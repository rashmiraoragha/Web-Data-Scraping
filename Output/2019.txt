Our results reveal the relationships between the western and native populations of Tibetan Terriers and support the hypothesis that Tibetan Terrier belongs to the group of ancient dog breeds of Asian origin  which are close to the ancestors of the modern dog that were involved in the early domestication process. Thus  we were able to reject the initial hypothesis that Tibetan Terriers belong to the group of terrier breeds. The existence of this native population of Tibetan Terriers at its original location represents an exceptional and valuable genetic resource. Tibetan Terrier (TT) is a medium-sized companion dog breed  which is present in many countries all over the world. The so-called western population of Tibetan Terriers originated from a small number of founder animals that were imported from the border region between Tibet and India (Central Himalaya) at the beginning of the twentieth century []. In western countries  two lineages were established during the history of the breed  the older Lamleh lineage  which can be traced back to the first two animals (Bunti and Rajah) that were acquired by Dr. Agnes Greig in 1922 and brought to England in 1930. In 1937  the Kennel Club of England recognized the Tibetan Terrier as an own breed  based on animals belonging to the Lamleh lineage. The second lineage of Tibetan Terriers i.e. Luneville was formed by mating Dusky  a stray dog  found by John Downey in Liverpool in 1953 (it was registered as a Tibetan Terrier and named Trojan Kynos) and the bitch Princess Aureus [] (see Additional file : Figure S1). Both lineages go back to a very limited number of founders from the native Tibetan Terrier (TTNA) population and represent the link between the western population of Tibetan Terriers and the original population in Tibet  which supports the genetic relationship between both populations. However  following recognition of the western population of Tibetan Terriers by kennel clubs in Europe  the United States  Australia and other countries  their population underwent a long and relative strict isolation from the original native population of Tibetan Terriers in Tibet. This isolation was broken only sporadically through a few imports of single animals  which refreshed temporarily the western population. Consequently  a very special situation was created for the western population of Tibetan Terriers  which is a pedigree-controlled population that exists in parallel to the original native population in Tibet. It is only very recently that a reproductive contact between both populations occurred through a limited number of imported dogs from Tibet to the western countries. The western population of Tibetan Terriers is registered at The International Cynological Organisation [Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI)  Breed standard N° 209  2017]. The original native population of Tibetan Terriers is still present in Tibet and represents the original gene pool from which only a few individuals contributed as founders to the western population of Tibetan Terriers. In addition  the native population of Tibetan Terriers contributed also to the formation of the gene pool of several other Tibetan dog breeds  i.e. Lhasa Apso  Shih Tzu  and Tibetan Spaniel  which are considered as ancient dog breeds. Thus  the native population of Tibetan Terriers can be assigned to a limited group of the early canine foundation stock []. During the last two decades  a number of studies used different types of genetic markers to assess the genetic variation  heterozygosity and phylogenetic relationships between dog breeds []. In addition to the analysis of autosomal genomic regions  some studies also focused on the Y chromosome [] and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) []. The first evidence on the genetic structure of dog populations and their phylogeny and on the genetic distances between breeds emerged from studies based on microsatellite markers (STR) [  ]  which separated several of the breeds with an ancient origin from the breeds with a modern European origin. The Tibetan Terrier breed was positioned into the group of ancient Asian breeds  close to the grey wolf. STR analysis can also be used to estimate population parameters and detect population events such as past bottlenecks []. With the availability of the complete canine genome sequence  a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified  which provided new opportunities for the genetic analysis of dog breeds []. Such analyses revealed the existence of long-range haplotypes across the entire canine genome and clarified the nature of the genetic diversity within and across breeds. An SNP-based analysis identified 51 regions in the dog genome that are associated with phenotypic variation of 57 traits []. An analysis of 509 dogs from 46 breeds revealed 44 genomic regions  which are associated with phenotypic traits that vary between breeds []. Recently  by investigating the genetic background of village dogs  Shannon et al. [] reported the existence of a Central Asian domestication origin and identified geographic isolation  migration  and hybridization as important factors that shape the genetic diversity of village dog populations []. A genome-wide haplotype sharing analysis uncovered the geographic patterns of development and the independent origins of common traits in dogs []. Results based on genome-wide SNP genotypes are supported by those from whole-genome sequencing  which has recently become a powerful approach for association studies [  ] and for the study of traits related to adaptation [  ] and dog domestication [  ]. With the accumulation of genomic data  evolutionary and functional analyses on a finer scale can be carried out. Analysis of copy number variations (CNV) has also been used to detect genomic regions in the dog genome that are responsible for breed-specific phenotypes []. The positioning of Tibetan Terriers within the terrier group of dogs  which was based on a superficial phenotypic judgement of some cynologists in the early period of the formation of the breed  is often questioned today []. Neither historical nor genetic data support this decision. According to Ostrander []  most of the terrier breeds fall within the “modern/hunting” cluster of dog breeds  which were all established from the same pool of ancestors in Europe in the nineteenth century. A few terrier breeds are found in the “mastiff” cluster  together with the Pomeranian and Labrador Retriever breeds. However  Tibetan Terriers cluster into the much older group of Asian and African dogs  along with the Pekingese breed []. Furthermore  some studies classify Tibetan Terriers into the group of ancient dog breeds []  which is also known as the basal lineages []. A recent genome-wide analysis of Korean dogs [] examined the genetic variation within Korean dog populations and their relationships with wolves and ancient and modern dog breeds. Among all the pairwise comparisons  the estimated F value was highest (0.35) in the comparison between Tibetan Terriers and the Korean wolf and thus revealed their distant genetic relatedness. The goal of our study was to provide an insight into the genomic structure and genetic history of Tibetan Terriers by using two unrelated and widely used types of genetic markers  high-density SNP microarray and microsatellite genotypes  to differentiate Tibetan Terrier lineages. In order to determine the genomic composition of the breed and its relationship to other breeds  we analysed the population structure of Tibetan Terriers and the potential admixture level between Tibetan Terriers (from both the western population of Tibetan Terriers and the native population in Tibet) and 33 other dog breeds  including the terrier and companion and toy dog groups  as well as the grey wolf  using publicly available datasets. For this study  we sampled buccal swabs from 64 Tibetan Terriers at dog shows or directly from breeders and owners: 24 western Tibetan Terriers (20 and 4 from the Lamleh and Luneville lineages  respectively)  22 native Tibetan Terriers  8 TT-F1 (native<U+2009>×<U+2009>Lamleh)  6 TT-BC2 (F1<U+2009>×<U+2009>Lamleh) and 4 TT-BC3 (TT-BC2<U+2009>×<U+2009>Lamleh). The native Tibetan Terriers samples were collected at 22 locations in Tibet. Identification of purebred animals was based on specific morphological criteria and/or pedigree. DNA from buccal swabs was extracted using the standard protocol for the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen  Germany). The quantity of DNA was estimated using NanoVue (GE Healthcare Life Sciences  USA). We performed genotyping using a microsatellite set and an Illumina 170 k CanineHD BeadChip. The data obtained from genotyping were merged with the publicly available SNP array data for 5406 dogs belonging to 163 breeds downloaded from the Dryad repository []. The number of dogs per breed ranged from 1 to 732 (see Additional file : Table S1). Quality control and merging of the SNP array data were done with the SNP and Variation Suite v8.7.0 (Golden Helix  Inc.  Bozeman  MT  ). First  we filtered the data obtained from the genotyping of 24 Tibetan Terriers by excluding the markers on the X chromosome (leaving 168 102 SNPs) and by removing the SNPs with a call rate lower than 95% and an Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P-value less than 0.00001 (leaving 156 708 SNPs. Then  less than 10% of missing calls per sample were allowed  and 18 out of 24 Tibetan Terrier samples passed the quality control. After merging this dataset with the publicly available data  143 170 SNPs that were common to both datasets  were available and distributed across all the autosomal chromosomes. The average marker density was one SNP every 15 404 kb. Based on publicly available data  we excluded the village dogs and mixed breed dogs  and finally selected 19 or less representative animals with the highest call rates for each breed. Tibetan Terriers were divided into five subpopulations (native  Lamleh  Luneville  F1 individuals between native and Lamleh Tibetan Terriers  and Tibetan Terriers that were extracted from the Dryad database []. To compare CanineHD BeadChip data with microsatellite data  we examined 18 microsatellite loci suggested by the International Society of Animal Genetics (ISAG): AHTK211  CXX279  REN169O18  INU055  REN54P11  INRA21  AHT121  FH2054  REN162C04  AHT137  REN169D01  AHTH260  AHTK253  INU005  AHTH171 and REN247M23  using the Canine Genotyping Panel 1.1 (Thermo Scientific  California) reagent kit. Genotyping was performed on the capillary Genetic Analyser ABI 3130xl. Microsatellite alleles were called using the GENEMAPPER v 4.0 software (ABI  Foster City  CA  USA) and manually checked. We used various methods to provide a fine-scale assessment of the genetic structure of Tibetan Terriers. First  we computed pairwise Nei genetic distances between individuals belonging to 161 dog breeds (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1793) and grey wolf individuals (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>14) using the ape R package []. A neighbor-joining tree was computed based on the distance matrix using the phyclust package for R []. Phylogenetic relationships between Tibetan Terriers and both dogs from 27 dog breeds (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>349) and grey wolf individuals (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>14) were analysed using the NeighborNet network based on Nei distances and the SplitsTree4 software []. We split Tibetan Terriers into two subpopulations  the native and western populations of Tibetan Terriers. To infer the patterns of splits and mixtures in the populations of Tibetan Terriers and a subset of 28 dog breeds and the grey wolf  we used the Treemix algorithm [] in which grey wolves (Gray_Wolf) were set as the rooting outgroup. First  we built a maximum likelihood tree of the populations with no migration events allowed. Then  we constructed a phylogenetic network for all selected populations  thereby increasing migration events sequentially up to 11 migrations. The residuals from the fit of the model to the data were visualized using the R script implemented in Treemix. To investigate the population structure inferred from SNP array and microsatellite genotyping data  we used the model-based clustering method STRUCTURE []. Visualisation of the results and estimation of the best K value according to Evanno [] were performed using the web-based tool CLUMPAK []. SNP array data were used to investigate the population structure of two datasets: (1) 366 dogs from 29 breeds and 14 grey wolves (by merging genotyped samples from this study and publicly available samples)  and (2) a subset that included Tibetan Terrier samples only. We pruned the CanineHD BeadChip data from the 143 170 SNPs by setting a window size of 100  a step size of 20 and a pairwise r threshold of 0.1  which left data for 22 175 SNPs. A model that assumes admixture and correlated allele frequencies was used for all STRUCTURE runs  with a burn-in of 10 iterations followed by 10 MCMC iterations. Runs were repeated 10 times for each K value  which ranged from 1 to 20 for the larger dataset (29 dog breeds and grey wolf) and from 1 to 6 for the subset of Tibetan Terrier samples. The STRUCTURE program was used to estimate the number of genetic populations/lineages in Tibetan Terriers based on allele frequencies of microsatellites with a burn-in of 10 iterations followed by 10 MCMC iterations. Runs were repeated 10 times for each K value ranging from 1 to 6. All Tibetan Terrier samples included in the SNP array analysis were present in the microsatellite dataset. However  the microsatellite dataset consisted of additional samples that were not genotyped on the SNP array. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) were identified for each individual separately using the SNP and Variation Suite v8.8.3 (Golden Helix  Inc.  Bozeman  MT  ). ROH were defined as runs of 25 or more homozygous SNPs that had a minimum run length of 500 kb and in which no heterozygous SNPs  and no more than five missing SNPs were allowed. Similar to other studies []  ROH were summarized in three length categories: short ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 Mb; medium ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 Mb; and long i.e. more than 5 Mb. Genomic inbreeding coefficients (F) were calculated as in [] and were defined as the percentage of the autosomal genome present in a ROH. The length of the autosomal genome was set to 2 392 715 236 bp. Based on CanineHD Illumina SNP chip data  we analysed the relationships between Tibetan Terriers and selected dog breeds by constructing a neighbour-joining tree from raw genetic distances. This analysis revealed several main characteristics of the population structure and showed that dogs from the same breed almost invariably built compact clusters. This reflects the fact that modern breeds mainly represent closed gene pools that have experienced major population bottlenecks during their formation. We detected relatively little structuring within the internal branches that distinguish the breeds. This is consistent with the suggestion that all modern dog breeds arose from a common ancestral population during a relatively short period  and that only a small proportion of the genetic variation divides dog breeds into subgroups. Tibetan Terriers formed two clusters: cluster (1) includes the native population and its F1 cross with western Tibetan Terriers  which are grouped together with the more ancient dog breeds such as Afghan Hound  Samoyed  Sloughi and Siberian Husky  and cluster (2) includes the western lineages (Lamleh and Luneville)  which are part of the Tibetan Companion Dog cluster  including Tibetan Spaniel  Pekingese  Shih Tzu  and Lhasa Apso  and showed some relatedness with the group of Terrier breeds. This suggests that some sporadic contacts may have occurred between the two western lineages of Tibetan Terriers and some Terrier breeds during the last century. The internal branches leading to the populations of Boxer and grey wolf are longer than those leading to other breeds. The long Boxer branch may be explained by the fact that a large proportion of the SNPs on the Canine HD array was selected by comparing Boxers with other breeds  which implies that the dataset is enriched for SNPs that allow the differentiation of Boxers from other breeds. The longer grey wolf branch probably reflects their more distant relatedness to dogs (Fig. ). Relationship of Tibetan Terriers with other dog breeds. Neighbor-joining tree based on SNP chip data for 161 dog breeds revealing a compact cluster of ancient dog breeds including native Tibetan Terrier and F1 crosses with its western lineages. The western lineages are part of the Tibetan Companion Dog cluster Some breeds show a clear tendency to build separate clusters  such as Retrievers  Spaniels  Setters  and Terriers. However  the length of the internal branches leading to these clusters represents only a small portion of the average total length of the branches in these clusters  which indicates that major bottlenecks occurred during their formation  although in general the detailed analysis of these data supports a common historical origin of the related breeds. The tree is consistent with previous studies and supports the accuracy and reliability of the genotypes obtained by using HD micro array analysis. Although the long Boxer branch most likely reflects the SNP ascertainment bias of the array  this tree indicates a high level of polymorphism  both within and between breeds. This supports the expectation that the SNP ascertainment bias does not hinder the detection of genetic variation within and between breeds. To provide additional insight into the origin and evolutionary history of Tibetan dog breeds  we constructed a NeighborNet network based on Nei’s genetic distances (Fig. ). Breeds belonging to the same group of FCI breed (Terriers) clustered together. All Tibetan Terrier populations were also grouped together and the native population of Tibetan Terriers branched closer to the grey wolf than any other breed. The Tibetan Spaniel  Pekingese  Shih Tzu  and Lhasa Apso branches were the populations of native and western Tibetan Terriers  while Japanese Chin was on its own branch. Sets of parallel edges on the NeighborNet network observed between the population of native Tibetan Terriers and other Tibetan Toy breeds (Tibetan Spaniel  Pekingese  Shih Tzu  and Lhasa Apso) indicate hybridization events between them. The other Terrier breeds formed a separate group on the other side of the network. NeighborNet network relating 27 dog breeds and Grey Wolf. NeighborNet network  based on Nei’s genetic distances  reveals the relationships between 27 dog breeds and Grey Wolf. Reticulations on the graph indicate past hybridization events between populations. Breed names are abbreviated as follows: Airedale Terrier (AIR)  American Pit Bull Terrier (APB)  American Staffordshire Terrier (AST)  Bedlington Terrier (BET)  Border Terrier (BORT)  Boston Terrier (BOST)  Bull Terrier (BullT)  Cairn Terrier (CT)  Fox Terrier Wire (FTD)  Jack Russell Terrier (JRT)  Japanese Chin (Chin)  Kerry Blue Terrier (KBT)  Lhasa Apso (LHAP)  Norfolk Terrier (NFT)  Norwich Terrier (NWT)  Pekingese (PEKE)  Rat Terrier (RATT)  Scottish Terrier (SCT)  Shih Tzu (SHI)  Silky Terrier (SILT)  Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (SCWT)  Staffordshire Bull Terrier (SBT)  Tibetan Spaniel (TIBS)  Native Tibetan Terrier (TTNA)  Tibetan Terrier (TT)  Toy Fox Terrier (TFT)  West Highland White Terrier (WHWT)  Yorkshire Terrier (YOR) Using the Treemix software  we modelled both population splits and gene flow between a subset of 29 dog breeds and the grey wolf. As explained in “” section  Tibetan Terriers were divided into five subgroups: native Tibetan Terriers  the two western lineages Lamleh and Luneville of Tibetan Terriers  F1 individuals between the western lineages and native population  and Tibetan Terrier samples that were extracted from the Dryad database (datadryad.org) []. Our results support the hypothesis that the native Tibetan Terriers are closer to the grey wolf than to any other dog breed analysed here. We detected significant gene flow from the native population of Tibetan Terriers to both Lamleh and Luneville lineages  the F1 individuals and to the Tibetan Terriers from the publicly available genotypes in the Dryad database [] (Fig. ). We also detected some migration of genes from the Terrier’s ancestor but only to the breeds positioned at the beginning of the European lineage branch. In addition  we observed a few less significant migration events to the Lamleh lineage only  which might be due to breeders assuming that the Tibetan Terrier belongs to the Terrier group and thus to a few sporadic crossings between Tibetan Terriers and Terriers during the last century. In addition  the Lamleh and Luneville lineages  the F1 individuals  and the Tibetan Terriers retrieved from Dryad database clustered together with other Tibetan dog breeds  rather than with Terrier breeds. Migrations within the Asian toy dog and Terrier breeds. Maximum likelihood tree showing the most important migrations within the Asian toy dog- (Tibetan Terrier  Japanese Chin  Shih Tzu  Lhasa Apso  Pekingese  and Tibetan Spaniel) and Terrier breeds The STRUCTURE plots for K values from 2 to 20 are in Fig. . In each plot  each cluster is indicated by a different colour and each individual is shown as a vertical bar divided into at most K coloured segments with heights being proportional to genotype memberships. Western Tibetan Terriers show more uniformity than native Tibetan Terriers  which display other colours that represent genetic elements  also present in other populations (Shih Tzu  Grey Wolf  Tibetan Spaniel  Japanese Chin  western population of Tibetan Terriers  Pekingese and some Terriers). Genetic structure of Terriers and companion dogs. Bayesian clustering on a complete CanineHD BeadChip dataset of 29 dog breed populations and Grey Wolf (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>366) performed with STRUCTURE and visualized using the CLUMPAK software In order to compare the results of the analysis of population structure of Tibetan Terriers  obtained with different types of markers  we performed a STRUCTURE analysis based on microsatellite (Fig. a) and SNP chip data (Fig. b). This analysis showed that  within the population of Tibetan Terriers  individuals are genetically very similar. For the native population of Tibetan Terriers  there was a 95% contribution of one genetic cluster and a 5% contribution of the other genetic cluster  whereas the opposite was observed for the Tibetan Terrier Luneville lineage. The TT-F1 cross showed contributions between 20 and 80% of each subpopulation  TT-BC2 showed a 90% contribution of the second subpopulation  and TT-BC3 had almost 100% of the genotype that prevails in the western subpopulation. STRUCTURE analysis of Tibetan Terrier subpopulations. STRUCTURE analysis of microsatellite () and SNP chip data () from different Tibetan Terrier subpopulations. Individuals were assigned to clusters at different K values. Breed abbreviations: TTLA: Tibetan Terrier  Lamleh lineage; TTLU: Tibetan Terrier  Luneville lineage; TTNA: Tibetan Terrier  native population; TT-F1. TT-BC2  TT-BC3: F1 and two back cross generations from the crossing of TTNA with the western TT The best K according to Evanno [] was used to determine the most likely value of K i.e. 3. Therefore  although our populations of Tibetan Terriers differ  they actually consist of three genetic clusters: the native Tibetan and western cluster  which shows some within-cluster structure. The genetic basis of the native population of Tibetan Terriers is wider than that of the western population of Tibetan Terriers  however  only the superficial evaluation of the phenotype does not clearly support this fact. The existence of a broader genetic pool in the native population of Tibetan Terriers is highly relevant for possible prevention measures against increases in homozygosity and risk for genetic diseases. STRUCTURE analysis of the six Tibetan Terrier subpopulations based on microsatellite data and SNP chip data resulted in similar substructures in all subpopulations. Due to the extreme bottleneck that led to the western population of Tibetan Terriers  it can be clearly differentiated from the native population of Tibetan Terriers. Both ancestral gene pools are present in the F1  F2 and F3 generations and  at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3  substructuring in the native population becomes apparent. Estimated inbreeding coefficients based on ROH analysis (F) were very low for the native population of Tibetan Terriers compared to those of several other breeds (Fig. ). Compared to the western population of Tibetan Terriers  the native population is characterized by a small number of long ROH and by a low proportion of the genome covered by ROH i.e. 0.07 instead of 0.24 in the western population. Assessment of the distribution of ROH lengths among populations gives an indication of the timing of diversity loss  and in our study  we found a larger fraction of the genome covered by long ROH in the western population of Tibetan Terriers  which indicates recent inbreeding. Thus  based on this ROH analysis  we show that the native population of Tibetan Terriers belongs to the dog populations with the lowest level of inbreeding  which increases its value as genetic resource. Proportion of the autosomal genome in ROH. Proportion of the autosomal genome in ROH for 11 dog populations; considering all ROH (first panel) and ROH summarized in three length categories: short<U+2009>=<U+2009>between 0.5 and 2.5 Mb; medium<U+2009>=<U+2009>between 2.5 and 5.0 Mb; and long<U+2009>=<U+2009>more than 5 Mb Tibetan Terrier is one of the very few dog breeds  for which the native ancestral population is available in Tibet that represents the original gene pool from which originates the modern western population of Tibetan Terriers. The western population experienced a major bottleneck at the beginning of its formation  which resulted in a relatively rapid increase in inbreeding and in several hereditary health problems. Moreover  when the western population of Tibetan Terriers was established as a breed  based on its phenotypic features  it was placed within the group of Terriers. According to population genetics studies  most terriers are included in the “modern/hunting” cluster of dog breeds that were developed from the same pool of ancestors in Europe in the nineteenth century  whereas the Tibetan Terrier belongs to the older group of Asian and African dogs  along with the Pekingese breed []. Several studies classified the Tibetan Terrier as an ancient breed due to its high level of divergence compared to that of other dog breeds. It is believed that the Tibetan Terrier breed originated about 500 years ago and that it was highly associated with the original domestication of dogs []. Thus  Tibetan Terrier can be considered as one of the basal lineage breeds of domestic dogs and as a live prototype of ancestral dogs. The recent study by []  which focuses on the origin  diversity and population structure of Korean dogs  includes Tibetan Terriers and supports the genetic relatedness between the Korean wolf and Tibetan Terrier. This study reports a neighbour-joining tree with the coyote at the root of the tree and shows that Tibetan Terrier belongs to the same branch as Afghan Hound  Basenji  Lhasa Apso  and Shi Tzu  which supports the findings of []. Our results clearly show migratory events between the native and western populations of Tibetan Terriers. There are also visible exchanges of genetic material from Terrier ancestors to the western population of Tibetan Terriers  which impacted only the beginning of the European Tibetan Terrier branch. This might be because  in the past  the name “Terrier” was mistakenly used  which led the breeders of Tibetan Terriers to cross Tibetan Terriers with some other Terrier ancestors. In addition  the fact that Tibetan Terriers are placed closer to other Tibetan dog breeds than to other Terriers confirms that the dog today known as Tibetan Terrier  is not a terrier at all. Our results demonstrate that the Tibetan Terrier and its lineages build a cluster  which is close to other ancient breeds of Asian origin and the grey wolf. This confirms the ancient character of the Tibetan Terrier and its positioning within the cluster of ancient breeds  i.e. close to the domestication event. Today’s population of Tibetan Terriers is clearly split into two populations: the native and western populations of Tibetan Terriers. The native populations of Tibetan Terriers represents the main gene resource for the western population of Tibetan Terriers  which has been separated from the original population for almost 100 years as a consequence of a major bottleneck and genetic drift. Although less obvious  a contribution of Terriers to the western population Tibetan Terriers can be assumed. According to the STRUCTURE analysis  Tibetan Terrier clearly belongs to the Asian ancient cluster  which also contains a grey wolf gene pool. The more K increases  the clearer is the influence of Terriers on the western population of Tibetan Terriers. The basic structure of the Tibetan Terrier populations is supported by both SNP and STR data. The intermediate position of the F1 individuals and the position of two back cross generations closer to the western lineages clearly show the effect of genetic drift in the Lamleh Tibetan Terrier lineage and that some minor alleles from the native population of Tibetan Terriers are represented in the Lamleh Tibetan Terrier lineage. The larger effective size of the native population of Tibetan Terriers and the breeding practices supporting high levels of admixture resulted in a relatively low inbreeding level compared to the western population of Tibetan Terriers  which has a much higher inbreeding level due to its small gene pool and the western breeding practices. These characteristics are also reflected by the proportion of the genome covered by ROH  i.e. the fraction of the genome containing homozygous regions is much smaller for the native population of Tibetan Terriers than for the western lineages. The genetic diversity of the native population of Tibetan Terriers compared to its western derivatives is higher  which is indicated by the very low proportion of the genome in ROH for the native population of Tibetan Terriers (Fig. ). Our findings show that the level of genetic diversity differs between the original native population of Tibetan Terriers and its western derivatives. The original population represents a natural gene pool resource  which could be used to reduce the level of inbreeding in the western population of Tibetan Terriers and represents an important genetic resource to preserve the original genetic diversity and to improve that of the western population of Tibetan Terriers. Our results reveal the considerable difference in genetic diversity between the original native population of Tibetan Terrier and its western population. The genetic pool of the western population of Tibetan Terriers represents only a tiny part of that of the original population. Because of its isolation from the original population and the genetic drift operating in its population with a small effective size  it can be clearly separated from the original population of Tibetan Terriers. This original population of Tibetan Terriers with its very low proportion of the genome included in long runs of homozygosity represents a unique example of existing contemporary ancestral and modern western populations  the latter being managed according to cynological practices during the last century. The native population of Tibetan Terriers represents also a backup population for the western population of Tibetan Terriers and can be used to significantly reduce the level of inbreeding of the latter. Thus  it is an important genetic resource for preserving the original gene pool and for improving the genetic diversity of the western population of Tibetan Terriers.

Furthermore  the results obtained from the two real datasets confirmed the variability in the inbreeding depression loads in both breeds and suggested a negative correlation of the inbreeding loads with the additive genetic effects in the Pirenaica breed. Inbreeding is caused by mating between related individuals and is associated with changes in the mean and variance of quantitative traits []. Inbreeding depression  which results in a reduction in the phenotypic yield of fitness-related traits [  ]  has been widely observed in animals  plants  and humans [  ] and is the most common consequence of inbreeding. The genetic basis of inbreeding depression stems from the high degree of homozygosity in inbred individuals  which reveals the presence of recessive alleles or losses in the advantage of over-dominance at heterozygous loci [  ]. Genetic variation within a population implies that inbreeding depression can vary depending on the genotype of the individuals whose alleles produce identity-by-descent (IBD) states in their progeny. Variability in inbreeding depression has been confirmed within ancestral lineages of Drosophila [] and in sire families in dairy [] and beef cattle []. Therefore  it is possible to define a specific hidden individual inbreeding depression load [] (hereafter referred to as inbreeding load)  which can be considered a hereditary trait [  ] with a phenotype that is only expressed when inbreeding occurs in its offspring. Lacy et al. [] proposed a founder decomposition of inbreeding  which assigns a different inbreeding depression to each founder of the population; yet  the common ancestors of inbred individuals are not restricted to the founding generation. Caballero and Toro [] and García-Cortés et al. [] proposed a Mendelian decomposition of the inbreeding coefficient that assigns partial inbreeding coefficients to the founders and to the Mendelian sampling of the non-founders. This decomposition was the basis for the development of a mixed-model approach that allows prediction of individual inbreeding loads []. However  this model assumes that the founding and non-founding effects on inbreeding depression are distributed independently  and cannot be used to predict the inbreeding load of individuals that do not have inbred progeny. In this study  we propose an alternative parameterization that can predict the inbreeding load for each individual in the pedigree  and can provide estimates of the covariance between the inbreeding loads and the additive genetic effects for the trait of interest. We tested the procedure with a simulation study and two large datasets of records on weaning weight in the Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega beef cattle breeds. The recessive alleles that appear in homozygosity caused by IBD from a common ancestor in the paternal and maternal lineages can cause inbreeding depression. Each ancestor might have different sets of recessive alleles; thus  the genotype of each individual determines an inbreeding load that can be interpreted as the effects on the trait performance of its inbred descendants. Inbreeding load can be considered a heritable trait [  ] and  from the perspective of the ancestors  it acts additively because the alternative alleles never interact in their inbred progeny. Thus  the polygenic inbreeding load () for the th individual can be decomposed [] as follows: where  and  are the inbreeding loads for its sire and dam  respectively  and  is its Mendelian sampling. Therefore  it follows that the distribution of the inbreeding loads is multivariate Gaussian as: where  is the numerator relationship matrix []  and  is the additive genetic variance of the inbreeding loads. Traditionally  inbreeding is split into several units that are attributed to founding individuals [] by tracing back the origin of the alleles that might be IBD in inbred individuals. Alternatively  inbreeding can be decomposed into the sources of the co-ancestry between the parents of each individual [  ]  which might include the founders of the population and the Mendelian sampling of the non-founders. The difference between the two approaches is illustrated by a simple pedigree of five individuals (Fig. ). Individual 5 has an inbreeding of 0.375. The founder decomposition splits it between two founders  and attributes 0.25 and 0.125 to individuals 1 and 2  respectively. In contrast  the Mendelian decomposition attributes 0.1875 and 0.0625 to founders 1 and 2  respectively  and 0.125 to the Mendelian sampling of non-founder 3. Note that  under the founder decomposition  the genealogical inbreeding is the sum of the partial coefficients from the founders  while under the Mendelian decomposition it is the sum of the partial coefficients from the founders and from the Mendelian sampling of the non-founders. Founder and Mendelian decomposition of the inbreeding. Partial inbreeding coefficients for the fifth individual with the Founder and Mendelian decompositions of inbreeding Based on the Mendelian decomposition of inbreeding  Casellas [] proposed a linear model that explains the phenotypic data () with two vectors of random effects: the additive genetic ()  and one extra effect () that is attributed to the inbreeding depression generated by the inbreeding loads of their ancestors (the founders and the Mendelian sampling of the non-founders). Thus  where  is the general mean   is the vector of the residuals   is a vector of ones with the same length of    is the incidence matrix and  is the matrix that contains the partial inbreeding coefficients from the Mendelian decomposition and connects the phenotypic data of inbred individuals and the inbreeding loads of their common ancestors from the paternal and maternal lineages. Furthermore   and   where  is the numerator relationship matrix and  and  are their associated variance components. Casellas [] proposed that the distribution of  is  with  being the variance component of the inbreeding loads. However  this assumption is incorrect because the variance that is attributed to the inbreeding loads of the founders must be larger than the variance that is attributed to the Mendelian sampling of the non-founders. Thus  the appropriate distribution of  is   where  is a diagonal matrix with a value 1 for the elements corresponding to founder individuals  and a value of  for the elements corresponding to the non-founder individuals [].  and  are the genealogical inbreeding coefficient of the sire and dam of the individual  respectively. In this study  we reparametrize the model in terms of individual inbreeding loads () that  given their additive nature  can be represented as follows: where  is a matrix with a diagonal of 0 s and 0.5 in the elements that link an individual with its sire and dam  such that it establishes a recurrent relationship between the inbreeding loads of each individual with their parents  as in Eq. (). As a result   and Model (2) can be rewritten as follows: where  and  As a result  a multiple trait model that includes the genetic covariance between additive effects and inbreeding loads can then be defined as: where  and  is the covariance between additive effects and inbreeding loads. Given the pedigree of five individuals (Fig. )  we assume that individuals 3  4  and 5 have phenotypes 113  87  and 96  respectively. Applying the method proposed by García-Cortés et al. [] a partial inbreeding coefficient of 0.250 is obtained for the animal 4 generated by individual 1  and three partial inbreeding coefficients (0.1875  0.0625  and 0.125) for animal 5  generated by individuals 1  2  and 3  respectively. Therefore  the mixed-model equations for the implementation of the model defined by Eq. () requires the following vector and matrices: In addition  the numerator relationship matrix () and its inverse () are as follows: and which leads to the following mixed-model equations: where      are the elements of the inverse () of the covariance matrix between the additive and the inbreeding load effects. Assuming       and   then and the equations become the following:  with solutions: A pedigree of 30 000 individuals arranged in six discrete generations of 5000 individuals (2500 sires and 2500 dams) was simulated. Each generation was obtained from the random mating of 20 sires and 500 dams that were chosen randomly from the previous generation. Thus  neither selection nor purging were simulated. Once the pedigree was obtained  the direct additive genetic effects () and the inbreeding loads () were simulated based on the multivariate distribution from Eq. (). The vector of the phenotypic records () was generated by Eq. (). The partial inbreeding coefficients required for the  matrix were derived from the procedure of García-Cortés et al. []. Two cases (i) and (ii) were simulated based on the following parameters: <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 000  <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>500  r(  )<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.5 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  r(  )<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  The simulated variances of inbreeding loads  were greater than the additive variances  as they reflect the inbreeding depression achieved by a completely inbred (100%) descendent. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the inbreeding depression loads depends on the magnitude of the partial inbreeding coefficients. Therefore  in the first simulation case (i)  the variance of inbreeding load for a partial inbreeding coefficient of 0.10 will be equal to the additive variance (100)  whereas in the second (ii)  it will be a tenth part (10). The simulated datasets were analyzed under Model (3). We used a Bayesian approach which included uniform priors for the mean () and for the variance components () and   and a multivariate Gaussian distribution for  and . The analysis was implemented through a Gibbs Sampler [] with two chains of 550 000 iterations  after discarding the first 50 000 iterations. The dataset included 35 126 (Pirenaica) and 75 194 (Rubia Gallega) records on live weights (one per individual) between 170 and 250 days of age  which were provided by the two breeding associations and had been recorded since 1989 and 1991  respectively  until 2018. The average (±<U+2009>standard deviation) weights in the Pirenaica and the Rubia Gallega breeds were 258.4 kg (±<U+2009>58.0 kg) and 281.4 kg (±<U+2009>46.7 kg)  respectively. The genealogical information dated back to 1920 (Pirenaica) and 1955 (Rubia Gallega)  and comprised 308 836 and 384 434 individual-sire-dam records  respectively. The average depth of the pedigree of the individuals for which there was phenotypic information was 5.9 and 3.9 generations for the Pirenaica and the Rubia Gallega breeds  respectively. In the Pirenaica breed  248 471 (80.5%) individuals were inbred and had an average inbreeding (±<U+2009>standard deviation) coefficient of 0.030 (±<U+2009>0.056). In the Rubia Gallega breed  inbreeding affected 176 048 (45.8%) individuals  and the average inbreeding coefficient (±<U+2009>standard deviation) was 0.020 (±<U+2009>0.048). The evolutions of the average inbreeding and the percentage of inbred individuals from 1975 to 2017 are shown in Additional file : Figures S1 and Additional file : Figure S2 for Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega  respectively. The partial inbreeding coefficients from the Mendelian decomposition of inbreeding were derived from the procedure of García-Cortés et al. []  which generated 16 099 374 and 5 080 457 coefficients from 8721 and 3601 ancestors in the Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds  respectively. The average partial inbreeding coefficients (±<U+2009>standard deviation) were 5.7<U+2009> 10 (±<U+2009>4.2<U+2009><U+2009>10) in the Pirenaica and 1.5<U+2009><U+2009>10 (±<U+2009>6.9<U+2009><U+2009>10) in the Rubia Gallega breed. Most of the partial inbreeding coefficients were very low (Table ); 99.3 and 93.0%  and 97.4 and 81.2% were lower than 0.01 and 0.001 in the Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds  respectively. Once the partial inbreeding coefficients from the Mendelian decomposition of inbreeding were available  the phenotypic data were analyzed with the following model: where  is the vector of age at recording   is the vector of systematic effects  which included sex and age of the dam (15 levels)   is the vector of herd-year-season effects (Pirenaica  6503 levels and Rubia Gallega  5251 levels)  and     and  are the vectors of direct genetic  inbreeding load  and residual effects  respectively. Furthermore   is the covariate with age at recording  and       and  are the appropriate incidence matrices. Under a hierarchical Bayesian analysis  it was assumed that prior distributions for the permanent environmental  additive  and inbreeding load effects followed a multivariate Gaussian distribution: where  is the variance of the permanent environmental effects and as in Model (4). The prior distribution for systematic effects were uniform between -<U+2009>M and M  being M a very large value. The prior distributions for  was an inverted Chi-square  distribution with parameters  and   and the prior distribution for  were inverted Chi-square and inverted Wishart  distribution with: and   that reduces to a uniform distribution. The Gibbs sampler [] was implemented with two chains of 550 000 iterations  after discarding the first 50 000 iterations. Convergence was confirmed by visual inspection of the chains (see Additional file : Figures S3 and Additional file : Figure S4) and by the use of the CODA package in the R software []. The posterior distributions of      and  obtained from the simulation study are shown in Fig. . The variance components used in the simulation were within the posterior mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>2 times the posterior standard deviation. Figure  shows the plots of the simulated direct genetic and inbreeding load effects and their predictions (posterior mean estimates) for sires and for individuals without progeny. In addition  the correlations between the simulated and predicted effects for sires and individuals without progeny are shown. The correlations between the direct genetic effects and their predictions ranged from 0.76 (individuals without progeny in case (i)) to 0.98 (sires in case (ii))  and were always higher than their counterparts for the inbreeding loads. Nevertheless  the correlations between simulated and predicted inbreeding loads were always positive  and ranged from 0.27 (individuals without progeny in case (ii)) to 0.82 (sires in case (i)).

The posterior mean estimates of the additive genetic variance and inbreeding load variance components were equal to 695.0 kg and 29 966.8 kg in Pirenaica  and 439.8 kg and 28 222.4 kg in Rubia Gallega  respectively. The posterior mean estimates of the genetic correlation between additive genetic and inbreeding load effects were -<U+2009>0.43 in Pirenaica and -<U+2009>0.04 in Rubia Gallega. The posterior mean estimates of the permanent environmental and residual variances were 1035.2 kg and 483.1 kg in Pirenaica  and 320.0 kg and 1018.2 kg in Rubia Gallega. Figure  presents  for each breed  a bivariate plot of the predictions (posterior mean estimates) of the direct additive and inbreeding load effects and a histogram that represents the distribution of the predicted inbreeding loads. In the Pirenaica breed  the bivariate plot indicated a clear negative relationship between direct genetic and inbreeding load effects  which was not apparent in the Rubia Gallega breed. The average (and standard deviation) of the predicted inbreeding loads were -69.3 (58.6) kg and -<U+2009>32.3 (41.7) kg in Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds  respectively  and ranged from -<U+2009>369.1 to 234.7 in Pirenaica and from -<U+2009>374.1 to 266.1 in Rubia Gallega. The proportion of individuals in the Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds that had a positive predicted inbreeding load was equal to 10.5% and 22.5%  respectively. Relationship between predicted additive and inbreeding load effects and distribution of inbreeding load effects for weaning weight in Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega. Predictions of the additive (x axis) and inbreeding load (y axis) effects for weaning weight in Pirenaica () and Rubia Gallega () and histograms of predictions of inbreeding load effects for weaning weight in Pirenaica () and Rubia Gallega () Inbreeding load and inbreeding depression are heterogeneous among populations [] or families [  ]  as inbreeding depression is affected by the variants of recessive alleles in each population  or even in each ancestor that generates inbreeding. Variability in inbreeding depression has been confirmed in several livestock populations [     ] with the approach proposed by Lacy et al. []  which is consistent with the results of previous studies [  ] that revealed heterogeneity in the contribution of genomic regions to inbreeding depression in several traits and species. Management of inbreeding to prevent the undesirable consequences is an important aspect of conservation genetics [] and in livestock and plant breeding programs [  ]. Purging is a natural process of selection against recessive alleles that are expressed in the homozygous state []. Purging during past generations can be inferred in pedigreed populations [  ]  and evidence of purging has been detected in natural [  ] and livestock [  ] populations. Genetic variability of the inbreeding loads among individuals within a population can be taken into account in ‘artificial’ purging strategies  to avoid the use of those individuals with poor inbreeding loads for reproductive purposes. However  it requires prediction of the inbreeding loads of young individuals without inbred progeny. The approach proposed by Lacy et al. [] is useful for describing the heterogeneity of inbreeding depression among founders  yet in most livestock populations  the founders live several generations before the current candidates for selection and  therefore  the prediction of the inbreeding loads based on Lacy’s approach is not useful for practical ‘artificial’ purging strategies. Casellas [] proposed an approach that uses the Mendelian decomposition of inbreeding and provides prediction of the inbreeding loads from both founders and the Mendelian sampling of the non-founders. However  it can only provide prediction of the inbreeding loads of the individuals that contribute to the inbreeding of individuals with known phenotypes. Moreover  its estimates of the variance of the inbreeding loads are biased  since it ignores the reduction in variance due to the Mendelian segregation of the progeny. Although the approach proposed by Casellas [] was the basis of the approach proposed in our study  rather than using directly the partial inbreeding coefficients derived from García-Cortes et al. []  the coefficients were transformed by the I–P recursive transformation in order to predict the total individual inbreeding load (). The parametrization is crucial because it allows the assumption that individual inbreeding loads follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and permits the use of the numerator relationship matrix () to predict the inbreeding loads of individuals that have yet to contribute to inbreeding but have relatives that have done so. The approach is illustrated with the results obtained from a simulation study  which used the same model of analysis to generate the simulated datasets. In spite of the limited amount of data  the posterior distribution of the variance components did not differ significantly from the simulated ones (Fig. )  which suggests that there is enough information to recover the variance of inbreeding loads and their covariance with the direct additive effects. The most outstanding result of the simulation study is that it demonstrates the ability of prediction of the inbreeding loads of individuals without progeny  since the correlations between the predicted and simulated inbreeding loads were 0.27 and 0.48 in the first (i) and second (ii) case of simulation  respectively (Fig. ). The higher correlation in the second case was caused by the larger  used in the simulation. The correlations obtained from the individuals without progeny were lower than those for the sires  which had many inbred progeny  and they were also lower than the correlations between simulated and predicted additive effects. Nonetheless  these results might provide a basis for the development of “artificial” purging strategies in order to avoid the undesirable consequences of inbreeding depression. One approach might be to develop a selection index by weighting the breeding values and inbreeding loads in an appropriate way. Implementation of our model involved the construction of the mixed-model equations  which followed the same rationale as that of the maternal animal model []. The model attributes two genetic effects to each individual; one  i.e.  that it is expressed directly in the individual phenotype  and another  i.e.  that it is expressed only in the phenotype of its inbred descendants. In spite of the complexity of the model  the results obtained from the simulation study (Fig. ) demonstrated its ability to recover the simulated parameters from the genealogical and phenotypic information. Computationally  the additional complexities beyond the standard mixed-model are the calculation of the partial inbreeding coefficients from the Mendelian decomposition of inbreeding and the calculation and storage of the  block. First  the tabular method that was implemented for the inbreeding decomposition described in [] involves the construction of a square matrix with the dimension of the pedigree. Thus  for computational feasibility  the partial inbreeding coefficients of each individual were calculated sequentially from a reduced pedigree that only included its ancestors. Second  the  matrix is more dense than is the  block and it requires more memory storage and computational time. Nevertheless  the contributions of the partial inbreeding coefficients to the  matrix were squared and  thus  the very small partial inbreeding coefficients generated almost null values  which could be discarded. The posterior distributions of the inbreeding load variances for weights at 210 days in the Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds indicated high variability among them  which is consistent with the variability of inbreeding depression among sire families reported by Carolino and Gama []. The posterior mean estimates were much larger (29 966.8 and 28 222.4 in Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds  respectively) than those of the other variance components in the model  which was confirmed by the broad range of the prediction of the inbreeding loads. However  it should be noted that the model provides estimates of the inbreeding loads that must be understood as the inbreeding depression achieved by a fully inbred (100%) descendent. Logically  the predictions are not realistic and have to be rescaled. Thus  the expected inbreeding depression from an ancestor that generates a partial inbreeding coefficient of 0.10 and has a predicted inbreeding load of -<U+2009>100 kg is -<U+2009>10 kg. The analysis of the beef cattle datasets indicated that  for most of the individuals  the prediction of their inbreeding load was negative  which is consistent with several studies that have analyzed the inbreeding depression in body weights of beef cattle [    ]. However  a significant proportion of the individuals (10.52% in Pirenaica  and 22.54% in Rubia Gallega) had a positive prediction of their inbreeding loads. In spite of the prediction error variance of the inbreeding loads  these figures may indicate that a relevant proportion of the individuals might have had an incremental effect on the trait of interest. Therefore  the potential inbreeding caused by mating between the descendants might not need to be avoided or could even be favored  at least for the analyzed trait. It should be noted that with a similar posterior mean estimate of the variance component (29 966.8 and 28 222.4)  the prediction of the inbreeding load effects was more variable in the Pirenaica (SD: 58.6 kg) than in the Rubia Gallega (SD: 41.7) breed. This was due to the different amounts of pedigree information available for the estimation of the inbreeding loads (5.9 vs. 3.9 generations in Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds  respectively). A deeper pedigree generates more partial inbreeding coefficients (Table ) and provides more reliable information for the prediction of the inbreeding loads  which is reflected in larger variances for the predictors. The additive nature of the inbreeding loads implies that it can be genetically correlated with other traits such as the direct additive effect on the analyzed traits. The mean posterior estimate of the genetic correlation between the inbreeding loads and the direct additive effect in the Pirenaica breed was clearly negative (-<U+2009>0.43) and the posterior probability that it was negative was higher than 0.99. In contrast  the estimate of the genetic correlation in the Rubia Gallega breed was near zero. To our knowledge  to date there are no published studies that provide estimates of the correlations between additive genetic and inbreeding load effects in livestock breeds  although Carolino and Gama [] did not find a significant correlation between the breeding values of the sires and the inbreeding depression associated with them. The only study available which provided an estimate of the genetic correlation []  although retracted  suggested a very small  negative genetic correlation []. A possible explanation of this negative correlation is that older individuals may have a smaller additive genetic effect due to selection and a higher inbreeding load as they are more exposed to purging than recent ancestors. This hypothesis may also explain the differences in the estimates of the genetic correlation between the Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega breeds  since the depth of the pedigree in the Pirenaica was larger  and  therefore  older individuals with more opportunities of purging were included. Regardless of its cause  if the negative correlation is confirmed  it will mean that individuals with high breeding values tend to cause worse inbreeding depression if their descendants are inbred. Finally  it is worth noting that the assumed model uses a prior distribution of the inbreeding loads centered at zero. Further research is necessary to define alternative prior distributions that allow the mean of the inbreeding loads to differ from zero. Our study proposes a mixed-model approach that includes individual inbreeding depression loads  direct additive effects and the covariance between them. The approach was applied to simulated data and two datasets with records on weaning weight from beef cattle breeds (Pirenaica and Rubia Gallega) in Spain. The results demonstrated the ability of the model to recover the simulated parameters and to provide prediction of the individual inbreeding loads of candidates for selection without inbred progeny.

Although low-density assays work well in the context of genomic prediction  they are less useful for detecting and mapping causal variants and the effects of rare variants are not captured. The objective of this project was to maximize the accuracies of genotype imputation from medium- and low-density assays to the marker set obtained by combining two high-density research assays (~<U+2009>850 000 SNPs)  the Illumina BovineHD and the GGP-F250 assays  which contains a large proportion of rare and potentially functional variants and for which the assay design is described here. This 850 K SNP set is useful for both imputation to sequence-level genotypes and direct downstream analysis.ResultsWe found that a large multi-breed composite imputation reference panel that includes 36 131 samples with either BovineHD and/or GGP-F250 genotypes significantly increased imputation accuracy compared with a within-breed reference panel  particularly at variants with low minor allele frequencies. Individual animal imputation accuracies were maximized when more genetically similar animals were represented in the composite reference panel  particularly with complete 850 K genotypes. The addition of rare variants from the GGP-F250 assay to our composite reference panel significantly increased the imputation accuracy of rare variants that are exclusively present on the BovineHD assay. In addition  we show that an assay marker density of 50 K SNPs balances cost and accuracy for imputation to 850 K.ConclusionsUsing high-density genotypes on all available individuals in a multi-breed reference panel maximized imputation accuracy for tested cattle populations. Admixed animals or those from breeds with a limited representation in the composite reference panel were still imputed at high accuracy  which is expected to further increase as the reference panel expands. We anticipate that the addition of rare variants from the GGP-F250 assay will increase the accuracy of imputation to sequence level."

Although low-density assays work well in the context of genomic prediction  they are less useful for detecting and mapping causal variants and the effects of rare variants are not captured. The objective of this project was to maximize the accuracies of genotype imputation from medium- and low-density assays to the marker set obtained by combining two high-density research assays (~<U+2009>850 000 SNPs)  the Illumina BovineHD and the GGP-F250 assays  which contains a large proportion of rare and potentially functional variants and for which the assay design is described here. This 850 K SNP set is useful for both imputation to sequence-level genotypes and direct downstream analysis. We found that a large multi-breed composite imputation reference panel that includes 36 131 samples with either BovineHD and/or GGP-F250 genotypes significantly increased imputation accuracy compared with a within-breed reference panel  particularly at variants with low minor allele frequencies. Individual animal imputation accuracies were maximized when more genetically similar animals were represented in the composite reference panel  particularly with complete 850 K genotypes. The addition of rare variants from the GGP-F250 assay to our composite reference panel significantly increased the imputation accuracy of rare variants that are exclusively present on the BovineHD assay. In addition  we show that an assay marker density of 50 K SNPs balances cost and accuracy for imputation to 850 K. Using high-density genotypes on all available individuals in a multi-breed reference panel maximized imputation accuracy for tested cattle populations. Admixed animals or those from breeds with a limited representation in the composite reference panel were still imputed at high accuracy  which is expected to further increase as the reference panel expands. We anticipate that the addition of rare variants from the GGP-F250 assay will increase the accuracy of imputation to sequence level. High-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping has driven rapid improvements in rates of genetic progress in livestock populations [  ]. To increase the predictive capabilities of genomic prediction models further  the discovery of functional variants has become increasingly important. Although many large-effect or Mendelian variants that control important phenotypes in cattle have been identified [    ]  the identification of moderate and small effect quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) and other causal variants has proven challenging [  ]. Early genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focused on the detection of these variants were often forced to choose between the density of the SNP array (number of SNPs genotyped) and statistical power (number of individuals genotyped). Imputation  the use of statistical models  and a reference set of haplotypes to infer missing genotypes  allows researchers to genotype large numbers of individuals at relatively low-density and impute their genotypes to high-density or even millions of SNPs from whole-genome resequencing data [  ]. Low- to medium-density common variant SNP assays are widely used for genetic evaluation in both beef and dairy cattle. Since the development of the BovineSNP50 (SNP50) BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA) [] in 2008 and the BovineHD (Illumina  San Diego  CA) array in 2009  more than 3 million dairy cattle in the United States alone have been genotyped using SNP assays that are derived from these progenitor assays []. Decker [] noted the value of these commercially-generated datasets for uses beyond genetic prediction. Although lower-density assays work well for genomic prediction [  ]  the effects due to rare variants are not captured and they have a low resolution for the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) or causal variants. High-quality imputation allows these datasets to be used to their full potential [  ]. Seabury et al. [] found that similar trait heritabilities were obtained with 50 K common variant genotypes and 778 K common variant imputed genotypes  but that the former were less powerful for QTL detection. Imputed 778 K genotypes identified 14 putative large effect QTL that were not identified using 50 K genotypes. Using these large publicly-funded or commercially-generated datasets imputed to high-resolution marker densities will increase prediction accuracies  aid in the detection of causal variants  and ultimately increase selection response in cattle [   ]. To use these large datasets to their full potential  the accuracy of imputation must be maximized. The most accurate imputation software packages for cattle [  ] were typically developed for human studies that were aimed at imputing from a high-density genotype panel to full-genome sequence. As a result  using these programs to impute genotypes directly from low-density to full-genome sequence  even in cattle breeds with high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD)  has been less accurate []. A “two-step” imputation strategy  first from a low-density assay (8 K to 70 K variants) to a high-density assay (><U+2009>700 K variants) and then from imputed high-density to the sequence level was more accurate than genotypes imputed in “one-step” from low-density to full-genome sequence in both cattle and humans [  ]. In this study  we consider the first part of the “two-step” imputation processes  because the produced genotypes can be used as input for imputation to full-genome sequence or as an endpoint for a variety of downstream analyses. Regardless of its use  maximizing the accuracy of imputation to high-density genotypes is essential to the success of both approaches. Initially  SNP assays for cattle were designed with common  evenly spaced markers that would presumably be in LD with causal variants []. Whereas these assays have performed well in genomic prediction applications  there is growing interest in including rare variants into predictions [      ]. Imputation accuracy has been shown to decline rapidly as minor allele frequencies (MAF) of SNPs decrease  thus increasing the confidence in the imputation of genotypes for rare variants has become a priority. In addition  most studies on optimizing imputation have focused on the imputation of genotypes for purebred animals using closely-related individuals from the same breed. As large numbers of genotypes for unpedigreed crossbred animals have become available  it is necessary to re-evaluate strategies for genotype imputation in these datasets. This study focuses on maximizing imputation accuracy from several commercially available low-density common variant SNP genotyping assays to a set of high-density variants (850 K)  many of which are rare and potentially functional. We test the effectiveness of a large  multi-breed composite reference panel for imputation in several beef and dairy cattle populations that are genotyped with several commercially available common variant SNP genotyping assays. We use both well-established and novel measures of imputation accuracy to categorize precisely the causes of imputation errors. These metrics provide insights for interpretation of imputation performance and define situations in which researchers should be cautious when using imputed variants. In addition  we explore how the starting chip density impacts the accuracy of imputation to 850 K variants. Finally  we introduce and describe the design of the GGP-F250 functional genotyping assay. The GGP-F250 is a tool not only for genotyping numerous functional variants but also for increasing the imputation accuracy of rare variants. To identify the best practices for achieving imputation accuracies that approach the error rates of modern SNP genotyping arrays  we compared the impact of altering reference panels and marker numbers in the starting assay when imputing genotypes to the level of the combined Illumina BovineHD (Illumina  San Diego  CA) and GeneSeek Genomic Profiler F250 (GeneSeek. Lincoln  NE) referred to herein as the HD and F250 assays  respectively. The HD assay contains 777 962 evenly spaced variants that have relatively high MAF across many breeds of cattle common to North America. The F250 assay contains 227 234 markers  of which 31 392 are present on the HD assay and included in the assay design for use in imputation  and another 195 842 potentially functional markers  many of which are rare (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.1). Due to these rare alleles  the MAF distribution for the F250 assay is more similar to the site frequency spectrum of the bovine genome (Fig. ). Details on the design of the F250 assay are in Additional file : Tables S1–S4. In this study  we used 2718 animals that were genotyped with both the F250 and HD assays  and 25 772 animals that were genotyped with only the F250  and 7218 animals genotyped with only the HD assay. Minor allele frequency spectra for three commercially available assays with different marker densities. Density plot of minor allele frequencies for the SNP50 (yellow)  F250 (purple)  and HD (green) assays Prior to sub-setting and masking genotypes for testing  we used the PLINK1.9 software [] to filter variants and individuals. The SNP positions were based on the ARS-UCD1.2 bovine reference genome assembly []. Non-autosomal variants were removed from the data. Variants and individuals with call rates lower than 0.90 were removed from the testing and reference datasets. Because many of the F250 variants are rare  no MAF filter was applied to any of the SNP arrays. Due to the diverse breed composition of the dataset  no Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium filter was applied. PLINK was used to estimate MAF in the filtered dataset for use in all downstream analyses. Two animals were removed due to low genotype call rates. The numbers of remaining variants after filtering for each of the assays in the masked testing set are in Table . To test the accuracy of imputation  PLINK1.9 [] was used to down-sample genotypes for 307 animals with both HD and F250 genotypes to the densities found on several commonly used commercial genotyping arrays: SNP50 and GGP-LD  GGP-90KT  GGP-HDv3  and GGP-ULD (all from GeneSeek  Lincoln  NE)  which were then imputed to the combined high-density research chips (~<U+2009>850 K SNPs). The process of sampling and masking testing genotypes is described visually in Additional file : Figure S1. All tested commercial assays possess SNPs that are largely derived from the SNP set of the HD assay (see Additional file : Table S5). A maximum of 50 individuals per breed that were genotyped with both the HD and F250 assays  were randomly chosen and masked to represent various commercial chip densities for testing imputation accuracy (Table ). All test set individuals had their breed-composition estimated by the CRUMBLER pipeline []. To avoid depleting the reference panel of breeds with small numbers of research assay genotypes  no more than 50% of a breed’s F250 or HD genotyped animals were removed for testing. The remainder of the HD and F250 genotypes were used in the composite reference panel (Table ). Due to the unequal representation of breeds in the test dataset  we created three separate datasets for testing different aspects of our imputation pipeline. The first dataset  ALL  used all 307 masked individuals that passed genotype call rate filtering. Because some of the indicine breeds used in our testing dataset were not adequately represented in the imputation reference panel  or their testing dataset sample sizes were not sufficiently large to draw meaningful conclusions  we created a test dataset  TAUR  which comprised only  animals  i.e. 281 Angus  Gelbvieh  Hereford  Holstein  Limousin and Simmental individuals. Finally  we used a test dataset  GEL that included 49 Gelbvieh individuals  to compare the accuracy of a within-breed imputation reference to the composite reference. After removing 307 individuals for testing  the remaining 28 183 F250 and 9629 HD genotyped reference individuals (Table ) were merged in PLINK and then phased with Eagle 2.4 []. Missing genotypes inferred by Eagle were removed with the bcftools program [] such that only the phased  directly genotyped markers remained. The within-breed imputation reference panel consisted of 265 and 514 Gelbvieh individuals that were genotyped with the HD and F250 assays  respectively. These reference individuals had their genotypes merged and phased  and the inferred genotypes were removed separately for each assay. Reciprocal F250/HD imputation analyses performed with Minimac3 were used to fill in missing genotypes in the reference panel. Reference-based phasing was performed for 307 individuals with masked genotypes in Eagle using 9629 individuals with pre-phased HD assay genotypes as the reference haplotypes. To perform “one-round” imputation  phased assays were imputed against the complete imputed 850 K SNP composite reference panel using Minimac3 []. The reference panel for the “one-round” imputation process was created by imputing missing HD markers for individuals genotyped on the F250 assay  and missing genotypes for F250 markers for individuals genotyped on the HD assay with Minimac3 (see Additional file : Figure S2). Here  the reference panel contained both observed and imputed genotypes. For “two-round” imputation  two separate imputation steps were performed to reach the 850 K SNP density (see Additional file : Figure S2). In each step  only observed genotypes served as HD and F250 references  respectively (no imputed genotypes in reference). First  the testing individuals with masked and phased genotypes were imputed to HD density (759 329 SNPs)  and then a second imputation step was performed that inferred genotypes for markers present on the F250  but not on the HD (122 181 SNPs) assay. Both imputation methods resulted in a total number of 835 947 variants  of which 835 926 segregated in the “one-round” CR panel and 835 933 in the “two-round” CR panel. For the within-breed imputation  49 Gelbvieh animals  all of which were present in the multi-breed testing set  which had been genotyped with both the F250 and HD assays  were masked to SNP50 density. Genotypes for these individuals were phased using Eagle along with 1113 additional Gelbvieh individuals genotyped with the SNP50 assay. This is representative of phasing strategies that involve a large number of individuals that have been genotyped using lower density assays. Phased genotypes were imputed against the breed-specific Gelbvieh reference (BR) panel. Imputation accuracy was measured for both individuals and variants within each imputation scenario. By coding alternate allele counts as 0  1  and 2 (for     and  genotypes  respectively)  both Pearson’s correlation coefficient () and count-based metrics could be used to evaluate the imputation accuracy for each variant and individual. Pearson’s correlation coefficients for individuals were calculated in two ways. First using unscaled  raw genotype values and then using genotype values centered by the variant’s MAF in the entire set of research assays (all HD  F250  reference and testing). To center genotypes  twice the variant’s MAF was subtracted from the raw genotype value. For both methods   values were calculated and compared. Although simple concordance (i.e.  “correct/incorrect”) measures of accuracy are valuable  they overestimate the quality of imputation at low MAF and are ambiguous as to the nature of the error that created an incorrectly imputed genotype. Rather than concordance rate  an imputation quality score (IQS) [] was calculated for each variant. The IQS calculates concordances that are adjusted for the chance that an imputed genotype could be correctly guessed. This statistic provides similar conclusions to correlation coefficients for most markers  but it estimates more robustly imputation quality for variants with low MAF []. Since Pearson’s correlation coefficients cannot be calculated in the absence of variation  a marker that appears fixed with the reference in the true set of genotypes  but contains an alternate allele when imputed  cannot have an  computed  but can have an IQS. This idea also applies in all cases when a marker is fixed in the true or imputed set  but not in the other. IQS allows us to identify all of these specific error types  and thus provides a more complete account of imputation accuracy. In addition to the IQS  the exact nature of each error was catalogued and tallied for each individual and variant. This allowed the errors to be categorized as either false heterozygotes (genotyped  or  imputed as )  false homozygotes (genotyped  imputed as  or ) or completely discordant ( imputed as  or vice versa). These more detailed error descriptions  in conjunction with MAF  genome position  and assay-of-origin information  allow for a detailed analysis of how these factors influence imputation accuracy to 850 K in each scenario. To approximate how well represented each individual was in the composite reference  we created a standardized genomic relationship matrix (GRM) as described in [] using the GEMMA software []. The resulting values provide quantitative measures of how far each individual is diverged from the members of the composite reference panel  i.e. larger values indicate that the individuals are more closely related to the animals in the reference panel. To observe the impact of within-breed genetic similarity on imputation accuracy  we created four breed-specific standardized GRM using test individuals and individuals in the reference with more than 50% Angus (number in test<U+2009>=<U+2009>50  number in reference<U+2009>=<U+2009>15 013)  Holstein (number in test<U+2009>=<U+2009>50  number of reference<U+2009>=<U+2009>5127)  Gelbvieh (number of testing<U+2009>=<U+2009>49  number of reference<U+2009>=<U+2009>470)  and Brahman/Nelore (number of testing<U+2009>=<U+2009>50  number of reference<U+2009>=<U+2009>2043) ancestry reported from the CRUMBLER pipeline []. Row means were calculated for each individual to quantify the relationship between each test individual and the members of their breed. The MAF spectrum of the SNPs on the HD and F250 assays for the individuals that composed our reference panel is shown in Fig.   which also displays data for the SNP50 assay for comparison. The SNP50 and HD assays have similar MAF spectra and include mostly common variants. In addition  the HD assay has an increased density of variants with a MAF ranging from 0.025 to 0.075. However  the F250 assay has a much higher proportion of SNPs with a MAF lower than 0.1  which is more similar to the site frequency spectrum of variants identified from genome resequencing []. Numerous statistics have been used to evaluate imputation quality. We compared two widely-used statistics [concordance rate and Pearson’s correlation ()] with the imputation quality score (IQS)  a metric that has been used in several human studies  but not in livestock [  ]. We tested each of these metrics on the TAUR dataset at both the level of variants and individuals. For variants  IQS were lower than concordance rates  particularly at lower MAF (Fig. a). In the TAUR dataset  IQS scores were lower than their corresponding  values for 81% of cases (Fig. b). At moderate to high MAF  these metrics generally agreed with each other. However  when MAF were lower than 0.1  both Pearson’s correlations and IQS penalized more heavily the imputation errors made for rare variants and resulted in lower averages and larger variances compared to concordance rates. The imputation quality statistic (IQS) compared to concordance rate and correlation as measures of imputation accuracy. Three imputation accuracy measures calculated for the TAUR dataset.  concordance  and  Pearson correlation over-estimate imputation accuracies compared to the imputation quality statistic (IQS) resulting in bias and a false high imputation accuracy Since IQS is a metric for assessing variant accuracy  we used error type/count and Pearson’s correlation () between observed and imputed genotypes to determine the impacts of different intrinsic and extrinsic factors on accuracy of imputation for each individual. Individual  values using raw and centered genotypes were highly correlated (Pearson’s <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9993 and Spearman’s <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9998). Since these values were so highly correlated  we report only individual correlations calculated from the raw genotype values  hereafter. For our 307 test animals  individual  ranged from 0.7466 to 0.9993  but 267 of these individuals had  higher than 0.990. In addition to characterizing these metrics  we also identified the type of error (complete discordance  false heterozygote  or false homozygote) that occurred on a SNP and individual basis. Individuals with the lowest  values (<<U+2009>0.85) tended to have significantly more false heterozygote errors than false homozygote errors (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.475<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  whereas well imputed animals showed no significant difference (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.7891). We used 50 Gelbvieh animals with both HD and F250 genotypes that were masked to SNP50 genotype density to compare the accuracy of imputation obtained when using a multi-breed composite reference (CR) or a single-breed reference (BR) panel when imputing to 850 K SNPs. Gelbvieh had the most complete genotypes of any open herdbook breed in our reference  making it a best-case scenario for breeds with mixed ancestry. Imputation with the breed-specific imputation panel had a mean IQS score of 0.982 (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.089). Because the breed-specific panel performed well  overall mean accuracy gains were modest but significant when using the composite panel (IQS mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.990  sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.073  paired T-test p<U+2009><<U+2009>2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) (Fig. a and see Additional file : Figure S3a). In addition to an increase in mean accuracy  the per-SNP accuracy variance decreased significantly when using the CR compared to the BR reference panel (F-test p<U+2009><<U+2009>2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Of the 107 110 SNPs for which IQS changed when imputed against the different reference panels  89 930 had an increased score with the CR panel (average IQS increase compared to BR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0797)  whereas only 15 349 (average IQS decrease compared to BR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0603) had a decreased score. For these two sets of SNPs  the average magnitude of the accuracy increases was significantly greater for the CR panel than for the BR panel (p<U+2009><<U+2009>2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). The composite reference panel improves per-variant imputation accuracies  particularly for rare variants. Imputation quality statistics when using breed-specific (green) and composite (purple) reference panels for 850 K imputation in the Gelbvieh (GEL) dataset across the MAF spectrum ()  and at low MAF () The most substantial accuracy gains from the use of the CR panel were observed for low MAF variants (Fig. b and see Additional file : Figure S3b). Although accuracy gains were modest for variants with MAF higher than 0.1 (0.007 IQS increase)  the increase in IQS for rare variants was 0.0182 when imputing with the CR panel. This increase in the quality of low MAF imputation was not detected when using concordance rate or  statistics (Table ). Of the 122 288 markers that were not perfectly imputed using the BR panel  there was an increase in IQS of 0.059 ( increase 0.032) when imputed with the CR panel. One concern with using a large multi-breed reference panel for imputation is that it may introduce variation that does not actually exist in the population being imputed. Individuals had significantly fewer false heterozygote errors when using the CR panel compared to the BR panel (paired T-test p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0039). There were  on average  733 fewer false heterozygote calls per individual when the CR panel was used. Whereas the per-variant increases in imputation accuracy were significant  the most substantial improvements in imputation accuracy due to the use of the CR panel were found for specific individuals. The mean individual  increased significantly from 0.9962 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0032) with the BR panel to 0.9979 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0010) with the CR panel (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0012). Animals that already had their genotypes accurately imputed using the BR panel did not show significant increases in accuracy with the CR panel. However  animals with the largest number of BR panel-induced imputation errors had much greater increases in accuracy when the CR panel was used (Fig. ). The 14 individuals with more than 5000 total errors when the BR panel was used had  on average  5522 fewer imputation errors (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>2361.33) when the CR panel was used for imputation. Conversely  the 35 individuals with less than 5000 imputation errors when the BR panel was used had only 209 fewer imputation errors  on average (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>609.80)  when the CR panel was used for imputation. Improvements from the composite reference panel were greatest for individuals for which genotypes were poorly imputed. Comparing the total number of errors when imputing from SNP50 to 850 K in the Gelbvieh (GEL) dataset when using breed-specific vs. composite reference panels. Points are individuals  colored by the change in count of errors from the breed to composite reference panels Across the MAF spectrum  accuracies for the “one-round” imputation were consistently higher than those for the “two-round” method. However  the overall magnitudes of the differences were modest. The “one-round” imputation increased the overall accuracy of imputation by 0.000762 IQS units  and for low MAF variants by 0.00256 units. In the “one-round” imputation  the addition of imputed rare variants from the F250 into the combined reference also increased the imputation accuracy of rare variants that were exclusive to the HD panel. The HD markers with MAF lower than 0.05 that were imperfectly imputed using the “two-round” method had an average increase in IQS of 0.0846 when imputed by the “one-round” approach (Table ). For the HD variants with moderate to high MAF  imputation accuracy increased slightly with the “one-round” compared with the “two-round” approach. Using individual imputation accuracy measures for 307 test animals  we identified the effects of an individual’s breed composition and of those breeds’ representations in the CR panel on individual imputation accuracy. Using the CR panel  individual  ranged from 0.747 to 0.999 while total imputation errors per individual ranged from 932 to 219 737. The accuracy of imputation was strongly related to an animal’s identified breed (Table ). Individuals from breeds that were adequately represented in the CR panel (Angus  Gelbvieh  Hereford  Holstein  Jersey  Limousin  Nelore and Simmental  Table ) were generally well imputed (median <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.997  range<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.930  0.999]) (Fig. ). Gelbvieh individuals had the highest mean imputation accuracy (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.998)  which is likely due to the high proportion of Gelbvieh animals genotyped on both the F250 and HD in the reference panel. Gelbvieh comprised 10.66% of the reference panel individuals with complete 850 K genotypes  second only to Holstein (80.13% of total). Since HD markers represent the largest proportion of the 850 K SNP panel  individuals from breeds with large numbers of HD genotypes  but relatively few F250 genotypes  such as Nelore  were still imputed at high accuracy (median <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.981  range<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.9774  0.9844]). Individuals from breeds that were only sparsely represented in the CR panel (Brahman  Gir  N’Dama  and Romagnola) had decreased mean accuracies and increased per-animal imputation accuracy variances (mean <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.890  range<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.747  0.961]). Per-individual accuracy by reported breed. Individual  by breed. Each point is an individual  colored by breed We used a GRM that was created with observed genotypes from all reference and test individuals to determine if an individual’s genetic similarity to individuals in the CR panel was related to its imputation accuracy (Fig. ). There was no direct relationship between an individual’s average relatedness to members of the CR panel and imputation accuracy. Rather  imputation accuracy was better predicted by the breed representation of the individuals in the CR panel. For example  individuals assigned by the CRUMBLER pipeline as Romagnola had relatively low imputation accuracies (mean individual <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.874  range<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.8549  0.8958])  although their genetic similarity values were comparable to those for the Hereford and Jersey samples. The low imputation accuracy for the Romagnola breed likely stems from the low representation of its haplotypes within the CR panel (15 HD and 8 F250 genotypes). We observed the opposite for Nelore; although the Nelore individuals were distantly related to the members of the CR panel as a whole  the larger number of samples contained in the reference panel (858 HD and 7 F250 genotypes) resulted in accurate imputation (mean individual <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.981). This was also observed for Gir  which is as diverged from taurines as the Nelore breed  but its reduced imputation accuracy was due to the presence of only 13 HD and nine F250 individuals in the CR panel. The average genetic relationship with individuals of the same breed in the CR panel had varying magnitudes of correlation with individual imputation accuracies  depending on the breed (see Additional file : Figure S4). Measures of genetic similarity and individual imputation accuracy were highly correlated in Brahman and Nellore (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.940)  negatively correlated in Gelbvieh (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.138)  and moderately correlated in Angus and Holstein (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.207 and 0.241  respectively). Relatedness to composite reference panel members is not a strong predictor of individual imputation accuracy.

Larger values indicate stronger relationships To test the impact of the starting assay number of markers on 850 K imputation accuracy  we used the TAUR dataset masked to represent the contents in markers of five common commercial assays. Each successive increase in assay marker number led to increases in imputation accuracy both overall and for low-MAF variants (Table  and Fig. ). The largest increase in imputation accuracy came between the number of markers used in ULD and GGP-LD assays. Imputation accuracies from the ULD were exceptionally poor for low-MAF variants. Although the decline in IQS at low MAF was also observed for other assays  it was much greater for the ULD variants (0.1385 IQS decrease). At marker densities higher than that of the GGP-LD assay  increases in overall imputation accuracy were smaller (GGP-LD<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>SNP50<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0133  SNP50<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>GGP-90KT<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0051  and GGP-90KT<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>GGP-HD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0036). Similar increases in accuracy were observed for low-MAF variants as the starting assay density increased (ULD<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>GGP-LD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1249  GGP-LD<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>SNP50<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0152  SNP50<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>GGP-90KT<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0099  and GGP-90KT<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>GGP-HD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0099). Effects of starting assay marker numbers on imputation accuracy across the MAF spectrum. Variant accuracy measures for 850 K imputation in the TAUR dataset based on five assays with different marker numbers. Binned mean IQS lines (per-variant accuracy) across the MAF spectrum Individual accuracies also increased as the starting assay number of markers increased. A one-way ANOVA using Tukey’s method for multiple comparisons indicated a significant difference in 850 K imputation accuracy between the ULD and GGP-LD (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.05<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) assays  but not between the GGP-LD and SNP50 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1486) assays (Fig. ). There were no significant differences between the SNP50 and GGP-90KT or GGP-HD assays. However  the starting GGP-LD marker number had a significantly lower imputation accuracy compared to GGP-90KT (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0049). This suggests that imputation accuracy gains are minimal when the starting assay marker number is larger than 50 000 variants (Table ). Impact of starting assay marker numbers on per-individual imputation accuracy. Per-individual accuracy measures for 850 K imputation in the TAUR dataset based on five starting assays differing in marker numbers. Boxplots for total imputation errors based on each starting assay marker number Using the imputation accuracy information for the TAUR dataset  we identified a number of genomic regions for which markers had a low imputation accuracy. Although most markers were accurately imputed  most chromosomes have at least one small region that contained poorly imputed markers (Fig. ). The overall number of poorly imputed markers was quite small. Only 21 848 markers had an IQS lower than 0.8 (1.95% of imputed makers) (see Additional file : Figure S3a and S3b)  and only 8963 markers had more than 10 imputation errors (1.07% of imputed markers). When using the IQS metric  we found that there are markers imputed with low accuracies on each chromosome  particularly low-MAF variants with relatively few errors (making IQS<U+2009>=<U+2009>0) (Fig. a). However  both IQS and total error counts (Fig. b) reveal clusters of markers with a low imputation accuracy. Investigation of these regions indicated that the probe sequences for these variants had multiple equally likely matches to the genome  which indicates either that there were genome mis-assemblies or simply that the wrong location was chosen to represent the position of the marker. The latter can be easily rectified by changing the map files for these variants to reflect the correct alternate position. Regions with low imputation accuracy exist across the genome but represent only a small subset of the markers. Regions of low imputation accuracy using the TAUR dataset identified by total imputation errors ()  and IQS () Most studies on imputation accuracy in livestock populations have used two methods to assess the adequacy of imputation: concordance rate  i.e. the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes  and the Pearson correlation () between observed and imputed genotypes. Although both statistics make sense at the level of individuals  their ability to identify markers for which genotypes are poorly imputed is not optimal  particularly for markers with a low MAF. Because our dataset contains a large proportion of rare variants (24.30% markers with MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.1)  a statistic that more robustly represents the quality of imputation is essential. Using the IQS statistic  we show that  and especially concordance rate  overestimate the accuracy of imputation for low-MAF variants [  ]. In the GEL test data  2070 variants with an average MAF of 0.040 had high concordance rates (0.97 average)  but very low IQS scores (0.0). Unlike   which requires that markers be variable in both the true and imputed datasets  IQS can be calculated for variants that are not variable in either the observed or imputed datasets. This provides a more complete view of the imputation accuracy at each locus  particularly for those with an extremely low MAF. This information is lost when using   and imputation accuracies are grossly inflated if measured using concordance rate. That said   and IQS are highly correlated (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9892) and provide equally useful diagnostics for imputation quality at most sites. We note that while we treated the HD and F250 genotype calls as being correct  a ~<U+2009>0.2% error rate is associated with these genotyping platforms [] (see Additional file : Table S4). The F250 assay was designed to query genotypes at a large number of rare  potentially functional variants and is very gene-centric (i.e. they are not evenly spaced). Common variants were also included in the F250 assay design to allow for imputation and genomic prediction applications. The rare variants present on the F250 assay are important in the context of this work for two reasons. First  imputing an additional ~<U+2009>170 000 variants at the population level will increase researchers’ ability to refine GWAS signals and identify putative QTN due to increased marker density within QTL regions. Second  because the variants are very gene-centric  it is anticipated that the accuracy of imputation to the whole-genome sequence level will be improved within genic regions. The inclusion of rare variants will likely increase the imputation accuracy of other rare variants that are not directly assayed  as strong LD () requires that allele frequencies at two markers be similar. In the absence of selection  rare variants are assumed to have been recently derived  and thus are likely in LD with other recently derived rare alleles []. By adding rare variants to our reference panel with the F250 assay and by genotyping a large number of individuals  we improve the imputation of rare variants that are not directly assayed by the F250. Although many individuals in our reference panel have only imputed F250 genotypes  their presence had a significant impact on the imputation accuracies of rare variants. Whereas at a reduced scale  our comparison of “one-round” vs. “two-round” imputation showed that leveraging rare F250 variants helped impute low-MAF variants that are only assayed by the HD assay (Table ). We expect that these increases in imputation accuracy of rare variants that are achieved from the use of the F250 assay will be carried over to subsequent imputation to whole-genome sequence-level. The positive impact of the F250 assay on imputation of rare variants underscores the need for additional complete 850 K data in our reference panel (individuals genotyped with both the HD and F250 assays). The highest imputation accuracies were observed for breeds that had the largest numbers of complete 850 K genotypes because more of the haplotypic diversity in those breeds was directly captured in the reference panel. Early imputation studies primarily concentrated on homogenous populations. When imputation is performed in closely related animals from breeds with small effective population sizes  such as Holstein [  ]  highly accurate imputation can be achieved from using a relatively small set of reference genotypes. Recently  large numbers of genotypes have been produced using low-density assays in outbred animals  admixed individuals  from both registered and commercial populations. In conjunction  many animals from a wide range of breeds have now been genotyped on high-density assays such as HD and F250. By combining all available high-density genotypes into a single multi-breed composite reference panel  we found increased imputation accuracy across the MAF spectrum. Comparing the composite reference panel with a breed-specific reference panel  the most substantial increases occurred at the level of individuals. Genotypes for individuals that were accurately imputed using the breed reference panel saw no substantial increases in accuracy when imputed using the CR panel. However  individuals with poorly imputed genotypes using the BR panel had a substantial reduction in the number of imputation errors when imputed using the CR panel. The increased haplotypic diversity present in the composite reference panel improves the accuracy of imputation of introgressed haplotypes that are not present in a more limited breed-specific reference panel. It is important to be aware that in the context of routine genotyping and imputation  there is no a priori knowledge on which individuals may have poorly imputed genotypes. On the one hand  gains in accuracy from using the CR panel may be small in closed herdbook populations such as Holstein or Angus but they are unlikely to be worse than if the panel is restricted to a breed-specific reference. On the other hand  for open herdbook or composite breeds  increases in imputation accuracy are likely substantial. We did not detect an increase in false heterozygote or false homozygote genotype calls using the multi-breed reference panel  which suggests that the use of a CR panel does not introduce false variation into imputed genotypes at a higher rate than imputation using a within-breed reference panel. For breeds that are adequately represented in the CR panel  we found imputation accuracies (median <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.997) that were consistent with the error rates of the genotyping assays (see Additional file : Table S4)  which suggests a near-perfect imputation process. Previous work recommended the use of multi-breed reference panels for whole-genome sequence imputation [  ]. Our findings for high-density genotypes with an allele frequency spectrum similar to that of the genome sequence supports this finding and suggests that improvements in imputation accuracy for outbred and admixed populations will benefit from the sequencing and inclusion of diverse animals that will capture more of the haplotypic diversity that is found in cattle. Further improvements in accuracy could be obtained by removing Mendelian inconsistencies from the raw dataset that is used to create the CR panel  which was not performed for this study. An individual’s average relatedness to the entire CR panel was not a good predictor of imputation accuracy. Our multi-breed reference panel was heavily biased towards the most common and economically relevant American beef breeds but also had a diverse array of individuals from other breeds in varying numbers. We found that even low levels of admixture with breeds not adequately represented in the CR panel can lead to decreased imputation accuracies. Information on breed composition was valuable for identifying outlying individuals or breeds that  in theory  should have been accurately imputed. For example  the five individuals labeled as Angus with low imputation accuracies were found to be admixed with breeds that are not well represented in the CR panel (see Additional file : Table S6). Each of these individuals identified as Angus actually had relatively low proportions of Angus ancestry (0.107 to 0.532 Angus and Red Angus)  and moderately high proportions of breeds sparsely represented in the CR panel. The most significant increases in imputation accuracy will likely come through the addition of high-density genotypes for breeds that are sparsely represented in our reference panel  and through the addition of more completely genotyped individuals  i.e.  those with both HD and F250 genotypes. It is worth noting that the breed accuracies reported here for populations with a limited representation in our composite reference panel (Brahman  Gir  N’Dama  Romagnola) would have improved if we had not removed large proportions of each of the breeds to create the test set. We expect that the accuracies reported here are underestimated compared with those achieved by imputation against the full CR panel. The starting assay marker number had a significant impact on the accuracy of imputation to 850 K. In agreement with the conclusions on LD of the Bovine HapMap project  we found that approximately 50 K SNPs are needed to impute to 850 K with high accuracy []. This observation likely has a larger impact on research applications that seek to identify QTN rather than applications that are targeted towards genomic prediction. At common allele frequencies (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.1)  IQS values were steady for all starting assay densities. The decline in imputation quality of rare variants (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.1) relative to MAF was much more severe for low-density starting assays  particularly the ULD assay  than for higher density starting assays. When starting array densities are increased above 50 K SNPs  significant gains in imputation accuracy will come almost exclusively from improved imputation at rare variants. There is a large number of individuals that have been genotyped with assays with small numbers of common markers (<<U+2009>10 000 markers) and these individuals can be accurately imputed to ~<U+2009>50 K common markers [  ]. Studies that impute from these densities to 850 K and whole-genome sequence should expect significantly more errors. If the aim is to perform both genomic predictions and downstream causal variant discovery  via imputation  our recommendation is to genotype new individuals with an assay density of ~<U+2009>50 000 SNPs. We conclude that  in diverse samples  as seen in typical beef cattle populations  a multi-breed phasing and imputation panel will provide the highest imputation accuracies. Individuals that have a moderately represented ancestry in the reference panel will have genotypes accurately imputed. Imputation accuracies were highest for rare variants when using the composite reference panel. The addition of rare variants from the F250 assay increased the imputation accuracy of rare variants in the HD assay. The addition of a large number of individuals that are genotyped for rare variants will likely improve imputation of rare variants to the sequence level. We confirm that for imputation to 850 K  gains in accuracy reach a plateau as the starting assay marker number exceeds 50 K SNPs. We identified a small subset of SNPs with poor imputation accuracies  most of which seem to be caused by location errors of probe sequences that can be corrected. The largest gains in imputation accuracy are expected to come from the addition of individuals with complete (HD and F250) genotypes  with the largest gains coming from modest increases in the numbers of individuals from the less well-represented breeds. Imputation accuracies for the breeds that are adequately represented in the multi-breed composite-reference panel when the starting assay comprises at least 50 K SNPs should approach accuracies of 1.0 minus the genotyping assay error rate. We anticipate that the CR panel presented here will serve as a foundation reference panel  on which the global cattle community can build to further increase the accuracy of genotype imputation.

However  in spite of intensive research  biases still occur  which make it difficult to perform optimal selection across groups of animals. The objective of this study was to investigate whether incomplete genotype datasets with errors could be a potential source of level-bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals and between animals genotyped on different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels in single-step genomic predictions. Incomplete and erroneous genotypes of young animals caused biases in breeding values between groups of animals. Systematic noise or missing data for less than 1% of the SNPs in the genotype data had substantial effects on the differences in breeding values between genotyped and non-genotyped animals  and between animals genotyped on different chips. The breeding values of young genotyped individuals were biased upward  and the magnitude was up to 0.8 genetic standard deviations  compared with breeding values of non-genotyped individuals. Similarly  the magnitude of a small value added to the diagonal of the genomic relationship matrix affected the level of average breeding values between groups of genotyped and non-genotyped animals. Cross-validation accuracies and regression coefficients were not sensitive to these factors. Because  historically  different SNP chips have been used for genotyping different parts of a population  fine-tuning of imputation within and across SNP chips and handling of missing genotypes are crucial for reducing bias. Although all the SNPs used for estimating breeding values are present on the chip used for genotyping young animals  incompleteness and some genotype errors might lead to level-biases in breeding values. Bias in single-step genomic predictions for dairy cattle has been debated within scientific communities for several years [  ]  and these biases have hindered the breeding organisations from adopting single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) approaches. Bias is a general term  and for practical use in breeding programmes  it is useful to differentiate between at least two types of bias: (1) inflation of genomic breeding values  which causes an enhanced spread of the breeding value estimates; and (2) level-bias of breeding values  which influences the predicted genetic levels for groups of animals (e.g. overprediction of genotyped animals vs. non-genotyped animals). Since many dairy breeding organisations tend to use only young bulls without daughter information in their breeding program  the importance of the inflation becomes less problematic for genetic progress. On the contrary  a prominent level-bias can have important effects for two reasons: (1) pre-selection (selection of the calves that should be genotyped) is based on the mid-parent mean  and a prominent level-bias would affect the selection based on the genotype status of the mother; (2) if the herd consists of both genotyped and ungenotyped animals  level-bias would affect the selection accuracy within the herd. In single-step genomic predictions (ssGBLUP)  breeding values for the selection of both genotyped and non-genotyped animals are calculated simultaneously with all the information included [  ]. This makes it possible to perform all the selection within the breeding program based on one set of breeding values. To perform an optimal selection  it is crucial that predicted breeding values are on the same scale whether the animal is genotyped or not. Often  selection of young animals to be genotyped (before the final selection into the artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer programs) is based on the parent-mean estimated breeding value (EBV) of all the calves in the entire population. Most AI bulls are genotyped; however  the cow population consists of both genotyped and non-genotyped animals. In the presence of level-bias  where genotyped cows that on average have higher breeding values than non-genotyped cows  sons and daughters of genotyped cows will mainly have higher parent average EBV than descendants of non-genotyped cows  and this leads to incorrect ranking and reduced genetic progress. In 2012  genomic predictions for all traits were implemented for the pre-selection of Norwegian Red young bulls using a SNP-BLUP method []. Selection candidates were genotyped on the same SNP panel as most of the reference population. In 2016  SNP-BLUP was replaced by single-step GBLUP [  ] because of the higher accuracy of EBV. This was followed by intensive genotyping of cows  using another SNP panel. All the SNPs used for genomic predictions were present on the new panel  and no imputation was performed when new genotypes from the new chip were added. After some months in operation  it was observed that breeding values of different groups of animals tended to drift. Young genotyped animals received on average higher EBV than before genotyping  and in addition  animals genotyped on one chip were predicted to have a higher genetic level than animals genotyped on other SNP chips  and this deviation was larger than that explained by genetic trend. In this study  we investigated several potential sources of the aforementioned biases. We investigated whether incomplete imputation of missing SNPs or erroneous SNP-data could be sources of bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals and between animals genotyped on different SNP panels in ssGBLUP. We also examined how the addition of a small value to the diagonal of the genomic relationship matrix  which was previously often used to make it non-singular  affects level-bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals. Norwegian Red (NR) is a synthetic dairy breed  which has been selected for a broad breeding objective. Historically  it was based on a cross between traditional Norwegian breeds  in combination with imported genetics mainly from Finnish Ayrshire and Swedish Red (from 1960 to present)  but also some Holstein/Friesian in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently  about 5% of the NR originates from Holstein (Morten Svendsen  personal communication). Back in the 1950s and 1960s  Norwegian Reds were mainly selected for production and functionality. Later  other traits were included in the breeding goal  i.e. fertility in the early 1970s and health in the late 1970s. Currently  health and fertility traits constitute one third of the breeding goal and the rest is divided between functional traits (1/3)  which include both conformation traits  milkability  temperament and polledness  and production traits (1/3)  which include both milk and beef production). The population includes<U+2009>~<U+2009>210 000 dairy cows  with an effective population size of about 240 []. Phenotypes on 305-day lactation yields for kg of milk were taken from the routine evaluations consisting of 7 519 418 records from the 1st to 3rd lactation on 3 647 173 Norwegian Red cows  with lactation data from 1979 and onwards. The pedigree was traced back to 25 generations and comprised 4 650 339 animals. Missing pedigree data were grouped by year of birth and by the following classes: the missing parent is the missing AI sire  or the missing farm bull or the missing dam. This resulted in 114 groups. The dataset was analysed in MiX99 [] by a single-trait repeatability animal model with a heritability   equal to 0.26  and a value of repeatability equal to 0.52  which are the values used in routine evaluations: where  is the vector of estimated accumulated 305 days yields/lactation produced by the cow;  is the intercept;  is a vector of fixed month  year effects with the design matrix ;  is a vector of fixed age  lactation number effects with the design matrix   (age was measured in months);  is a vector of fixed effects of days open  lactation number with the design matrix   (days open is grouped into 10-days intervals up till 159 days);  is a vector of random herd  year effects with the design matrix ;  is the vector of genetic group regression effects with the design matrix  of genetic group contributions;  is a vector of random permanent environmental effects with the design matrix ;  is a vector of random animal effects with the design matrix ; and  is a vector of random errors. All random effects are assumed to be independently distributed  with the exception of  which has variance   where  denotes the combined genomic and pedigree-based relationship matrix that is varied as described in the next section. Genetic groups were included in the model as fixed regressions where the genetic group contributions of each animal in  were calculated first with RelaX2 []. Then  after solving the mixed model equations in MiX99  the regression coefficients   were multiplied with the genetic group matrix  (which included all the animals in the pedigree) and then added to the animal effects () to give the final breeding values:  Genomic data consisted of 40 174 Norwegian Red animals  genotyped on different platforms: a customized Affymetrix 55 k SNP chip (Affymetrix  Santa Clara) (31 947 samples)  Illumina 54 k v1  BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego) (726 samples)  Illumina 54 k v2  BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego) (4943 samples)  Illumina 777 k  BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego) (1487 samples) and Affymetrix 25 k (Affymetrix  Santa Clara)  (1071 samples). Most progeny-tested bulls are genotyped on the Illumina chips and the Affymetrix 25 k chip  whereas in the last few years most of the cows and selection candidates have been genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k SNP chip (Fig. ). Birth year and proportion of animals genotyped on different SNP chips The following parameters were used to filter the SNPs within a chip before imputation: a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.01  a SNP call rate  0.9  and a Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium exact test  value  1e–7. In order to reduce the biases observed in the routine breeding value estimations described in the \"\" section  genotype data were imputed with Flmpute [] to a subset of the Illumina 777 k chip for which all SNPs segregated in the population with few Mendelian inconsistencies. To make the selection of SNPs for genomic predictions as uniform as possible across the genome  we performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning by using the PLINK software [  ]. A 50-SNP window size was set  and five SNPs was used to shift the window at each step. Pairs of variants in the current window with a squared correlation greater than the  threshold of 0.5 were pruned from the window until no such pairs remained. After this step  109 k SNPs remained for the genomic predictions. SNP data were used to calculate genomic relationships and to build the combined inverse pedigree and genomic relationship matrix  [  ] using the HGINV program []: where  is the sub-matrix of the pedigree-based relationship matrix () for genotyped animals. Since Norwegian Reds’ are an open population  estimation of the base allele frequencies is not straightforward. To overcome this problem and to avoid that imported genetics appeared extremely inbred  we used equal allele frequencies (0.5) for all SNPs in the construction of the genomic relationship matrix  [].  was then scaled by multiplying a parameter to all matrix elements to make the average diagonal elements equal to 1 []. Let  denote the () marker matrix  with  individuals and  markers containing elements equal to -<U+2009>1  0 and 1 for the homozygote  heterozygote and the other homozygote  respectively. Using Method 1 from [] with allele frequencies of 0.5 and scaling the matrix to have average diagonal elements equal to 1  the scaled genomic relationship matrix can be written as . Then  the additive pedigree relationship matrix was weighted by 10% to account for genetic effects that are not captured by the SNPs. In addition  we also investigated the effect of adding a small value () to the diagonal of the raw  matrix [  ]  which became  The effect of changing the  parameter was investigated for the alternative scenarios D-2 to D-4 in Table   while for the other scenarios  this parameter was set to zero. To investigate various aspects of imputation of missing data and discrepancy between SNP panels  we made some permutations of the SNP data to mimic different scenarios before running the HGINV program with the same parameters as mentioned above. In raw genotype data  noise or missing data occur for nearly 1% of the SNPs  and here 1000 of the 109 k SNPs were permuted. The HGINV program imputes missing genotypes by inserting the most common genotype. Scenario 1 was motivated by the situation where there is a proportion of the genotypes that are not imputed before going into HGINV  but there is no systematic missingness among the SNPs (Table ). This was performed by setting 1000 random SNPs for each animal genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k SNP chip to missing (a different set of 1000 SNPs for each of the animals). To study the effect of systematic missingness among SNPs for non-imputed genotypes  we created Scenario 2  in which  1000 common random SNPs were set to missing for all animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip (‘common’ denotes that the set of SNPs was the same for all these animals). Scenario 3 was motivated by our experience that some systematic genotyping errors exist. Some SNPs work well on one chip and poorly on others. This was modelled by removing data on a set of 1000 common random SNPs for all the animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip and inserting random genotypes from a uniform multinomial distribution on those 1000 SNPs instead (equal probability of inserting 0  1 or 2). Finally  we developed Scenario 4  to investigate alternative handling of missing data. In this scenario  the genotypes of the common 1000 random SNPs among the animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip were removed and replaced by one of the three possible genotypes according to the distribution of their probabilities (based on Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium frequencies  which were estimated based on the animals genotyped on the other SNP chips). To investigate how sensitive the predictions are to the set of random values used for creating missingness and errors  each of the scenarios 1 to 4 was replicated ten times and standard errors for the different measures were calculated based on these replicates. To quantify level-bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals for the different scenarios  we masked the genotypes of 2000 young animals without progeny or phenotypes  genotyped with the Affymetrix 55 k chip. Then  we ran single-step genomic prediction and compared the breeding values of these animals () with those when their genotypes were included (). The average change in breeding value of these animals divided by the genetic standard deviation of the trait    quantified level-bias in the model. To measure level-bias between animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip vs. the other panels  we analysed only the genotyped animals that were born between 31.12.2013 and 01.01.2017. The reason is that we wanted to remove the effect of genetic trend from the dataset. We then investigated the mean level of the breeding values from the different scenarios and compared them with those from pedigree-based BLUP. To estimate the accuracy and inflation of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV)  we removed the phenotypes of the 4000 youngest genotyped cows with milk records and all the data on their descendants. Then  we estimated the breeding values and correlated them against the yield deviations (YD) on the same 4000 animals. The yield deviations were calculated as the sum of GEBV plus the residual connected to each record from the full dataset from MiX99 []. Since some of the validation cows had more than one lactation record  the number of YD (6285) was a little larger than the number of animals (4000). Animals with more than one record had their GEBV repeated in the dataset before estimating the correlation and performing a linear regression. Accuracy  was then measured as: Inflation was estimated as the regression coefficient  from the linear regression with YD as a response variable and the GEBV as an explanatory variable. Level-biases for the 2000 young animals in the different scenarios are in Table   which shows that the magnitude of level-bias depends on the noise in the genotype data and  to some extent  on the parameter added to the diagonal. The accuracy and inflation (regression coefficient) are much less sensitive to these permutations. For all scenarios  the predicted GEBV for animals born after 2013 and genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip were higher than those predicted with BLUP (Fig. a). The BLUP-EBV of the group of animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip were slightly lower than those for the animals genotyped on other SNP panels. In contrast  for some of the other scenarios (particularly  Scenarios 2 and 3)  this relationship was reverted. The only scenario  for which the GEBV between animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip vs. other SNP panels reached the same values as with BLUP  was Scenario D-2. However  in this scenario  both groups of genotyped animals (on the Affymetrix 55 k chip and other SNP panels) had increased GEBV compared to the BLUP-EBV. Comparison of the breeding values for all genotyped animals (Fig. b) showed that the breeding values for animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 chip are on average higher than those for animals genotyped on other SNP chips. Box plot of breeding values of  genotyped animals born between 2013 and 2017 and  all genotyped animals in the different scenarios In this study  we demonstrated how genotyping errors and missing values in genotype data affect level-bias in single-step genomic predictions. Noise or missing data for nearly 1% of the SNPs in the genotype data are in the same range of those observed with raw genotype data  and they affected both the level of breeding values between genotyped and non-genotyped animals  and between genotyped animals genotyped on different chips. Scenarios 2 and 3 gave the highest level-bias (Table ). These scenarios have in common that the introduced genotype missingness/errors resulted in systematic differences in allele frequencies between genotypes obtained with Affymetrix 55 k and the other SNP chips and seemed to cause bias between genotyped vs. non-genotyped animals as well as between animals genotyped on different SNP panels (Fig. a). On the one hand  the animals belonging to the group genotyped with the other SNP panels mainly consist of progeny-tested bulls born over a period from 1980 to 2014. On the other hand  the Affymetrix genotype data consist mostly of cows  heifers  calves and selection candidates that were born within the last 5 years and have a higher average genetic level than the animals belonging to the group of animals genotyped on other SNP panels (Fig. b). When allele frequency is changed due to missingness and errors in the raw genotype data  these SNPs will become erroneously associated with the genetic improvement that occurred between these two groups of animals. New animals with added raw-genotypes will receive biased breeding values because their genotype will carry some of the same missingness and noisy SNPs as the other animals genotyped on the same chip. This shows that filtering within chips (based on Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and missingness)  in addition to imputation in routine single-step genomic evaluations  is crucial to reduce level-bias. If routine imputation is not possible due to computational costs  inserting the most common genotype or a uniformly random genotype is an extremely poor choice. Instead  picking a random genotype based on the observed allele frequencies is better  as illustrated in Scenario 4. Another approach is to use genotype probabilities instead of poorly imputed genotypes  but the software for building genomic relationship matrices that were developed for large-scale genotype datasets are generally not able to handle genotype probabilities (such as [  ]). The value of the parameter added to the diagonal of the  matrix also influenced level-bias  but to a much smaller extent than the permutations mentioned above. The permutations in the diag-parameter mainly affected level-bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals. A value of 0.01 (such as in e.g. []) added to the diagonal elements of the genomic relationship matrix more than doubled level-bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals  compared with the BaseLine scenario (see Table ). Instead of adding values to the diagonal values  a better idea is to put some weight on the -matrix which makes the genomic relationship matrix invertible []  and also  results in improved prediction accuracy []. In addition  the scenarios with non-systematic random missing values among the animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip (Scenario 1)  and the scenario in which systematic missingness was replaced by a random number drawn from the observed Hardy–Weinberg genotype distribution (Scenario 4)  gave the same level-bias between genotyped and non-genotyped animals. These two scenarios do not necessarily create systematic differences in allele frequencies between genotypes obtained with Affymetrix 55 k and other SNP chips. Thus  they do not affect level-bias between the groups of animals genotyped on the Affymetrix 55 k chip vs. other SNP chips. These scenarios resulted in values of level-bias that were similar to those obtained when adding a relatively large number to the diagonal of the genomic relationship matrix. Cross-validation of different models is a valuable tool to optimize a methodology  but not necessarily the best tool to uncover level-bias. Many studies quantify the performance of a model by measuring the accuracy and regression coefficients only  but these measures are relatively insensitive to the values of the input parameters [  ]. Normally a validation set is selected to be a set of genotyped animals born within a brief time interval  but such validations do not capture the level-bias described in this paper. Level-bias seems to be much more sensitive to changes in parameters than regression coefficients and accuracy  which are mainly measured when comparing models. Since level-bias affects the average level of EBV for groups of animals  the average ranking within the group might be correct  but the average level across the groups might be wrong. To quantify level-bias  validation sets should contain enough animals from the relevant groups. Alternatively  one could do comparisons as shown here  by removing some of the animals and comparing the average change in their estimated breeding values when including their genotype data. Several attempts have been done to reduce both bias and inflation by introducing and optimizing parameters with more or less biological meaning [] and by introducing variables that could represent the selection history [  ]. In practice with noisy genotype data  a lot of the observed bias in single-step genomic predictions could be reduced without inserting any new parameters or variables. However  since single-step genomic predictions depend on many assumptions and parameters and determining which parameters should be tuned to get rid of the bias is not straightforward. Because historically different SNP chips have been used for genotyping different parts of the population  fine-tuning of imputation across SNP chips and handling of missing genotypes is crucial. This does not mean that the work performed to harmonize  and  and account for selection history [  ] is not important. In a subsequent paper  we shall investigate how such methods could further reduce level-bias in our data. Contrary to other studies [    ]  the GEBV of production traits do not seem to be inflated  but rather show too little variance compared to yield deviations. This could be due to an underestimated genetic variance. Legarra [] showed that genetic variance estimates depend on the base population assumed when estimating the relationship matrix. The genetic variance in the current population is   where  equals the average of the self-relationships minus the average of all the elements of the relationship matrix. In our case   and the genetic variance was not estimated using this relationship matrix  which may explain why we effectively used a genetic variance that was too small. The level-bias that we obtained in the ssGBLUP evaluations for Norwegian Red was probably due to a combination of various sources: lack of imputation of new genotypes  which led to partly systematic and partly random missingness among young genotyped animals  and in addition  erroneous genotypes. In addition  a diag parameter equal to 0.01 also contributed to level-bias. A lot of effort was done to harmonize the genomic and the pedigree part of the  matrix [    ]  without success. However  removal of SNPs with a large amount of Mendelian inconsistencies across SNP chips  thorough imputation and decrease of the diag parameter  removed the most severe source of bias. We showed that incomplete handling of erroneous/missing genotypes of young animals resulted in high level-bias in breeding values in ssGBLUP. Both the level of breeding values between genotyped and non-genotyped animals and between animals genotyped on different SNP chips were affected. Similarly  the magnitude of a small value added to the diagonal of the genomic relationship matrix  to make it invertible  affected the level of breeding values between genotyped and non-genotyped animals. The accuracy and regression coefficient from standard cross-validations were not sensitive to erroneous/missing genotype data. Hence  we suggest that the average change in breeding value after the animals are genotyped  should be included as a standard quality measure of ssGBLUP models.

By using an eigenvalues-based approach  it was possible to explain why the moderate accuracy of genomic selection based on small datasets only increases slowly as more data are added. Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) is a common tool for genomic analysis in animal and plant breeding []. Its basic form is equivalent to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) BLUP [] and assumes an identical distribution of all SNP effects [    ]. When not all the individuals are genotyped  a special version of GBLUP called single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) can merge pedigree and genomic relationships into a single matrix []. The advantage of GBLUP (and especially ssGBLUP) is simplicity  since existing models and BLUP software can be reused just by changing a relationship matrix. GBLUP and ssGBLUP have become popular methodologies for the genetic evaluation of livestock. Although Bayesian variable selection methods [  ] were found to be more accurate with small datasets  their advantage seemed to be lost with large reference populations []. Daetwyler et al. [] showed that selection of SNPs via BayesB outperformed GBLUP only if the number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was small compared to the number of independent chromosome segments (). Therefore  if the amount of phenotypic data is small  SNPs that are selected by tagging large QTL segments can improve accuracy by reducing the number of parameters to estimate. Karaman et al. [] found that the advantage of BayesB over GBLUP fades with large datasets. Consequently  when the amount of information is sufficient to estimate most of the segments  selection of SNPs is no longer beneficial. Although selection of SNPs is possible with GBLUP [  ]  its application is difficult in complex multitrait models  such as those used for commercial genetic evaluations. There are several formulas to determine . The first formula reported by Stam [] is based on the number of chromosome junctions in a fixed size population with random mating  i.e.   where  is the effective size of the population and  is the genome length in Morgan. By taking selection into account  Hayes et al. [] reduced that number to   and Goddard [] reduced that number even further to . Assuming typical values for  (100) and  (30) in Holstein dairy cattle  according to these three formulas   would be equal to 12 000  6000  and 600  respectively. Pocrnic et al. [] related  to the dimensionality of the genomic relationship matrix (GRM). For large populations that are genotyped with many SNPs      and  corresponded approximately to the number of eigenvalues that explained 90  95  and 98% of the GRM variation  respectively. To determine which number of eigenvalues maximizes the accuracy of genomic selection  they applied ssGBLUP with a GRM inverted by the algorithm for proven and young (APY) []  which computes a sparse generalized inverse while indirectly assuming  as derived in Misztal []. The accuracy of prediction was maximized for a range of  when the assumed dimensionality was approximately . However  the accuracy was only marginally lower when the assumed dimensionality was  or . Pocrnic et al. [] found similar results when analyzing field datasets for dairy and beef cattle  pigs  and chickens and estimated the  at ~ 10 000 to 15 000 in cattle and ~ 4000 in pigs and chickens. Although the theory of genomic prediction by chromosome segments is interesting  it seems to be incomplete. Assuming that all chromosome segments are independent and approximately of equal size  Daetwyler et al. [  ]  Goddard []  Goddard et al. [] presented several formulas to estimate accuracy of genomic selection based on heritability    and the size of the reference population. However  in a meta-analysis using field datasets  their formulas had little predictive power []. If all the segments had approximately the same size  assuming half the optimal dimensionality in the APY (the largest eigenvalues that explained 98% of the GRM variation/2) would lead to half the reliability compared with using full dimensionality. However  using half of the optimal number as core animals reduced the reliability by less than 2%  and using only a third of that number reduced the reliability by less than 5% [  ]. Therefore  the decrease in reliability was tiny with both simulated and field datasets. In Pocrnic et al. []  approximately 25% of the eigenvalues explained more than 90% of the genetic variation in the GRM. This suggests that genomic selection by GBLUP (and SNP BLUP) can also be seen as being based on estimates of eigenvalues of GRM. The first purpose of our study was to determine the distribution of eigenvalues in a GRM as well as the GBLUP accuracy when only the top eigenvalues of the GRM are considered. The second purpose was to determine if the optimum number of core animals in the APY algorithm is more related to the number of independent chromosome segments or to the number of top eigenvalues. Data for this study were generated using the QMSim software []. Each of the simulated scenarios was replicated five times. The initial historical population consisted of 1250 generations with a gradual decrease in size from 5000 to 1000 breeding individuals and then an increase to 25 015 breeding individuals with equal sex ratio  non-overlapping generations  random mating  no selection  and no migration  in order to create a bottleneck and initial linkage disequilibrium (LD) and to establish mutation-drift balance in the population. Then  10 discrete  recent generations with  of ~ 40 were simulated by random mating of 1000 females and 10 males per generation  which resulted in 6000 genotyped individuals in generations 8 to 10. Phenotypes for individuals from generations 8 and 9 were simulated with an overall mean as the only fixed effect and with assumed heritabilities of 0.1  0.3  0.6  and 0.9. Scenarios with a heritability of 0.6 were replicated by simulating half (3000) and twice (12 000) the number of genotyped animals. To keep  consistent across scenarios with increasing or decreasing numbers of animals  the number of breeding males per generation was fixed at 10. The simulated genome was assumed to have 10 chromosomes of equal length of 100 cM each; 3000 biallelic and randomly distributed QTL affected the trait  with allelic effects sampled from a gamma distribution as predefined in the QMSim software. The recurrent mutation rate of the markers and QTL was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 per locus per generation []. The first generation of the historic population had 50 000 evenly allocated biallelic SNPs with equal allele frequencies. GBLUP was used for the analysis with the following model  with  and   where  is a vector of phenotypes   is a simple mean   is a vector of animal effects   is a vector of residuals   is a GRM   is the additive variance set to result in the desired heritability  and  is the residual variance. GBLUP was run with three options for the GRM. For the first option  a standard GRM was constructed as in VanRaden []:  where  is a matrix of allele content centered for allele frequency and  is the allele frequency for marker . For the second option  a reduced-rank GRM was constructed based on   where  is a matrix of eigenvectors and  is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues arranged from the highest to the lowest value. Then  a GRM restricted to  eigenvalues and eigenvectors () was constructed as   where  includes only the  largest eigenvalues in . To enable inversion in GBLUP  0.01  was added to both  and  for full rank. This method is equivalent to using the largest singular values in the SNP-BLUP design matrix (). As a third option  the inverse of the GRM was derived using APY ( as in Misztal []:  where  and  designate core and noncore animals  respectively  in blocks of  and The inverse is sparse and requires only the dense inverse of the block of GRM for core animals. Standard GRM were calculated for the three populations (3000  6000  and 12 000 genotyped animals) and replicated five times. Then  the number of eigenvalues that explained approximately 10  30  50  70  90  95  and 98% of the variance in the GRM was computed; the fraction was defined as . Subsequent computations were performed only on the 6000-animal population. GBLUP was run using standard GRM (    and . For   the same number of eigenvalues as for  was used as number of core animals. Core animals were chosen randomly from all available genotypes. Two methods for assessing accuracy were applied. The first method calculated a realized accuracy as the correlation between the genomic estimated breeding value and the simulated breeding value for animals from the last generation without phenotypes. The second method was based on prediction error variance (PEV) that was calculated in a training set of animals. Validation was done on exactly the same animals as in the first method  but this time those animals were completely excluded from the GBLUP equations. The number of validation animals varied per scenario and was 1000  2000  or 4000. The accuracy for animal  () based on PEV is calculated as follows:  where  is the diagonal term of the inverse of the left-hand side of the mixed-model equations corresponding to animal . The same accuracy can be represented as:  where  is the ratio of residual to animal genetic () variance and  and  are the effective number of records per individual for phenotypic and genomic information  respectively [  ]; with one phenotype per animal  . If the amount of genomic information is calculated for animals with phenotypes only  the approximate accuracy for young animals from the same population but with no phenotypic information will be: where  is the average amount of genomic information based on a  of a training population and is common for all the validation animals. The  of a training population was based on PEV that are calculated by a direct inversion of the corresponding left-hand side of the mixed-model equation for training animals using the BLUPF90 software []. These two methods can be compared because they both result in a measure of accuracy based on the whole population rather than on individuals. Figure  shows the eigenvalue profiles for 3000  6000  and 12 000 genotyped animals. The number of eigenvalues that explained 30  50  70  90  95 and 98% of the total genomic variation ranged from 15 to 16  45 to 49  113 to 130  357 to 453  585 to 804  and 964 to 1495  respectively. Standard deviations across replicates were negligible. When varying the number of genotyped animals  the number of eigenvalues that explained a given percentage of the variance did not change much for lower percentages of explained variance  and the change was more marked for higher percentages. For lower percentages of explained variance (10 to 50%)  the number of eigenvalues was relatively small (3 to 50). For higher percentages  the number of eigenvalues was more variable. For example  the number of eigenvalues that explained 90% of the GRM variance ranged from about 900 for a population of 3000 genotyped animals to 1800 for 12 000 animals. Based on Stam []  Pocrnic et al. [] reported that approximately  eigenvalues explained 98% of the variance  but their study assumed a population much larger than   and the eigenvalue profile undergoes compression at higher percentages for smaller populations. The logarithm of the number of eigenvalues explaining 30 to 90% of the GRM variance increased almost linearly. Eigenvalue profiles for explained variance of the genomic relationship matrix (GRM). Eigenvalues are expressed as either the log of the number () or the number itself () for simulated populations of 3000  6000  and 12 000 genotyped animals The accuracy of GBLUP with the standard  increased with increased heritability as expected and was used as a benchmark for the  and  methods. Average accuracy (± standard error) values were 0.69 ± 0.03  0.79 ± 0.01  0.90 ± 0.01  and 0.96 ± 0.00 for heritabilities of 0.1  0.3  0.6  and 0.9  respectively. For a heritability of 0.6 and half the number of animals (3000)  average accuracy was reduced to 0.87 ± 0.01; with twice the number of animals (12 000) it increased to 0.92 ± 0.01. The accuracy of GBLUP with  relative to the percentage of explained GRM variance is shown in Fig.  and the corresponding number of eigenvalues in Fig.  for heritabilities of 0.1  0.3  and 0.9 for 6000 genotyped animals. For a heritability of 0.1  accuracy stops increasing at ~ 70% of the explained variance and for a heritability of 0.3  it stops increasing at ~ 90% of the explained variance. For a heritability of 0.9  it continues to improve up to 98% of the explained variance. For all heritabilities  accuracy at 98% of the explained GRM variance was the same as for GBLUP with a standard . Figure  shows the eigenvalues on a logarithmic scale for 6000 genotyped animals and heritabilities of 0.1  0.3  and 0.9 and includes points beyond which eigenvalues are smaller than the variance ratio a; details on the computation are provided in the . These eigenvalues are likely to affect accuracy  whereas smaller eigenvalues are likely to be ignored. For a heritability of 0.1  the point is approximately a log(eigenvalue) of 130  which corresponds to 70% of the explained GRM variance; the corresponding point is ~ 340 (< 90% of explained variance) for a heritability of 0.3 and ~ 1500 (98–99% of the explained variance) for a heritability of 0.9. These points correspond approximately to the points where the accuracy plateau is reached for  (Figs.  and ). The lower the heritability (or the smaller the effective information)  the fewer eigenvalues are considered  and subsequently the information included in the smaller eigenvalues is ignored. With a higher heritability  the information contained in smaller eigenvalues is included. Accuracy of the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) restricted by eigenvalues based on the percentage of explained GRM variance (EIG) and heritability (). Accuracy is measured as the correlation between genomic estimated breeding values obtained with EIG and simulated breeding values (TBV). Heritability () was 0.1  0.3  or 0.9 for a population of 6000 genotyped animals Accuracy of the genomic relationship matrix restricted by eigenvalues (EIG) based on number of eigenvalues and heritability (). Accuracy is measured as the correlation between genomic estimated breeding values obtained with EIG and simulated breeding values (TBV). Heritability () was 0.1  0.3  or 0.9 for a population of 6000 genotyped animals Relationship between logs of eigenvalues and numbers of eigenvalues for a population of 6000 genotyped animals. Specific curve points beyond which the eigenvalues are smaller than the ratio of residual to animal genetic variance are noted for heritabilities () of 0.1  0.3  and 0.9. The values shown after  are the number of eigenvalues at specific curve points and the variance ratios at given  The accuracy of GBLUP with  relative to the number of eigenvalues is shown in Fig.  for population sizes of 3000  6000  and 12 000 and a heritability of 0.6. For the largest population  accuracy is slightly lower at smaller numbers of eigenvalues and slightly higher for larger numbers of eigenvalues. In general  accuracy is expected to be higher with a larger population when a complete relationship matrix is used. However  the largest eigenvalues could correspond to the largest clusters of haplotypes  and those clusters can account for slightly more variation with smaller populations. Accuracy increases when genetically similar animals are part of the reference population; therefore  prediction accuracy for a large population with many animals for which both genotypes and phenotypes are available will improve by including additional information (e.g.  herd mates) in the reference population []. For all population sizes  differences in accuracy were small. When the amount of phenotypic information is sufficient to estimate the effects due to most of the eigenvalues  accuracy is high and improves little with additional data. Accuracy of the genomic relationship matrix restricted by eigenvalues (EIG) based on number of eigenvalues and population size. Accuracy is measured as the correlation between genomic estimated breeding values obtained with the EIG and simulated breeding values (TBV). Population size was 3000  6000  or 12 000 genotyped animals with a heritability of 0.6 Figure  shows the average accuracy of GBLUP with heritabilities of 0.3 and 0.9 for  and  using the same number of eigenvalues and core animals  respectively  for a population of 6000 genotyped animals. Accuracy is lower for  than for  at the number of eigenvalues corresponding to 70% of the explained variance but very similar at larger numbers. Using  eigenvalues is almost equivalent to assuming recursion with  animals. Therefore  animal effects for any  animals include almost the same information as the  largest eigenvalues. Sampling variance among the five replicates was larger with  than with   especially at smaller numbers. The choice of the core animals in the APY algorithm is critical when their number is small but not when it is large []. Accuracy of the genomic relationship matrix either restricted by eigenvalues (EIG) or with the inverse derived by using the algorithm for proven and young (APY) based on number of core animals []. Accuracy is measured as the correlation of simulated breeding values (TBV) with genomic estimated breeding values obtained with either EIG or APY. Heritability () was either 0.3 or 0.9 for a population of 6000 genotyped animals Validation methods used to assess accuracy of GBLUP are compared in Fig. . For all heritability levels  accuracy was slightly lower for the method based on average number of effective records than for realized accuracy. The difference was largest for a heritability of 0.3 and smallest for a heritability of 0.9. The method based on average number of effective records can be a useful and simple approximation for population accuracies of validation animals. Comparison of the correlation between genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) and simulated breeding values (TBV) with accuracy approximated from the average number of effective records. Heritability was 0.3  0.6  or 0.9  and the simulated population included 6000 genotyped animals In animal breeding programs  approximations of individual accuracy are of interest  but they cannot be derived by inversion because of the large amount of data. Although several approximations exist  those formulas are unclear when evaluations include genomic information [    ]. One possibility is to use eigenvalue decomposition of  (possible derivations are presented in the ). PEV from the direct inversion of the left-hand side of the mixed-model equation were compared with PEV from the eigenvalue decomposition of  using 2000  4000  and 8000 genotyped animals that were treated as training animals for validation with heritabilities of 0.1  0.3  0.6  and 0.9. For all scenarios  correlations were equal to 1. Meuwissen et al. [] reported a similar method for obtaining PEV using singular value decomposition for SNP BLUP. Approaches to approximate accuracy are experimental  and further research is needed to evaluate and incorporate these formulas beyond simple GBLUP  especially for ssGBLUP. It would be useful to derive new formulas on expected genomic accuracies given the heritabilities  the number of genotyped animals and population parameters. According to this study  such an accuracy depends on the fraction of variance explained by subsequent eigenvalues. We attempted to capture that fraction given different effective population sizes and genome lengths. Preliminary studies indicated that the biggest eigenvalues were not affected by genome length  the smallest eigenvalues were affected by population size and all eigenvalues were affected by effective population size. We plan to address this issue in a future study. The distribution of eigenvalues of the GRM is very uneven  with a small fraction of the largest eigenvalues explaining a large portion of the genetic variation. The accuracy of genomic selection by GBLUP depends on how many eigenvalues can be estimated well  given the amount of information. With a small amount of information  only the effects of the largest eigenvalues are considered  but that small number of eigenvalues can explain a large portion of the genetic variation. Consequently  genomic selection is moderately accurate even with a limited amount of genomic information  and accuracy only increases slowly with larger datasets. Accuracies obtained by GBLUP using the GRM with only  largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are similar to using the APY inverse of GRM with recursion on  animals. Subsequently   animals carry almost the same genomic information as the  largest eigenvalues. Selection by GBLUP is based on clusters of independent chromosome segments and not on individual independent chromosome segments.

However  we found a genetic lag that became significantly smaller as more breeding queens served as dams of queens in the passive population. We conclude that even when unwanted admixture of subspecies can be excluded in natural matings  controlled mating is imperative for successful breeding efforts. This is especially highlighted by the strong positive impact that controlled mating in the breeding population has on the unselected passive population. The beginning of the modern era of animal breeding owes everything to Sir Robert Bakewell (1725–1795). Sir Bakewell combined strict record-keeping with the intentional mating of closely related animals for the expression of desirable traits in the population. His breeding strategies proved successful and were soon copied across Europe and North America [  ]. An important factor in his success was the strict separation of male and female individuals except for mating  which took place under controlled conditions. Today  controlled mating is still a crucial factor in successful animal breeding. Species for which controlled mating is hard to achieve  such as aquaculture species  lag behind in breeding success partly for this reason [  ]. A lack of controlled mating is also a common inhibitory factor in successful animal breeding in developing countries [  ]. Modern breeding strategies  involving genetic evaluation  rely heavily on reliable pedigree data  further strengthening the importance of controlled mating []. In comparison with other agricultural species  controlled mating in the honeybee appears to be especially hard to achieve. A few days after hatching  a young honeybee queen will undertake one or several nuptial flights to drone congregation areas during which she mates in mid-air with an average of 12 drones from neighboring hives []. The exact number and origin of the drones cannot usually be observed []. The necessity of mating control became first apparent in the middle of the nineteenth century when the Italian honeybee () was introduced to Switzerland (1843)  Germany (1853)  and the United States (1860) [  ]. Previously  only the dark honeybee () had been maintained in these areas [  ]. In the middle of the nineteenth century  controlled mating was not seen as a means of selective breeding but rather a means of avoiding the newly introduced subspecies to cross with the native population []. Strategies for controlled mating involved unsuccessful efforts of tethering the queen or enclosing the queen and drones in a tent. Attempts to achieve controlled mating by delaying the flight time of queens and drones to avoid the time window of other drones’ natural flight were more successful [    ]. This practice  which has recently been rediscovered and became known as the Horner system  was occasionally used in Germany and the United States in the late nineteenth century [    ]. Mating control via geographic isolation of the queen and the desired drones on so-called isolated mating stations was first (unsuccessfully) attempted by T. C. von Baldenstein in Switzerland in 1848 []. During the end of the nineteenth century  this technique was repeatedly applied by Swiss beekeepers  mainly under the leadership of U. Kramer from Zurich [    ]. The concept of isolated mating stations has henceforth been developed further and is very popular in Central European honeybee breeding to this day []. The first reports of successful artificial inseminations of honeybee queens date back to the late nineteenth century. During the 1940s and 1950s  artificial insemination was further developed into a practical tool in economic bee breeding and is still used today [    ]. Controlled matings allowed beekeepers to keep accurate stud books including pedigree and performance information for use in directional breeding. The systematic collection of such data was introduced in Germany around 1950 [  ]. In 1994  the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) methodology [] was adapted to the honeybee [] and has since yielded significant genetic improvement in all selection traits []. In the course of the SmartBees project []  breeding efforts have begun in numerous European countries after the development of standardized performance testing protocols [  ]. To date  infrastructure for controlled mating has not been created in many European regions and its introduction will be connected with considerable logistic efforts. As most local breeders have not had any experience with controlled mating so far  it is unclear how willingly they are going to invest in these extra expenditures. Therefore the following question arises: is successful breeding possible without controlled mating by selecting dam queens only? In this context  it might be beneficial for a breeder to distribute colonies from her/his own stock among the neighboring beekeepers to increase the probability of his/her own queens mating with drones carrying good genetic material. In this study  we compare the genetic progress in honeybee populations undergoing selection with either free mating or mating on isolated mating stations. The uncontrolled mating procedure makes it necessary to consider an unselected passive population besides the breeding population and the possible exchange of queens and drones between the populations. In addition to the genetic progress in the breeding population  this set-up also allows for further investigations on the individual contribution of maternal and direct effects under various breeding conditions. Furthermore  we examined how breeding and passive population affect each other and in particular  how the passive population can benefit from changes in the breeding population. The situation of two or more partially connected populations following different selection principles has previously been studied in other agricultural species in the context of nucleus breeding schemes both theoretically [  ] and by simulations [  ]. However  to our knowledge  there has been no such study for the honeybee with its biological peculiarities. Furthermore  none of the studies we are aware of explicitly explored the role of controlled mating in animal breeding schemes. We used the program BeeSim [] to simulate the construction of honeybee populations consisting of queens and their workers as well as drones. All simulated queens belonged to one of three mutually exclusive categories: Breeding queens (BQ) were queens whose colonies underwent performance tests and that were subject to selection. Drone producing queens (DPQ) were queens that produced the drones with which BQ could mate on a mating station. Passive queens (PQ) formed the unselected passive population. They did not undergo any performance testing  breeding value estimation or selection procedure. We simulated various population sizes of the breeding population and passive population. We assumed that the numbers of BQ and PQ born in each year were constant and referred to those numbers as  and   respectively. We considered the values     and   as well as         and . In the case of controlled mating  we considered different numbers  of mating stations. In particular  we simulated     or  mating stations per year  each equipped with a sister group of eight DPQ. By stating that   we indicate that no controlled mating took place. Mating stations correspond with sires in other species [    ]; the relatively small values for  are realistic due to the large logistic efforts of station maintenance. All dams of breeding queens were necessarily breeding queens themselves. However  for the passive population we assumed that PQ could have dams from either population and considered different relative proportions  of PQ that had a dam from the breeding population. We simulated the different rates         and . We selected for a directly (worker group) and maternally (queen) affected quantitative trait with an additive maternal genetic variance of   an additive direct variance of   and a residual variance of . We chose two different values for the correlation between the effects: one set of simulations was run with a medium negative correlation of  (i.e. covariance ) and another set with a stronger negative correlation of  (). These numbers correspond to maternal and direct heritabilities of    in the case of   and    in the case of  (see [] for a detailed description of the calculation of heritabilities for honeybees  where the direct effect reflects the mean of the worker group). The chosen numbers roughly represent those reported in the literature for parameter estimates for economically important traits such as honey yield or swarming behavior [  ]. All possible combinations of the parameters         and  were simulated separately over the course of 20 years and repeated 100 times in order to obtain stable results. An exception formed the parameter choices  and   which were only simulated in combination with   leading to a total number of 408 simulation settings (see Table ). The animals’ genetics were simulated for a directly and maternally influenced trait according to an infinitesimal model that accounts for the haploid nature of drones. Queens of the base population were equipped with direct and maternal true breeding values following a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance  given by     and . The inheritance of true breeding values from a queen  to a drone  was realized as: and from a queen  and drone  to an offspring queen  as: Hereby   denotes the inbreeding coefficient of  and  denotes a -distributed Mendelian sample term. Finally  worker groups obtained their breeding values as the mean value of their queen’s TBV and the average TBV of their sire drones. See [] for a detailed description of the infinitesimal model for honeybees. When mating took place in a controlled manner  the breeding population was simulated as described in []  i.e.  each breeding queen produced a worker group and underwent performance testing. Furthermore  each year the best 20% of 2-year-old breeding queens based on a BLUP evaluation were selected as dams and each produced five breeding queens as offspring. The  best three-year-old queens each produced a sister group as set-up for a mating station on which the newly created queens were mated with 12 drones each. In the case of uncontrolled matings  breeding queens mated with 12 drones whose dams  one to three years old  were picked randomly from the entire (i.e. breeding and passive) population. Contrary to usual beekeeping practice  we did not simulate any culling or other exclusions of queens  so that one  two and three year old queens were equally represented among the dams of the drones. Thus  the probability of a drone in such a mating to come from a breeding colony was . In the case of an infinite passive population  the dams of the drones were selected exclusively from the passive population. Also when matings were uncontrolled  a BLUP evaluation was performed each year and the best 20% of breeding queens were selected to produce five daughters each. Regardless of the mating procedure  the true breeding values were passed according to Eqs.  and . However  when the inverse additive relationship matrix for the BLUP evaluations was calculated  only the information that is available in reality was taken into account. In particular  with uncontrolled mating  all sires were assumed to be unknown. The inverse additive relationship matrix was calculated with the bee specific approach of [] following the ideas of []  which combines the classical inversion strategy of Henderson [] with the bee specific properties of haploid drones while considering the complex situation on mating stations. After being generated  each queen of the passive population mated with 12 drones whose dams  one to three years old  were picked randomly from the entire (i.e. breeding and passive) population. Thus  the probability that a drone in such a mating comes from a breeding colony was also   as in a breeding population without controlled mating. When it came to generating new passive queens  a relative proportion  of these was created as offspring of randomly chosen BQ one to three years old. For the remaining passive queens  a dam was randomly selected among the passive queens one to three years old. The maternal generation interval for the passive queens was thus chosen to be more variable than that of the breeding population since these colonies do not have to follow the somewhat strict schedule of performance testing and subsequent selection. The passive population was not included in the BLUP breeding value estimation and no worker groups were simulated for the passive queens. However  queens and drones from the passive population did inherit and pass on true breeding values. Unlike the finite passive populations  the infinite passive population was not explicitly simulated. We assumed that  in an infinite passive population which does not receive any queens from the breeding population ()  the passive population would not undergo any genetic changes due to selection efforts in the breeding population. Thus  the passive population was only needed when breeding queens were left to mate without control. For that purpose  drones were created as if they belonged to the base population. We investigated how the queens’ true breeding values changed over the course of 20 years. In all simulated settings  the average true breeding value in the first two years was close to zero  since the breeding queens of these years formed the base population. In years 3 to 5  a genetic response was observed. We defined the total breeding value of a queen as the sum of her direct and maternal breeding values. In the models with a moderately negative correlation between direct and maternal effects    the accumulated gain in total breeding values of queens in year 5 was between 0.63 and 0.81 units with little differences between the population sizes and breeding schemes. With a strong negative correlation    a genetic response of 0.12 to 0.23 units could be accumulated by year 5. In both cases  settings with controlled mating performed slightly better. After the first five years  genetic gain increased nearly linearly in all settings. However  the rate of genetic improvement varied drastically among the different set-ups. On average  without controlled mating  the genetic gain from year 5 to year 20  measured in total breeding values of queens  was 75% lower than with controlled mating. Based on the individual setting  the range of reduction in breeding success was from 47 to 99% (see Fig. ). Genetic response with and without controlled mating. Genetic response to selection over the course of 20 years with a moderate () and strong () negative correlation between maternal and direct effects. Results are shown for a breeding population of 1000 colonies per year and various passive population sizes with (solid blue line) and without (dotted red lines) controlled mating. The passive population did not receive any dams from the breeding population () While all breeding schemes with uncontrolled mating performed significantly worse than their counterparts with controlled mating  the difference was more marked  when the ratio between BQ and PQ was small (see Fig.   Table ). The data suggest  that  without controlled mating  breeding success depends linearly on the relative proportion  of BQ in the total population  i.e. . The correlation between this value and the genetic gain between years 5 and 20 was 0.993 for  and 0.996 for . When parts of the passive queen population had dams from the breeding population ()  the genetic response without controlled mating could be slightly improved. The improvements in genetic gain due to positive values of  were stronger when the breeding population was small compared to the passive population: in the setting with 500 BQ and 2000 PQ the breeding success was roughly doubled from  to   whereas in the setting with 2000 BQ and 500 PQ  there was only an improvement of between 7 and 8%. In no case  however  could the improvement of genetic gain due to  make up for the negative effects of the lack of controlled mating (see Table ). When mating took place in a controlled manner  the realized number of mating stations had only a minor effect on the genetic gain after 20 years (see Table ). Different numbers of mating stations caused deviations of up to 4.8% in the simulations with a moderately negative correlation between direct and maternal effects. In the simulations with a strong negative correlation  the deviations ranged up to 10.5%. There was no clear indication for an ideal number of mating stations. Traits with a stronger negative correlation () tended to prefer more mating stations than traits with a moderate negative correlation (). Different simulation settings not only led to different genetic gains in total breeding values  but also had great impact on the subdivision of total genetic gain into direct and maternal genetic gain (see Fig. ). In the following two paragraphs  we describe the progress for controlled and uncontrolled matings  separately. Genetic response for direct and maternal effects. Genetic response to selection of maternal and direct effects over the course of 20 years with a moderate () and strong () negative correlation between maternal and direct effects. Results are shown for a breeding population of 1000 colonies per year and various passive population sizes with (solid blue line) and without (dotted red lines) controlled mating. The passive population did not receive any dams from the breeding population () In simulations with controlled mating  the genetic gain for the direct effects was greater than for the maternal effects. When the correlation between direct and maternal effects was moderate ()  the ratio between direct and maternal genetic gain from years 5 to 20 was between 2.01 and 2.88. Larger numbers of mating stations led to a stronger selection focus on direct effects. A strong negative correlation () even led to negative selection on maternal effects. However  the negative change in the maternal effects was outweighed by positive selection on direct effects by a factor between 2.77 and 5.07. Here  the selection on direct effects was stronger  when there were fewer mating stations. With uncontrolled mating  the selection focus switched to the maternal effects. With a moderate negative correlation  the ratio between maternal and direct gain was between 1.29 and 1.60 without clear dependencies on population sizes or relative proportion of passive queens with breeding queen dams (). A strong negative correlation () yielded a slightly negative selection on direct effects  which was outweighed by the gain in the maternal effects by a factor between 2.46 and 3.39. Again  no clear dependencies could be detected. All finite passive populations showed a positive genetic response which was delayed in time compared to the breeding population. When breeding queens served as dams for at least half of the passive queens ()  the genetic difference between breeding and passive population remained constant after a few years (see Fig. ). For  and controlled mating conditions in the breeding population  the passive population stayed between 1.47 and 2.03 years behind the breeding population in terms of genetic gain. The time delay was shorter for smaller breeding populations. When  was reduced to 0.5  it took the passive population between 3.17 and 4.24 years to reach the level of the breeding population. Here  smaller passive populations led to a smaller gap between the breeding values of the respective populations. Under uncontrolled mating conditions for the breeding population  the time difference in genetic gain increased to between 3.26 and 5.16 years for   respectively to between 4.56 and 8.67 years for . For values of  and in particular for   i.e. no breeding queen dams for the passive population  the genetic gain of the passive population was slower than that of the breeding population throughout the entire 20 years. However  in these cases the genetic response in the passive population was superlinear over the entire 20 years. Thus  it is expected that the passive population will also reach the rates of genetic gain of the breeding population  but only well after 20 years. Genetic response in the passive population. Genetic response to selection in the breeding and passive populations over the course of 20 years with a moderate () negative correlation between maternal and direct effects. Results are shown for a breeding population with (left hand side) or without (right hand side) controlled mating  different population sizes and different relative proportions of passive queens with breeding queen dams () Simulation studies in animal breeding mostly rely on either Fisher’s infinitesimal model [  ] or on finite locus models []. Previously  we have shown in the context of honeybee breeding that long-term simulation studies based on finite locus models are more reliable than those that use the infinitesimal model []. However  in the same study  we also showed that for studies that do not exceed the timeframe of 20 years  either model works equally well. Thus  we decided to use the infinitesimal model because it has fewer levels of freedom and therefore needs fewer repetitions of the simulations to obtain stable results. The simulated time of 20 years  i.e. 10 maternal generations  is rather short for an investigation of strategies in animal breeding [  ]. However  such limited time frames are not without examples [  ] and may even be long considering the objectives of individual breeders. In the long term  breeding schemes with uncontrolled mating will generate lower rates of inbreeding and thus a reduced loss of genetic variance. However  promising mating schemes in animal breeding that aim at avoiding high inbreeding rates  such as optimum contribution selection  generally do not compromise genetic gain to a large extent [  ]. Based on our current findings  it is already clear that this is not the case for uncontrolled mating of honeybees. In order to hint at the long-term effects of controlled and uncontrolled mating  we conducted a small-scale simulation with 20 repetitions over the course of 100 years. (see Fig. ) In this simulation  we chose the parameters       and  and uncontrolled mating () or controlled mating on  mating stations. As a genetic model  we chose a finite locus model with 400 unlinked loci as is described in []. After 100 years  the genetic response in the simulation without controlled mating was reduced by 43% in comparison to the controlled mating scheme. Without controlled mating  the initial standard deviation was reduced by only 24% (63% with controlled mating). In another simulation  we reduced the loss of genetic standard deviation under controlled mating by increasing the number of mating stations to 50 and selecting 50% of all breeding queens as dams (as opposed to 20% in the rest of our simulations). By this means  we could decrease the loss of genetic standard deviation from 63 to 43% while the genetic response after 100 years decreased by only 5%. We expect that an implementation of more sophisticated selection strategies  such as optimum contribution selection []  can yield high response rates with even smaller reductions of variance. Thus  in our opinion renouncing controlled mating is a clearly inferior breeding practice for honeybees  also in the long term. Genetic change over 100 years. Genetic response to selection (left hand side) and evolution of genetic standard deviation (right hand side) over the course of 100 years with a moderate () negative correlation between maternal and direct effects. Results are shown for a breeding population of 500 colonies and a passive population of 1000 colonies per year with (blue lines) and without (dotted red line) controlled mating. Controlled mating was performed with two different selection intensities: 20 mating stations and the best 20% of BQ selected as dams (solid blue line) of 50 mating stations and the best 50% of BQ selected as dams. We assumed  In the honeybee  resistance to the parasitic  mite is a trait that is often regarded to be a fitness advantage [  ] and some breeding strategies rely on the assumption that drones from resistant colonies are more likely to reproduce than those from susceptible colonies [  ]. Other commercial quantitative traits in the honeybee  such as honey production or gentleness  appear to have negligible implications on colony fitness. In our studies  we assumed an absence of natural selection against or in favor of the simulated trait and thus that our simulations accurately describe the situation for most commercial traits. For the  resistance trait  the absence of controlled mating may be less inferior than our simulations suggest since in uncontrolled matings resistant drones also have a fitness advantage over susceptible drones. In small populations  the so-called tolerance mating stations as they are described in [  ] may be a promising alternative to classical mating stations for this trait. In our simulations  all queens between one and three years old had the same chance of being the dam of a drone involved in an uncontrolled mating  and the number of queens was the same in each age group. Similarly  the dams of passive queens were chosen randomly from queens one to three years old. In reality  there will be more younger queens because several queens will not reach three years of age due to illnesses  colony losses or requeening practice [  ]. Furthermore  it is likely that in reality  the queen-to-queen generation interval in the passive population will be larger than in the breeding population because in the passive population there is no urge to rapidly improve the genetic material. This effect will become even stronger in the future due to the possibilities of shorter generation intervals due to genomic selection [  ]. However  this study aimed at investigating the implications of controlled mating on breeding success. In order to be able to quantify its effects  we avoided intermingling them with other factors such as age structures or generation intervals. The fact that queens of all ages are equally represented leads to an average queen-to-queen generation interval in the passive population of two years  which equals the queen-to-queen interval in the breeding population. This facilitates the comparison between the breeding and passive populations. Simulation studies with realistic age structures and generation intervals would require a detailed knowledge of the behavior of beekeepers of the passive population. However  due to the nature of the passive population  no such data is available. In areas where beekeeping is mainly carried out by large commercial operators  procedures are likely to be highly standardized. However  the diverse structure of beekeeping in Europe with many recreational beekeepers suggests a wide variety in individual practices. Nevertheless  we expect that realistic simulations would lead to results that are similar to those presented here. In accordance with most of the literature on bee breeding  the sum of the direct and maternal breeding values of a worker group served as the selection criterion in the present simulations. This value is generally chosen since it represents the expected genetic properties of an unmated queen offspring of the colony [    ]. However after simulation  when we investigated the change in the genetic response in the population  we chose the sum of the direct and maternal breeding values of a queen as the total breeding value. This choice has the advantage that it allows comparing genetic progress between breeding and passive populations even though PQ are generally simulated without worker groups. Based on our previous work  []  the selection criterion and the total breeding value as defined here generally show the same behavior. The present definition of total breeding values has previously been used in []. The linear genetic progress is in line with other breeding simulations in the literature [  ]. Furthermore  the rate of genetic gain in a trait with a moderate negative correlation between direct and maternal effects () under controlled mating conditions is similar to the results in []. To our knowledge  these are the first simulation studies on breeding strategies without mating control. We found that the absence of controlled mating clearly impaired genetic progress in all settings in two ways. First  it allows only for inaccurate calculations of relationships and therefore leads to a less reliable BLUP-based breeding value estimation []. Second  it does not allow for selection on the paternal path and the genetic progress will continuously be hampered by queens that mate with genetically inferior drones from the breeding or passive population. Since the drones in the passive population can not or only indirectly benefit from the breeding efforts  the risk of queens mating with undesired genetic material increases with the relative proportion of PQ in the population. The high correlation rates between the relative proportion of BQ in the population and the rate of genetic gain indicate that the impact of genetically inferior drones is the prevalent factor. If breeders give away virgin queens to the passive population ()  this improves the average genetics of the passive population. However  this affects the breeding population only whenever a BQ mates with a drone from the passive population. This explains  why the positive influence of a positive  value was especially high  when the passive population was relatively large. The improvements in the breeding population due to  were generally small  which has its reason in the indirect nature of the effect. The situation of  can be compared to nucleus breeding programs in other agricultural species  where nucleus-born individuals are disseminated to the base population. In a related setting (albeit with controlled matings with sires of the base population)  James [] also derived a small positive influence of such practices. In the case of uncontrolled mating with an infinite passive population that did not receive queens from the breeding population ()  there was little extra genetic gain after a few years (see Fig.   Table ). This may seem surprising at first sight as one might think that the selection of superior dam queens would have to lead to at least some improvement. However  there is a theoretical explanation to this effect as described below. Let  be the average breeding value of the breeding population in year . Then  since we assumed an absence of selection in the passive population and that it cannot benefit from the breeding population (  )  the average breeding value of the infinite passive population remains constant . Furthermore  we assumed that the average breeding value of the selected breeding queens in year  is  and that  is bounded for all years. Now  once the average breeding value of the breeding population has improved by this upper bound   we obtain  for the next generation  the average of the selected queens of year  and the drones from the passive population. I.e.  Thus  the average breeding value of the breeding population will never exceed the maximum superiority  of selected dam queens. Several honeybee breeding experiments without controlled mating have been performed to improve the hygienic behavior of workers but the results of these studies are ambiguous. While [] found only small improvements over five generations  other studies have shown short-term breeding success without controlled mating in the selection for hygienic behavior [  ]. but did not investigate if the initial rate of genetic improvement after one generation could be maintained over longer periods of time. In fact  the results of [] show an initial improvement in the first two years but stagnation afterwards. Like []  our simulation studies indicated an initial breeding success under uncontrolled conditions that was only slightly inferior to selection with controlled mating. However  our simulations show that this initial genetic improvement in the first few years cannot be held up in the middle and long term. In this study  we did not assume that genetic transfer between the breeding and passive populations has any implications beyond the influence on an unspecified trait. This would be the case if breeding and passive populations are genetically similar  i.e.  belong to the same subspecies. In practice  however  many of the newly established bee breeding programs in Europe are confronted with the situation that the native population is heavily endangered by admixture due to the introduction of foreign honeybee subspecies [  ]. Besides the moral aspect of conserving native subspecies  there are also economical reasons to prevent admixture  as it has been observed that hybrids show increased aggressive behavior and native subspecies generally have fitness advantages due to local adaptation []. In areas  where there is a risk of crossing between subspecies  controlled mating is crucial beyond reasons of breeding progress [  ]. In regions that do not provide the necessary geographical features for secure mating stations  artificial insemination can be a practicable alternative []. Furthermore  alternative strategies for controlled mating  using time shifts in the nuptial flights  have shown promising results [  ]. The preferred selection for direct effects under controlled mating conditions is in line with the results of [] and can be explained by the larger direct additive genetic variance. Negative selection on maternal effects when they are strongly negatively correlated with the direct effects has been shown in simulation studies for other agricultural species [  ]. The role of the number of mating stations  which corresponds to the number of sires in other species  can be explained as follows. On the one hand  a small number of mating stations implies a strong selection on the paternal side  which will influence the direct breeding values of the tested worker groups positively. On the other hand  a larger number of mating stations leads to higher genetic diversity in the sires and thus in the direct effects of the worker groups. This increases the accuracy of the estimation of direct breeding values []. Traits with a low negative correlation between direct and maternal effects generally have higher total heritabilities and therefore more accurate breeding values and can thus benefit from an intense selection scheme. In comparison  traits for which direct and maternal effects are strongly negatively correlated need a larger number of sires for an accurate estimation of breeding values. While maternal effects are expressed directly in the BQ that are to be selected  their direct breeding values can only be deduced via relationship information to their worker groups. This relationship information is far less accurate when uncontrolled mating is applied  which explains the stronger focus on maternal effects. This means  that a part of the reduced genetic gain in selection schemes without controlled mating is also caused by the fact that the direct breeding values cannot be assessed accurately. Therefore  the selection focus is shifted from the ideal mixture of direct and maternal effects and concentrates too strongly on the maternal effects. The genetic progress in the breeding schemes with controlled mating indicate that with a strong negative correlation between direct and maternal effects it may be ideal to sacrifice the maternal effects in order to overcompensate the maternal genetic loss with gains in the direct effect. When the negative correlation is lower  a positive selection on both effects appears favorable. Future research on how an ideal weighting of the loci under selection on direct and maternal effects depends on their (co-)variances is of great interest. A negative selection on maternal effects may lead to practical difficulties  even when it is overcompensated by direct genetic gain. It makes the queen more dependent on her own workers which may lead to problems in the practice of queen replacement [  ]. However  in practical breeding programs  no negative change of either effect has been observed so far [  ]. The genetic parameters in our simulations may appear somewhat extreme. In particular  a negative correlation between effects of  may be seen as too strong and heritabilities of the considered traits are high. We decided to use these parameters because they reflect the estimates that were obtained for economically relevant traits such as honey production or swarming behavior [  ]. Negative genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects have repeatedly been estimated for other farm animals and  in some cases  reached or exceeded values around - 0.9 [  ]. Estimation of parameters for honeybees is particularly difficult because each queen has only one worker group as offspring that can be used to separate direct effects from maternal effects. In a study on sheep  Maniatis and Pollott showed  that unreasonably strong negative correlations between effects can be estimated when the number of offspring per dam is small and performance data are missing []. However  honeybee simulation studies have shown that genetic parameters for honeybees can be estimated without bias []. In []  honeybee breeding simulations with a weaker genetic correlation of  were implemented and showed only quantitative rather than qualitative differences to those with . Thus  we believe that the key results of the present work also hold true if the real correlation between direct and maternal effects is lower than we assumed. In addition  it is most likely that although the breeding values will be estimated with the wrong parameters it will not have a big impact []. Traits with indirect genetic effects often show particularly high heritabilities which are caused by the negative correlation between effects. In extreme cases  the genetic variance for individual effects may exceed the phenotypic variance  leading to heritabilities higher than 1  which are impossible in classical theory without indirect effects []. In honeybees  this effect is further strengthened by the fact that the direct effect is shown in a collective rather than a single individual  which causes further reduction of the phenotypic variance []. Therefore  it is recommended to be cautious when deriving implications from high heritabilities in honeybee traits. For example  Brascamp et al. [] have reported that despite high heritabilities  the selection differentials in honeybee breeding schemes can be seen as low. To our knowledge  these are the first simulations that investigate the influence of breeding programs on the surrounding unselected population in any agricultural species. However  nucleus breeding programs with interdependent populations have been studied. In these breeding programs  an eventually parallel genetic contribution in the populations has been predicted theoretically [] and observed in simulations []. Therefore  the parallel genetic progress of breeding and passive populations that was observed for  can also be assumed in the case of a maternally self-sufficient passive population when a timeframe of more than 20 years is taken into account. It points out that decisions for the breeding population may have severe consequences for the entire population since they inevitably influence the genetic changes in the passive population with a delay in time. It clearly marks the importance of breeders who use controlled mating  since they will pave the way for the genetic improvement of the entire population. The results indicate that it is advantageous for beekeepers without breeding ambitions to obtain their queens from active breeders because it lets them benefit from the breeding activities with a shorter time delay. Our simulation study shows that controlled mating is crucial to generate genetic response over several generations. Especially in regions where breeders form a minority among the beekeepers  as it is mostly the case  controlled mating is absolutely mandatory. Moreover  depending on the exchange rates of queens and drones  the passive population can also benefit greatly from a controlled mating of BQ. Thus  applying controlled mating does not only mean a personal advantage for individual breeders but is also important for the genetic progress of the passive population.

Meanwhile  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo failed to converge with a simple univariate model for pig data. Thus  it might be difficult to use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for usual complex models in animal breeding. In the 1980s  Gianola and Foulley [] and Gianola and Fernando [] introduced Bayesian inference methods to animal breeding. Although Bayesian methods were theoretically powerful  they encountered difficulties in mathematical computation. Bayesian methods usually led to formulas in which multiple integrals had to be solved in order to obtain the marginal posterior distributions that are used for a complete Bayesian inference. These computation problems were solved by applying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods  which could simulate direct draws from target posterior distributions without analytically solving multiple integrals. Accordingly  MCMC methods were introduced to quantitative genetics in the early 1990s [  ] and enabled the widespread use of Bayesian methods in animal breeding. One of the most general MCMC methods is the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm. MH simulates candidate samples from arbitrary proposal distributions that are approximations of the target distribution  and then corrects for the bias by stochastically accepting or rejecting the proposal to satisfy the detailed balance. In MCMC  choosing an appropriate proposal distribution is a critical issue to accelerate convergence with the smallest number of samples. However  the choice is problem-dependent. Gibbs sampling (GS) [  ] is another MCMC method and is a special case of MH. GS repeatedly samples from the conditional distribution of one variable of the target distribution when all the other variables are given []. GS is frequently used in practice because a proposal distribution does not need to be designed and the procedure is simple to program. However  GS cannot be applied to complex models in which growth curve parameters and environmental variance are under genetic control [  ]  because conditional distributions cannot be derived in such models. In this context  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is an increasingly popular alternative MCMC method. HMC adopts Hamiltonian dynamics in physics to propose future states in the Markov chain. Hamiltonian dynamics in HMC allows the Markov chain to simulate arbitrarily long trajectories in parameter space around the target distribution. Thus  HMC can theoretically generate samples from a wide range of parameter space with a high level of acceptance probability. However  the success of HMC is due to geometric numerical integration of Hamiltonian dynamics  which is markedly affected by the two hyperparameters. A poor choice of parameters decreases the efficiency of HMC dramatically []. To mitigate the challenges of tuning the abovementioned hyperparameters  Hoffman and Gelman developed the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) []. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to automatically tune the HMC algorithm without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. NUTS algorithms have recently been packaged into Stan (a probabilistic programming language) [  ] and the BGLIMM procedure in SAS. Stan is used in social science []  pharmaceutical statistics []  and ecology among others []. GS is widely used to estimate genetic parameters and breeding values. Although HMC and NUTS are also prospective methods for animal breeding  these methods have not yet been applied in this field. Therefore  this study compared the performance of GS  HMC  and NUTS for estimating genetic parameters and breeding values with both simulated and real pig data. HMC is a variation of the Metropolis algorithm that uses Hamiltonian dynamics to create proposals. In a physical system  the Hamiltonian () is defined as follows: where  and  are the potential and kinetic energies  respectively. The property of the dynamics is that it keeps the  invariant. When estimating a random variable  with probability density function  in the HMC method  we define an auxiliary momentum variable  that follows a normal distribution:   where  is interpreted as a covariance matrix in statistics. The joint density function of  has the following form: In HMC   and  are defined as  and   respectively. Thus  the joint density function of  can be rewritten as follows: HMC generates samples  from this joint distribution  and then we can obtain the samples from the target distribution by picking up only . According to Hamiltonian dynamics  the samples are moved while maintaining the total energy  which is described by the following two differential equations  a so-called Hamilton’s equation: where  is the fictitious time. However  there is no analytical solution for Hamilton’s equation; therefore  Hamiltonian dynamics is usually approximated in a discrete time setting to enable computer implementation. The discretization integration for HMC generally uses the leapfrog method  which provides a good approximation for Hamiltonian dynamics. The leapfrog method can preserve the two important properties for Hamiltonian dynamics  “reversibility” and “volume preservation ” which rely on the use of MCMC updates []. The leapfrog integration proceeds as follows: where  is the integration step size and  is the time (). These integration steps are replicated until  reaches   which is the number of integration steps in the leapfrog method. For one integration step  we start with a half-step for   then perform a full step for   using the new values for . Starting from the state   the proposal state  is reached via  steps of step size  in the leapfrog method. In the leapfrog method   is not exactly conserved because of the integration error caused by the time discretization. Therefore  a Metropolis correction step is necessary to ensure correct sampling. In this correction step  the proposed state  is accepted as the next state of the Markov chain with the following probability:  which corresponds to the Metropolis–Hasting acceptance probability. If the integration errors in  remain small during the integration  HMC will achieve a high level of acceptance probability. The difficult point of HMC is that the sampling efficiency relies heavily on tunings for the two user-defined hyper parameters:  and  []. On the one hand  a large value of  leads to a low acceptance rate due to an increase of the integration error by the leapfrog integration. In contrast  if  is too small  a long computation time will be needed to obtain the adequate trajectory length. On the other hand  the number of steps  affects sampling efficiency; if  is too small  samples generated by HMC show quite high autocorrelations between successive iterations. In contrast  a large  leads to a large trajectory length  which may move the parameters back to their original states. NUTS automatically selects an appropriate value for  in each iteration in order to maximize the distance at each leapfrog step and avoid random-walk behavior. Let  be half the squared distance between the current position  and the initial position  at each leapfrog step. The aim is to run leapfrog steps until  starts to move back towards   which is accomplished by the following algorithm  in which leapfrog steps are run until the derivative of  with respect to time becomes less than 0: However  this algorithm does not guarantee “reversibility” or convergence to the correct distribution. NUTS overcomes this problem by applying a doubling method for slice sampling []. Slice sampling is an MCMC method for sampling from a probability distribution. To obtain samples of  from the target distribution   we introduce an auxiliary variable  and a joint distribution . This joint distribution is defined as follows: where  and  is a kernel of . The marginal distribution of  is as follows: Therefore  we can sample  from the target distribution by sampling from   and then ignoring . In slice sampling  these procedures are accomplished by alternately sampling  and . In the first step  we fix  and sample  uniformly to satisfy : Then  we fix  and sample  uniformly from the horizontal sliced region  defined by: In the slice sampling algorithm  the challenge is to find the bounds of . Therefore  Neal [] proposed a doubling method in which the size of an initial segment containing the current value of  is randomly chosen and the segment is expanded by doubling its size until the endpoints are outside . The expanding directions are randomly chosen from forward or backward. A subset of candidate  is obtained from the segment generated by the doubling process. NUTS begins by introducing  with the following uniform distribution: NUTS generates a finite set of all  by repeatedly doubling its size. Doubling proceeds by randomly taking forward and backward leapfrog steps to satisfy time reversibility. The doubling process is stopped to satisfy the following: where    and    are the leftmost and rightmost    of all  generated by the doubling process  respectively. Here  let  be a subset of candidate  states. In NUTS   is selected from the  generated by the doubling process to satisfy the following: The next values of  are sampled uniformly from . To further improve this algorithm  Hoffman and Gelman [] used the following sophisticated transition kernel in each step of doubling: where  is 1 if the expression in brackets is true and 0 if it is false   is the subset of  added by the last step of doubling  and  is the disjoint subset of  such that  and . This transition kernel  proposes a move from  to a random state in   and accepts the move with probability . In leapfrog steps   permits memory-efficient implementation and produces larger jumps on average than simple uniform sampling. The efficient implementation of NUTS relies on the acceptance probability. When the acceptance probability is too high  the step size is small  resulting in many leapfrog steps being needed to generate subset . Hoffman and Gelman [] reported that an acceptance probability of 0.6 was the optimal balance. NUTS can automatically choose a step size that achieves an acceptance probability around the desired level []  which is one of the stochastic optimizations. The process of tuning  for the th iteration of a Markov chain in NUTS is as follows: where  is an actual acceptance probability for the th iteration   is a desired average acceptance probability   is a freely chosen point that the iterated  shrink towards   is a free parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage towards   and  is a free parameter that dampens early exploration. Hoffman and Gelman [] introduced  and set   which give a bigger weight to more recent iterates. They recommend setting  and . This algorithm guarantees that . In NUTS   is tuned during the predetermined warm-up phase and is fixed thereafter. Because NUTS chooses  from multiple candidates  an alternative statistic to Metropolis acceptance probability must be defined. For each iteration  the acceptance probability is calculated as follows: where  and  are the candidates   and  are initial values  and  is the set of all states explored during the final doubling for the th iteration of the Markov chain. The sampling procedure by NUTS is summarized as follows: Set the initial value of    and values of         . Generate momentum  from the standard normal distribution . Generate auxiliary variable  from the uniform distribution . Generate  by using the doubling method with transition kernel . Accept the proposal  with probability  at the th iteration. Update  by dual averaging. Repeat steps (2) to (6). Note that step (6) is repeated only during the warm-up phase. For a precise definition and a pseudocode of the NUTS algorithm  see Hoffman and Gelman []. The following univariate linear mixed model was used: where  is the observation vector (: number of records)   is the vector of fixed effects (: number of fixed effects)   is the vector of direct additive genetic effects (: number of animals)  and  is the vector of residuals;  and  denote the incidence matrices relating the observations to the corresponding fixed and random effects. The likelihood of the model and prior distributions for  can be specified as  and   respectively  where  denotes the pedigree-based additive genetic relationship matrix  and  and  are the variances for  and   respectively. The prior distribution for  is assumed to be a uniform distribution. Partial derivatives for log posterior  with respect to each parameter are required in leapfrog procedures in HMC or NUTS. Here  let  be the vector of parameters       and . Partial derivatives of  with  are expressed as follows: The simulated data were generated by using QMSim []. Under an infinitesimal model  the base population comprised 20 males and 100 females generated from a historical population with linkage equilibrium. After the base population  the next five generations were generated to investigate the performance of HMC and NUTS. For these five generations  one male was randomly selected as a sire of the next generation and mated to 10 females to produce 10 males and 10 females. Total population sizes were set to 1000 with an equal number of each sex. The heritabilities of the simulated phenotypes were set to 0.1  0.3 or 0.5  and phenotypic variance was assumed to be 1. For each condition  five replicates were simulated. In the statistical analysis  the fixed effect was sex effects. Pig data were derived from 1521 purebred Duroc pigs at the National Livestock Breeding Center  Japan. Pigs in the first and second generations were regarded as the base population  and closed breeding was subsequently performed from the third to seventh generation. The pigs were selected based on average daily gain from 30 to 105 kg  backfat thickness (BF)  loin eye area (LEA)  and intramuscular fat content. BF and LEA were measured on the left side at 9 cm from the position of half the body length in pigs weighing 105 kg using ultrasound (B-mode) equipment (USL-11  Kaijo-denki Co.  Ltd.  Tokyo). This study focused on 991 records of BF and LEA. Descriptive statistics for the BF and LEA data are in Table . In the statistical analysis  the fixed effects were sex effects (three classes: boar  barrow  and gilt) and generation effects (seven classes). The computing programs for GS and HMC were developed in R  and the programs for NUTS were developed in Stan. Developing a program for NUTS is challenging because of its very complex algorithm but it can be overcome by using Stan  which involves a simple programming language. Stan is an open-source software  with a publicly available manual online (). In the present study  we used RStan  which is the R interface for Stan. The pseudocode for NUTS is described in Additional file . Stan implements reverse-mode automatic differentiation to calculate the gradients of the model  which is required by the leapfrog steps of HMC and NUTS. Therefore  the user can implement NUTS by merely writing the analysis model. In this pseudocode  we convert the additive relationship matrix by Cholesky decomposition to identify a matrix to describe an animal model in Stan format. This improves the performance of MCMC. Thus  for a fair comparison  we also run the Cholesky decomposition of the additive relationship matrix for GS and HMC. In HMC  we assumed that   where  is an identity matrix. In Stan  we can define the value of . When  approximates the covariance matrix of the target distribution  the kinetic energy function    will reduce the negative impacts of strong correlations and bad scaling on the efficiency of HMC and NUTS. For the default setting of the Stan software   is defined as a diagonal metric (i.e.  a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries) and the values of  are estimated during the warm-up phase []. All records were used to estimate heritabilities and breeding values with both simulated and pig data. The posterior mean and Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) were calculated to evaluate the estimated heritabilities. The MCSE describes the uncertainty about a statistic in the sample due to sampling error. For the accuracy of estimated breeding values  we calculated Pearson’s correlation between the true value and the estimated breeding value. The regression coefficient of the true value on the estimated breeding value of animals was calculated to assess unbiasedness. The true value was assumed as the true breeding value in the simulated data and the phenotype in the pig data. In total  10 000 iterations were simulated to obtain marginal posterior distributions for all methods. For GS and HMC  the first 1000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. The warm-up phase was 1000 iterations for NUTS. For HMC  the hyperparameters were set as follows:  and  in the simulated data  and  and  in the pig data. For HMC  the initial values of  were sampled from the uniform distribution . For NUTS  we used default parameters in Stan. We presented the traceplots and marginal posterior distributions of heritability estimates to evaluate the performance of MCMC samplings for all methods. The effective sample size (ESS) and autocorrelation between samples were calculated by using the R “coda” package []. For autocorrelation by using the function “acf” on R  the intervals between samples were set to 1  5  10  and 50 (lag1  lag5  lag10  and lag50  respectively). The heritability estimates and predictive accuracies are in Table . Regardless of the values of true heritabilities  there are no differences in estimated heritabilities and accuracies among GS  HMC  and NUTS. The MCSE of NUTS was smallest for all scenarios. When the true heritability was 0.1  the marginal posterior distributions of GS and HMC were skewed compared with NUTS (Fig. ). When true heritabilities were 0.3 and 0.5  the marginal posterior distributions for all methods were unimodal and bilaterally symmetrical (Figs.   ).

The autocorrelation estimates by HMC and NUTS decreased more quickly than those by GS for all scenarios. For LEA and BF  the heritability estimates and predictive accuracies of GS and NUTS were almost the same (Table ). On the one hand  the MCSE of NUTS was smaller than that of GS for both LEA and BF. The marginal posterior distributions of these methods were unimodal and bilaterally symmetrical (Figs.   ). On the other hand  HMC could not estimate heritability or breeding value because the parameters did not converge. Compared with the ESS estimates by GS  the ESS estimates by NUTS-Stan were 3.5 to 5.9 times larger (Table ). The autocorrelation estimates of NUTS decreased more quickly than those of GS for both LEA and BF. Trace plots and posterior density plots for heritability of loin eye area.

GS and  NUTS This study examined the performance of HMC and NUTS  which can automatically optimize key parameters in HMC  for estimating heritabilities and breeding values as well as the quality of MCMC sampling in a pedigree-based univariate animal model. On the one hand  for both simulated and real pig data  NUTS performed better than GS. Compared with those by GS  the ESS and the declines of autocorrelation estimates by NUTS were larger and faster  respectively. In particular  when true heritability was low in simulated data  the skewness of the marginal posterior distributions of NUTS was smaller than that of GS. Thus  the results of the present study indicate that NUTS is an appropriate alternative sampling method for animal breeding. On the other hand  HMC could not estimate parameters for real data  whereas the performance of HMC was better than that of GS for simulated data. Therefore  it might be difficult to set appropriate hyperparameters for HMC according to trait and population structure. R language is highly extensible and provides a myriad of statistical and graphical techniques. However  R language has poor computation time compared to Fortran  which is especially well suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. In the present study  we developed the programs for GS and HMC in R but did not examine computation time; instead  we focused on examining the performance of estimating genetic parameters and breeding values. In practice  the computation time of HMC and NUTS is greatly affected by leapfrog integration. In HMC  if  is large  the computation load of leapfrog integration is large  although the distance of parameter transition is also large. In NUTS  candidate parameters must be calculated by leapfrog integration at all steps of the doubling procedure. Therefore  if the number of these steps increases  then the computation load increases exponentially. In the present study  the autocorrelations of HMC and NUTS decreased quickly compared to GS  which led to fast convergence. Thus  the computation time for HMC and NUTS can be shortened by reducing the number of MCMC iterations. Many algorithms that extend HMC have been published. Although NUTS is the most popular algorithm and is very effective for the sampling process  it can be slow if the evaluation of the gradient is computationally expensive  especially when large datasets are used. This problem might be solved by using stochastic gradient HMC []. Rather than directly computing the costly gradient  which requires examination of the entire dataset  stochastic gradient HMC uses a noisy estimate based on a small dataset  called minibatch  which is sampled uniformly at random from the entire dataset; as the size of minibatch increases  this approximation becomes more accurate. Empirically  in a variety of settings  simply considering a minibatch size on the order of hundreds of data points is sufficient to obtain an accurate estimate []. Minibatches of this size still represent a significant reduction in the computational cost of the gradient. Another algorithm that extends HMC is Riemannian manifold HMC []. Riemannian manifold HMC uses Riemann geometry to adapt the mass matrix  enabling the algorithm to use curvature information to perform more efficient sampling. The sampler will automatically adjust its movement through the probability space to better match the target distribution by using an appropriate metric for the manifold  thus providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. Hence  like NUTS  these extended HMC methods are also promising for the field of animal breeding. In our study  we compared the performance of GS  HMC  and NUTS for estimating genetic parameters and breeding values with both simulated and real pig data. The accuracies of NUTS were very similar to GS but NUTS had larger ESS estimates in the same iteration and declined more quickly for autocorrelations then GS. In addition  when true heritability was low in the simulated data  the skewness of the marginal posterior distributions of NUTS was smaller than that of GS. These results indicated that NUTS was an appropriate alternative sampling method for animal breeding. In particular  the performance for NUTS coded by using the Stan software was remarkably superior to other methods when true heritability was low in the simulated data. Furthermore  Stan’s simple programming language makes it quite practical for such applications. HMC could not estimate parameters for real data  whereas the performance of HMC was better than that of GS for simulated data  indicating that HMC requires appropriate parameter settings according to trait and population structure. Here  we applied HMC and NUTS to a univariate linear mixed model  thus future studies should investigate the possibility of applying HMC and NUTS to more complex models and big data.

Thus far  genomic prediction accuracy has shown limited increase when using such information in dairy cattle studies  in which one or few breeds with limited diversity predominate. The objective of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction in a multi-breed Australian sheep population of relatively less related target individuals  when using information on imputed WGS genotypes. Between 9626 and 26 657 animals with phenotypes were available for nine economically important sheep production traits and all had WGS imputed genotypes. About 30% of the data were used to discover predictive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and the remaining data were used for training and validation of genomic prediction. Prediction accuracy using selected variants from imputed sequence data was compared to that using a standard array of 50k SNP genotypes  thereby comparing genomic best linear prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian methods (BayesR/BayesRC). Accuracy of genomic prediction was evaluated in two independent populations that were each lowly related to the training set  one being purebred Merino and the other crossbred Border Leicester x Merino sheep. A substantial improvement in prediction accuracy was observed when selected sequence variants were fitted alongside 50k genotypes as a separate variance component in GBLUP (2GBLUP) or in Bayesian analysis as a separate category of SNPs (BayesRC). From an average accuracy of 0.27 in both validation sets for the 50k array  the average absolute increase in accuracy across traits with 2GBLUP was 0.083 and 0.073 for purebred and crossbred animals  respectively  whereas with BayesRC it was 0.102 and 0.087. The average gain in accuracy was smaller when selected sequence variants were treated in the same category as 50k SNPs. Very little improvement over 50k prediction was observed when using all WGS variants. Accuracy of genomic prediction in diverse sheep populations increased substantially by using variants selected from whole-genome sequence data based on an independent multi-breed GWAS  when compared to genomic prediction using standard 50K genotypes. Accuracy of genomic prediction of genetic merit of farm animals depends on factors such as heritability  the size of the reference population and the effective number of chromosome segments  which in turns depends on the effective population size () [  ] and the structure of the reference population used for prediction []. In multi-breed/crossbred populations  such as in Australian sheep  it is difficult to achieve a sufficiently high genomic prediction accuracy for genetically diverse breeds with large  or for minor breeds with small reference populations. Prediction based on a set of reference animals from other breeds was shown to be of limited value [  ]  which could be mainly due to low linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers used in common marker genotype arrays and quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the traits. Low LD suggests that denser marker genotypes could improve genomic prediction accuracy. However  the use of high-density (500k) genotypes was shown to lead to only small improvements in prediction accuracy in multi-breed sheep data  compared to using a 50k SNP array []. The relatively small difference may be due to the LD between genetic markers and QTL remaining low when using common HD genotypes  especially across breeds. Whole-genome sequence data provide further opportunities and have the advantage of covering all causal mutations that are responsible for the genetic variation of a polygenic trait or genetic markers in sufficiently high LD with causal mutations. Genetic variants at or in high LD with causal mutations are likely to be only a small subset of the whole set of sequence variants. This means that a large part of the whole-genome sequence data is in low LD with causal mutations and can be excluded from the prediction model. Earlier work in dairy cattle showed that WGS data used in genomic prediction gave no to limited improvement in prediction accuracy when all variants were used [  ] and only small improvements were found by using a subset of variants selected based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [   ]. However  using selected variants can also lead to considerable bias  if the data used for detecting QTL was the same as the training data used to predict breeding values [  ]. Reasons for the limited improvement from using WGS data in previous studies may be the high levels of LD and relatively low genetic diversity in the dairy cattle populations used in these studies. With high LD  the difference in predictive ability between markers from standard 50k SNP-panels and other markers closer to the actual QTL is likely to be smaller. Indeed  it will be more difficult to distinguish between these when selecting variants from GWAS in such populations. Improvements in prediction accuracy were more notable when variants were selected from a multi-breed GWAS []. Another important aspect of genomic prediction is the genetic relatedness between the training set and the target animals for which we want to predict the breeding value. In efficient breeding programs  it is likely that most selection candidates have close relatives in the training set  i.e. animals with both genotype and phenotype information are often available from previous rounds of selection. Prediction from closer relatives is less likely to be improved by markers that are closer to the QTL  and therefore WGS data provides limited benefit. However  prediction of more distant target individuals is also relevant  for example when applying genomic prediction to more diverse populations and populations of multi-breed nature  such as in beef cattle and sheep  or when special reference populations are formed for a limited set of individuals measured for traits that are not widely recorded  such as slaughter traits or feed efficiency. Relatedness between training and target individuals may vary considerably in such cases. Another application of genomic prediction could be for genetic benchmarking in commercial herds or flocks in which information on previous breeding history is limited  and the target individuals may be less related to the reference population. Using markers that are closer to the actual QTL could make genomic prediction more robust and applicable to a wider range of individuals with lower genetic relatedness  including crossbreds. The objective of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction in a multi-breed Australian sheep population for some key lamb production traits using variants from imputed WGS data. We used selected variants obtained via a multi-breed GWAS in a separate discovery dataset and compared best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) and a Bayesian method to evaluate the potential change in accuracy and bias of genomic prediction when adding these variants to a standard 50k SNP genotype array. Phenotypes for key meat and wool production traits were extracted for animals in the “Sheep Cooperative Research Centre” database (“Research data”)  which includes the “Information Nucleus Flocks” (INF)  “Resource Flocks” (RF) and “the Sheep Genomics Flock” (SGF). INF consisted of eight flocks located across different regions of Australia that are linked to each other by the use of common sires through artificial insemination between 2007 and 2011 [] and the RF followed the same mating design (2012–2017) but only in two flocks. SGF was a single research flock located in southern New South Wales  Australia  with data collected between 2005 and 2006 []. Additional phenotypes for on-farm traits recorded in industry flocks (“Industry data”) were extracted from the Sheep Genetics database () for flocks with animals with genotypes. Both research and industry datasets were from a multi-breed/crossbred sheep population. Most animals were either purebred Merino or crossbreds of Border Leicester (BL)  Poll Dorset (PD) or White Suffolk (WS) rams mated to Merino dams or BL<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino dams. For each trait  animals with both phenotype and genotype data were divided into three non-overlapping groups: (1) a QTL discovery set for a GWAS with imputed WGS data to find variants at or very near putative causal mutations; (2) a reference or training set for genomic prediction based on estimated marker effects; and (3) a validation set to evaluate accuracy and bias of genomic prediction. These three sets were purposefully chosen as being independent of each other to avoid bias in the evaluation of prediction accuracy. The data were divided into three subsets independently for each trait  because the numbers of animals recorded differed for each trait. The QTL discovery and training sets were selected to have a broad representation of breeds and crosses (Fig. ). However  the validation set consisted of only two specific breed groups: (1) purebred Merino (MER) and (2) F1 cross of Border Leicester with Merino (BL<U+2009>×<U+2009>MER). Breed composition of the discovery  reference and validation datasets. Breed composition as number of animals multiplied by breed proportion for each trait in QTL discovery  and genomic selection reference and validation sets The animals in the validation set were selected such that they did not have high genetic relationships with animals in the training set. Thus  for each trait: (1) half-sibs families were not split across the training and validation sets and no sires of validation animals were included in the training set; and (2) relationships between the training and validation sets were further restricted at a fixed threshold using the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) constructed from 50k SNP-chip genotypes []. The applied GRM threshold ensured that the genomic relationship between each animal in the validation set with any animal in the training set was lower than 0.25 (meat traits) or lower than 0.125 (wool traits). The contributions of the MER and BL<U+2009>×<U+2009>MER breeds in the discovery  training and validation sets for each trait are in Table  as well as the number of animals from other breeds or crosses available in these three sets for each trait. Proportions of each main breed represented as either purebreds or crosses were predicted using pedigree information (Fig. ). Phenotypic records of eight traits related to weight  carcass and meat quality and wool production were used in this study; post weaning weight (PWT)  post weaning eye muscle depth (PEMD  mm) from ultrasound scanning of live animals  carcass eye muscle depth (CEMD  mm)  carcass fat depth at the C site (CCFAT  mm)  intra muscular fat (IMF  %) and shear force at 5 days after slaughter (SF5  Newton)  yearling clean fleece weight (YCFW  kg) and yearling wool fiber diameter (YFD  µm). First  phenotypes from the research data were edited for possible outliers (more than 4 standard deviations from the overall mean)  for records with no pedigree or breed composition information or for records with missing age or weight at measurement. Phenotypes were then pre-corrected for fixed and random effects in a univariate mixed model analysis  similar to the model used by Sheep Genetics []. The fixed effects of the model were a contemporary group effect (from a combination of flock  birth year and management group)  gender  age at measurement (days)  age of the dam (years; fitted both as a first and second order terms)  a combination of birth and rearing type (single  twin  triplet) and traits related to carcass were corrected for weight at measurement. Hence  PEMD was corrected for PWT  whereas CCFAT  CEMD  IMF and SF5 were corrected for carcass weight. For PWT and YCFW a random maternal effect was fitted. Phenotypes from the industry dataset were taken from the national Sheep Genetics OVIS database []  which is divided into six separate analyses: Merino  terminal breeds and maternal breeds and smaller runs for Meat Merino  Dohne and Corriedale sheep. These phenotypes were pre-adjusted within each of the six analyses for fixed effects of birth and rearing type  age of measurement in days  age of dam in years with both linear and quadratic adjustments and body weight adjustments for PEMD and carcass traits  as described in []. Then  pre-adjusted phenotypes were taken from all data in the national evaluation for each trait and residuals were calculated from fitting a model with a fixed contemporary group effect for PWT and YCFW. These residuals were used as corrected phenotypes for further analysis  but only for animals with genotype information. Animals from the research dataset that were also included in the national evaluation were excluded from the industry dataset. Additional file : Table S1 shows the summary statistics of the phenotypes of the combined datasets after editing. There were 31 937 animals with genotypes that had either previously been imputed from 12k to the 50k SNP panel (about 35% of animals) or were real 50k genotypes (about 65% of animals) and the breed representation in these datasets was similar and relative to their occurrence in industry flocks (e.g. see Fig. ). Genotypes on the X chromosome were excluded from the analysis. The imputation of WGS genotypes from 50k was performed in two steps. First  for the animals that did not have real high-density (HD) genotypes (all but 2266 key animals)  the 50k genotypes were imputed to HD and then in the second step  all imputed and real HD genotypes were imputed to sequence data using a reference of 726 sequenced animals representing multiple European breeds and crosses (further details in []). The numbers of sequenced animals from the Merino and Border Leicester breeds were 124 and 22  respectively. The total number of variants that passed imputation quality controls and included in this study were: 45 670 SNPs in the 50k panel  485 617 SNPs in the HD panel and 31 154 082 variants in WGS. In the discovery population for each trait  we ran a GWAS using the WGS 31 154 082 imputed genotypes. The GWAS results were used to select the ‘top SNPs’ from those associated with variation in the traits of interest. The “top SNPs” were defined as the most significant SNPs below an association threshold of p-value<U+2009><<U+2009>10 within a 100-kb window. The windows started at the proximal end of each chromosome  then sliding 50 kb along to the next 100 kb window until reaching the end of each chromosome. After selection of the most significant SNP per 100 kb window  one of any pair of these top SNPs in strong LD (with an r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.95) was removed using the PLINK software []. Some of the selected SNPs were also removed if their MAF was lower than 0.005 in the reference population for a given trait. The final numbers of top SNPs used for each trait to improve the accuracy of genomic predictions are in Table . The small number of top SNPs that overlapped with those on the 50k SNP chip were treated as top SNPs in our genomic prediction models  i.e. they were removed from the 50k subset and retained with the top SNPs when fitting the latter set as a separate component to the 50k. However  these overlapping SNPs were retained in the 50k set when only the 50k genotypes were used for prediction. The model used in GWAS for each trait using Wombat software [] is as follows: where  is a vector of corrected phenotypes;  is a vector of fixed effects  intercept and data source  (six industry data sources and one for research)  is a vector of genotypes (coded 0  1  and 2)   is the effect of the th sequence variant;  is a vector with random breed effects     is a matrix with breed proportion of each animal according to pedigree information  i.e. assigning animals to breeds  and  is the variance explained by the breed proportion matrix;   contains random additive genetic effects where  is the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) constructed with HD SNPs and  is the variance explained by SNPs;   is the vector of random residual effects;  and  are design matrices connecting phenotypes to fixed effects and to random additive genetic effects  respectively. The contributions of each breed are listed in Fig.   but for the Merino breed three sub-breed groups were defined because there is generally little intercrossing of these sub-breed groups  thus creating further population structure. The Merino sub-breed groups are largely defined on fiber diameter: ultrafine  fine-medium and broad (“strong”) wool  according to wool breeding objectives as defined by the breeders. We applied genomic BLUP (GBLUP) [] and the BayesR [] and BayesRC methods [] for prediction of genomic breeding values (GBV). The same phenotypic data were used in the Bayesian and GBLUP models  and prior to these analyses  the corrected phenotypes for animals in the training and validation sets were further pre-adjusted for data source and genetic groups using estimates for those effects ( and ) based on the model in Eq.   but the individual SNP effect was not included in the model. Five different genotype sets were tested in the models: (1) top sequence variants (top)  (2) 50k panel  (3) 50k plus top sequence variants (50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top)  and (4) HD panel and 5) WGS data. However  due to the large number of SNPs in WGS data  we did not run a Bayesian model for that set. The SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.005 in the genomic prediction training populations were excluded from the genotype sets. In the GBLUP models  top  50k  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top  HD and WGS genotype sets were fitted in the model with the GRM as a covariance structure of one random additive genetic effect (Eq. ). In addition  the 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top set was also fitted as two GRM constructed separately from the 50k and top SNP genotype sets (Eq. ): where  is a vector of pre-adjusted phenotypes;  is a vector with 1s   is the intercept;  is a design matrix allocating records to individual additive genetic values in  ()  which is a vector of GBV in which  is the GRM constructed from different sets of genotypes (i.e. top  50k  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top  HD and WGS) and  is the additive genetic variance; and  is a vector of random residual effects. When 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top genotypes were fitted as two components as in Eq. ()   and  are vectors of additive genetic values explained by the SNP sets that formed  and  from the 50k and top SNP genotype sets  respectively  and  and  are the respective additive genetic variances of those effects. The overall GBV for each individual was formed from the sum of  and . We used the MTG2 software [] for GBLUP of GBV and genomic residual maximum likelihood (GREML) for estimating variance components. For Bayesian analysis  the genotypes were centered and standardized to a variance of 1. The SNP effects were fitted as a mixture of four normal distributions each with a mean of zero and variance:      and   where  is the additive genetic variance. The BayesR method was used to predict GBV using  top  50k  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top and HD genotype sets. The BayesRC method was only tested with 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>top genotypes because this is a modified BayesR method that allows for different categories of variants that may be differentially enriched for QTL. Thus  the selected top SNPs were allocated to a separate category from the remaining 50k SNP  allowing the possibility of a different mixture distribution of SNP effects in each of these two categories. Each Bayesian model (BayesR and BayesRC) was replicated with five MCMC chains to check for convergence  each with 40 000 iterations (20 000 burn-in). Animal GBV were calculated by multiplying genotypes and corresponding SNP effects summed across the genome. The total proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all SNPs was used to estimate trait heritabilities. Evaluation of the accuracy of genomic prediction was calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between GBV and pre-adjusted phenotypes in the two validation subsets and then scaling this correlation by dividing it by the square root of the trait heritability (estimated in a GBLUP model using a 50k genotype set  Table ). The bias of the prediction accuracy was assessed from the regression coefficient of the pre-adjusted phenotype on GBV in the validation subsets. The Bayesian heritability  accuracy and bias were assessed from each of the five MCMC chains and then averaged. Table  shows the heritability estimates of each trait in the prediction data for each of the five SNP subsets when using one of the Bayesian methods or genomic residual maximum likelihood (GREML) with either one or two GRM. Across all traits and SNP subsets  heritabilities estimated based on the Bayesian method were slightly lower (1.6% in relative terms) than those based on the GREML method using a GBLUP model. The heritability estimated by GREML  on average across traits  increased by<U+2009>~<U+2009>15% when using all WGS variants compared to 50k genotypes  but the increase was<U+2009>~<U+2009>25% for CEMD  PEMD and SF5. Heritability estimates based on only selected sequence variants (3924 to 8654 variants) were more than 40% lower than those based on the 50k set  except for YFD where the top SNPs resulted in a higher heritability than the 50k set for both GREML and BayesR. The heritability based on fitting 50k genotypes and selected sequence variants as one component was on average slightly higher than the heritability estimate based on the sum of the two variance components estimated from the 50k and top SNPs sets. Again  YFD was an exception as it always gave a significantly higher heritability when top-SNPs were used. The accuracy of genomic prediction for each trait based on different SNP subsets and models is shown in Fig.  for the purebred Merino validation set and in Fig.  for the crossbred validation set. Currently in the Australian sheep industry  genetic evaluation is based on GBLUP using a 50k SNP array  so we used the scenario GBLUP (50k) here as the benchmark. The average GBLUP (50k) accuracy across all traits was 0.27 for both validation sets  but it should be noted that the validation sets were selected to minimize relationships with the training set (as a more stringent test to differentiate between methods). Accuracy of genomic predictions in purebred Merino for different traits and models Accuracy of genomic predictions in Merino<U+2009>×<U+2009>Border Leicester crossbreds for different traits and models Accuracy of GBV based on the HD SNP genotypes and GBLUP was only slightly increased relative to GBLUP (50k) (0.028 accuracy increase for Merinos and no difference for the crossbreds when averaged across traits)  but increases were higher and more consistent with BayesR (0.081 for Merinos and 0.039 for the crossbreds). When using all the variants in WGS data (~<U+2009>31<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 variants) the accuracy of genomic prediction increased in some cases compared to either the 50k or HD GBLUP  but more often decreased with no clear pattern among traits. Compared to using 50k  the WGS set resulted in a change in accuracy  averaged across traits  of + 0.016 for Merinos and - 0.014 for the crossbreds. A larger and more consistent increase in prediction accuracy was observed when adding the selected sequence variants to the standard 50k set in the Bayesian and GBLUP prediction models. When using the GBLUP method and fitting selected sequence variants and 50k genotypes as one variance component  the average prediction accuracy across traits improved in absolute value by 0.046 and 0.048 for Merinos and crossbreds  respectively  and these improvements were 0.083 and 0.073 when two separate variance components were fitted (one for 50K and one for the top SNPs). When including top SNPs using the BayesR method  the accuracy increase  when averaged across traits  was 0.079 for Merinos and 0.059 for crossbreds  compared with GBLUP (50k)  and these increases were 0.102 and 0.087 with the BayesRC method  in which top SNPs and the 50k set were treated  separately. The increase in accuracy due to adding top SNPs to the 50k array varied among traits  between methods within traits  and also with the validation set (Fig. ). With GBLUP in the Merino set  the increase from using top SNPs as an additional  matrix compared to using the standard 50k was lowest for CCFAT (0.01) and IMF (0.02)  and highest for PEMD (0.16)  SF5 (0.13) and PWT (0.12). When using BayesRC  the increases of using the top SNPs added to the standard 50k array  compared to using GBLUP (50k)  were 0.09  0.04  0.20  0.15 and 0.15 for the same traits in the Merino set. However  in crossbreds  these increases were quite different across traits. For both GBLUP and Bayesian prediction methods  most traits had an increase in accuracy of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.05 when adding information from the top SNPs  but CCFAT had a much higher increase of 0.28. Accuracy increase for each trait when using top SNPs in GBLUP or BayesRC. Accuracy increase over a 50k GBLUP prediction for each of the traits in both validation populations when using top SNPs either as a second GRM in GBLUP or as a second class of predictors in BayesRC Using just the set of selected variants alone improved accuracy more compared with GBLUP (50k) when averaged across all traits; 0.053 and 0.029 for GBLUP in Merino and crossbred validation sets and 0.069 and 0.043 for BayesR in these two validation sets (Figs.  and ). However  there was again a large variation among traits and validation populations  which was generally consistent with the increase in accuracy when combining top SNPs with 50k panels. For example  in the Merino set  top SNPs alone had a much higher accuracy than GBLUP (50k) for PEMD and SF5 whereas for CCFAT and CEMD this accuracy was lower than the 50k array. On the other hand  for the crossbred validation population  CCFAT showed a much higher accuracy when using top SNPs only (increase 0.36) compared to using GBLUP (50k)  whereas for the other traits there was either a lower accuracy or only a slightly higher accuracy than that of the 50k panel. The regression coefficients of corrected phenotypes on estimated GBV for two validation sets across different traits are shown in Figs.  and . All methods and models showed some bias. Regression coefficients  when averaged across traits  varied between methods from 0.71 to 0.85 for the Merinos and from 0.76 to 0.91 for the crossbred validation population. In the Merino set  the greatest deviation from 1 in the average regression coefficient (i.e. most bias) was found when using top SNPs alone (0.71)  but this was only slightly lower than the average value for GBLUP (50k)  which was 0.74. For the crossbreds  on average bias was not larger when top SNPs were used  but this average was affected by a strong upward bias for one trait (CCFAT). There was no difference in bias between GBLUP and BayesR. Generally  we found more bias for traits with lower prediction accuracy. This could be related to the smaller size of both training and validation data subsets for those traits. Bias of genomic predictions in purebred Merino for different traits and models Bias of genomic predictions in Merino<U+2009>×<U+2009>Border Leicester crossbreds for different traits and models This study demonstrated that the use of selected variants from WGS increased the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to standard 50k genotypes for eight economically important traits in sheep. Selection of the WGS variants (SNPs or InDels) was based on performing an association study on imputed sequence data in an independent set of animals to avoid probable bias of prediction [  ]. The accuracy of genomic prediction was assessed in independent training and validation datasets  chosen in such a way as to remove genetically high relationships between the validation and training animals. Thus  genomic prediction accuracies are expected to be lower and the benefit from using selected sequence variants is likely higher  e.g. compared with dairy cattle studies where populations are less diverse and training populations often contain highly related individuals. However  in beef and sheep populations  individual breed numbers are small and therefore it is desirable to combine multi-breed and crossbred populations to enlarge reference populations for genomic prediction. Therefore  in these more genetically diverse beef cattle or sheep populations  the prediction of more distant relatives is also important. The same holds for genomic prediction of commercial animals  e.g. for the purpose of genetic bench-marking and management decisions related to genetic merit. Furthermore  there is a trend towards highly accelerated breeding schemes using reproductive technologies  where selection candidates may be separated from the reference population by several generations. It is expected that genomic prediction based on predictive markers that are closer to actual causal variants are more widely applicable and depend less on the relatedness between the training set and the target individual. This is also important for difficult to measure traits for which it may not be possible to continually update reference populations with immediate relatives of test animals. Compared to using 50k genotypes  using the complete set of sequence data (~<U+2009>31 million variants) resulted in a higher estimated additive genetic variance and heritability. We compared the sum of diagonal terms and off-diagonal terms from -matrices derived from 50k  HD and WGS genotypes and both means and SD were nearly identical between these. Therefore  a higher heritability estimate could potentially be the result of stronger LD between sequence variants and polymorphisms responsible for trait variation. However  no or only a very small improvement in genomic prediction accuracy was observed when using all sequence variants compared to 50k genotypes. This finding is similar to previous studies in dairy cattle [      ] that also found no to very small improvements in prediction accuracy from using all variants of WGS. WGS data provide a very large number of genetic variants across the genome  while only a small subset is expected to be  or in high LD with  the causative mutations underlying the genetic variance of a polygenic trait. This means that the majority of the sequence variants are in low LD with causative mutations and do not capture the genetic variance of significant genomic regions when using a GBLUP approach. Thus  compared to the 50K genotypes  their contribution would be limited to the capture of more precise family relationships between animals. It is possible that the prediction accuracy for WGS showed little benefit in lowly related validation individuals because a large proportion of the markers are not linked to causal variants in the validation set and might hinder rather than help prediction accuracy. Furthermore  in WGS there is a much higher risk of false positives from for example  population structure  as well as imputation errors which can erode the accuracy of genomic prediction []. Estimation of heritability is mainly driven by (higher) relationships between training animals  in which case markers that are not linked to causal variants could still be helpful in estimating these more accurately. This argument can also be used to explain that the heritability based on using top SNPs alone was generally lower than the heritability based on the SNP sets with more markers  while prediction accuracies based on these selected marker sets were generally similar and sometimes even higher than the accuracy based on the 50k set. A similar result was found by Raymond et al. [] who argue that the selected variants may explain only a small amount of the genetic variation due to their small effects  but they can contribute significantly to genomic prediction when relationships between training and target individuals are low  in their case across breed. Besides marker density and potential proximity of markers to causal variants  another potential factor that may influence estimates of heritability across variant sets could be their difference in allele frequency spectrum. Fitting the selected sequence variants (3924 to 8654 for different traits) that were derived from the association study along with the standard 50k genotypes often resulted in a notable increase in prediction accuracy in both purebred and crossbred animals  particularly if these selected markers were fitted as separately defined groups  either in GBLUP (2  matrices) or in BayesRC. These methods allow more variance for the set of selected SNPs and therefore less shrinkage and effectively giving them more weight in the prediction. We expected an increase because these selected genetic variants are in stronger LD with QTL regions than randomly chosen markers such as those on the 50k array. However  as shown in Fig.   the gain in accuracy varied among traits and validation sets. Variation between traits could exist due to the differences in the genetic architecture of each trait  i.e. there would be more benefit from using top SNPs if a trait is affected by relatively few QTL  each with a relatively large effect. However  our results varied also within traits and among validation sets  e.g. selected variants for CCFAT explained a small part of the genetic variation in the Merino validation set and had only a small effect on prediction accuracy  while these two parameters were much larger in the crossbred validation set. This could be related to differences in QTL effects between populations that could be due to epistatic interactions  or simply due to differences in mean and variation of traits in different breeds. Allele frequency differences between breeds are likely to have a large impact on results  both for QTL and predictive markers. We examined furthermore the high accuracy and bias for CCFAT found in the crossbred validation when only fitting top SNPs. We noted that these results were quite sensitive to the MAF threshold applied  i.e. both accuracy and bias were lower in this case when the MAF threshold for the top SNPs to be included increased from 0.005 to 0.05. Evans et al. [] recently demonstrated that low MAF WGS variants can have a considerable effect on the estimation of SNP heritability. Further work is needed to systematically explore all these issues with larger datasets. Besides finding a set of more predictive SNPs  it is also important to examine how these are optimally used in the genomic prediction model. Our study is the first to compare directly the single and two GRM GBLUP models vs. BayesR and BayesRC methods. The GBLUP linear model with two separate variance components allows for a larger genetic variance on average per marker for the set of selected SNPs  effectively giving more weight to these markers. In principle  more -matrices could be fitted to allow further differential weighting of markers into more subclasses  where marker selection would be based on statistical significance in a separate GWA analysis. Alternatively  it is possible to use a single  matrix that is weighted  for example  according to the estimated predictive value of each SNP from one or more independent studies []. This two-step approach is pragmatic and feasible in large datasets and with very many markers  such as from WGS data. A Bayesian model such as BayesR applies the concept of differentially weighing markers more formally  by assigning marker effects to one of the four normal distributions based on statistical evidence in a model selection approach in which all markers are fitted simultaneously  and allowing for a large proportion of markers to have no effect on the trait. The BayesRC model takes the standard BayesR model one step further by enabling the mixing proportions to vary across different variant sets  where based on prior information  the user defines one or more groups of variants that may be more enriched for QTL than another. In this study  the variant sets were the 50k and the top SNP set  and for many traits  this improved prediction accuracy over BayesR. However  although approaches for Bayesian analysis with the complete set of WGS markers have been developed [  ]  these models did not result in increased accuracy for WGS compared to standard genotype sets using real dairy cattle data. Van den Berg et al. [] found limited benefit over 2GBLUP from a Bayesian model fitting two mixture distributions. Our design was more favorable towards showing benefit of using selected variants  and the BayesR methods showed more clearly an advantage over GBLUP methods. However  Bayesian methods also become very computationally challenging in larger datasets with hundreds of thousands of individuals and dense genotype sets. However  large datasets are needed to obtain more accurate estimates of marker effects and to enable more accurate marker selection. Further development of model selection approaches is required  likely with a role for two-stage approaches  to optimize the selection of WGS variants and their best weighting for the purpose of genomic prediction of trait variation. Our results were based on a multi-breed dataset and  generally  the improvement in prediction accuracy from using selected variants was larger than that obtained in studies using data on a single breed (mostly Holstein–Friesian dairy cattle e.g. [    ]. This is in line with other studies in dairy cattle  which used multi-breed datasets [  ]. Van den Berg et al. [] used variants derived from multi-breed GWAS (four dairy cattle breeds) in multi-breed genomic prediction and showed on average up to 7% higher genomic prediction reliabilities () across milk traits in different scenarios for selecting sequence variants. By including selected sequence variants from GWAS in GBLUP (with a separate variance component to the 50k genotypes) Brøndum et al. [] reported on average a 5% improvement in genomic prediction reliability on a range of production traits in a multi-breed dairy cattle dataset. Multi-breed datasets are particularly useful in GWAS for marker selection because long distance LD will be reduced across breeds  allowing a more precise localization of predictive markers across breeds. We have not tested explicitly our ability to increase prediction accuracy from training data on different breeds. The accuracy of prediction across breeds (i.e. the reference and the validation sets consist of individuals from different breeds) was found to be close to zero in our previous work with less dense marker panels [  ]. Some results from data in dairy cows showed promise for the use of information from other breeds and this might be mostly important for smaller breeds that often lack large numbers for training genomic predictions [  ]. Using multi-breed data for marker selection could also have a drawback if marker effects differ between populations. In our data  the number of purebred individuals from different breeds was not sufficient to test this hypothesis. In our validation sets  we observed on average a similar prediction accuracy for purebred Merinos and for BL<U+2009>×<U+2009>Mer crosses  but the benefit of using selected variants was generally higher in the Merino validation set. This is likely due to the larger proportion of Merino haplotypes that were available in the training and SNP-discovery sets. Generally  Merino sheep are a lot more diverse than BL sheep and previous work has shown that a smaller training set for BL results in a similar accuracy to that for Merinos based on a large training set []. In other words  Merinos have a large effective population size  and as a result  a larger number of effective chromosome segments. This would also explain that the use of selected markers that are in higher LD with QTL is more advantageous for the Merino breed than the BL breed  which has less diversity and a larger effective number of chromosome segments. We used a design in which the discovery set used for GWAS and SNP selection was separate from the training set used to estimate marker effects for the purpose of genomic prediction. Previous papers pointed out that using the same data for discovery and training leads to biased predictions [  ]. Our results show that prediction based on top SNPs only were slightly more biased than prediction without these selected sets. This may be due to selected variants picking up some effects of the population structure that were not accounted for by the genetic groups that were derived from pedigree. Population structure is pronounced in the Merino breed where various subpopulations exist that are quite distinct  and therefore more precise correction for population structure based on genomic relationships might have resulted in less bias. Differences in bias between using selected variants and all variants was found to be much larger in a single-breed study with Holstein–Friesian cattle []  where QTL discovery and genomic prediction training sets were the same. We used an arbitrary proportion of the total dataset for SNP discovery. A balance needs to be found between the accuracy of selecting top SNPs and the precision of establishing the accuracy of prediction. The process of allocating data to discovery  training and validation sets could also be repeated multiple times  so that results can be averaged over multiple samples. For larger datasets  a larger proportion of the data could be used perhaps for discovery. It is tempting to use the complete dataset to accurately establish QTL and markers to predict their effects. However  it would then be impossible to establish the improvement in prediction accuracy free of bias. In addition  in commercial genetic evaluations  where top SNPs are selected from the same data as those used for prediction  it is likely that genomic predictions of breeding values are biased. Bias could be the result of selectively using information from random occurrences  but also systematic biases could occur due to not accounting properly for population structure  or otherwise use of selective data. The extent of the problem may be smaller with larger datasets but some cautions and independent validation will be required. The ultimate goal is to generate custom SNP panels for genotyping that include highly predictive sequence SNPs for the entire range of economically important traits  so that these variants can be directly genotyped rather than rely on imputation to WGS that is more error prone. The threshold for the p-value of marker effects in the selection of sequence variants to be used in genomic prediction was set at p<U+2009><<U+2009>10. Other studies have varied the threshold and  generally  found no or a slight improvement if more stringent thresholds were used [    ]. An optimal threshold is part of the process of selecting variants to improve genomic prediction  and an optimal value might well differ between traits and datasets. For example  a more stringent threshold is easier to apply in large datasets  since the false discovery rate can be low without losing too much power. An important aspect of our approach was the relatively lenient p-value threshold combined with selection of only one “top SNP” per 100-kb window along the entire genome. This enables representation of many of the QTL with a smaller effect that would otherwise be missed and reduces redundancy of multiple markers tagging a single QTL. This paper describes the first study in sheep to test the selection of WGS variants for improving prediction accuracy. Compared with previous studies  results were relatively more consistent with larger accuracy increases compared with those described in studies on dairy cattle. This may be partly due to the large diversity and multi-breed nature of the data used in sheep breeding. However  a large part of the additional contribution is also likely the result of the lower accuracy overall  as achieved for the default scenario of 50k industry panel. Our training dataset is smaller than those used in most dairy studies  and we have tested the accuracy in relatively unrelated animals  which is more difficult to achieve in populations that are less diverse. In the near future  we can expect that larger datasets will become available  which will be favorable towards more accurate SNP selection. Larger training datasets will of course also increase the prediction accuracy overall  even with standard SNP arrays. However  adding selected variants from WGS data to SNP arrays used in the industry will have a substantial benefit  especially for predicting GBV of animals that are not well connected to the industry reference population  provided suitable analytical methods are applied. Use of selected variants from imputed whole-genome sequence data resulted in considerable improvement in genomic prediction accuracy in validation sets that had a relatively low relationship to individuals in the training set. These variants were selected from independent discovery sets and larger increases in prediction accuracy were observed if they were given more weight in the prediction model  either as a separate variance component in GBLUP  or by allocating them to a separate group when using a Bayesian approach that allows for different mixture models of SNP effects (BayesRC).

The phenotype of a colony is affected by the average breeding value for the worker effect of the thousands of workers in the colony (the worker group) and by the breeding value for the queen effect of the queen of the colony. Because the worker group consists of multiple individuals  interpretation of the variance components and heritabilities of phenotypes observed on the colony and of the accuracy of selection is not straightforward. The additive genetic variance among worker groups depends on the additive genetic relationship between the drone-producing queens (DPQ) that produce the drones that mate with the queen.ResultsHere  we clarify how the relatedness between DPQ affects phenotypic variance  heritability and accuracy of the estimated breeding values of replacement queens. Second  we use simulation to investigate the effect of assumptions about the relatedness between DPQ in the base population on estimates of genetic parameters. Relatedness between DPQ in the base generation may differ considerably between populations because of their history.ConclusionsOur results show that estimates of (co)variance components and derived genetic parameters were seriously biased (25% too high or too low) when assumptions on the relationship between DPQ in the statistical analysis did not agree with reality."

Here  we clarify how the relatedness between DPQ affects phenotypic variance  heritability and accuracy of the estimated breeding values of replacement queens. Second  we use simulation to investigate the effect of assumptions about the relatedness between DPQ in the base population on estimates of genetic parameters. Relatedness between DPQ in the base generation may differ considerably between populations because of their history. Our results show that estimates of (co)variance components and derived genetic parameters were seriously biased (25% too high or too low) when assumptions on the relationship between DPQ in the statistical analysis did not agree with reality. In honey bees  observations on traits under selection such as honey yield are usually made on colonies  rather than on single individuals. A colony consists of a single queen and a group of thousands of workers. The phenotype of the colony is affected by the breeding value (BV) of the queen and by the mean BV of the worker group. The queen mates only on one occasion (or sometimes two) early in life with several haploid drones that were produced by queens in other colonies  so-called drone producing queens (DPQ). The queen is intended to head a colony that will be phenotyped. Each worker in the colony descends from the queen of the colony and from one of the drones that mated with her. In bee breeding  selection of parents for the next generation entails selection of colonies from which replacement queens are reared. A replacement queen is essentially a newborn worker who receives special nutrition such that she develops into a queen  rather than into a worker. Because it is unknown from which drone a replacement queen descends  she represents a randomly selected worker from the colony. As a consequence  the estimated breeding value (EBV) of a replacement queen at the time of selection  i.e.  before the colony she is going to head is phenotyped  is identical to the EBV of the worker group. Thus  for the selection of colonies to breed replacement queens  interest lies in the EBV of the worker group in the colony. Because the BV of the worker group is the mean BV of many workers  interpretation of the variance components and heritabilities on phenotypes observed on the colony and the accuracy of selection is not straightforward. Interpretation of these parameters depends on the mean additive genetic relationship between the workers in the worker group  because this relationship affects variance of the mean BV of the worker group. This relationship in turn depends on the additive genetic relationship between the DPQ that produced the drones that mated to the queen of the colony. Moreover  while the EBV of a replacement queen reared from a colony is identical to the EBV of the worker group  the accuracies of the two EBV differ because the second is the accuracy of an average EBV. The first purpose of this note is to clarify theoretically how the relatedness among DPQ affects phenotypic variance and heritability of a trait observed on the colony and how it affects the accuracy of the EBV of replacement queens. The second purpose is to investigate numerically how assumptions about the relatedness between DPQ in the base population affect the estimates of genetic parameters. Finally  we discuss practical implementation. Here  we first introduce the quantitative genetic model for traits recorded in honey bees. Next  we show (i) how phenotypic variance is calculated  and how this depends on the relatedness between DPQ  (ii) how heritability can be defined and interpreted  and (iii) how accuracy of the EBV of selection candidates is calculated. Finally  we use simulation to investigate the effects of assumptions about relatedness between DPQ in the base population on estimates of genetic parameters. The phenotype of a colony    can be written as:  where superscripts indicate the worker-effects () and the queen-effects () on the phenotypes  subscripts indicate the individuals  i.e. the worker group () and the queen (  their dam).  is the average BV of the worker group for the worker effect   is the BV of the queen for the queen effect  and  is a non-heritable residual. See [] for the biological interpretation of worker and queen-effects in the context of honey bees. To estimate variance components  a numerator relationships matrix    is derived from the pedigree []. The pedigree of a bee breeding program contains three types of ‘individuals’: groups of workers  dams (individual queens) and sires (groups of DPQ). As usual in an animal model  the elements of  are scaled relative to the additive genetic variance among individuals    such that the estimated variance components refer to single individuals. In particular  the estimate for the variance of worker effect    represents the variance of BV for the worker effect among single individuals  rather than among the groups of workers  . It follows from Eq. () that the phenotypic variance equals:  where  is the additive genetic variance for the worker effect of worker groups   the additive genetic variance for the queen effect of dams  and  their covariance. Worker groups consists of many () related workers  such that the relationship between  and  for worker group  is given by  where  is the additive genetic relationship between two random workers from the same colony  and depends on the distribution of drone contributions to the worker group (see “” section and Brascamp and Bijma [] for details). The second equality holds because  is very large. To find   consider the typical structure of a bee breeding programme where the workers in a colony are related not only because they descend from the same dam  but also because they either descend from the same drone  from two drones of the same DPQ  or from two different DPQ reared from the same colony. From Eq. 24 of []  the average additive genetic relationship between workers in a colony of a non-inbred population equals:  where the first term is relatedness due to the shared mother   is the probability that two workers descend from the same drone   is the probability that they descend from the same DPQ  and  is the additive genetic relationship between two DPQ reared from the same colony. If the DPQ in the base population are unrelated  Eq. () reduces to:  where subscript  indicates “unrelated”. However  within a few generations the  increases to an equilibrium value such that  []. In other words  about four generations after the base generation  the  has approached an equilibrium value  while the overall population is still unrelated and non-inbred. Thus  this equilibrium value may already be present in the base population  if the base population was part of an already ongoing breeding program. In that case    such that the equilibrium value becomes:  where subscript  indicates “equilibrium”. Apart from the gradual increase in inbreeding on the population level  the value of  remains at its equilibrium thereafter. A common way to define heritability () is as the fraction of phenotypic variance that can be attributed to additive genetic effects in the base population []. From Eqs. () and ()  overall heritability and heritabilities of the worker and queen effects are:  where the subscript  indicates heritabilities defined as a fraction of the variance  and either the unrelated () or equilibrium () value of  should be used in the numerator and in  depending on whether DPQ in the base population are unrelated or have an equilibrium relatedness. Note that also  depends upon  (Eqs. () and ()). The middle term in the numerator of Eq. () uses a relationship of ½ between the queen and her workers. When traits are affected by genetic effects that originate from different individuals  for example with direct and maternal effects  direct and social effects  or worker and queen effects  defining heritability as the fraction of phenotypic variance attributable to additive genetic effects does not reflect the potential of a population to respond to selection [  ]. Here  this issue is relevant for two reasons; first  the phenotype of a colony depends on both the queen and the workers  and second  the group of workers consists of multiple individuals. Because response to selection depends on the sum of changes in the mean worker and mean queen effects  based on [  ] the relevant “heritability” for response to selection is: Analogously  we may express the total heritable variance for response to selection due to workers and queens relative to phenotypic variance: These results are a special case of the general approach of [].  is equal to the ordinary heritability of queen effects  because the queen is a single individual. Note that theoretically  and  can exceed 1  as the denominator    contains  while the numerator contains . Fitting Eq. () yields the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of the mean BV of worker groups    and corresponding accuracies  say . Interest  however  also lies in the accuracy    of the EBV of a replacement queen bred from the colony. The EBV of the replacement queen    equals the EBV of the worker group: Note that we dropped the superscript for the trait (workers vs. queen effect)  because this section applies equally to both traits. In the section entitled “”  we show how the accuracy of the sum of worker and queen effect can be calculated. In general  the accuracy of BLUP equals the ratio of the standard deviations of EBV and BV (e.g. [])  such that:  where the second step follows from Eq. (). Using  and  from Eq. ()  and   it follows that: This result shows that the accuracy of the EBV for a replacement queen is a factor  smaller than the accuracy of the EBV for the worker group. Thus  although the EBV of the worker group and of a replacement queen are identical (Eq. ())  accuracy of the EBV is lower for the replacement queen (Eq. ())  because the genetic variance among replacement queens is larger than that among worker groups. The size of  follows from Eq. () in the course of developing  according to []. The value for  follows from the standard error of prediction (SEP) of the BLUP in the usual way  Note that the denominator of the second term in the square root is  and not . Equations () and () show that the relationship between DPQ in the base population () depends on the population’s history. When the base population is part of an ongoing bee breeding program  this relationship is higher (Eq. ()) than for a newly started breeding program (Eq. ()). To study the effect of erroneous assumptions for  on estimates of genetic parameters  we carried out simulations. For both the simulations and the analysis of the simulated data  we considered two alternatives for   either unrelatedness (Eq. ()) or equilibrium values (Eq. ()). Thus  we investigated a 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 design  with a total of four scenarios. Each scenario was replicated 40 times. The equations needed for the simulation were taken from []. In the first year  DPQ (sires) were simulated that produce drones fertilizing queens that were simulated in the second year. Sires in the first three years and dams in years two and three were base parents. Base dams were unrelated. The additive genetic relationships between DPQ in base sires either corresponded to Eqs. () or (). We assumed that  and  followed from a Poisson distribution  so that  and  []. Each queen in average mated with 12 drones () that descended from 10 different sires (). With these values  relationships between DPQ in the base population were  and  Every year  10 sires () were mated to 10 queens each  and each queen produced five offspring. This led to 500 queens with colonies and phenotypes per year. Queens belonging to the same full-sib family were mated to the same sire. Sires were assigned at random  with the restriction that each sire contributed 10  5<U+2009>=<U+2009>50 offspring. Every year one new sire was selected at random from each sire family (1 out of 50)  and one new dam was selected at random from each dam family (1 out of 5). Simulated genetic parameters were<U+2009><U+2009> <U+2009><U+2009>  the genetic correlation between worker and queen effect was -<U+2009>0.5  and<U+2009><U+2009>. For all datasets  variance components were estimated with ASReml []  using a relationship matrix  that either assumed unrelated DPQ in the base population (  or equilibrium relationships between DPQ (. Inputs for ASReml were identifications of groups of workers and dams  the observations  and the inverse of the relationship matrix according to []. Results in Table  show that the estimates of the (co)variance components and derived parameters were unbiased when the assumption for the base sires in the analysis agreed with the simulation. When the simulation assumed unrelated base animals while the analysis assumed equilibrium relationships  the variances of worker and queen effects and their covariance were underestimated by a factor of approximately . Heritabilities were also underestimated. When the simulation assumed equilibrium relationships while the analysis assumed unrelated base animals  results mirrored the previous situation and the (co)variance components were overestimated by a factor of approximately . For practical implementation  it is important to have a good understanding of the additive genetic relationship between DPQ in the base generation. For a starting breeding programme  these queens can be considered as unrelated  as assumed for example in []. If the colonies with these queens are kept at mating stations similar to the breeding programme that is starting up  then the relationship between DPQ may be calculated assuming that the number of DPQ equals the usual number in the programme. If there is open mating in the base population  a far larger number of DPQ should be used in Eqs. (5). See Eqs. (24a) and (24b) in [] for how the number of DPQ affects . Baudry et al. [] reported a value of 240 DPQ with open mating  but this number will obviously depend on the concentration of colonies and the geography of the region. When the analysis concerns a dataset that involves recent years in a longer-running programme  a reasonable assumption is that the additive genetic relationship between DPQ is in equilibrium. If the interest lies in the BV for queen effect  or in the BV for worker effect  but not in their sum  then the SEP required to calculate the accuracy of the EBV is usually included in the output of software for breeding value estimation (  ASReml []). However  when the genetic analysis includes both worker and queen effects  the interest usually lies in the summed EBV for worker and queen effects of replacement queens    because this “index” determines response to selection. To calculate the accuracy of this index for a prospective replacement queen  we first need the SEP of the corresponding value for the worker group of the colony  . The SEP of the index for the worker group depends on the diagonals of the inverse of the coefficient matrix for queen and worker effect of the worker group and on the corresponding off-diagonal. In ASReml  the  of the worker group can be obtained by inclusion of the command line (personal communication Arthur Gilmour) directly after the line defining the model. In Eq. ()   and  refer to sequence numbers in the pedigree file (of note: we experienced a limit to the size of  that can be dealt with in a single ASReml-run.) Subsequently  the accuracy of the index for a replacement queen follows from substituting the SEP for the worker group into Eq. ()  where  now refers to the sum of both BV    and then applying Eq. (). Our results show that estimates of (co)variance components and derived genetic parameters are seriously biased (25% too high or too low) when assumptions in the statistical analysis on the relationship between DPQ in the base population do not agree with reality. Generally  the history of the base population will be sufficiently well known to decide what assumption to make such that the bias can be avoided. Brascamp EW  Bijma P.

After domestication  geographic isolation of some goat breeds has resulted in distinct genetic structures. Furthermore  our work highlights several positively selected genes that likely contributed to breed-related traits in domestic goats. Modern livestock were domesticated tens of thousands of years ago [  ]  and provide an invaluable resource for fulfilling basic human needs. After dispersal throughout the world from domestication centers  domestic animals have genetically adapted to local environmental factors (e.g.  temperature  humidity  and oxygen content) over time [   ]. In addition  domestic animals have been subjected to artificial directional selection for different purposes  such as coat color and meat and milk production [  ]. The phenotypic variation of a Mendelian trait in livestock can be determined by a single genetic locus with large effect  e.g.  plumage color in Pekin ducks []. In such cases  artificial selection or adaptation to local conditions usually leads to a rapid increase in the frequency of the desirable allele at the population level and leaves a classical selection signature that is referred to as a “hard sweep” []. In another scenario  multiple independent mutations at one locus in a population introduced by e.g. migrations or mutation events are all similarly advantageous and their frequencies tend to increase slowly by selection  which produces one type of soft sweeps [] that is usually more difficult than hard sweeps to detect using the standard methods of detection of signatures of selection [  ]. Furthermore  artificial selection in livestock acts mainly on quantitative traits (e.g.  body weight and size) and is prone to result in polygenic adaptation []. Based on an analysis of eight domestic cattle breeds with an<U+2009>~<U+2009>800 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip  Kemper et al. [] reported that strong artificial selection for quantitative traits (e.g.  milk yield) left little or no classic signatures of selection  whereas recent studies have revealed selection signatures for some complex traits  such as fiber and meat production traits in goats [  ]  immune traits in sheep []  and milk-related traits in cattle []. It is widely accepted that the Bezoar is the wild ancestor of domestic goats and that the domestication center was the Fertile Crescent [    ]. After domestication  long-term selection for morphological traits created many goat breeds with diverse phenotypes (regarding e.g.  coat color  horn shape  and hair type) []  but the genetic loci that underlie these phenotypic variations in domestic goats are largely unknown  particularly for economically important traits. To address this issue  many studies have sought to identify the signatures of selection that may be associated with important traits in goats based on comparative genomic analyses. For example  Wang et al. [] showed that the genes  for fiber-related traits in cashmere goats   for coat color  and  for adaptation to high-altitude were under positive selection in eight goat populations. Genomic comparisons between Dazu black and Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats showed that several regions of selective sweeps were related to reproduction and production traits []. In a previous study  we showed that three loci involved in pigmentation (i.e.  -  -  and ) were under positive selection in domestic goats [] but the evidence was weak mainly because individual genotypes were unavailable from our pooled sequence data. Compared to methods for population genetic analyses based on SNP data  those based on haplotype homozygosity and frequency could improve the power of detection for loci under selection [    ]. Based on more than 3000 sampled goats that originated mainly from Europe and Africa  the Goat ADAPTmap consortium has recently investigated signatures of selection and the strong partitioning of diversity caused by geographic isolation [  ]  and provided the first comprehensive picture of the global domestication and adaptation of domestic goat breeds. However  the studies of the Goat ADAPTmap consortium did not include goat breeds from China [  ]  although large numbers of domestic goats are raised in China under different environments []. For example  animals that are located in the Sichuan Basin  which is surrounded by very high and extensive mountains since thousands of years ago  may have a highly distinctive genetic structure due to their geographic isolation. Moreover  the Tibetan Plateau that is adjacent to the Sichuan Basin has a very harsh environment (e.g.  low temperatures and oxygen levels). In this study  we sequenced the whole genome of 38 goats from three Chinese breeds from the Sichuan basin and the Tibetan Plateau. Then  we performed comparative population genomics analyses by comparing our sequencing data with sequence data of 30 goats from five other breeds and 21 Bezoar ibexes to investigate the evolutionary history and the signatures of selection that underlie the phenotypic differences in various goat breeds after domestication. In this study  we sequenced the genome of 38 animals that were unrelated within three generations of three Chinese goat breeds: Jintang Black (JT) from a breeding farm in Jintang County  Chengdu Brown (CB) from a breeding farm in Dayi County  and Tibetan Cashmere (TC) from Coqen County in Tibet. Specifically  the genomic DNA of these 38 Chinese goats was extracted from whole blood samples using the E.Z.N.A. TM Blood DNA Kit (OMEGA  USA). The DNA samples of the 14 TC goats were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X10 sequencer in paired-end 150 bp mode at Novogene (Beijing  China)  whereas the DNA samples of the 15 CB and nine JT goats were sequenced on the BGISEQ-500 platform in 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>100 bp mode at BGI (Shenzhen  China). We downloaded genome sequence data of 21 Bezoar ibexes (BI) and 30 other goat individuals: two Alpine (AL)  two Saanen (SA)  14 Draa (from Morocco  MD)  and eight Moroccan Northern (MN) goats from the Nextgen project (dataset number PRJEB3136  PRJEB5900  and PRJEB3134)  and four Shaanbei Cashmere goats (SC) (PRJNA422206) from NCBI. After removing read pairs that contained adapter sequences  the raw reads were quality controlled by using the Trimmomatic software [] (v0.36)  with the following parameters: LEADING: 20  TRAILING: 20  SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:20 and MINLEN: 50 (see Additional file ). High-quality reads were then mapped against the goat reference genome [] (assembly ARS1  ) using the ‘mem’ algorithm of BWA [] (v0.7.12) with default parameters. We applied the Picard software (v2.10.6) () to remove duplicated reads and then GATK (v3.8-0) [] for local realignment around existing indels and base quality score recalibration. For quality control of the variants  we used the GATK software to filter the raw variant calls (SNPs and indels) with the following cut-off values: QUAL<U+2009><<U+2009>100.0  QD<U+2009><<U+2009>2.0  MQ<U+2009><<U+2009>40.0  FS<U+2009>><U+2009>60.0  SOR<U+2009>><U+2009>3.0  MQRankSum<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>12.5  and ReadPosRankSum<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>8.0 (see Additional file )  and VCFtools [] to remove the variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05 and variants with more than 10% missing genotypes at the meta-population level. Finally  biallelic SNPs were extracted and used in the subsequent analyses. SnpEff [] (v4.3) was used for SNP variant annotation and effect prediction. The nucleotide diversity (p) [] in 10-kb non-overlapping windows was first calculated using VCFtools []. The genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) r in each breed was calculated using the PopLDdecay [] (v3.4.0) software based on the high-quality SNPs. We also applied PLINK [] to detect runs of homozygosity (ROH) in each goat breed  with the command ‘–homozyg-window-kb 5000 –cow –homozyg-window-snp 50 –homozyg-window-het 1 –homozyg-snp 10 –homozyg-kb 100 –homozyg-density 10 –homozyg-gap 100’. The parameter ‘–cow’ was used to indicate the number (i.e.  29) of autosomes in the goat genome since cow and goat have the same number of autosomes. Following Bertolini et al. []  we also calculated the ROH-based inbreeding coefficient () for each breed  which was defined as the average fraction of the genome covered by ROH  by considering a total length of 2.92 Gb for the goat reference genome (ARS1). To explore the degree of admixture between the sampled goats  genetic admixture analysis was carried out with the ADMIXTURE [] (v1.3.0) software by varying the number of presumed ancestral populations. We also carried out principal component analysis (PCA) implemented in GCTA [] (v1.26.0) to analyze the genetic relationships after converting the file including biallelic SNPs into PLINK PED format with PLINK []. We applied the Treemix [] (v1.13) software to infer the historical relationships and possible gene flow between populations at the population level. To identify the optimal number (“m”) of migration events  we ran 20 iterations for each migration event (m<U+2009>=<U+2009>1–9) with a different random k value (1000–10 000) (i.e.  the number of SNPs per block for the estimation of covariance matrix). We then used the OptM R package to pinpoint the optimal “m” (). To identify the signals of positive selection that are driven by artificial selection and genetic adaptation to the local environment after domestication  we calculated the genome-wide fixation index (  i.e. Weir and Cockerham’s estimator [])  Tajima’s D [] and <U+03B8> ratios (i.e.  <U+03B8>·BI/<U+03B8>·TC  <U+03B8>·BI/<U+03B8>·CB  and <U+03B8>·BI/<U+03B8>·JT) in 10-kb non-overlapping windows across the autosomes between domestic goat and Bezoar ibex populations using VCFtools []. We also calculated the haplotype homozygosity-based statistic iHH12 [] (i.e.  H12 []) in selscan []  after inferring the haplotype phase and imputing the missing alleles with Beagle (v4.0) [] with default parameters. To detect the genomic loci that are associated with adaptation to high-altitude  we also calculated the pairwise  and <U+03B8> ratios (<U+03B8>·Control/<U+03B8>·TC) in 10-kb windows between the highland breed (TC) and the lowland control group of breeds (CB  JT  MD  and MN). Finally  we averaged the normalized iHH12 of each biallelic SNP site in 10-kb non-overlapping windows. To reduce the number of false positives  only the outlier windows (with a number of SNPs<U+2009>=<U+2009>10) showing extremely high   <U+03B8> ratio  and iHH12 values (corresponding to the 5% right end of the tail) were identified as selection signals. Statistical analysis was conducted in the R Statistical Programming Language []. According to genome annotation  a gene was assumed to be under positive selection if it overlapped with a selection signal. To obtain an in-depth view of the biological significance of the candidate selection signals in each breed  we carried out Gene Ontology (GO)  KEGG and MGI Mammalian Phenotype (MGI-MP) analyses for the identified genes using Enrichr []. Because no goat genome information is available in Enrichr  we used the human homolog gene symbols. Because  has a major role in the regulation of hair fiber traits in animals [    ]  we validated one novel SNP (chr6: 95418992  c.-253G>A) in the 5'UTR of  that could result in a premature protein (for details  see the Results section). A primer pair was designed to amplify the target fragments that contained this SNP (forward primer: 5'-ACTCACTCACTCGGCATTTC-3'; reverse primer: 5'-CGTGGGAGCCATTGACTTT-3'). Similarly  given the significant role of  in the synthesis of pheomelanin in animals []  one SNP (chr13: 63249342  c.383G>T) in exon 3 (which is the 4th exon in NCBI) of  was also validated using Sanger sequencing with a primer pair (forward primer: 5'-AGTGGGGCGGACGTGGATG-3'; reverse primer: 5'-GCAGGGGACTAGGCGAAGG-3'). DNA samples of each of the five homozygous goats with either the reference or mutant allele were selected as template for PCR. All the purified PCR products were directly sequenced on an ABI 3730XL sequencer (Applied Bio-System  USA) at Tsingke Biological Biotechnology Co.  Ltd. (Chengdu  China) using the forward primer. Sequences were analyzed with the DNASTAR software (v.7.1). Based on our genome sequence data for 38 goats from three Chinese goat breeds (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Table S1) and the whole-genome sequence data from 30 individuals of five other goat breeds and 21 Bezoar ibexes downloaded from NCBI (see Additional file : Table S2)  19 791 420 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) (18 082 455 biallelic and 109 280 multiallelic SNPs and 1 599 685 indels) were identified across these 89 goat autosomal genomes (see Additional file : Table S3). At the population level (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05)  10 656 569  12 580 085  and 12 491 330 biallelic SNPs were detected in the CB  JT  and TC breeds  respectively (see Additional file : Table S3). Such a high density of SNPs (7.33 biallelic SNPs/kb across the autosomes) enabled an accurate search for signatures of selection in the goat genome. According to genome annotation  most of the SNPs (89.67%) and indels (89.13%) were located in intergenic and intronic regions  but the proportions of exonic SNPs and indels were only 0.88% and 0.26%  respectively (see Additional file : Table S4). Sample information and geographic distribution of the 89 goats included in this study. Geographic locations of the eight domestic goat breeds and Bezoar ibexes included in this study: Tibetan Cashmere (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>14)  Chengdu Brown (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15)  Jintang Black (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>9)  Shaanbei Cashmere (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4)  Saanen (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2)  Alpine (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2)  Draa (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>14)  Moroccan Northern (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8)  and Bezoar ibex (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>21) The genome-wide average p in 10-kb non-overlapping windows for the five domestic goat (i.e.  CB  JT  TC  MD  and MN) and Bezoar ibex populations ranged from 1.51<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (CB) to 1.92<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (MN)  which indicates a low genetic diversity in each of these breeds (see Additional file : Figure S1a). Furthermore  the breeds with a low p had a high ROH coverage (see Additional file : Figures S1a  b). Among the goat breeds studied here  CB exhibited the largest number of ROH (from 1526 to 2128)  the highest ROH coverage (from 407.44 to 729.21 Mb)  and the highest inbreeding level (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.194) (see Additional file : Figure S1b and Additional file : Table S5). Among the four categories of ROH size considered in this study  short ROH (0–250 kb) were the most frequent (ranging from 56.40% in the Bezoar ibexes to 82.23% in TC)  whereas long ROH (><U+2009>1 Mb) accounted for 1.11% (TC) to 8.48% (Bezoar ibex) of the total ROH (see Additional file : Figure S1c). In addition  the genome-wide mean LD measured by r was largest between adjacent SNP pairs (0.56 to 0.65) in CB  JT  TC  MD  MN  and Bezoar ibex populations (Fig. a)  and decreased rapidly to 0.2 at a distance of 5 kb. The most rapid decay of LD was observed for the Bezoar ibex followed by TC  whereas it decayed at a slightly slower rate in CB and JT from the Sichuan Basin compared to MN and MD and Bezoar ibex. Population genetics analyses of the eight domestic goat and Bezoar ibex populations.  Decay of linkage disequilibrium in CB  JT  TC  MD  MN  and Bezoar ibex.  Proportions of genetic ancestry for the 89 sampled goats with a number of ancestral clusters ranging from 2 to 4.  PCA of the 89 sampled goats based on the identified biallelic SNPs.  Maximum likelihood tree for the eight domestic goat populations. Bezoar ibexes were chosen as the outgroup Although the genetic admixture analysis was performed by assuming a number of ancestral populations (K) ranging from 2 to 9  the results showed that K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4 was the most plausible number of genetically distinct clusters for the 89 sampled goats (Fig. b). In this scenario  all CB  TC  MN  and MD individuals represented a mixture of alleles from three populations of unknown ancestry  which do not agree with the genetic information of eight of the Bezoar ibexes. In contrast  the other 13 Bezoar ibexes were resolved as an admixture of three populations: a wild goat population  a Moroccan population  and a Tibetan goat population. The JT and SC individuals from China showed admixture of the ancestral populations  to some extent. According to the genome-wide  in 10-kb sliding windows  CB was the most diverged breed (average weighted <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.22) from the Bezoar ibex  followed by JT (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.17)  TC (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.14)  MD (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.14)  and MN (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.14) (<U+2009><<U+2009>2.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  Mann–Whitney U test). In addition  a moderate divergence was observed between CB and JT (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11) or TC (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.15). PCA clearly showed that all the individuals of each domestic goat breed clustered close together in small groups (Fig. c)  whereas the 21 Bezoar ibexes clustered loosely  in accordance with the results of the genetic admixture analysis with K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 and 4. Strikingly  the first eigenvector separated the four Chinese goat populations (CB  JT  SC  and TC) from the Bezoar ibexes (9.28% of the explained variance)  whereas the two Moroccan (MD and MN) and the two European breeds (SA and AL) were further separated from the Bezoar ibexes along the second eigenvector axis (6.72% of the explained variance). According to the analysis without considering migration events  the eight domestic goat breeds were divided into two large clusters at the population level: one that comprised the European and Moroccan populations and another that included the Chinese populations  which was consistent with the PCA and the population coancestry analysis of individual genomes (see Additional file : Figure S2a). When migration edges (m<U+2009>=<U+2009>1–9) were added to the maximum likelihood (ML) tree  the optimal number of migration events was found to be 2 using OptM (see Additional file : Figure S2b and 2c). In this scenario  two migration edges were observed from AL (France) to MN (Morocco) and from MD (Morocco) to SC (China) (Fig. d). To identify signatures of positive selection  we calculated iHH12 scores and pairwise  and <U+03B8> ratios in 10-kb sliding windows across the autosomes between the three Chinese goat breeds and the Bezoar ibexes. In total  1089  749  and 664 outlier windows (corresponding to 0.44  0.30  and 0.27% of the genome) were identified as regions of selective sweeps in TC (iHH12<U+2009>><U+2009>1.93  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.33  and <U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>><U+2009>1.81)  CB (iHH12<U+2009>><U+2009>2.33  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.46  and <U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>><U+2009>2.89)  and JT (iHH12<U+2009>><U+2009>2.04  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.38  and <U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>><U+2009>2.18)  respectively (Fig. a  b) and (see Additional file : Figures S3a–d and Additional file : Table S6). Based on genome annotation  we identified 388  248  and 245 genes under selection (Ensembl ID) in the TC  CB  and JT goats  respectively (see Additional file : Table S7 and Additional file : Figure S3e). Although the CB and JT breeds are present in neighboring regions in the Sichuan basin  only 28 genes under selection were shared between these breeds (see Additional file : Figure S3e)  which indicates that their respective selection targets differed. In addition  we detected 322  206  and 181 breed-specific genes under selection in the three Chinese breeds  respectively (see Additional file : Figure S3e). Genome-wide selection signals identified in Tibetan Cashmere goats.  Distribution of log(<U+03B8> ratios) and  values calculated in 10-kb sliding windows between TC and Bezoar ibex. The data points in red (corresponding to the top 5% of the empirical distribution) indicate the signatures of selection in TC.  Manhattan plot of iHH12 across all 29 autosomes with different colors in TC. The iHH12 values were calculated in 10-kb sliding windows.  Distribution of log(<U+03B8> ratios) and  values calculated in 10-kb sliding windows between TC and the lowland group of goat breeds (including CB  JT  MD  and MN).  Venn diagram for the positively selected genes identified in TC from two different comparisons (i.e.  TC versus Bezoar ibex and TC versus the four lowland breeds (CB  JT  MD  and MN) To better understand the biological implications of the selection signals  a functional enrichment analysis was conducted for the positively selected genes (PSG) in each breed (see Additional file : Table S8). At the molecular and phenotypic levels  no significantly enriched terms (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) were found for the genes under selection in CB. In contrast  the PSG in JT were significantly enriched in five GO terms  i.e. ‘Molecular Functions’ (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  including adenyl ribonucleotide binding (11 PSG  e.g.     and )  phosphatidylinositol-4 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase activity (5 PSG  e.g.     and ) and ATP binding (9 PSG  e.g.     and ). Although the enrichment analysis did not provide strong evidence of links between the selective sweep regions and economically important traits  several PSG may be relevant for the CB breed (e.g.     and ) and the JT breed (e.g.       and ) (Table )  based on their biological functions and the phenotypic characteristics of the two breeds. At the phenotypic level  the PSG detected in TC were significantly enriched in 12 MGI-MP terms (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) (see Additional file : Table S8). Seven of these categories were directly involved in circulation development and related diseases  including trabecula carnea hypoplasia (6 PSG  e.g.     and )  hemorrhage (13 PSG  e.g.   and )  thin myocardium (7 PSG  e.g.     and )  and cyanosis (11 PSG  e.g.     and ). In addition  two enriched terms were also related to immunity: decreased thymocyte number (8 PSG e.g.     and ) and abnormal splenic cell ratio (5 PSG  e.g.     and ). To investigate the genetic loci that underlie adaptation to high-altitude in the domestic goat genome  we conducted a pairwise comparison of the genome-wide variations between the highland breed (i.e.  TC) and the four lowland breeds (i.e.  CB  JT  MD  and MN) as the control group. It is noteworthy that the four lowland goat breeds have short hair. Thus  the selection signals associated with hair-related traits can be included here. In total  731 outlier windows (iHH12<U+2009>><U+2009>1.93  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.18  and <U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>><U+2009>1.85) (Fig. c) and (see Additional file : Table S9) that encompassed 247 genes (Fig. d) and (see Additional file : Table S10) were detected as selection signals in TC. Among these genes  113 (e.g.         and ) overlapped with the positively selected genes identified in the comparison between TC and Bezoar ibexes (Fig. d)  which suggests that they may be involved in adaptation to high-altitude or cashmere traits. The MGI-MP analysis showed that these genes under selection were significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) enriched in pigmentation  hair growth  and bone and nervous system disorders (see Additional file : Table S11)  including diluted coat color (e.g.     and )  abnormal hair follicle morphology (6 PSG  e.g.     and )  abnormal skeleton development (7 PSG  e.g.     and )  abnormal chondrocyte morphology (6 PSG  e.g.     and )  decreased compact bone thickness (6 PSG  e.g.     and )  abnormal telencephalon morphology (5 PSG  e.g.     and )  and abnormal synaptic depression (2 PSG   and ). We also found that three other positively selected genes      and   were significantly enriched in hair growth (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  as described below  considering that hair growth or normal skin function is very important for adaptation to low temperatures or strong UV radiation. Among the signatures of selection associated with adaptation to high-altitude  a signature between 95.41 and 95.45 Mb on chromosome 6 (iHH12<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.32  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.47  and <U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.34) was detected in TC (Fig. b  c)  which was also supported by the Tajima’s D values (Fig. a). One hundred and eighty SNPs and 18 indels were detected across the nine populations analyzed (see Additional file : Table S12)  including three synonymous substitutions in the exons (c.273T>C  c.450A>G  and c.699T>A) of   which is a key regulator of hair length.

Pairwise LD between the three missense SNPs (chr24: 25 985 493  25 985 494  and 25 985 569) and other SNPs in the  gene in TC. Squares in pink or red indicate significant LD between SNP pairs (bright red indicates pairwise D'<U+2009>=<U+2009>1).  The haplotype frequencies composed of the seven SNPs showing perfect LD in the five domestic goat breeds (CB  JT  TC  MD  and MN) and Bezoar ibexes The absence of functional changes in the predicted FGF5 amino acid sequence prompted us to examine the effect of SNPs in noncoding regions. In the 89 goat genomes analyzed  only two SNPs (chr6: 95 418 992  95 419 200; c.-253G>A and c.-45G>A) were detected in the 5'-UTR of  (see Additional file : Table S12)  and the first mutation (c.-253G>A) was validated by Sanger sequencing (Fig. b). These two SNPs displayed a high level of divergence (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.66 and 0.41  respectively) between TC and the other goat breeds (see Additional file : Table S12). The major allele at the c.-253G>A SNP in TC is the mutant allele “”  with a frequency of 78.57%  whereas in the other populations it is the reference allele  “” (JT: 92.86%  CB: 70.00%  MD: 100.00%  MN: 100.00%  and BI: 100.00%) (Fig. c). In addition  all four SC individuals were homozygous . As shown in Fig. d  the mutant allele “” introduces a start codon that results in a premature protein with an amino acid sequence that is completely different from the normal amino acid FGF5 sequence. Compared to the Bezoar ibexes and the four lowland domestic goat breeds  the genomic region that harbors exon 1 of  and   and exons 2 to 15 of   at 25.95–26.07 Mb on chromosome 24  exhibited strong evidence of positive selection (iHH12<U+2009>=<U+2009>23.46  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65  and <U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.25) in TC (Figs. a–c  and e) and (see Additional file : Table S5 and Additional file : Table S6). In total  865 SNPs and 89 indels were detected across the nine populations analyzed (see Additional file : Table S12)  including six and seven missense SNPs in the exons of  and   respectively. Moreover  the pairwise  for each biallelic SNP in this region showed that 136 SNPs were highly divergent (average <U+2009>><U+2009>0.80) (see Additional file : Table S12) between TC  the four lowland goat breeds (CB  JT  MD  and MN) and the Bezoar ibexes  and included three missense SNPs in exon 12 of  (c.1790G>A  c.1789C>G  c.1714G>A; chr24: 25 985 493  25 985 494  and 25 985 569; average <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.91  0.91  and 0.83  respectively). Strikingly  the first of these two single nucleotide substitutions were adjacent and resulted in a change in arginine to glutamic acid (Arg597Glu)  and the third mutation caused a glycine to serine (Gly572Ser) substitution. The estimated pairwise r showed substantial LD (r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.2) between the SNPs located in the region 25 981 644–25 990 264 bp in TC (Fig. f). In particular  perfect LD (D'<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and r<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) was observed between the above three missense SNPs  three other SNPs in intron 12 (c.1891+ 619T>C  c.1891+ 398G>A  and c.1891+ 397T>A; chr24: 25 984 773  25 984 994  and 25 984 995) and one SNP in intron 11 (c.1640-37T>C; chr24: 25 985 680). Accordingly  only two haplotypes were detected in TC  Haplo1 (CAAAGGT) and Haplo2 (TGTGCAC). The three missense sites (i.e.  c.1790G>A  c.1789C>G  and c.1714G>A) tagged the two haplotypes  with the AGG- allele tagging Haplo1 and the GCA- allele tagging Haplo2 (Fig. g). In TC  Haplo1 was almost fixed  with a frequency of 92.9%  but none of the individuals were homozygous for Haplo2. However  Haplo2 was present in a majority of the Bezoar ibexes (61.9%) and the lowland goat populations (CB: 53.3%  JT: 49.9%  MD: 57.1%  and MN: 87.5%) (Fig. g). In TC  a selective sweep region (18.02–18.18 Mb) that overlapped the  on chromosome 5 was assumed to be under positive selection (Figs. a  b  and a) and (see Additional file : Table S6  and Additional file : Table S7) and was associated with adaptation to high-altitude (Fig. c) and (see Additional file : Table S9 and Additional file : Table S10). In particular  among the JT  CB  TC  MD  and MN and Bezoar ibex populations  the p values for this chromosomal region were lowest in TC (see Additional file : Figure S4). Among the 1785 SNPs and 164 indels detected in the nine goat breeds analyzed here (see Additional file : Table S12)  one missense SNP was observed in exon 2 of the  gene (c.73A>T  p.Thr25Ser)  but no significant differences in allele frequency were found between TC and the other goat populations. Furthermore  the corresponding small region between 18.10 and 18.17 Mb had a very low Tajima’s D value. In this region (Fig. b)  13 SNPs exhibited perfect pairwise LD (D'<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and r<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)  and the dominant haplotype was ‘CGGAACCGGCCGA’  with a high frequency of 89.3%  whereas these sites segregated in the Bezoar ibex and other domestic populations (i.e.  CB  JT  TC  MD and MN) (Fig. c).

However   is a relevant gene due to its important functions in the regulation of the synthesis of eumelanin and pheomelanin and the uniform black coat color of JT (Fig. ). It should be noted that although this region was not assumed to be under selection in CB (with a black-and-tan coat color) based on the outlier approach  the region that overlapped  showed a relatively high level of divergence (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20) and low nucleotide diversity (<U+03B8> ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.75) between CB and Bezoar ibexes (Fig. d). Among the 13 SNPs and three indels that were detected in  (see Additional file : Table S12)  one SNP (c.383G>T) caused a Gly-Val mutation (p.Gly128Val) in exon 3 of   which was validated by Sanger sequencing (Fig. e). However  JT and the other goat breeds carried mainly the mutant allele “” at this site  whereas the major allele in CB was the same as the reference allele “”. The frequencies of the reference allele “” were 78.57  39.29  31.25  18.75  0.00  and 0.00 in CB  MD  MN  JT  TC  and Bezoar ibex  respectively (Fig. f). In this study  we investigated the genetic composition and relationships and the signatures of selection after domestication in three native Chinese goat populations based on the genome sequence data of 68 domestic goats and 21 Bezoar ibexes. The population-based metrics (e.g.  p  LD  and ROH) within a breed reflect evolutionary factors such as natural/artificial selection  demographic history  and migration. For example  the genome-wide nucleotide diversity in zebu (i.e.  a primitive  breed) is much higher than that in commercial cattle breeds (approximately 1.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  including Angus and Holstein cattle [  ]. Genetic diversity across a variety of goat populations based on p values has been reported [  ]. However  the higher mutation rates and the small number of loci in the mitochondrial genome make it difficult to compare these results with those of our study. Compared to whole-genome studies in native cattle [  ] and sheep [  ]  the genome-wide nucleotide diversity in the goat genomes was lower  which is consistent with a previous report []. Furthermore  the genome-wide LD decay rates in the three Chinese goat breeds were very similar to those in other native goat breeds [  ] but slightly higher than those in Boer  Nubian  and Toggenburg goats []. ROH refer to genomic segments that show consecutive homozygous genotypes and have been used to measure inbreeding in livestock []  including domestic goats [    ]. At the genome-wide level  the total ROH length in the three Chinese goat breeds was similar to that in other goat breeds [    ]. As shown in previous work []  the increased homozygosity in local goat breeds is a consequence of the small size of the populations  inbreeding  and even geographic isolation. Among the goat breeds included here  the largest ROH number and genome coverage were observed in CB  an ancient native breed  which implies a small population size with inbreeding. A recent study demonstrated the strong partitioning of the genetic diversity in domestic goats around the world  which is caused by geographic isolation or decreased local gene flow driven by humans []. Based on the population genetic analysis  we found that TC and CB goats inherited ancestral genetic information that differed considerably from that of the Bezoar ibexes. Furthermore  CB goats are significantly more divergent from the Bezoar ibex than the Bezoar ibex from the other domestic goat populations. Therefore  these results collectively suggest that the genetic composition of this breed is highly distinctive and is very likely caused by isolation due to geographical barriers (i.e.  mountains)  which is supported by previous findings on other species from the Sichuan Basin [  ]. A striking finding in our study is that the genomes of some Bezoar ibexes were found to result from an admixture of three ancestral populations: a wild goat population  a Moroccan population  and a Tibetan goat population  which indicates that the Bezoar ibex has hybridized with domesticated breeds showing close genetic relationships to TC and Moroccan goats. In the past several years  there has been a growing interest for the identification of genetic loci that contribute to adaptation to high-altitude in humans [  ] and animals [    ]. Compared to the genome of Bezoar ibexes  we identified many positively selected genes in TC. Interestingly  20 of these positively selected genes (e.g.         and ) were also detected in Tibetan sheep  suggesting common targets of selection since both species have genetically adapted to high altitude []. Furthermore  the comparison to lowland domestic goats showed that the diversifying selected genes that underlie adaptation to high-altitude were involved mainly in abnormal bone  nervous system and hair follicle development in TC  which is consistent with the phenotypic characterization of this breed (e.g.  small body size and cashmere traits). Previous studies have revealed the biological functions of some of these selected genes in biological processes  which support our findings. For example  the  gene is not only related to testicular dysplasia in humans and mice [  ] but also plays important roles in bone metabolism and osteoporosis []. In wild sheep  the  locus was identified as a signature of selection underlying sexual selection for female choice [  ] due to its significant functions in bone development. Several SNPs and an insertion within or around  are significantly correlated with horn types in domestic sheep [  ]. Recently  Pan et al. verified that  was under strong selection associated with unique horn phenotypes (i.e.  greater horn length and spiral and horizontally extended horn shape) as a response to semi-feralization in Tibetan sheep []. Furthermore  a signature of selection overlapping with  was identified in goats from Southwestern Europe and central Asia []  particularly in Thari and Blanca de Rasquera goats. Although two missense SNPs were found in the nine goat populations examined in this study  the differences in allele frequency did not support the assumption that they may be under selection. It has been established that   which encodes HIF-2a  is involved in complex oxygen sensing and regulates the expression of many genes [].  is a tumor suppressor gene with phosphatase activity  and loss of this gene facilitates HIF-1a-mediated gene expression []. Recent studies demonstrated that  and  were under positive selection in native Tibetan humans [    ]  dogs [  ] and goats [] driven by adaptation to high-altitude. In addition to the essential roles of cartilage formation []  a genome-wide significant association between one SNP in  and blood pressure traits has been reported in humans []. In the following sections  we discuss mainly about several genes under selection that were highlighted and could be promising candidate genes underlying hair growth or coat color in goats. Cashmere-related traits (e.g.  fiber length) are the most important economic traits in TC and are shaped by artificial selection and adaptation to low temperatures (the average yearly temperature is below 0 °C in Coqen county).  is a key regulator of hair fiber traits in animals [    ]  and its disruption via the CRISPR/Cas9 system leads to longer fibers in genome-edited goats [  ] and sheep []. However  the natural causal mutations underlying these phenotypes in cashmere goats are still unknown. In this study  we found that one SNP (c.-253G>A) in the 5'-UTR of  resulted in a start codon that could lead to a premature/dysfunctional protein. Importantly  very large differences in allele frequency at this site were observed between cashmere goats (i.e.  TC and SC) and the goat populations with short hair. Moreover  all four SC individuals were homozygous for the mutant allele. Therefore  this mutation is likely a causal variant underlying a cashmere-related trait in TC and is driven by artificial selection and adaptation to low temperatures. In addition to the well-known genes under selection discussed above  the genomic loci that encompass     and  showed strong evidence of a selective sweep in the TC goats analyzed here. A recent exome sequencing study demonstrated that  was the most divergent locus between the Tibetan goat populations from Bange and Ritu and the lowland populations []. As an important class of the cadherin supergene family  desmogleins include four members (i.e.  DSG1  DSG2  DSG3  and DGS4) that mainly function as cell adhesion molecules for keratinocyte adhesion in skin [  ]. DSG could serve as targets for treating skin diseases and are involved in the autoimmune function in humans []. For example  mutations in  can cause the striate palmoplantar keratoderma skin disease in humans []; a homozygous deletion in  leads to the loss of keratinocyte adhesion and a blistering phenotype in mice []. In addition  DSG1 aids in the recovery of epidermal differentiation after acute UV light exposure []. Our previous study revealed a significant difference in the abundance of DSG3 protein between guard fiber and fine fiber in SC goats []  implying its important role in hair. Together with different population statistics  the core selected site seems to encompass the three missense SNPs in exon 12 of  in TC  which was validated in ten Chinese goat populations by Sanger sequencing []. In addition  four other SNPs showed perfect LD with the three missense mutations  and accordingly  only two haplotypes were detected in TC: i.e. Haplo1 (CAAAGGT)  which is almost fixed  and Haplo2 (TGTGCAC) for which there were no homozygous individuals. These results are consistent with a previous study []. In contrast  these SNP sites continue to segregate in the Bezoar ibex and other domestic goat populations. Notably  the same previous study [] did not support the assumption that  was functionally directly related to a cashmere-related trait  because distinct haplotypes were found between TC goats and lowland cashmere goats. In summary  the accumulation of these missense variants in TC is due to their beneficial effects on the function of  in skin and hair  which further contributed to their adaptation to high-altitude. In this study  because of the phenotypic variations in coat color in the nine goat populations analyzed  we examined whether some of the pigmentation genes were under selection. First  the genomic region overlapping the  gene was identified as a signature of selection in TC  which is consistent with our previous findings based on pooled sequencing []. The comparison of nucleotide diversity values in domestic goats from Iran and Morocco revealed that similar selection signals were present in the Bezoar ibexes []. Based on the p values for the region around  observed in our study for the Bezoar ibex and the five TC  CB  JT  MD  and MN breeds  the result reported by Alberto et al. [] may be a false positive due to sampling bias. Furthermore  whole-genome resequencing studies have revealed that similar regions are under strong selection in domestic sheep [  ] and Berkshire pigs []. Previous studies have demonstrated the significant roles of  in the regulation of skin and hair pigmentation  and one mutation in the regulatory region of  was shown to be a causal variant controlling blond hair in humans [  ].  is more strongly correlated with adaptation to low temperatures (i.e.  thermogenesis) than UV radiation in Asian populations []. In livestock   is significantly associated with UV-protective eye area pigmentation in cattle [] and reproductive traits in goats [] and horses []. Although there was one missense SNP in the coding region of   the moderate difference in allele frequency between the goat populations did not support this mutation as a causal variant. Strikingly  the SNPs that are in strong LD in the upstream region of  show a large difference in allele frequency between TC and the other goat breeds  which indicates that the causal variants may be located in regulatory regions  in accordance with previous findings in goats []  sheep [  ]  and humans []. However  we were unable to speculate about the causal mutations due to the lack of molecular experiments. Considering the extreme environmental conditions (e.g.  strong UV radiation and low temperatures) on the Tibetan Plateau  we concluded that the genomic region encompassing  was under strong selection in TC  mainly due to its pleiotropic effects. Three pigmentation genes      and   were assumed to be under selection in JT  and we examined more closely  because of its major role in the regulation of the synthesis of eumelanin and pheomelanin in animals []. In our study  we detected a selection signal that completely encompassed  in JT  which was in accordance with the findings in Taihang Black goats []. Although  was not under selection in CB  it has been reported that the region surrounding this gene is in a signature of selection in Alpine  Poitevine  Valdostana []  and Nanjiang Yellow [] goats with a black-and-tan pigmentation phenotype. More importantly  missense SNPs in  and copy number variations in goats have been reported [  ]. We identified a missense mutation (c.383G>T; p.Gly128Val) in exon 3 of  that was also found in European goat breeds from Italy []  but the patterns of allele frequency at this site were similar in all the studied goat populations except for CB in our study. In contrast  its allele frequency in CB was close to that (0.84) in Murciano-Granadina goats  which is consistent with the coat color patterns of both breeds []. However  this SNP did not show a significant association with coat color in Murciano-Granadina goats []. Furthermore  we did not detect a selection signal overlapping with  in domestic goats  although the SNPs in the regions upstream and downstream of  could separate black and white goats []. Based on a candidate gene association analysis  none of these SNPs have been significantly associated to red or yellow coat color  to date [  ]. In summary  the genetic loci that underlie black/red or yellow coat color are still elusive in goats  and GWAS involving a large number of individuals as well as molecular studies are necessary to identify plausible candidate mutations. In this work  we also identified several genes under selection that may underlie important traits in goats. In CB  for example   and  may play a role in reproduction or growth traits  as shown in other goat breeds [  ]  sheep []  and cattle [  ]. Although there have been few reports about its role in important traits in domestic animals [  ]   is also regarded as a strong signature of selection. This gene encodes a receptor for GABA that is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter and has therefore been related to anxiety []  depression []  and particularly alcohol dependence [  ]. In JT  the  gene has been assumed to be a strong selection signal and was previously detected in Egyptian goats  particularly in Nubian goats []. This genomic region was first identified as a major QTL affecting carcass weight in Japanese Black cattle []  and many studies have subsequently shown that the - region  which exerts a pleiotropic effect  is significantly associated with growth (e.g.  feed intake)  body size (e.g.  body weight)  and reproduction traits (e.g.  direct calving ease) in livestock  particularly in cattle (for a comprehensive review  see Takasuga []). After domestication  the genetic composition of Chengdu Brown goats from the Sichuan Basin became highly distinctive due to geographic isolation. Our work highlights genes that very likely contributed to breed standard traits. Taken together  these results provide an improved understanding of the evolutionary history of the domestic goat genome and its genes that have undergone artificial selection or are involved in the adaptation to local environments.

The “Appendix” shows that this holds when the number of individuals included in the statistics is large (several hundred or more) or when they are not structured into very large sibships. Otherwise  as shown in the “Appendix”  both the true regression coefficient   and its estimator  have an expectation less than 1  even when the model is perfect and the EBV have the right dispersion.” This statement is wrong  because a further expansion of the Taylor series (until its 3rd term) shows that the expectation of both  and  is 1. The correct paragraph should be:“In the remainder of this paper  we assume that the expectation of a ratio of quadratic forms is equal to the ratio of the expectations. The “Correction” below shows that this holds (up to the second order of the Taylor series expansion) when the BLUP properties hold  as assumed throughout the paper.” Moreover  the Abstract reads “Contrary to common belief  the regression of true on estimated breeding values is (on expectation) lower than 1 for small or related validation sets  due to family structures.” whereas it should read “Up to the second term of a Taylor series expansion  the regression of true on estimated breeding values is (on expectation) equal to 1  even for small or related validation sets.”Further proof (equivalent to the Appendix) is below. According to [] the second-order Taylor series expansion of a ratio is . Consider the bias in the estimation of the ratio  using the estimator . In our case:$$\hat{b}_{{w p}}  = \frac{{cov\left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  \widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{w} } \right)}}{{var\left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p} } \right)}} = {\text{ }}\frac{{\frac{1}{n}\left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{p} } \right)^{\prime } \left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{w}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{w} } \right)}}{{\frac{1}{n}\left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{p} } \right)^{\prime } \left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{p} } \right)}}. $$ Therefore  we expand  for  where  and  The expression for the covariance of bilinear forms (under normality) is:$$ \begin{aligned}& Cov\left( {{\mathbf{x}}_{1}^{\varvec{\prime}} {\mathbf{A}}_{12} {\mathbf{x}}_{2}  {\mathbf{x}}_{3} {\mathbf{A}}_{34} {\mathbf{x}}_{4} } \right) \\ & \quad  = tr\left( {{\mathbf{A}}_{12} {\mathbf{C}}_{23} {\mathbf{A}}_{34} {\mathbf{C}}_{41} + {\mathbf{A}}_{12} {\mathbf{C}}_{24} {\mathbf{A}}_{43} {\mathbf{C}}_{31} } \right) + {\varvec{\upmu}}_{1}^{\prime} {\mathbf{A}}_{12} {\mathbf{C}}_{23} {\mathbf{A}}_{34} {\varvec{\upmu}}_{4} \\ & \qquad + {\varvec{\upmu}}_{1}^{'} {\mathbf{A}}_{12} {\mathbf{C}}_{24} {\mathbf{A}}_{43} {\varvec{\upmu}}_{3} + {\varvec{\upmu}}_{2}^{\prime} {\mathbf{A}}_{21} {\mathbf{C}}_{13} {\mathbf{A}}_{34} {\varvec{\upmu}}_{4} + {\varvec{\upmu}}_{2}^{'} {\mathbf{A}}_{21} {\mathbf{C}}_{14} {\mathbf{A}}_{43} {\varvec{\upmu}}_{3} \end{aligned}  $$ ( is the covariance matrix across ; chapter 2 Equation 58 in []). Applied to our case  this yields:$$ Cov\left( {X Y} \right) = \frac{2}{{n^{2} }}tr\left( {{\mathbf{S}}\left( {{\mathbf{G}} - {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{uu} } \right){\mathbf{S}}\left( {{\mathbf{G}} - {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{uu} } \right)} \right).  $$The terms linked to the means disappear  as before  because they have the form   which has a value of 0. Then  we have:$$ \begin{gathered}   E\left( Y \right) = E\left( {\frac{1}{n}\left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{p} } \right)^{\prime } \left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{p} } \right)} \right) = \frac{1}{n}tr\left( {{\mathbf{S}}\left( {{\mathbf{G}} - {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{{uu}} } \right)} \right)  \hfill \\   Var\left( Y \right) = Cov\left( {Y Y} \right) = \frac{2}{{n^{2} }}tr\left( {{\mathbf{S}}\left( {{\mathbf{G}} - {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{{uu}} } \right){\mathbf{S}}\left( {{\mathbf{G}} - {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{{uu}} } \right)} \right)  \hfill \\   E\left( X \right){\text{ }} = E\left( {\frac{1}{n}\left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{p}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{p} } \right)^{\prime } \left( {\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}_{w}  - \overline{{\widehat{{\mathbf{u}}}}} _{w} } \right)} \right) = \frac{1}{n}tr\left( {{\mathbf{S}}\left( {{\mathbf{G}} - {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{{uu}} } \right)} \right)  \hfill \\  \end{gathered}  $$ which are all the elements needed. To simplify notation  consider . Putting all together gives:$$ \begin{aligned} & - \frac{{Cov\left( {X Y} \right)}}{{E\left( Y \right)^{2} }} + \frac{Var\left( Y \right)E\left( X \right)}{{E\left( Y \right)^{3} }}  \\ &= - \frac{{\frac{2}{{n^{2} }}tr\left( {{\mathbf{SKSK}}} \right)}}{{\left( {\frac{1}{n}tr\left( {{\mathbf{SK}}} \right)} \right)^{2} }} + \frac{{\frac{2}{{n^{2} }}tr\left( {{\mathbf{SKSK}}} \right)\frac{1}{n}tr\left( {{\mathbf{SK}}} \right)}}{{\left( {\frac{1}{n}tr\left( {{\mathbf{SK}}} \right)} \right)^{3} }} \\ & = - \frac{{2tr\left( {{\mathbf{SKSK}}} \right)}}{{\left( {tr\left( {{\mathbf{SK}}} \right)} \right)^{2} }} + \frac{{2tr\left( {{\mathbf{SKSK}}} \right)tr\left( {{\mathbf{SK}}} \right)}}{{\left( {tr\left( {{\mathbf{SK}}} \right)} \right)^{3} }}  \end{aligned}$$ which cancels out. Therefore  up to the 3rd order approximation  the bias in the estimation of  using the estimator  is 0. In addition  this shows that the expected value of  is also 1 since the same derivation as above holds with  in the place of .

Infectious disease transmission in a host population is a dynamic process. The probability that an animal is infected depends on its own susceptibility  on the number of infected contact animals (“group mates”)  and on the infectivity of those group mates. The number and composition of the infectious contact animals in a population varies over time  since some animals get infected while others recover. Whereas state-of-the-art epidemiological models take this variation into account  it should probably also be taken into account to make optimal genetic inference. However  most genetic studies use linear mixed models that ignore the dynamics of the transmission process in the population  such as the variation in exposure of susceptible individuals to infectious contact individuals. Moreover  studies on host genetic variability commonly connect an individual’s disease status to its own pedigree or genotype only  and therefore capture genetic effects related to susceptibility (or resistance) only [  ]. However  individuals probably also differ in infectivity  as suggested for example by the observation of superspreaders  which are animals that infect substantially more contact individuals compared to a typical infectious animal []. Recently  studies on selection against disease transmission have started that include the infectivity of the herd mates [    ]. Genetic inference on infectious diseases can probably be improved by using quantitative genetic models that are founded on epidemiological theory. Moreover  such models would give estimates of genetic variation and breeding values for fundamental epidemiological parameters  such as the basic reproduction number  (see also below). Such knowledge would also facilitate the prediction of response to selection while accounting for the non-linear nature of infectious diseases  including phenomena such as positive feedback and the eradication of a disease when  falls below 1 []. An animals’ infectivity affects the disease status of other animals  rather than its own disease status. Thus  if the observed variation in infectivity has a genetic component  then infectivity is a so-called indirect genetic effect (IGE). IGE can have a considerable effect on the rate and direction of evolution by natural selection  and on response to selective breeding [  ]. Hence  IGE can and should be used for the genetic improvement of populations whenever they play a role. Together  susceptibility  infectivity  and the duration of the infectious period determine the basic reproduction ratio ()  which is the average number of secondary cases caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population [].  contains information on the ability of an infection to transmit and establish itself in the population []  and has a threshold value of 1; if  is lower than 1  an infectious animal will infect  on average  less than one susceptible animal and the disease will die out with certainty. If  is higher than 1  an epidemic disease can affect a substantial proportion of the population  while an endemic disease may persist in the population. For endemic diseases  the prevalence at the equilibrium state depends on   and is (ignoring differences in susceptibility between individuals) equal to  when  is higher than 1. Because  determines the prevalence of a disease in a group of animals (e.g.  a herd)  breeding strategies that aim at reducing the prevalence should focus on reducing   ideally to a value lower than 1 []. In this study  we focused on the endemic infectious disease digital dermatitis (DD). DD is a claw disorder that affects (mainly) the hind feet of (dairy) cattle [  ]. Typically  affected cattle have a round lesion above the interdigital space next to the heel bulbs []. These lesions can be painful and prone to bleed  and can develop filiform papillae or be surrounded by hyperkeratotic skin with hairs longer than normal []. Severely affected cows show signs of lameness; they bear their weight on the toes of the affected foot  shake the foot as if in pain  and show reluctance to move [    ]. The herd prevalence of DD in 383 dairy herds in the Netherlands was estimated at 21.2% in 2003  and within these herds cow level prevalence estimates ranged from 0 to 83.0% []. Thus  DD has an impact on the welfare of cows and  furthermore  causes economic losses for the farmer [  ]. The prevalence of DD is affected by many factors  such as herd management  lactation stage  flooring system  climate  and breed []. Optimizing management strategies are one way to reduce the DD prevalence on a dairy farm []. An additional strategy could be to improve claw health through genetic selection [  ]. As we will argue  this is best done by selecting for lower . The objective of our work was to quantify the genetic variation in host susceptibility  host infectivity  and  for DD in Holstein Friesian dairy cattle  and to investigate our ability to estimate genomic breeding values (GEBV) for these traits. In addition  for model validation  models with and without genetic variation for infectivity will be compared for their ability to predict whether susceptible (infection-free) claws of an animal get infected. Phenotypes for DD were collected on 12 dairy cattle farms in the Netherlands  between November 2014 and April 2015. Two observers (author FB being one of them) visited these farms 11 times with a 2-week interval between visits []. On each farm  one of the observers rinsed and scored the hind feet using the method of Relun et al. []  while the other observer recorded cow ID and DD status. Six distinct classes were scored: skin on which lesions were macroscopically absent (M0)  displayed a small lesion of 0 to 2 cm (M1)  a lesion of more than 2 cm (M2)  a lesion covered by a scab (M3)  altered skin with dyskeratotis or surface proliferation (M4)  and a small lesion in addition to altered skin (M4.1) [  ]. These classes were divided into susceptible (M0) and infected (M1  M2  M3  M4  and M4.1). Farmers were not informed on the DD status of the cows  but were allowed to identify and treat affected cows using their normal routine. Phenotypes were collected on 1513 cows  of which 1401 were genotyped (see below). On average  a cow was scored 8.7 times. Table  shows several characteristics of the farms enrolled in the study. The cows were genotyped with the Eurogenomics 10 K chip. A first round of quality control was performed before imputation  following the standard procedure of the breeding company CRV. A marker (single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP) was included only when its call rate was higher than 0.85  the deviation of the observed frequency from the expected Hardy Weinberg equilibrium frequency was less than 0.15  and the minor allele frequency was higher than 0.025. Furthermore  inconsistent genotypes between parents and offspring were set to missing. SNPs that passed the quality control were imputed to a set of 76 438 SNPs based on the Illumina BovineSNP50 chip and a custom chip from the breeding company CRV  with a reference population of more than 1000 animals with genotypes on both chips and the combination of Beagle [] and PHASEBOOK [] software. A second round of quality control was performed on the imputed data. A SNP was included only when there was no strong deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p<U+2009>><U+2009>10)  the missing rate was lower than 0.05  and the minor allele frequency was higher than 0.02. In total  75 904 SNPs passed the quality control and were included in the analysis. In this section  we develop a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) founded on epidemiological principles  to estimate genetic parameters for susceptibility  infectivity and . To develop the GLMM  we need to find the probability that a susceptible cow gets infected between two observations. We present an epidemiological model  derive the infection probability from this model  and present the resulting GLMM  building on work of Velthuis et al. []  Lipschutz-Powell et al. []  Anacleto et al. []  Anche et al. []  and Biemans et al. []. DD is an endemic infectious disease with infections reoccurring in the same animals. DD is transmitted via the environment []  where the environment is defined as any possible pathogen reservoir through which transmission can occur. Thus  we used a stochastic compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible-model (SIS-model) with an environmental route (E) see e.g. [] to model disease transmission (Fig. ). An SIS-model has two categories of individuals: (1) non-infected individuals who can become infected; these are referred to as susceptible; and (2) infected individuals that are also infectious  and who can recover; these are referred to as infected. Hence  the term “susceptible” merely denotes a non-infected individual that can  in principle  become infected. It does not indicate a high degree of susceptibility. In the SIS-model  the infection of a susceptible claw occurs randomly with a probability per observation interval  depending on the parameters of the model  the number of infected claws in the group  and the infection pressure coming from the environment. Susceptible-infected-susceptible model with environmental route In the SIS-model with an environmental route ()  the expected rate with which susceptible claws get infected is   where  is the number of currently infectious claws   the number of susceptible claws  and  the total number of claws in a group (twice the number of cows). Here  it is assumed that infected cows are immediately infectious to their herd mates.  is the infection pressure coming from the environmental reservoir  expressed as the equivalent number of currently infectious claws (i.e.   and  are on the same scale).  is the transmission rate parameter that contains information on the contact rate and transmission probability between individuals []. Because our interest is in genetic variation in susceptibility and infectivity among cows  we consider the pairwise  between a susceptible cow and her infected herd mate. This pairwise  depends on the susceptibility of the cow and the infectivity of the herd mate. Thus  the transmission rate parameter  from an infected claw of herd mate   with infectivity   to a susceptible claw of cow   with susceptibility   is: In Eq.   the overall contact rate  serves as a scaling parameter  so that mean susceptibility and infectivity are approximately 1    and mean logarithms are 0   The latter is relevant for the inclusion of random effects in mixed models  which are commonly assumed to have a mean of 0. Thus  the expected (i.e.  average) rate with which a single susceptible claw of cow  gets infected when exposed to  infected claws in the group depends on the susceptibility of cow   on the number of infected claws in the group  and on their average infectivity: where  is the pairwise transmission rate parameter averaged over the genotyped infected herd mates  of susceptible cow    is the number of infected claws of herd mates that had genotype records  and  is the total number of infected claws at the start of the observation interval. We distinguished between  and  because some of the cows were not genotyped. While we estimated infectivity for the genotyped cows only  the non-genotyped infected cows also contributed to transmission. To account for all infected claws  we assumed that the claws of the non-genotyped cows (<U+2009>=<U+2009>112) had the same infectivity as their infected genotyped herd mates (). In the  term (Eq. )  we should ideally average the infectivity over all claws that contribute to the current infection pressure. This also includes the infection pressure via the environment of the claws that were infected at an earlier time. However  in the statistical software we did not manage to keep track of all the weighted genotypes of claws that were infected at earlier times. Therefore  we only included claws that were infected at the start of the observation interval in the  term. In contrast  the -term included infection pressure of the full  of previously infected claws  but these were not weighted according to their infectivity. Thus  our estimates of genetic variation in infectivity use only part of the variation in the infection pressure. This issue is further addressed in the “” section. The probability that a susceptible claw becomes infected in an observation interval varies among observation intervals  because it depends on the number of infected herd mates  the infectivity of those herd mates  and on the infection pressure coming from the environment. To estimate this probability  we assumed that the transmission rate (probability per unit of time) is constant within the interval  which is the default assumption in disease transmission models. With this assumption  transmission follows a so-called Poisson process  where the number of transmissions within the interval has a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the product of the rate and the length of the interval; . A claw becomes a case when it is infected at least once within the interval. Hence  the probability of becoming a case is the complement of the probability of no infection    where  is the probability of a zero outcome from a Poisson distribution. Using Eq. : where   is the probability that a susceptible claw of  is a case (becomes infected) in interval   given the number of infected herd mates  the infectivity of those herd mates  and on the infection pressure coming from the environment at the start of the interval. The number of cases for each interval (counting process in discrete time) follows a binomial distribution with a probability that follows from a Poisson process within the interval (counting process in continuous time). Therefore  the complementary log–log is the appropriate link function to connect the explanatory variables to the expected value of the observed variable []. Thus  the GLMM follows from applying the complementary log–log transformation to Eq. : where  is an intercept   is the logarithm of susceptibility of the focal individual   the log of the mean infectivity of infected (genotyped) herd mates  and  is an offset  i.e.  a known “explanatory variable”. The offset accounts for the infectious pressure coming from the infected cows (both genotyped and non-genotyped) at time : ( and from the environment at : ()  and for the length of the interval (). Note that the dependent variable for Eq.  is the number of cases for a cow with at least one susceptible claw. For cows with one susceptible claw  the binomial total equals 1 and the number of cases takes values <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 or 1. For cows with two susceptible claws  the binomial total equals 2 and the number of cases takes values <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1 or 2. Equation  is linear in the logarithm of susceptibility  but not in the logarithm of infectivity. To allow the fitting of a linear model  we linearized the model term for infectivity following [] in the models in which the infectivity of the group mates was included (Models 2 and 4  see below): Equation  follows from approximating the   which is an arithmetic mean  by the corresponding geometric mean (see [] for details). The errors caused by this approximation are less than 5% for infectivity effects up to a factor of 3 (i.e.   between 0.33 and 3.0). However  this error estimation is based on a model with SNP effects rather than polygenic breeding values. The size of the error is not known for a trait determined by many genes each with a small effect. The method will anyway take the real differences in exposure for different observation periods on the different farms into account. We acknowledge that this is a relevant issue that requires further investigation. We calculated the infectious pressure coming from the environment () as described in detail in Biemans et al. []. In short  claws that were infected at an earlier time could still contribute partly to the environmental reservoir at the moment of observation. Their contribution was assumed to decrease each interval  by a factor   which may be interpreted as a survival rate of the pathogen. The estimate for this survival rate is 0.9 []. Thus  the number of pathogens in the environment coming from a claw that was infected at   is a fraction 0.9 at   a fraction 0.9<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81 at   a fraction 0.9<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.729 at   etc. Therefore  the values for  were calculated as: where  is the total number of infected claws at   and  is the infectious pressure coming from the environmental reservoir at . Because we did not observe the number of infected claws in the period before the first observation ()  we estimated this number with a linear model. For each farm  we fitted the model to the number of infected claws over the observation period. The intercept of the model    was used as the average number of infected claws on that particular farm in the periods before observations started (). Thereafter  the value for the environmental reservoir at the first observation was estimated as    and was used in Eq. . With the GLMM  we modelled the expectation of the number of cases over the number of susceptible feet (claws) of cow  within the interval   . Only the hind feet of the cows were scored  so a susceptible cow could have one or two susceptible feet () at the start of an interval  which were zero  one  or two cases by the end of the interval. Thus  the number of cases  (0  1 or 2) for each susceptible cow followed a binomial distribution with binomial total  (1 or 2). We tested four models (Table ). Model 1 included a genetic effect for susceptibility only: where  is the intercept. The fixed effects were farm ( with <U+2009>=<U+2009>A to L)  period ( with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to 10)  parity ( with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  or<U+2009>><U+2009>2)  and months in milk (  a continuous covariate with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to 12). Random effects included an interaction between farm and period ( with <U+2009>=<U+2009>A to L and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to 10)  a non-genetic permanent animal effect for the susceptible animal  () to account for repeated observations on the same animal in different periods  and an additive genetic effect for susceptibility of animal  (  where  is the genomic relationships matrix among animals). Model 2 included genetic effects for both susceptibility and infectivity: where  are the random genetic effects for infectivity of the infected group mates  of animal   with (). We expected that the interaction between farm and period could be partly confounded with the genetic effect for infectivity  because previous IGE studies showed that omitting group-effects may substantially inflate estimated genetic parameters for infectivity []. To investigate this issue  we dropped the farm by period interaction from Models 1 and 2  resulting in Models 3 and 4  respectively. The -matrix was computed using method 1 of VanRaden []  with the calc_grm software []. We fitted the four models with ASReml v4.1.0 []. Model fit was assessed with Akaike information criterion (AIC). The susceptibility and infectivity estimates from ASReml were on the log scale because of the complementary log–log link function (Eq. ). These random effects are zero on average. By taking the exponent of the estimates  we obtained the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for susceptibility and infectivity  relative to a typical (average) individual that has a GEBV of 1 (thus   therefore ). We validated the GEBV to investigate their bias and accuracy with a 12-fold cross-validation on all four models. In each analysis  all the cases () of one of the 12 farms were censored from the dataset. For each susceptible claw of cow  at interval  at the censored farm  we predicted the dependent variable of the GLMM    based on the information of the other 11 farms. In the following  we refer to this prediction as the predicted probability . However  as the fixed effects were nonlinear on the normal scale because they were estimated with a complementary log–log link function  correction of the observed records for fixed effects was not straightforward. To solve this issue  we translated both the predicted probabilities and the observed records to a standard (i.e.  average) farm. Subsequently  we validated the models using a weighted correlation and a regression of observed records on predicted probabilities (see “” for detailed methods). To calculate the correlation and regression coefficients  we used observations and predictions averaged over the number of times an animal was susceptible at the start of an interval  and this number was used as the weight. For the best fitting model (lowest bias  highest accuracy)  we calculated the genetic variance and GEBV () for the basic reproduction ratio. The additive genetic variance of  was calculated as []: where the approximation follows from  The GEBV for the basic reproduction ratio is the product of the GEBV for susceptibility ()  the GEBV for infectivity (  the contact rate ()  and the average duration of the infectious period () []: With a previously estimated  for DD of 2.36 on these farms [] and the average product of the estimated relative susceptibility and relative infectivity  the value for  was calculated as . The breeding value for  in Eq.  is on the absolute scale  and thus has an average equal to   rather than zero. This is convenient  because absolute breeding values for  can be interpreted relative to a value of 1  which is the threshold for eradication of a disease. Note that  in Models 1 and 3  variation in infectivity is not estimated. Hence  for these models we used  for all individuals. GEBV are prone to overestimation  as illustrated by regression coefficients of validation phenotypes on predicted GEBV  which are often less than 1 e.g. []. To avoid overestimation of the variation in breeding values for   we shrunk the estimates for the transmission rate parameter where  is the regression coefficient of the observed  on the predicted probability  averaged over cross-validation sets. The corrected individual breeding values for the basic reproduction ratio were: After this correction  the regression coefficient of the observed  on the predicted probability in cross-validation was 1  implying that the GEBV have the correct variance. Moreover  when the regression coefficient of phenotypes on predicted breeding values equals 1  and observations and predictions follow an approximate normal distribution  then the accuracy of EBV equals the ratio of the standard deviations   []. We used this result to obtain the approximate accuracy of the GEBV for . The farm effect was significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) in Models 1 and 3  but not in Models 2 and 4. For all models  there was a significant effect for period  parity  and months in milk. The probability of becoming infected during an interval increased during the first six periods and stabilized thereafter. The transmission rate parameter increased with increasing parity; it was 21% higher for parity 2 compared to parity 1  and 69% higher for parities greater than 2 compared to parity 1. For months in milk  the transmission rate parameter decreased by 4% with every month in milk. A table of fixed effect estimates and standard errors on the log scale from Model 1 is presented in Additional file . Table  shows the estimated variance components and their standard errors (SE) on the log scale. The estimated variance components are similar on the normal scale  because  around  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) []. For Models 1  2  and 4  the estimated genetic variance for susceptibility was about 0.55  and was strongly significant. These models had a genetic effect for infectivity and/or the interaction term between farm and period. For Model 3  the estimated genetic variance for susceptibility was smaller (0.49); this model had neither a genetic effect for infectivity  nor a term for the interaction between farm and period. Similarly  the variance of the non-genetic random animal effect was about 0.95 for Models 1  2  and 4; and was smaller <U+2009>~<U+2009>0.92  for Model 3. The estimated variance for infectivity was large  and not significant for Model 2. The interpretation of the magnitude of these variance components is discussed below  in the section on . Figure  shows the infectivity estimates from Model 4 plotted against the infectivity estimates from Model 2. The estimates varied from -<U+2009>3.20 to 3.80 for Model 2 and from -<U+2009>8.76 to 9.04 for Model 4. Thus  the GEBV for infectivity from Model 2 showed less variation compared to the GEBV from Model 4; part of the variation that is attributed to the interaction between farm and period in Model 2  is attributed to the genetic infectivity effect in Model 4. This suggests that the GEBV for infectivity from Model 4 include both a genetic and a non-genetic component  and may therefore be inflated. Estimated infectivity effect from Model 2 versus Model 4. Each point represents one cow. The line shows y<U+2009>=<U+2009>x Figure  shows the weighted linear regression of the average observed number of cases over the number of susceptible feet () on the average predicted probability  and their correlation. Bias was smallest for models without the infectivity effect (Models 1 and 3)  since regression coefficients of these models were closest to 1. The weighted correlations coefficients were higher for models with the infectivity effect (Models 2 and 4). Thus  models without an infectivity effect showed significantly lower bias  while models with an infectivity effect had a slightly higher accuracy. The higher bias for Model 4 compared to Model 2 agrees with results in Fig.   and confirms that omitting the random farm-by-period interaction inflates the variation in GEBV for infectivity. Weighted linear regression and correlation coefficients between the average observed number of cases over the number of susceptible feet () and the average predicted probability for the observations. Regression coefficients smaller than 1 indicate over prediction The genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for susceptibility corrected for bias were approximately the same for Models 1  2 and 4  and ranged from 0.49 to 2.81; the GEBV from Model 3 ranged from 0.50 to 2.53. A cow with a susceptibility GEBV of 0.50 is genetically about two times less susceptible than an average cow  whereas a cow with a susceptibility GEBV of 2.50 is genetically about 2.5 times more susceptible than an average cow. The GEBV for infectivity showed substantially more variation than the GEBV for susceptibility. We chose to illustrate the variation in GEBV for  using results from Model 3  which is the most conservative model as judged by the estimated genetic variance in susceptibility (smallest value) and the bias. For this model  we calculated individual breeding values for the basic reproduction ratio () corrected for the bias that we found from the cross-validation. The average GEBV for susceptibility was 1.081  which is slightly higher than 1 because of the transformation from the log scale to the normal scale. In Model 3  there was no infectivity effect  thus infectivity was 1.00 for all individuals. With an average  for DD of 2.36 on our farms []   was estimated at 2.18. GEBV for  ranged from 1.089 to 5.515 (Fig. ) (the GEBV not corrected for bias ranged from 0.62 to 6.68). This result indicates very substantial genetic variation in . The expected prevalence in a population of individuals similar to the genetically best individual equals approximately  []  while the corresponding value for the genetically worst individual equals 81.9%. Histogram of the individual GEBV for the basic reproduction ratio corrected for bias for all genotyped cows  based on results from Model 3 The estimated additive genetic standard deviation for  was 1.17 (this value is corrected for bias). This result shows that the current  of 2.36 [] is only about one genetic standard deviation greater than 1. Hence  this suggests that a genetic improvement of  by a bit more than one genetic standard deviation would be sufficient to eradicate DD. The approximate accuracy of  follows from the ratio of the standard deviation of GEBV for  over the additive genetic standard deviation of the true breeding values for ; . This accuracy equals<U+2009>~<U+2009>39%. To be conservative  we did not correct (i.e.  shrink) the  in the denominator of this expression  while we did correct the numerator for the bias. Note that this accuracy is based on validation within a generation  rather than on validation forward in time. The accuracy based on validation forward in time is relevant for response to selection  and may be somewhat lower because genetic relationships may be a little weaker. We estimated the additive genetic variation in host susceptibility  infectivity  and the basic reproduction ratio () for DD in dairy cattle. Furthermore  we calculated GEBV for susceptibility  infectivity  and  for each animal. Four models were compared for their ability to predict whether a susceptible animal becomes infected. All four models included a genetic effect for susceptibility; Models 2 and 4 also included a genetic effect for infectivity  while Models 1 and 2 included an interaction term between farm and period. In all models  the estimates are corrected for the variation in exposure of the susceptible individuals to infected group mates via the offset of the model. The estimated additive genetic standard deviation for  was large <U+2009>~<U+2009>1.17  and the mean  (2.36) was only about one genetic standard deviation greater than the important threshold value of 1. Furthermore  GEBV for  (corrected for bias) showed large variation  ranging from 1.089 to 5.515  and the approximate accuracy of GEBV for  was<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.39. These results show that genetic selection against DD is very promising; there is substantial heritable variation and a meaningful accuracy can be obtained from a limited amount of data. Farm  parity  period  and months in milk of the focal cow were included in the models as fixed effects. The transmission rate parameter was 21% higher for parity 2 compared to parity 1  and 69% higher for parity greater than 2 compared to parity 1. The prevalence also increased with parity. This is in contrast with most previous studies where DD was most prevalent in first and second parity cows [  ]. For months in milk  the transmission rate parameter decreased by 4% per month in milk. This is in agreement with Argáez-Rodríguez et al. [] who found that cows had the highest risk of getting DD in the first and third months of lactation  after which the risk decreased. The potential effect of parity and months in milk on the infectivity of a cow was not considered  because incorporating these factors in the summed effects of the infected group mates of a focal cow was methodologically too challenging. We managed  only partly  to account for genetic effects on infectivity. For technical reasons  we included only the genetic effects of claws that were infected at the start of the observation interval () in the statistical model. However  the majority of the infection pressure originated from earlier infected claws that still contribute to transmission via the environment. We estimated a survival rate (<U+03BB>) of the pathogen of 0.9 []  meaning that 90% of the total infectious pressure originates from infectivity present in the environment from claws that were infected before the start of the observation interval. This suggests that we missed a large part of the potential heritable variation in infectivity. Hence  the relevance of genetic variation in infectivity for DD may be larger than suggested by the estimates presented here (Table ). Unfortunately  in the statistical software we did not manage to keep track of all the weighted genotypes (i.e.  weighing the genotypes of the infected individuals for their contribution to the environment). Nevertheless  the accuracy of predicting the phenotype from the cross-validation for the model with genetic effects of infectivity (Model 2) was 9% higher than the accuracy for the corresponding model without these effects (Model 1). Thus  even including a small proportion of the apparent variation in infectivity in the model appears to increase the accuracy of GEBV. Estimates of infectivity show relatively larger standard errors because variation in infectivity must be estimated indirectly  unlike variation in susceptibility. Infectivity estimates are based on the number of susceptible group mates of an infectious individual that become infected  and on differences in genotype among the infected group mates at different time points. When there are multiple infected group mates  the accuracy of the infectivity estimates decreases []. Especially in large groups  as in this study (~<U+2009>100 cows)  more records and groups are needed to estimate genetic variation in infectivity accurately []. This issue is very similar to the estimation of indirect genetic effects from large groups. In addition  we observed DD transmission for a relatively short period of time. More accurate estimation of genetic variation in infectivity requires data that are recorded over longer time periods (i.e.  to be able to observe the entire infectious period for the majority of the cows)  more groups (herds)  a better statistical model (i.e.  inclusion of the genetic effects from earlier infected cows of which the pathogens are still present in the environment)  and the inclusion of infectivity effects of cows without genotypes. The latter could be done using single-step GBLUP []. In the first two models  we included an interaction between farm and period to account for non-genetic effects of infectivity. This interaction serves to avoid overestimation of the genetic variance in infectivity []  similar to the inclusion of a random group effect in the analysis of indirect genetic effects [  ]. The genetic effect for infectivity and the interaction term were partly confounded  because both terms have an effect on the number of susceptible animals that become a case within a certain period on a certain farm. However  confounding is not complete because of genetic relationships between the infected animals across farms and periods. Our results also suggest that inclusion of a random farm-by-period effect is essential to avoid overestimation of the genetic variation due to infectivity. The estimated variances for susceptibility (genetic and non-genetic) were lower for Model 3 that included neither a genetic effect for infectivity nor an interaction between farm and period. Anacleto et al. [] showed that estimates for susceptibility are less accurate when genetic variation in infectivity is not accounted for. Indeed  we also found a slightly higher correlation in the cross-validation when infectivity was included in the model  although this was accompanied by an inflation of the GEBV  as shown by the regression coefficients in Fig. . However  inflation of GEBV can be remedied by shrinking them based on the results of cross-validation  whereas a reduction in correlation cannot. Therefore  even when genetic variation in infectivity is small  it might be beneficial to include infectivity in the model to more accurately estimate susceptibility GEBV []. In the cross-validation  we estimated a weighted correlation of about 0.2 between the observed and predicted number of cases over the number of susceptible feet. This value can be used to approximate the accuracy of the GEBV () []  where   is the correlation between the observations and the predictions  and  is the heritability of the trait. Heritability estimates for digital dermatitis from previous studies range from 0.05 to 0.29  depending on the model used []. Assuming a heritability of 0.28 for DD []  the accuracy of the predicted number of cases is 0.37. In general  studies on genetic variability of infectious diseases commonly focus on individual differences in susceptibility only  and those differences are estimated with linear models that ignore variation in exposure between individuals. In this study  we used a GLMM founded on epidemiological theory to estimate genetic variability in susceptibility and infectivity. An important advantage of models founded on epidemiological theory is that they provide estimates for epidemiological parameters  such as   that are interpretable in the context of infectious disease dynamics. Our results  for example  show that  is only slightly more than one genetic standard deviation away from the threshold value of 1  which suggests that eradication of DD by genetic improvement is  feasible. Further work is needed to quantify the benefits of GLMM based on epidemiological theory over simpler linear models  to better account for the potential genetic variation in infectivity via the environment  and to include genetic variation in the duration of the infectious period. Genetic variance components for susceptibility and infectivity for digital dermatitis were estimated with four generalized linear mixed models. We managed  only partly  to account for genetic effects on infectivity. We estimated GEBV for the basic reproduction ratio from a (conservative) model including genetic effects for susceptibility only. GEBV for  were corrected for bias  and showed substantial variation  ranging from 1.089 to 5.515. The mean  (2.36) was only about one genetic standard deviation greater than 1. Based on cross-validation between farms  the approximate accuracy of GEBV for  was 0.39  in spite of the relatively small dataset of only 12 genotyped herds. These results suggest that lowering prevalence of DD by selective breeding is very promising.

In the 12-fold cross-validation  we censored the number of cases in each period and predicted for each susceptible animal the number of cases over the number of susceptible feet () based on information of the 11 other farms. In general  the predicted probability for the number of cases over the number of susceptible feet can be calculated with the estimated effects. Because of the complementary log–log link function  these effects need to be back-calculated to the original scale: when the genetic effect for infectivity was not included (Models 1 and 3)  and when the genetic effect for infectivity was included (Models 2 and 4). In Eqs. () and ()   is the predicted probability for the number of cases over the number of susceptible feet for animal  in the time from  to    is the sum of the estimates for the fixed effects  i.e.  the estimates for the intercept  farm   period   parity   and months in milk. The  is the estimated genetic effect for susceptibility on the log scale and  is the sum of the estimated genetic effects for infectivity of the infected group mates of the susceptible individual on the log scale. The last term in Eqs. () and () is the offset. In the 12-fold cross-validation  the cases () of one entire farm were censored from the dataset  therefore  the random effects for the interaction between farm and period  and non-genetic animal effect for animal  could not be estimated for this farm. Thus  these random effects did not contribute to the predicted probabilities  and they are not included in Eqs. () and (). To validate the estimated genetic effects  we wanted to estimate the probability that an animal would be a case during an interval independent of the fixed effects in the model. We achieved this independence by standardizing both  and . We obtained the regression coefficients for the fixed effects for each of the four models that were applied to the full dataset where no data was censored. With these regression coefficients  we calculated the average value of summed fixed effects . The  can be interpreted as a standard/average farm and a standard/average cow. This  was used in Eqs. () and () instead of the estimated fixed effects: for Models 1 and 3  and for Models 2 and 4. Here   is the predicted probability for the number of cases over the number of susceptible feet for animal  in a period  as if it were an average cow with an average parity and months in milk  during a standard period  on a standard farm. Note that the genetic susceptibility and infectivity did differ between cows  and thus had an effect on the predictions. Similarly  we wanted to standardize the observed cases over the number of susceptible claws   so that they would be independent of the fixed effects that contributed to that observation. The observations were transformed to the complementary log–log scale so that they were linear in the effects: for Models 1 and 3  and  for Models 2 and 4. Next  the summed fixed effects  in Eqs. () and () were replaced with the average value of the summed fixed effects   and back-calculated to the original scale to obtain the observed number of cases over the number of susceptible feet independent of the fixed effects   for all models: Here   is the observed number of cases over the number of susceptible feet for animal  in a period  as if observed on an average cow with an average parity and months in milk  on a standard farm. Again  the genetic susceptibility and infectivity did differ between cows (see Eqs. () and ())  and affected the dependent variable. We calculated weighted correlation coefficients between the “corrected” observed number of cases over the number of susceptible feet () and the “corrected” predicted probabilities ()  averaged over the number of times an animal was susceptible at the start of an interval  and this number was used as the weight.

"GSE’s 50th anniversary: where do we go from now?"	"Authors: "	""	"No Co-Author"	"19 November 2019"	"This year  Genetics Selection Evolution (GSE) celebrates its 50th anniversary. Indeed  it was in 1969 that the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) created the journal “Annales de Génétique et de Sélection Animale”  which was renamed “Génétique Sélection Evolution” in 1983  and translated into the current English title in 1989. Initially created to disseminate INRA’s academic and applied research in animal genetics  from the 1980s the journal aimed at extending its international influence and recognition under the impetus of its editors Jean-Louis Foulley and Francis Minvielle (see complete list of GSE’s editors-in-chief at the end of the article). During the last 20 years  GSE has established itself as one of the premier international scientific journals in its field  with currently at least half of the editorial board and two editors-in-chief of non-French origin  and more than 80% of the articles from non-INRA authors. GSE has been instrumental in developing quantitative genetics applied to farm animals  but also population genetics  including model species such as Drosophila under the leadership of Jean David (editor for GSE)  whose research is dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of evolution using this model. Milestone papers include theoretical work on the properties of BLUP related to selection  methods for estimating variance components by REML  the use of Bayesian methods for parameter estimation  the development of reaction norm models  computation algorithms for genetic evaluation and parameter estimation  of non-linear models for categorical traits or survival analysis  of QTL mapping methods  and of genomic prediction models  as well as methods for prediction of rates of genetic improvement and inbreeding. The journal also published many applied research articles  among which those on estimates of genetic parameters  the first large-scale genetic diversity analyses of animal populations based on microsatellite data  QTL detection analyses  and the characterization of several major genes in different species. From the 2000s  the field of animal genetics was revolutionized by the emergence of SNPs and GSE published an early visionary article by Vignal et al. entitled “A review on SNPs and other types of molecular markers and their use in animal genetics” (Genet Sel Evol. 2002;34:275–305)  followed by numerous articles on genomic prediction and selection."

A large number of regions associated to milk traits were identified. The outputs provided by the proposed method are useful for the selection of candidate genes  which need to be further investigated to identify causative mutations or markers in strong LD with them for application in selection programs assisted by molecular information. The identification of genomic regions that affect traits of interest and the application of marker- or gene-assisted selection [] in livestock are crucial to speed up genetic improvement. This is especially valid in species for which genetic gain is hampered by the relatively high costs of large-scale phenotyping and the logistic constraints of artificial insemination []. However  application of selection assisted by molecular information for traits that are influenced by numerous loci  each one explaining a small portion of the trait variance  is limited by the lack of power of experiments based on low-density marker maps []. In sheep  attempts to identify regions that affect quantitative traits (QTL) were performed first by using microsatellite maps [         ]. Most of the identified QTL showed low significance levels and large confidence intervals  and thus their use in selection programs was not possible []. Nevertheless  the discovery of thousands of single-nucleotide markers (SNPs) and cost-effective tools (SNP arrays) to genotype them on a large number of animals as well as the recent availability of affordable whole-genome sequencing techniques  has opened new perspectives. It is expected that polymorphisms with small effects that collectively explain an increasing amount of the genetic variance may be gradually identified by using denser molecular marker maps on larger structured resource populations []. Thus  individuals that belong to pre-existing and new dairy sheep experimental populations have been accurately recorded for several traits and genotyped with 50 K and/or 600 K SNP chips. This is the case of an experimental flock of Sarda ewes  which has been set up since 2000 as a resource population to implement selection assisted by molecular information in the breeding scheme of this Italian dairy breed. QTL detection studies based on SNP arrays and the availability of increasingly accurate genome asec15 nnotation data allow the listing of potential candidate genes [     ]. Moreover  whole-genome re-sequencing of target animals has been used to restrict the number of candidate polymorphisms. Thus  putative causative mutations that affect traits of economic interest have been proposed [   ]. Among the available QTL detection approaches  those based on the combined use of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and linkage analysis (LA) information (LDLA) have been indicated as the most powerful  robust and precise in populations that are structured in families [    ]. The main reason is that they account for both recombination events that occurred within genotyped generations and historical recombination events that occurred in generations prior to genotyping []. Several approaches have been proposed to combine LD and LA information [      ]. The classical LDLA method [  ] performs a variance component analysis at each putative QTL position by using identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities between haplotypes. The main issue is that the IBD probability matrix is often dense  non-positive definite and computationally demanding for its inversion [  ]. Thus  either strategies that perform the hierarchical clustering of haplotypes based on IBD probability [  ] or the approximation of the IBD based on the extent of the identity-by-state status between haplotypes [] have been used. However  these approximations inevitably result in a loss of information []. An alternative way to process IBD information is principal component analysis (PCA)  which has the desirable feature of collapsing information that is contained in a set of correlated variables by a smaller set of orthogonal variables. As such  PCA has been proposed as a technique to reduce the dimensionality of predictors in genomic selection [  ]. The aim of this study was to detect genomic regions that affect milk traits in the resource population of Sarda sheep by applying an LDLA approach combined with PCA to overcome computational issues of the IBD matrix and minimize the loss of information. The generation of the resource population (RP) started in 1999 when 10 Lacaune<U+2009>×<U+2009>Sarda F1 sires were mated to Sarda ewes to produce 928 back-cross female lambs in the framework of an European project aimed at detecting QTL in the main European sheep breeds (QLK5-CT-2000-00656; “genesheepsafety”). Subsequently  we focused on the detection of QTL segregating in the pure Sarda breed  and since 2002 we used exclusively Sarda rams (SA) to produce the yearly replacement of RP. Until 2009  the average size of the sire families was 43 daughters whereas  from 2010 onward the average size of families decreased to nine daughters  in order to increase the number of Sarda  represented in the RP. Sarda sires were always chosen based on their genetic impact on the registered population among rams belonging to the artificial insemination centre of the breed. In total  3949 ewes from 161 rams (10 F1 and 151 SA) were generated until 2015. Ewes of RP were kept until the 4th (occasionally the 5th) lactation on an experimental farm. The farming system was similar to that commonly applied in Sardinia with most of the adult ewes lambing in autumn and yearlings lambing between January and March. The ewes were milked twice a day by machine from weaning (3–4 weeks from lambing) until the end of July. The feeding regime was based on controlled grazing  supplemented by hay and concentrates in winter and late spring. All the ewes of RP and their sires as well as the 10 Lacaune sires of F1 and 11 Sarda sires of SA were genotyped with the Illumina Inc. OvineSNP50 Beadchip. SNP editing was performed using call rate and MAF thresholds of 95% and 1%  respectively. The ovine genome assembly v4.0 and the software SNPchimMpv.3 [] were used to construct the genetic map by assuming 1 Mb<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 cM. Unmapped SNPs and SNPs on sex chromosomes were not included in the study. A large range of traits of economic interest was measured in the RP. In the current study  we focused on milk traits: milk yield (MY); fat yield (FY); protein yield (PY); fat content (FP) and protein content (PP). MY  FP and PP were measured twice a month during the milking period at the am and pm milking. Lactation records were computed by the Fleischmann method  using records from the milking period only (in agreement with ICAR recommendations)  by considering an initial suckling period of 30 days. Finally  13 059 lactations of 3731 ewes recorded from 2000 to 2017 were retained. The average number of records per ewe was 3.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.02  ranging from 1 (5% of animals) to 5 (9.3% of animals); most of the ewes (55.5%) had four records. First  in order to adjust for the main environmental effects  raw lactation records were analysed with single-trait repeatability animal models using the ASReml 4.1 software []. Genetic relationships between animals were taken into account by calculating the genomic relationship matrix [] between 4513 animals  including F1 and SA sires and their genotyped ancestors. The animal model included as fixed effects the year-management-group interaction (37 levels)  the year-month of lambing-parity-age class interaction (230 levels) and the milking length within age class (adult and primiparous) as a covariate. The average performance deviation (APD) of each ewe was calculated as the average of lactation records adjusted for fixed effects. The APD used in this study as pseudo-phenotypes for QTL detection differ from the yield deviations [] that were used in similar studies in that the performances are not adjusted for permanent environmental effects in order to prevent inaccurate estimations due to the likely confounding between permanent environment and additive genetic effects. Indeed  Pearson’s correlations between additive genetic and permanent environmental effects from the repeatability animal model ranged  for the five analyzed traits  from 0.46 for FY to 0.50 for PP. Moreover  although in this study we shall investigate only additive effects  ADP include dominance and epistatic genetic effects when they exist and are suitable pseudo-phenotypes for testing such effects in further analyses. Finally  3731 APD from as many ewes were available. To verify the suitability of the applied animal model  the ratio between the estimated genomic and total variance was compared with the heritabilities reported in the literature. In the same way  the correlations between APD and GEBV of different traits were compared with phenotypic and genetic correlations estimated in other studies. By “gamete”  we refer to the whole haploid set of autosomes that are inherited by an individual from one of the two parents. Moreover  we classified the gametes of the population as base haplotypes (BH) when inherited from an ungenotyped parent and replicated haplotypes (RH) when inherited from a genotyped parent. The pool of BH comprised both gametes of F1 rams and of 63 SA rams  the maternal or paternal gametes of the 35 ewes with an unknown sire or dam  respectively  and the maternal gametes of the 928 back-cross ewes and of 85 SA rams for which the sire was genotyped. Finally  1207 gametes were classified as BH  i.e. the 10 F1 sires paternal Lacaune gametes () and 1197 Sarda origin gametes (). Then  all 7462 gametes () carried by the 3731 ewes with production records () were considered as replicates (RH) of the 1207 BH (). An example of how gametes were classified is given in . The paternal and maternal inherited gametes of all the genotyped individuals were reconstructed by using a procedure based on the linkage disequilibrium multilocus iterative peeling method proposed by Meuwissen and Goddard []. In this method  the parental origin of the alleles carried by an individual is iteratively inferred on the genotypes of parents and offspring at a given locus if they are already phased or at the neighbouring phased loci if the phase at the given locus is unknown. Here  the LD at the population level was ignored  since the population structure was expected to allow a high level of precision using family relationships only. For individuals with both parents without a genotype  the paternal or maternal origin was arbitrary assigned. Genotypes for which the parental origin of alleles was assigned with a probability lower than 0.99 were assumed missing. The marked familial structure of the RP led us to exploit the information from the within-family linkage analysis (LA) in addition to that from the population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) to estimate IBD probabilities. First  IBD probabilities between BH and RH were calculated by LA () given the known gametic phases and the pedigree information. The grand-parental origin of each RH was estimated at each SNP position with certainty when the genotype at a given position was not missing and the parent transmitting RH was heterozygous. When these conditions were not fulfilled  the probability of a grand-parental origin at a given locus was determined based on information from the closest neighbouring informative loci [  ]. Then  transmission from BH to RH was traced through generations following Fernando and Grossman []. At each SNP position    probabilities were stored in a matrix  with size . Moreover  the number of replicates of a given BH in RP at each SNP position  () was calculated as   where  is a vector of  ones (see ). Secondly  IBD between BH were estimated by LD analysis () at each SNP position following Meuwissen and Goddard []. The  probability was conditioned to the identity-by-state (IBS) status of neighbouring SNPs using windows of 21 SNPs (10 upstream and 10 downstream resulting in an average window length of 1 Mb) and to the within-breed (Lacaune or Sarda) expected homozygosity. The  between  and  were assumed to be null. At each SNP position    probabilities were stored in a matrix  with size . Once we had precisely estimated the covariances between BH and between BH and RH as well as the BH number of replicates at each locus  the average values across loci were also calculated and stored in  ()   () and  ()  respectively. These matrices will be used later to estimate genome-wide IBD probabilities between gametes to adjust for the polygenic effect of background genes. Hereafter we describe a novel LDLA approach for QTL mapping that  similarly to the basic LDLA model proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  relies on the IBD information at the locus level and takes the effect of background genes into account. In their study  Meuwissen et al. [] modelled the phenotypic records by the random effects of all the inherited gametes (  twice the number of individuals) at a given position  and the random polygenic effects (  i.e. the combined effect of background genes) of all the individuals. In the original model []:   the covariance matrix of gametic effects  included IBD probabilities between founder gametes that were obtained by LD analysis () [] and IBD probabilities between founder and non-founder gametes and between non-founders gametes that were obtained by combining the corresponding transmission probabilities () with   using the algorithm described by Fernando and Grossman []. The additive polygenic covariance between individuals was considered through the numerator relationship matrix  based on pedigree information. In the basic method []  the maximum likelihood estimates of the variance components were calculated at each putative QTL position . The application of this method implies some relevant issues related to the nature of the  matrix  which is usually dense and may turn out to be non-positive definite  and the computational needs in applying the variance component analysis at each investigated position. To overcome these issues  we propose a novel approach which uses the principal component analysis (PCA) to handle  and exploits the dimensional reduction of the model equations that may be achieved by PCA to estimate both QTL and polygenic effects. First  PCA is used to capture the IBD information at the locus level with the aim of overcoming the difficulties in inverting the  matrix  in a different way from previous strategies having the same purpose [     ] which frequently result in a loss of information []. Second  PCA is applied to the matrix of the genome- wide IBD probabilities between gametes (i.e. the average across loci of IBD probabilities locus-wide) which is used instead of the classical numerator relationship matrix () to take into account the polygenic effects. A similar approach was used by Rothammer et al. [  ]  which applied PCA to reduce the dimension of the relationship matrix and used explanatory PC as fixed effects in their QTL detection model. Third  PC that explain most of the variability of both the locus-level and genome-wide IBD probability matrices are included in the model as fixed effects to estimate both QTL and polygenic effects by performing a least square analysis instead of the more computationally demanding variance component one. Thus  at each SNP position  the model is the following: where  is a vector of APD of  ewes for MY  PY  FY  PP and FP;  is the overall mean;  is a vector of the fixed effects of the  principal components that explain more than 99% of the within breed variation () of the IBD probability matrix   i.e.  summarizes the effects of haplotypes at the QTL position ;  is a vector of the fixed effects of the  principal components that explain more than 99% of the variation () of the genome-wide IBD probability matrix  i.e.  summarizes the polygenic effects of the gametes;  is a vector of  ones;  is a  incidence matrix relating phenotypes with RH;  is a  matrix including the  scores of RH   is a  matrix including the  scores of RH;  is a vector of  residuals assuming that  with  a diagonal matrix with the APD’s reliability () as diagonal element. For each investigated trait (MY  PY  FY  PP and FP)  reliabilities were calculated as   from a repeatability linear model   where  is the performance deviation  (i.e. the lactation record  adjusted for the fixed effects estimated with the full animal model) of ewe    is the random ewe effect assuming that  and  is the corresponding error  assuming that . Below  we explain how the PC scores of the  and  matrices were calculated. In addition  a numerical example is given in . As far as the  elements are concerned  in order to limit the computational requirements to extract PC directly from the large ()  matrix  the PCA was performed on a  matrix denoted as   where the  probabilities between BH  stored in   were weighted for the  probabilities between BH and RH by condensing  information in a  diagonal matrix   in which the diagonal elements are the number of RH of each BH (stored in   where ). The  matrix is defined as: PCA was carried out on  by using the Jacobi algorithm. Eigenvectors () relating to the largest principal components that together explain more than 99% of the within-breed variation () were retained. Finally   probabilities between BH and RH () were combined with  to define the  scores of RH () by: Note that when  between BH and RH are estimated with certainty and  thus   only contains 0 and 1  then:  and ; eigenvalues from  correspond to eigenvalues from  for the explanatory principal components () and  scores from  correspond to  (see ). When  between BH and RH are estimated without certainty and  contains intermediate values between 0 and 1   scores from  and  do not correspond perfectly and differences tend to increase as the uncertainty of  probabilities increases. This is because  only considers the covariance that derives from  excluding the covariance between RH pairs generated by imprecise estimation of transmissions of BH. This effect is negligible in our experiment because most transmission probabilities are estimated with certainty. Since the  between  and  was set to 0 and two sets of breed-specific PC were obtained  the matrix  can be detailed as . where  and  are the  summarising IBD probabilities between the gametes of Sarda and Lacaune origin  respectively. In Eq. ()  elements  which are related by the incidence matrix  to phenotypes  are used as covariates on the investigated traits to estimate QTL effects at locus  (). As far as the  elements are concerned  the PCA performed directly on the weighted genome-wide  matrix  () computed as in Eq. () resulted in 1022 PC that were needed to capture 99% of the total variation. This limited dimensional reduction is due to the moderate genome-wide . probabilities between BH (on average around 0.1) and the small number of replicates of some BH on RP. Thus  in order to not over-parameterize the model  we considered the BH with the highest impact on RP (). Then  to recover information from BH with few RH  a matrix of coefficients  relating  to all the BH was calculated as: where  is the section of  including  probabilities between all the BH with  and  is the inverse of the section of  including  probabilities between  pairs. The average number of replicates per  was then updated as . The  set was iteratively selected as the smallest group of BH that satisfied the condition that  is higher than 0.99. According to the analysis at the locus level  the Jacobi algorithm was performed on the matrix  computed as: where  is a diagonal matrix  with its diagonal elements being the number of replicates stored in . Eigenvectors () of the largest principal components that together explain more than 99% of the total variation of  () were retained. Finally  genome-wide  probabilities between BH and RH () were combined with  to define  scores of RH () by: In Eq. ()    scores which are related by the incidence matrix  to phenotypes  are used as covariates on the investigated traits to estimate polygenic effects (). Note that  and  vectors in Eq. () are both fixed effects that are depicted separately to highlight that the model aims at estimating QTL effects () while adjusting for the background of polygenes (). Moreover  covariates related to   are locus-specific whereas covariates related to   remain constant throughout the genome. In addition  in accordance with    can be detailed as   where  and  summarize the effects of the Sarda and Lacaune gametes  respectively. The model was tested at each SNP position by F-tests. Three null hypotheses were tested  : <U+2009>=<U+2009>0; : <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and : <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. In the current study  only  tests  corresponding to : <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  will be analysed and discussed. Genome-wide (GW) significance thresholds were determined by 2000 within-trait permutations of the residuals () of the reduce model   where only the polygenic effects were considered. In order to break free from differences in the number of degrees of freedom at each SNP position  genome-wide maxima of the negative logarithms of p-values  from each permutation were used to construct the null distribution. The ratios between genomic and total variance estimated by a single-trait animal model (Table ) are consistent with the estimates of heritabilities for dairy traits in the literature []. Content traits were more heritable than yield traits. The most and the less heritable traits were PP and PY  respectively. APD and GEBV correlations between traits showed similar values and were consistent with phenotypic and genetic correlations reported in previous studies on sheep []. Strong correlations (from 0.88 to 0.95) were observed between yield traits  and moderate positive correlations were observed between content traits (0.58 and 0.62). MY was negatively correlated with both content traits  while the correlations of the other two yield traits with content traits were low. Preliminary editing of data led to remove SNPs with more than 5% missing genotypes and with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01. Only SNPs located on the 26 autosomes were retained. The phasing procedure allowed the reconstruction of the sequence of the alleles carried by the investigated BH and RH for more than 99.5% of the SNP positions. After phasing  another 120 SNPs were excluded  because their genotypes were inconsistent with the phase estimated from neighbouring SNPs. Finally  43 390 SNPs were retained for further analyses. The explored genomic portion was 2437 Mb long and the average distance between SNPs was 56<U+2009>±<U+2009>49 kb with a maximum gap of 2.377 Mb on  (OAR) chromosome 21. On average  the maximum locus-wide  probability between each RH and all the BH was 0.99  which indicates the precise reconstruction of the meioses occurred across RP generations. The distribution of the genome-wide number of replicates of the 1207 BH in RP () are depicted in Fig. . The impact of BH on RP was extremely variable  in fact the average number of replicates per BH ranged from 1 to 202. The locus-wide  probability between BH pairs was zero in 68% of cases. The distribution of non-zero  probabilities is shown in Fig. . The 13% and 6% of the locus-wide  were lower than 0.05 and higher than 0.95  respectively  which suggests that  for a large proportion of BH pairs  it would have been possible to approximate the IBD status to 0 or 1. However  another 13% of locus-wide  showed intermediate values  for which the approximation to 0 or 1 would have been less accurate. Genome-wide average number of replicates () per base gamete (BH  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1207) across the gametes of the resource population (RH; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>7462) Distribution of non-zero  probabilities between base gametes (BH; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1207) at the locus (blue) and genome-wide (orange) levels Most of the BH pairs showed a genome-wide  probability equal to 0.10  with 95% having values ranging from 0.07 to 0.16 (Fig. ). This result confirms that the original pool of Sarda gametes as well as the rams used to generate the yearly replacement of RP show a rather large genetic variability. The distribution of the number of PC needed to capture 99% of the locus-wide variability is shown in Fig. . The average number of  was 32.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>6.4 with a maximum of 74 and a minimum of 9. As far as the breed of origin is concerned  the number of  explaining 99% of variation due to  (see Additional file ) and  were 24.1<U+2009>±<U+2009>6.0 and 8.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.2  respectively. Frequencies across all loci (43 390 SNPs) of the number of principal components capturing 99% of the variation at the locus level () Concerning the genome-wide analysis  139 BH with the highest impact on RP () were selected on the basis of  and the genome-wide  probabilities between BH pairs. The  set included all 10 Lacaune gametes and 129 Sarda gametes. The sum of the original number of replicates () of  was 0.69 (i.e. 69% of the RH were replicates of ). The remaining 30% of the RH variation was accounted for through the coefficients included in the  matrix and derived from  probabilities between  and other BH. At the genome-wide level  the number of  needed to capture 99% of the variation was 137. The distributions of the genome-wide maxima of   corresponding to the null hypothesis : <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  obtained by 2000 within-trait permutations  did not show relevant differences across traits (see Additional file ). The 5% threshold ranged from 5.59 to 5.69. Thus  the most conservative value  5.69  was retained as the common GW threshold for all the analysed traits. Overall  2563 positions exceeded the 0.05 GW significance threshold for at least one trait (Fig. ) (see Additional file ). There were 200  108  122  918 and 1927 SNP positions significantly associated with MY  FY  PY  FP and PP  respectively. The number of significant positions affecting simultaneously one  two  three and four traits was 1943  546  56 and 18  respectively. Several significant positions were adjacent  which may be due to linkage disequilibrium between locations. In order to account for such dependency  significant positions were clustered into QTL regions (QTLR). The correlations between  (corresponding to the second term of the model Eq. ) were calculated for all pairs of significant SNPs on the same chromosome. Then  the strongest signal at the chromosome level was retained as the peak of the first QTLR. The peaks of further QTLR along the chromosome were iteratively identified among the significant locations that had correlations lower than 0.15 with the already defined QTLR peaks. Finally  the remaining significant positions were assigned to the QTLR with which they had the highest correlation. When QTLR for different traits overlapped  we considered them as a unique QTLR. This procedure may underestimate the true number of QTL if more than one gene affecting the trait(s) is located in the same genome region. Manhattan plots showing -<U+2009>log10 (nominal p-values) corresponding to the null hypothesis that the effects of principal components that explain 99% of the variability due to the Sarda base gametes (BH) at each locus (43 390 SNPs) are zero. The dashed black lines indicate the 0.05 genome-wide significance threshold determined by permutations. MY milk yield; FY fat yield; PY protein yield; FP fat content; PP protein content Details of the 75 defined QTLR are in Table . QTLR were detected across all 26 autosomes except OAR26. The largest number of QTLR (10) was detected on OAR1. Overall  12  11  10  46 and 43 QTLR significantly affected MY  FY  PY  FP and PP  respectively. Among these 75 QTLR  46 were significant for one trait only: two for MY  two for FY  two for PY  23 for FP and 17 for PP; 20 were significant for two traits: one for MY and FY  one for MY and PP and 18 for FP and PP; two QTLR were significant for three traits: one for MY and the two content traits and one for the three yield traits; five QTLR were significant for four traits: one for the three yield traits and FP  three for the three yield traits; and PP  and one for FY  PY  FP and PP; and finally two QTLR significant for all five investigated traits. The strongest signal was obtained for PP on OAR6 at 85.34 Mb where a nominal p-value of 11.12*10 was observed. The corresponding QTLR harboured significant positions also for FP and MY. The most significant position for FP (p-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.26*10) was observed at 12.34 Mb on OAR4. This QTLR affected also PP. The most significant results for the three yield traits (p-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.41*10  5.89*10 and 2.20*10 for MY  FY and PY  respectively) were detected at 55.43 Mb on OAR11 where a significant peak for FP was also identified (Table ). Power  precision  robustness of QTL mapping experiments in complex populations may be affected by several issues (size of the experiment  number and frequency of base haplotypes  density of marker maps). As described above  the resource population investigated here is constituted by families based on male ancestors. LDLA mapping approaches are expected to be more suitable than linkage and genome-wide association analyses to fine map QTL regions in such populations. In fact  the LDLA analysis combines both the within-family linkage and population-wide linkage disequilibrium information to estimate IBD probabilities between haplotypes []. The proposed approach allowed us to solve the model by the least square method  which avoid a computational expensive variance component analysis. The advantages of approaches based on LDLA regression versus those on variance components  in term of ease of use and computing time  are well known [] and have been clearly demonstrated by Roldand et al. []. In our study  LDLA mapping greatly benefits from the structure of the population  in which the ewes born after the first generation have both parents genotyped  which allows a precise reconstruction of the base gametes of the population and their transmission through generations. IBD information can be efficiently captured with PCA and the computational constraints due to the multi-collinearity generated by the high  probabilities that may occur between pairs of BH at the locus level can be overcome. The use of PCA avoided the implementation of prior clustering of BH or approximations in the IBD probability estimation [  ]. Moreover the strategy used here to collapse IBD information into principal components (i.e. the use of  instead of ) is computationally efficient. It relies on the high precision of LA for defining the ancestral origin of each gamete  which is possible for populations with a strong familial structure. The effectiveness of the method in populations with weaker familial structure should be investigated. Depending on the eigenvalues threshold used for PCs selection  the proposed approach allows to capture most of the IBD variation with a dramatic decrease in the number of effects to estimate. Although the direct solutions of the analysis are the effects of explanatory PC  the effect corresponding to each BH at position  can be easily calculated (). Effects and frequencies of BH may be used as basic information to identify the BH that contribute most to the significance of a given locus. In fact  in their study on the identification of putative causative mutations that affect the protein content  Casu et al. [] used such information to select individuals for whole-genome re-sequencing. The QTL detection model proposed here included a fixed factor to adjust for the polygenic background of each individual based on the effect of PC that summarize the genome-wide BH variation. However  at the genome-wide level  probabilities between BH had moderate values when averaged across the genome. Indeed  most PC showed small eigenvalues and many of them were necessary to explain most of the variability. Thus  we applied an approach that aimed at reducing the number of BH to be included in the PCA to those that had the highest impact on RP () by taking their probability to be carried by an individual with a record into account. During the development of our method  we applied it to the dataset that was simulated for the XVI QTLMAS meeting []. The results of QTL detection were very close to those reported by Garzia Gamez et al. [] who used a more classical LDLA method [  ]  which implemented variance component analysis and accounted for an individual random polygenic effect (see Additional file ). Overall  a large number of genomic regions that significantly affected milk traits were detected in this study. The number of detected regions largely exceeded those obtained by other LDLA studies in dairy sheep for milk production traits []. This larger number of detected QTLR is probably due to the larger size of the analyzed population. Indeed  Garzia-Gamez et al. [] performed a LDLA mapping on a population of about 1700 Churra ewes that were organized in 16 half-sib families and they detected 34 genome-wide significant regions. Consistent with the estimates of heritabilities  the number of QTLR that affected content traits was larger than that for yield traits. Several positions suggested pleiotropic effects. Twenty-nine QTLR affected more than one trait: nine affected at least two yield traits and frequently one or both of the content traits  four affected MY and both content traits  and 18 were significant for both content traits. A very long list of positional candidate genes was obtained by overlapping the sheep genome reference (Oar_v4.0) with each QTLR. Overall  745 annotated genes were detected but only a few of these were cited as dairy-related in previous studies on cattle [] and sheep []. Among these  the most interesting genes were those in the casein cluster (     and )  which is mapped to OAR6 within the 85.00–85.23 Mb interval. This interval overlaps with the position of the strongest signal for PP found in this study. At almost the same position  a QTL for PP was detected in Churra sheep by GWA []. A deeper investigation of this region is ongoing by whole-genome re-sequencing of individuals that carry BH with large effects at the significant location. The aim is to list the candidate causative mutations by performing specific association studies of all the polymorphisms included in the genomic region []. The QTLR that affects PP and FP on OAR3 at 137.3 Mb overlaps with the - gene (). This gene was previously reported as a strong candidate for PP and has been deeply investigated in the Churra breed [  ]. Two other interesting candidate genes are the  () and - () genes.  is located on OAR16 within the 31.83-32.00 Mb interval  where a QTLR that affects yield traits was detected. Previous studies in dairy cattle and sheep have shown that  affects milk production [  ].   which is involved in the development  differentiation  and oncogenesis of the mammary gland []  overlaps with a QTLR that is significant for MY  FP and PP on OAR13 at 58.6 Mb. We present a simple least square model to map QTL. It combines linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis information and accounts for the polygenic effects of base gametes. The use of principal component analysis was found to be a good strategy to reduce the computational burden. A large number of regions associated to the variability of milk traits were identified. The outputs provided by this method are useful for the selection of individuals and genes that need to be further investigated for identifying causative mutations or markers in strong linkage disequilibrium with causative variants and for implementing them in genomic selection programs.

In this Appendix  we use a simple numerical example with few animals to explain how principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on IBD probability matrices. The example considers two males and 10 females with records and assumes that all the individuals are genotyped (Table ). Thus  in this example there are 6 BH () and 20 RH (  Table ). We assumed that the gametic phases of both BH and RH  for a map of  markers  had been reconstructed by the linkage disequilibrium multilocus iterative peeling method [] and that alleles assigned with a probability lower than 0.99 were set as missing. Let  be one of the  loci of the marker map. At this locus   we assume that the grand-parental origin of each RH has been estimated with certainty by linkage analysis (LA)  given the known gametic phases and the pedigree information (Table ). Thus  the  matrix of LA-based identity-by-descent () probabilities between RH and BH () calculated by the Fernando and Grossman procedure [] from the grand-parental origin probabilities depicted in Table  is: and the vector of  number of replicates () of each of BH across RH  calculated as  (where  is a vector of  ones)  is: Let us assume that the  matrix of LD-based identity-by-descent () probabilities between BH pairs   is: The  diagonal matrix  (in which the diagonal elements are the square root of the number of replicates stored in ) is: Then  the   probabilities matrix weighted for the  probabilities ()  calculated as  (Eq. ())  is: Eigenvalues of   defined by using the Jacobi algorithm  are in Table . The first four principal components capture more than 99% of the variability of  and  thus  are retained as explanatory (). The  (6<U+2009>×<U+2009>4) matrix of eigenvectors extracted from  and relating BH with the four    is: Finally  the  (20<U+2009>×<U+2009>4) matrix () that allocates the  scores of RH  calculated as  (Eq. ())  is thus: This section of the Appendix aims at demonstrating the equivalence between PCA that are carried out on  and PCA that are directly carried out on the LDLA IBD matrix  that was built as described by Meuwissen et al. []. A   matrix can be calculated in our example by using  probabilities between BH pairs stored in  and grand-parental origin probabilities (Table ). It allocates IBD probabilities between RH pairs obtained by combining LD and LA information. The  in our example is: Eigenvalues of   calculated by using the Jacobi algorithm  are depicted in Table . The eigenvalues of the first five PC (i.e. those not equal to zero) overlap precisely with those obtained with  (Table ). Thus  even in this case the first four PC are retained as explanatory (). The  score of RH extracted from  and stored in a  matrix (say ) are: Even in this case   precisely overlap . demonstrating that in terms of results the PCA carried out on  is equivalent to the PCA carried out directly on . Nevertheless  PCA on  is much faster and less computationally demanding since it refers to a much smaller matrix . The  genome-wide  probabilities matrix   should be calculated  in a map with  markers  as . In this example  we assume that  has the following final configuration: and the vector of  genome-wide average number of replicates () of BH over RH (i.e. the average number of replicates of each BH across-genome)  which should be calculated as  or  more simply  as   (where  is a vector of  ones)  is: The  genome-wide  probabilities   which in real data is calculated as   is assumed here to have the following final configuration: Note that  we assumed that genome-wide (and thus all the locus-wide)  probabilities between the BH 2p and all other BH are zero (third row and third column) in order to mimic a gamete from another breed. Moreover  the off-diagonal elements in  have more moderate values than those which may arise in . Because of this  PCA performed on a matrix  (calculated as described above for ) does not result in a dimensional reduction as it was observed at the locus level (Table ). Let us assume that 1p  1m  2p  2m have been selected as the base gametes with the highest impact () on the population (the demonstration of how  are selected in the real data would require a population much larger than that simulated here). The  section of  corresponding to the genome-wide  probabilities between all the BH with   and denoted as   is: and the  matrix  corresponding to the portion of . including . probabilities between  pairs is: The  matrix   including coefficients relating  to all the BH and calculated as:  (Eq ())  is thus: The vector of  updated number of replicates of  () calculated as  is: Note that <U+2009>=<U+2009>16.723/20<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.83 (this is the best value that can be obtained in this simulation but it is far away from the 0.99 obtained with real data). The  diagonal matrix  (in which the diagonal elements are the root square of the average number of replicates stored in ) is: Finally  the  matrix  calculated as  (Eq. ())  is: Eigenvalues of   which are calculated by using the Jacobi algorithm  are in Table . In this example  all four principal components are needed to capture more than 99% of the variability of  and thus are retained as explanatory (). The  (4<U+2009>×<U+2009>4) matrix of eigenvectors extracted from   and relating  with the four    is: Finally  the  (20<U+2009>×<U+2009>4) matrix () allocating the  scores of RH  calculated as  (Eq. ())  is thus:  This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License ()  which permits unrestricted use  distribution  and reproduction in any medium  provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source  provide a link to the Creative Commons license  and indicate if changes were made.

This advantage also increased with increasing family sizes or decreasing genome sizes. The use of genotyping information for grouping animals increases the accuracy of selection when phenotypic group records are used in genomic selection breeding programs. Continuous individual records are difficult and expensive to obtain for some economically important traits such as feed efficiency and egg production. For breeding programs that aim at improving genetic gain in the presence of genotype-by-environment (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) interactions  continuous individual recording of such traits can even be impossible for animals that are tested in commercial production environments or in village conditions. In such situations  the use of pooled data from group records can be an alternative  which was shown to be feasible for predicting variance components and breeding values of animals with pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) [   ]. These studies showed that accuracy of prediction depends on the relationships between group members and increases when group members are more closely related. In the additive numerator relationship matrix  the relationship coefficients between members of a full-sib group are all the same  i.e. 0.5 for unrelated parents or higher for inbred parents. Compared to pedigree information  genomic information gives a better measure of the relationships between animals. VanRaden [] showed that the realized genomic relationships between specific pairs of full-sibs vary with the standard deviation of the relationship coefficients according to genome size and number of chromosomes. Empirical values of the relationship coefficients between pairs of full-sibs range from 0.27 to 0.70 for chicken [] and from 0.35 to 0.65 for cattle []. We hypothesized that genomic information could be exploited to improve the accuracy of prediction of breeding values based on group records when it is available before animals are grouped for phenotype testing. The accuracy of prediction of breeding values based on group records increases as the relationships between animals within groups increase [  ]  thus an increase in genomic similarity between group members may improve accuracy of prediction. Unsupervised clustering of genetically similar individuals into groups based on genomic data is implemented in a program named STRUCTURE []. This Bayesian  model-based program  is widely used in analyses of population structure []. This program integrates over the parameter space  infers population structure  and makes cluster assignments for every individual []. The number of subpopulations  or clusters  can be given or estimated. An output of the program is the membership coefficient or probability that an individual belongs to a given cluster. Clustering individuals into subpopulations is a similar concept to clustering animals that have close relationships into the same groups. However  this approach may not be optimal for designing breeding programs because the number of individuals assigned to each cluster can vary under unsupervised clustering. For example  the breeding facilities  which are usually fixed systems  may be able to accommodate four groups with four animals per group  but unsupervised clustering ends up with animals that are clustered into only three groups of different sizes. Besides  the membership coefficient of an animal based on STRUCTURE cannot always clearly distinguish to which group the animal belongs. Thus  in addition to the grouping method based on the STRUCTURE program  we propose a grouping method that maximizes the relationships between animals within a group  based on the realized genomic relationship matrix. This grouping method is a supervised clustering approach  in which the number of groups and group sizes are defined as fixed input variables. Instead of using genotyping data directly  the method uses it indirectly through the realized genomic relationship matrix. The objectives of our study were to: (1) compare these two grouping methods based on genotyping information to improve accuracy of selection with group records  when using genomic BLUP (GBLUP) models to estimate variance components and genomic breeding values (GEBV) with group records  and (2) investigate the effects of adding surplus genotyped offspring  of the number of groups  family sizes and genome sizes on breeding schemes that used the proposed grouping method. These grouping methods were tested with a stochastic simulation study. We simulated a population of animals in three steps: (1) simulation of individual genotypes and phenotypes using the stochastic simulation program ADAM []  (2) allocation of simulated animals into groups based on pedigree or genomic information using different grouping methods  and (3) calculating group phenotypes from individual phenotypes. Variance components and breeding values were estimated from individual records or from group records using a GBLUP model. The historical base population and its genomic structure were from Chu et al. [] with a simulated genome of 26 chromosomes and a total length of 916 cM. Segregating loci of 2 k quantitative trait loci (QTL) and 40 k neutral markers that were randomly distributed along the genome were used to simulate information on traits and genotypes  respectively. The segregating QTL and markers had a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05 in the base population. Inheritance of QTL and markers from parents to descendants followed the standard principles of Mendelian inheritance  and allowed for recombination as described in Chu et al. []. From the base population  20 sires and 200 dams were used for a nested mating scheme in which one sire is mated with 10 dams. Each dam produced 16 offspring  thus the total number of offspring was 3200. Sex was randomly assigned to the offspring with a 1:1 ratio. Only one generation of offspring was simulated. All sires  dams and offspring had genotype information. The true breeding value of each individual was the sum of the effects of the QTL. Allele substitution effects of QTL were randomly sampled from a normal distribution   and then rescaled to achieve the initial additive genetic variance of 0.3 in the base population. The simulated phenotype of individual records was the sum of the true breeding value and an environmental deviation term:  where  is the individual phenotypic record of animal ;  is the mean of the trait equal to 0;  and  are the true breeding value and residual environmental deviation term of animal   respectively. The residual environmental deviations were drawn from the normal distribution . Thus  the phenotypic variance was 1. Four animals were pooled per group  which resulted in 800 groups. A group record was composed of the sum of all records of the group members. Individual records and group records were used to estimate variance components and GEBV using the DMUAI module from the DMU software package []. The model for individual records in matrix notation was (GBLUP: Eq. ): where  is a vector of phenotypic individual records;  is the mean;  and  are vectors of additive genetic and residual effects  respectively. These vectors are assumed to be normally distributed:  and   where  is a genomic relationship matrix constructed from marker data and  is an identity matrix associating residuals to individual phenotypic records;  and  are the additive genetic variance and residual variance  respectively. The incidence matrix  links  to individual phenotypic records. When group records were analyzed  the model for estimating variance components and GEBV was similar to the exact model of Olson et al. [] and to the model of Su et al. []  except that a realized genomic relationship matrix was used instead of the additive numerator relationship matrix. The models applied to equal group sizes was (GBLUP: Eq. ): where  is a vector of group records  i.e. the sum of the individual’s phenotypes  with number of elements equal to number of groups;  is a vector of additive genetic values of individuals as described above in the model for individual records: ;  is a vector of residuals:   where  is a diagonal matrix and diagonal elements are equal to group size. Matrix  is an incidence matrix associating  to phenotypic group records. Matrices  and  have an equal number of columns but a number of rows equal to the number of individual records and group records  respectively. For example  eight animals numbered 3 to 10 that were offspring of animals 1 and 2 were grouped in two groups of four animals. Phenotypic records of groups were 2.6 and 3.5. The model for group records is: The realized genomic relationship matrix  was constructed from marker data of all sires  dams and offspring individuals using VanRaden’s [] method 1: where  is a matrix that has number of rows equal to number of animals and number of columns equal to number of markers; matrix  is centered so that elements in column  are 0-2  1-2 and 2-2 for genotypes    and   respectively;  is the allele frequency of  at locus  computed from the marker data of all dams  sires and offspring. Division by  scales matrix  to be analogous to the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix. The realized genomic relationship matrix  was used in the genetic evaluation models and grouping methods and to investigate the distributions of relationships. For group records  animals were pooled into groups based on either pedigree or genomic information. Grouping methods based on pedigree information were random grouping of full-sibs and random grouping of paternal half-sibs. The two grouping methods based on genomic information were unsupervised clustering based on genotypes and supervised clustering based on the genomic relationships. For random grouping of paternal half-sibs  allocation of animals into groups was based on having a common sire. From each parental half-sib group of 160 animals  individuals were randomly allocated to 40 groups. For random grouping of full-sibs  allocation of animals into groups was based on having a common sire and dam. From each full-sib group of 16 animals  individuals were randomly allocated to 4 groups. When unsupervised clustering analysis using the STRUCTURE program was applied to all 3200 animals  paternal half-sibs from a sire were always clustered into one group even if the assumed number of clusters was set at 800. When unsupervised clustering was applied to a group of paternal half-sibs from a single sire  full-sibs from a family were always clustered into one group. Therefore  clustering analysis was carried out separately for every full-sib family of 16 animals. The admixture model in STRUCTURE was used []. The number of clusters was set to 4  and allele frequencies were assumed to be correlated between clusters []. Cluster membership coefficients of the 16 animals from the output were used for allocation to groups. Animals from the same full-sib group were pre-allocated into four groups based on their highest membership coefficients. In many cases  the pre-allocated four groups did not all have the expected number of four animals. Four animals with the top ranking membership coefficients from the biggest group were allocated to the first group. Then  the remaining 12 animals were pre-allocated into three groups based on their highest membership coefficients. Four animals with the top ranking membership coefficients from the biggest group were allocated to the second group. Similarly  four animals were allocated into the third group  and the fourth group consisted of the remaining four animals. These grouping allocation procedures were applied to all 200 full-sib families to constitute 800 groups. With the unsupervised clustering method based on genotypes  animals within a group were always full-sibs. A supervised clustering method scripted in R [] was developed to pool four animals into groups based on realized genomic relationships between animals. Applying this approach to all 3200 offspring was time-consuming because of the many possibilities for allocating the offspring into 800 groups. The probability that half-sibs or non-related animals were placed in the same group was extremely low. Therefore  grouping was carried out separately for every full-sib family of 16 animals. In each round of iteration  animals were assigned into groups by an evolutionary algorithm as follows: Animals from a full-sib family were randomly assigned to four groups with four animals in each group; An exchange of two randomly chosen animals between two randomly chosen groups was proposed; Group membership was updated if the proposal resulted in an increased mean genomic relationship between members within groups; The round ended when the exchange of two animals between two groups did not increase the mean of genomic relationships for  times  where  is the number of animals per group (group size) and  is the number of groups per full-sib family. The exchange of two animals between two groups was a random process  but if the exchange did not increase genomic relationships between group members  these two animals were not chosen for the exchange until a new set of animal groups was formed (the solution on the set of groups was retained if there was no improvement). The  times were the number of possibilities of forming a new set of animal groups when two animals are randomly chosen from two random groups. The exchange of two animals in each round of the above iteration is a conditional event given that a certain set of groups of animals is formed. Therefore  the above evolutionary algorithm was iterated for 300 rounds that formed up to 300 different sets of groups. The set of animal groups that resulted in the highest genomic relationship coefficient between group members was chosen. The number 300 is an empirical number that was chosen after different trials to get a set of animal groups with the highest genomic relationship coefficient between group members. Through this supervised clustering method based on genomic relationships  the offspring were allocated into 800 different groups and  within each of these groups  animals were always full-sibs. To investigate the effects of adding surplus genotyped offspring (more genotyped offspring than required in the groups)  number of groups for the same total number of individuals  family sizes and genome sizes for all grouping strategies (except the unsupervised clustering method)  four additional simulations (SS1 to SS4) were carried out with 100 replicates for each scenario. In sensitivity analysis simulation 1 (SS1) group sizes and number of groups per full-sib family were the same as in the base scenario. The number of surplus genotyped offspring were varied  i.e. set at 16 or 32 offspring per full-sib family (Table ). For comparisons  individual records in SS1 were obtained from only 16 offspring per dam that were randomly chosen from each full-sib family. SS2 had the same family structure as in the base scenario  but group sizes and number of groups per full-sib family were varied. In SS3  the number of groups was constant  but family size (number of offspring per dam) was varied. SS4 was the same as in the base scenario  except that the simulated genome consisted of 30 chromosomes each 100 cM long  i.e. it had a total length of 3000 cM. Table  summarizes the features of the base scenario and of SS1 to SS4 for the factors investigated. The supervised clustering method based on genomic relationships in SS1 to SS4 was similar to that in the base scenario with the aim to maximize relationships between animals within groups. In SS1  one extra group was added that included all surplus animals  which were not phenotyped or included in the calculation of the average relationship within groups. The probability of sampling groups for the exchange between two random animals corresponded to the number of animals of these groups. Scenarios were replicated 100 times. Accuracy of GEBV predictions was computed as the correlation between GEBV and true breeding values of all phenotyped offspring individuals. Bias of GEBV predictions was computed as the regression coefficient of true breeding values on GEBV. Coancestry coefficients were computed as the means of realized genomic relationships between the top GEBV rankings of 20 males and 200 females. Pairwise genomic relationships between animals that were half-sibs  full-sibs  paternal half-sibs or genomic-close full-sibs were used to investigate the distribution of relationships. Half-sibs were offspring from the same sires  but from different dams based on pedigree. Paternal half-sibs were offspring from the same sire that could be  but not necessarily  from the same dam. Genomic-close full-sibs were full-sibs that became members of the same group after applying unsupervised clustering based on genotyping or supervised clustering based on genomic relationships. All pairwise genomic relationships of group members from all 100 replicates were combined and used to calculate means and standard deviations. Realized genomic relationships of the breeding schemes were calculated for half-sibs  paternal half-sibs  full-sibs and groups of genomic-close full-sibs that were grouped by either unsupervised clustering based on genotypes or supervised clustering based on genomic relationships (Table ). As expected  the means of realized genomic relationships were roughly 0.50 for full-sibs and 0.25 for half-sibs (Fig. ). Paternal half-sib relationships were a mixture of full-sib and half-sib relationships. The highest means of relationships within groups were obtained when these were grouped by supervised clustering (0.55) and by unsupervised clustering (0.54). Distribution of realized genomic relationships between half-sibs (blue line and light-blue bars)  full-sibs (green line and light-green bars) and genomic-close full-sibs (full-sibs grouped by the supervised clustering method based on genomic relationship (red line and pink bars). Broken vertical lines are means of the genomic relationships Variance components estimated from group records were consistent with those estimated from individual records (Table )  and these estimates were not significantly different from simulated values. However  variance components estimated from group records had a higher standard deviation than those estimated from individual records. Accuracy and bias of GEBV based on individual and group records from the different prediction models are in Table . As expected  the accuracy of GEBV was higher when estimated from individual records than from group records. When group records were used to predict GEBV  accuracies of GEBV depended on the grouping method applied. Accuracies of GEBV decreased as the realized genomic relationships between group members decreased. Grouping methods based on genomic information led to higher accuracies of GEBV than the random grouping methods based on pedigree information. Group records from supervised clustering based on genomic relationships led to the highest accuracy and lowest standard deviation of the accuracy compared to group records from other grouping methods. Group records from random grouping of paternal half-sibs resulted in the lowest accuracy of GEBV prediction and the highest standard deviation of the accuracy. Coancestry coefficients were computed for the top 20 males and 200 females ranked by GEBV that were estimated from individual records and from group records (Table ). Coancestry coefficients between the top animals ranked by GEBV were lower when based on individual records than based on group records and were also lower with grouping methods based on genomic information than random grouping methods based on pedigree information. In SS1 to SS4  variance components estimated from group records were consistent with those estimated from individual records. Biases of GEBV estimated from individual records and group records showed no clear difference  and regressions of true breeding values on GEBV were close to 1. However  standard deviations of variance estimates and biases of GEBV over 100 replicates were greater for group records than for individual records. The results on variance estimates for SS1 to SS4 are not shown. Genomic relationships between group members  accuracies of GEBV and coancestry coefficients of the top ranking animals were similar for scenarios in SS1 to SS4. As in the main study  the supervised clustering method based on genomic relationships generally led to higher genomic relationships between group members  higher accuracies of GEBV and lower coancestry coefficients of top ranking animals than random grouping of full-sibs and random grouping of paternal half-sibs. In SS1  group size and number of groups per full-sib family were the same as in the base scenario  but there were surplus offspring that did not belong to any group or did not have phenotypes. With 0 (base scenario)  16 (SS1) and 32 (SS1) surplus offspring  coefficients of relationships between genomic-close full-sibs that were grouped by supervised clustering were equal to 0.55  0.60 and 0.62  respectively (Tables   ). An increased number of surplus offspring tended to increase the accuracy of GEBV that were estimated from group records of the genomic-close full-sibs (Tables   ). However  a change in the number of surplus offspring had no effect on the coefficient of relationships between group members or accuracy of GEBV for scenarios with groups that were formed by random grouping of full-sibs or random grouping of paternal half-sibs. The relative increases in accuracy of GEBV from using supervised clustering based on genomic information compared to using random grouping of full-sibs were 3.9 and 4.5% when the numbers of surplus offspring were 16 and 32 per full-sib family  respectively. In SS2  family size was the same as in the base scenario and kept constant  but the number of groups per full-sib family  and thus the group sizes  were varied. With group records formed by supervised clustering  random grouping of full-sibs and random grouping of paternal half-sibs  an increase in the number of groups per full-sib family led to an increase in accuracy of GEBV and a decrease in coancestry coefficients of top ranking animals (Table ). With group records formed by supervised clustering  a change in the number of groups per full-sib family from 2 to 8 changed the coefficients of genomic relationships between group members from 0.522 to 0.589  respectively but had no effect in terms of accuracy of GEBV. The relative increases in accuracy of GEBV from using random grouping of full-sibs to using supervised clustering based on genomic information were 1.3  1.7 and 1.4% for scenarios with 2  4 and 8 groups per full-sib family  respectively. In SS3  the number of groups was constant with four groups per family  but family sizes  and therefore group sizes  were varied. With records of groups formed by different grouping methods in SS3  an increase in the family size led to an increase in accuracy of GEBV and coancestry coefficients of the top ranking animals (Table ). With records of groups formed by supervised clustering  an increase in the family size led to a decrease in genomic relationships between group members. The relative increases in accuracy of GEBV from using random grouping of full-sibs to using supervised clustering based on genomic information were 1.2  1.7  2.4 and 3.2% for scenarios with family sizes of 8  16  32 and 48 offspring per full-sib family  respectively. Breeding structures  group sizes and family sizes of SS4 were the same as those of the base scenario  but the genome structure differed with a longer genome size  i.e. 3000 cM vs 916 cM. Accuracies of GEBV based on individual records and group records were higher in the base scenario than in SS4 (Table ). The means of genomic relationships between full-sibs or between paternal half-sibs were similar for the base scenario and SS4  but their standard deviations were lower for SS4. Genomic relationships between genomic-close full-sibs that were grouped by supervised clustering were higher in the base scenario than in SS4. The relative increases in accuracy of GEBV from using random grouping of full-sibs to using supervised clustering based on genomic information were 1.7 and 1.3% in the base scenario and SS4  respectively. In this work  we found that with GBLUP models  the estimated variance components were similar whether they were based on group or individual records  but their standard errors were larger for those based on group records than on individual records. These findings confirm those of previous studies that used pedigree-based BLUP models to estimate variance components based on group records [  ]. Compared to these studies [  ]  the main modification of our model for group records was the use of a realized genomic relationship matrix instead of a numerator genetic relationship matrix. With a numerator genetic relationship matrix  full-sibs in the same group have equal EBV whereas with a genomic relationship matrix  full-sibs in the same group can have different EBV. The benefit of using genomic information over pedigree information  in terms of accuracy of prediction  has been well documented in simulation studies [  ] and empirical studies of chicken [  ]  cattle [  ] and pig [    ] breeding schemes for individual records. The increase in accuracy of GBLUP prediction obtained by using individual records is due to an improved measurement of the relationships between animals and a better prediction of the Mendelian sampling terms []. These advantages of using genomic information should also apply to GBLUP models for group records  and thus increase the accuracy of prediction compared to pedigree-based models. For the same number of individuals  accuracies of GEBV based on group records were lower than those based on individual records. Coancestry coefficients of animals that were selected based on group records were also higher than those based on individual records. While the results from group records cannot compete with those from individual records  the number of phenotypes that need to be recorded differs between group and individual record data. At the commercial production environment level  group records are sometimes the only available phenotypes. When group records were analyzed  the accuracy of GEBV depended on the relationships between group members  i.e. it increased when group members were more closely related  as previously reported by Olson et al. []  Peeters et al. [] and Su et al. []. Allocation of animals based on sires resulted in a higher accuracy of EBV than that based on maternal grand sires []. The prediction of EBV and variance components was more accurate with group records of animals from the same family than from two different families [  ]. A possible reason could be that a larger proportion of the phenotypic variance at the group level is explained by the additive genetic (co)variance when increasing the level of relationships between individuals within a group []. In addition to the increase in accuracy of GEBV by using a genomic relationship matrix in a GBLUP model  the use of genomic information resulted in additional accuracy of GEBV through optimized grouping. With the grouping methods based on genomic information proposed here  we obtained higher relationship coefficients between individuals within groups than random grouping based on pedigree  which led to a higher accuracy of GEBV when group records were used. Compared to random grouping of full-sibs  accuracy improved by 1.2 to 1.7% when genomic information was used. However  while higher accuracies are preferred  the grouping methods based on genomic information require individual genotyping before transfer of the animals to phenotype testing facilities. The small improvement in accuracy of GEBV may not offset the genotyping cost in a situation where full-sib groups can be constituted without having genomic information. For situations where only paternal half-sib groups can be produced and full-sibs cannot be identified  accuracy would improve by 11.1 to 11.7%. This relatively large increase in accuracy is mainly due to the possibility to pool full-sibs into a group with genomic information. Our approach could be useful when the objective is to obtain records on feed efficiency in a commercial testing environment or on egg production in village household chickens (e.g. a program targeting genetic gains in African Chicken []). Another application is for genomic selection in fish breeding programs for which mating and reproduction are natural and sib information is absent []. When genotyping information is available prior to group testing  grouping based on genomic information could give additional “rewards” in the form of accuracy to genomic selection in such breeding programs. Coancestry coefficients were also lower with grouping methods based on genomic information compared to random grouping based on pedigree. In our study  the coancestry coefficients were defined as realized genomic relationships between the top 20 males and 200 females ranked by GEBV. Therefore  the coancestry coefficients are indications of future inbreeding when GEBV estimated from group records are used for selection. The use of more closely related animals to form groups can have two opposite consequences for the coancestry coefficients. One consequence is an increase in coancestry coefficients: since more closely related animals in the same group have the same phenotypic group records  GEBV between those animals are more similar  thus increasing co-selection. The other consequence is a reduction in coancestry coefficients because the use of more closely related animals to form groups increases the accuracy of GEBV prediction from group records  thus reducing co-selection. The latter benefit is obtained only with the GBLUP model because a reduction in co-selection due to increasing accuracy of prediction does not occur with pedigree-based BLUP. The EBV predicted from group records with pedigree-based BLUP are identical for full-sibs in the same group. With the prediction of GBLUP model from group records  full-sibs in the same group can have different GEBV  thus selected animals by top GEBV rank can come from different groups and different families. The effect of increasing accuracy of prediction was more pronounced when the more closely related animals were used to form groups. Thus  compared to random grouping of full or half-sibs based on pedigree  a decrease in coancestry coefficients of selected candidates was observed with grouping methods based on genomic information. Of the two grouping methods based on genotyping information proposed here  supervised clustering based on genomic relationships had a higher accuracy  was less computationally demanding  and is more easily applied in practice than unsupervised clustering based on genotyping. Unsupervised clustering analysis with the STRUCTURE program uses genotyping data to infer population structure and assign individuals to clusters  each of these being characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus []. Criteria for inferring population structure and assigning individuals are similarity or homogeneity of alleles between individuals in clusters and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of alleles in clusters. With such an inferred population structure  half-sibs from each sire were assigned to one group when unsupervised clustering analysis of STRUCTURE program was applied to all offspring. Full-sibs from each family would be assigned to one group if the unsupervised clustering analysis was applied to paternal half-sibs from each sire. Therefore  unsupervised clustering analysis of STRUCTURE was applied to each full-sib family. Then  membership coefficients of individuals that belong to clusters had to be used to obtain equally sized groups. Because of this re-arrangement of animals between groups  the advantage of unsupervised clustering to pool animals with genomic similarity into groups was reduced. Unsupervised clustering based on genotypes is not ideal for assigning animals to groups because testing facilities often have a fixed capacity for group sizes and number of groups. In addition  the unsupervised clustering analysis of STRUCTURE for each full-sib family is several hundred times more computation-expensive than the grouping method of supervised clustering based on genomic relationships. In contrast  our proposed grouping method of supervised clustering assigns individuals to groups based on a genomic relationship matrix that was calculated from genotyping data. This grouping method uses a relatively simple evolutionary algorithm to cluster animals into predefined numbers of groups and desired group sizes. Supervised clustering based on genomic relationships was carried out for each full-sib family because the probability of allocating half-sibs into the same group was very unlikely. The overlap of the distribution of full-sib and half-sib relationships is very small (Fig. ). When supervised clustering was applied to form groups from the whole population at one time  the members within a group were always from the same full-sib family. Grouping from the whole population was time-consuming  thus only a few replicates were tested (results not shown). However  it is useful to know that when family relationships are not available to apply grouping within full-sib families  the same benefits of grouping based on genomic relationships can be obtained with additional computational effort. The same principles for animal grouping based on genomic relationships can be also applied to paternal half-sibs  half-sibs and all testing candidates when the number of full-sibs per family is smaller than the intended group sizes. Compared to grouping based on pedigree information  there is only one situation for which grouping based on genomic relationships does not lead to an increase in genomic relationships between animals within groups  i.e. when the numbers of full-sibs per family are equal to group sizes. In such a situation  grouping based on pedigree and grouping based on genomic relationships will give the same result. The benefits of supervised clustering based on genomic information were further examined by increasing the number of surplus offspring. This approach can be useful in the situation that animals are used in different experiments  where some are done with groups  and others with individuals. This is a cost effective phenotyping strategy  and in some situations  animals raised in groups are preferred to better account for G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions due to animal housing. Compared to random grouping based on pedigree information  a surplus number of offspring available for supervised clustering based on genomic information increased the genomic relationships between group members furthermore  and improved accuracy of GEBV estimated from group records. The use of supervised clustering based on genomic relationships improved the accuracy of GEBV by up to 4.5% compared to the use of random grouping of full-sibs or by 14.7% compared to the use of random grouping of paternal half-sibs. Another factor that affected accuracy of GEBV and the genomic relationships between group members was genome structure. Genomic relationships between group members that are formed by supervised clustering depended on the genome structure  which may be related to the size of the simulated genome. Increasing the genome size decreases the genomic relationships between group members because the standard deviation of the coefficient of genomic relationships between full-sibs and between half-sibs decreases. For example  the standard deviation of genomic relationships between full-sibs is approximately equal to   where  is the number of independent loci in the genome []. The standard deviation will approach zero as the number of loci increases. However  the standard deviation does not fall below about 0.035 because loci are usually linked rather than independent []. In addition  increasing the genome size decreases the accuracy of GEBV from GBLUP models as shown by Daetwyler et al. []. We propose two grouping methods based on genomic information to improve the accuracy of prediction from group records. Variance components and GEBV from group records were estimated using GBLUP models. We found that estimates of variance components from group records were consistent with those from individual records and with their true values. Both grouping methods resulted in higher genomic relationships between group members  and prediction from records on these groups had a higher accuracy of GEBV prediction compared to records from random groups based on pedigree information. In addition  grouping based on genomic information led to lower coancestry coefficients of selected candidates than random grouping of paternal half-sibs and random grouping of full-sibs. Of the two proposed methods  supervised clustering based on genomic relationships was superior in terms of computation requirements and applicability. The benefits of supervised clustering based on genomic information were further examined by estimating the accuracy of GEBV from group records when the number of surplus offspring increased or when family sizes increased. Accuracy of GEBV and genomic relationship between group members that were formed by supervised clustering depended on the genome structure. In summary  genotyping information can be used to increase the accuracy of prediction from group records in two ways: genomic-based prediction and optimized grouping.

It is a hallmark of Holstein–Friesian cattle  and several previous studies have detected genetic loci with major effects for white spotting in animals with Holstein–Friesian ancestry. Here  our aim was to better understand the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of white spotting  by conducting the largest mapping study for this trait in cattle  to date.ResultsUsing imputed whole-genome sequence data  we conducted a genome-wide association analysis in 2973 mixed-breed cows and bulls. Highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found on chromosomes 6 and 22  highlighting the well-established coat color genes  and  as likely responsible for these effects. These results are in broad agreement with previous studies  although we also report a third significant QTL on chromosome 2 that appears to be novel. This signal maps immediately adjacent to the  gene  which encodes a known transcription factor that controls  expression and is the causal locus for white spotting in horses. More detailed examination of these loci revealed a candidate causal mutation in  (p.Thr424Met)  and another candidate mutation (rs209784468) within a conserved element in intron 2 of  transcripts expressed in the skin. These analyses also revealed a mechanistic ambiguity at the chromosome 6 locus  where highly dispersed association signals suggested multiple or multiallelic QTL involving  and/or other genes in this region.ConclusionsOur findings extend those of previous studies that reported  as a likely causal gene for white spotting  and report novel associations between candidate causal mutations in both the  and  genes.

It is a hallmark of Holstein–Friesian cattle  and several previous studies have detected genetic loci with major effects for white spotting in animals with Holstein–Friesian ancestry. Here  our aim was to better understand the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of white spotting  by conducting the largest mapping study for this trait in cattle  to date. Using imputed whole-genome sequence data  we conducted a genome-wide association analysis in 2973 mixed-breed cows and bulls. Highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found on chromosomes 6 and 22  highlighting the well-established coat color genes  and  as likely responsible for these effects. These results are in broad agreement with previous studies  although we also report a third significant QTL on chromosome 2 that appears to be novel. This signal maps immediately adjacent to the  gene  which encodes a known transcription factor that controls  expression and is the causal locus for white spotting in horses. More detailed examination of these loci revealed a candidate causal mutation in  (p.Thr424Met)  and another candidate mutation (rs209784468) within a conserved element in intron 2 of  transcripts expressed in the skin. These analyses also revealed a mechanistic ambiguity at the chromosome 6 locus  where highly dispersed association signals suggested multiple or multiallelic QTL involving  and/or other genes in this region. Our findings extend those of previous studies that reported  as a likely causal gene for white spotting  and report novel associations between candidate causal mutations in both the  and  genes. The sizes of the effects of these QTL are substantial  and could be used to select animals with darker  or conversely whiter  coats depending on the desired characteristics. Coat patterning traits provide visual characteristics that allow differentiation between domesticated animal breeds and between strains within breeds. White spotting is one of these phenotypes  and is a feature of a variety of mammals including cattle  horses  dogs  cats and mice. White spotting is a complex quantitative trait  for which several genes with major effects have been described and are relevant across species  as well as many other loci with small effects that account for the remaining genetic variance []. This oligogenic architecture derives from the multifaceted biology that contributes to white spotting of the coat  which is hypothesised to arise from abnormal melanocyte precursor migration and/or development. Mouse models have demonstrated that pigment cells originate from the neural crest cells via the SOX10 positive glial bipotent progenitor cells during embryogenesis  and migrate dorsally via the neural tube []. These cells proceed to differentiate into melanoblasts by acquiring expression of the genes - ()  - () and  ()  and migrate down the ventral axis of the body. When the cells reach their destination  they migrate into the epidermis where some melanoblasts localise to the hair follicle and differentiate into melanocytes. A subset of melanoblasts dedifferentiate  losing  and  gene expression  and colonise the hair follicle bulge where they act as melanocyte stem cells and replenish differentiated melanocytes during subsequent hair cycles []. Disruption of any of the above processes is expected to result in parts of the body lacking mature melanocytes  and thus regions of abnormal pigmentation in the hair coat. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) and mutations that cause white spotting have been described for a variety of species. Genetic studies in the horse revealed an inversion in the  gene associated with the Tobiano white-spotting []  and a mutation in the  gene associated with a splashed white pattern [  ]. Several mutations in the  gene have also been associated with complete white [] or roan coat phenotypes []. Studies on white spotting in dogs have revealed associations with the  gene []  and in mice more than 10 genes have been reported to be associated with white spotting traits  including the  and  genes []. Comparatively few studies have investigated the genetics of white spotting in cattle. Liu et al. [] found significant QTL on chromosomes 6  18 and 22 using linkage analysis within Holstein–Friesian (HF)<U+2009>×<U+2009>Jersey (J) crossbred cows. It has been suggested that the QTL on chromosomes 6 and 22 might be underpinned by the  and  genes  respectively []. Fontanesi et al. [] compared the sequences of the  gene in white spotted Italian Holstein and Simmental cattle  and solid coloured Italian Brown and Reggiana cattle  and found a haplotype (carrying allele g.31831615T) that is associated with white spotting. This haplotype accounts for some  but not all of the variation observed in the white spotting phenotype []. More recently  Hofstetter et al. [] investigated atypical white spotting in Brown Swiss cattle. They identified two completely linked single nucleotide variants within the 5' regulatory region of the  gene associated with white spotting  and although these variants largely account for the manifestation of white spotting  they do not account for the variability between individuals  which provides further evidence for a polygenic trait []. Hayes et al. [] detected the  and  genes in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that investigated the proportion of black in black and white Holstein cows  and reported an additional signal on chromosome 8  which carries  i.e. another potential candidate gene for this trait []. Together these studies converge on the involvement of  and  gene expression in white spotting in dairy cattle  however the causal variants that drive these effects have yet to be definitively identified and may be breed-specific. Here  our aim was to investigate white spotting in New Zealand dairy cattle  by using whole-genome sequence genotype data to conduct the largest GWAS of white spotting to date. We report three genome-wide significant QTL for white spotting. Effects on chromosomes 6 and 22 extend on previous associations at these loci  and further implicate the  and  genes as responsible for these effects. For the first time  we also report a QTL on chromosome 2 that implicates the  gene in white spotting of dairy cattle and highlight an amino acid substitution that may underlie this effect. White spotting data were derived from several cohorts of animals that included: 885 outbred dairy bulls (223 J  327 HF  and 335 HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J)  1389 outbred dairy cows (51 J  265 HF  and 1073 HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J)  and 699 HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J F2 cross cows from an experimental pedigree. Breed definitions  in these cases  define animals from a 4-generation pedigree that were / J or HF as purebreds  with / animals defined as crossbreeds. The F2 animals were ½ HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>½ J  representing a study population that was previously described in several publications [    ]. Genotyping data were available for 2973 animals  with genotype and phenotype information derived as described in the following sections. For animals in the F2 population  proportion of white spotting values that had been derived for a previous study [] were used directly in the current study. Video footage was recorded on 1389 cows walking single file either into or out of the milking shed using a GoPro HERO4 camera  at a 4000 pixel horizontal resolution. Still images that provide a clear side-on view of each animal were captured from the video footage using VideoPad Video Editor (v5.3). Additional side-on images representing either the right or left profile of 885 bulls were made available by LIC and incorporated into the dataset. First  cows and bulls were scored for the presence or absence of white on their coat and  then  the proportion of white spotting was quantified. Quantification was carried out manually using the image processing software  GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP  v2.9.8)  to generate an objective measurement of the proportion of white color. The freehand tool was used to trace each animal and remove the background. The pixel count from the remaining image  and the pixel count after manually subtracting the white regions on the coat  were used to calculate the proportion of white spotting on the coat. For 760 of the outbred cows included in the study  tissue samples were obtained from ear tissue biopsies and DNA extraction and genotyping were performed by GeneSeek (Lincoln  NE  USA) using the GeneSeek GGP50 k SNP chip. For all the remaining individuals  we used available single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes that were previously obtained by genotyping at Geneseek on a variety of platforms including the Geneseek GGPv1  GGPv2  GGPv3  GGP50 k  Illumina BovineSNP50 or BovineHD 777k SNP chips. A full list of the genotyping platforms  the number of SNPs per panel and the number of animals genotyped per panel are in Additional file : Table S1. Subsets of the reference and target populations that are described in this paper have been published by Lopdell et al. []  and Littlejohn et al. [  ]. Whole-genome sequencing  read mapping  and variant calling were performed on a population of 116 HF  95 J and 354 crossbred cattle as previously described [  ]. Briefly  DNA samples were sequenced based on 100-bp paired-end reads on the Illumina Hiseq platform  read mapping was performed using the UMD3.1 genome build and the BWA MEM 0.7.8 software [] and resulted in mean and median mapped read depths of 15× and 8×  respectively. Variants were called using the GATK HaplotypeCaller (v3.2) software []  which incorporates base quality score recalibration. Then  phasing of the variants was performed using Beagle 4 []  and variants with phasing allelic R metrics lower than 0.95 were excluded for quality filtering purposes. These criteria yielded the<U+2009>~<U+2009>19.5 M whole-genome sequence variants that constituted the reference set for imputation into the 2973 SNP-chip genotyped samples used for GWAS. A step-wise imputation was performed using the Beagle 4 software []. Note that these procedures were conducted to create an imputed sequence resource that is much larger than that used in the current study and represented<U+2009>~<U+2009>150 000 animals  which have been accumulated over time and imputed in three different batches. The overall pipeline was as follows: first  the animals that were typed on the GGP panels were imputed to a reference panel representing the BovineSNP50 SNP-chip. Then  BovineSNP50 data (now consisting of both imputed and physically genotyped data) were used to impute all the animals to the BovineHD platform. We also conducted a parallel step to impute all the samples to the GGPv3 platform  to recover non-overlapping content between that platform and the BovineSNP50 SNP-chip. These steps yielded two datasets that comprised an ‘all animals imputed to BovineHD’ set  and an ‘all animals imputed to GGPv3' set. These datasets were then merged  creating a scaffold for genome sequence imputation that contained all the animals imputed to all content from all SNP-chips. Following sequence imputation (by using Beagle 4)  data were then filtered to remove variants with extreme Hardy–Weinberg statistics (HW exact test; removal of 47 660 variants based on <U+2009><<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  and near-monomorphic positions (minor allele frequency (MAF)<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001; removal of 911 633 variants). These criteria yielded 18 641 995 variants  which were extracted for the subset of 2973 animals with color phenotypes from the larger<U+2009>~<U+2009>150 000 animal dataset. In terms of genetic representativeness between the sequence reference animals and the 2973 GWAS animals  1282 cattle were directly represented by both a sequenced sire and maternal grandsire in the reference dataset  of which 1122 were represented by a sire or maternal grandsire in this population. To address population stratification in the association models due to breed and relatedness  genomic relationship matrices (GRM) were generated using GCTA (v1.91.1 beta). These calculations involved the creation of 29 GRM  one for each bovine autosome  to enable a ‘leave one chromosome out’ GWAS approach where each GRM differs by the absence of a single autosome—thus avoiding double fitting when testing the effect of candidate variants. These GRM were calculated using a curated subset of variants from the Illumina BovineSNP50 platform  which comprised 34 963 variants that had been quality-filtered based on Mendelian concordance parameters  minor allele frequency (those with a MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02 were removed)  LD pruning (those with a R<U+2009>><U+2009>0.9 were removed)  and deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (those with a p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.15 were removed). The GCTA (v1.91.1 beta) software was used to conduct the mixed linear model-based association analysis (MLMA)  which incorporates the GRM as outlined above  in addition to fixed effects for farm of origin and cohort (the latter relevant to the F2 animals with the first cohort born in spring 2000 and the second cohort born in spring 2001 [      ]). Whole-genome sequence variants were filtered to remove the variants with a MAF lower than 0.005 prior to MLMA  this filter being different to that applied previously based on the frequencies present in the subpopulation of 2973 animals. To account for multiple hypothesis testing  a  value threshold of 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 was deemed to be significant for variant associations. To assess candidacy of the associated variants  RNA-seq data representing black and white bovine skin were sourced from a data submission accompanying the Koufariotis et al. [] paper  and uploaded into the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) for visualization []. Sequence variants in intervals of interest were functionally annotated by using SNPEff (v4.3) [] and the Ensembl UMD3.1 gene annotation set  with custom scripts to visualize these effects in Manhattan plots. To assess conservation metrics for candidate causal variants  genome evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) scores were obtained for the 32-way amniota vertebrae alignments (v92.31) from the Ensembl portal  with both element and site-wise scores reported in the text [  ]. For multiple protein alignments that were used to investigate the conservation of the  p.Thr424Met mutation   homologues were retrieved for other species using BLAST  and aligned using the Geneious software []. Sequence alignments representing the three major QTL regions were manually inspected in animals that displayed segregating tag-SNP genotypes to detect gene-disrupting structural mutations that might explain these QTL. However  given the ambiguity of the association signals at the chromosome 6 locus  a more formal analysis was conducted. Here  CNVnator (v0.3.3) [] was used to predict the presence of structural variants based on sequence read depth  using the same whole-genome sequence dataset as described in the ‘Genotypes  whole-genome sequencing  and sequence imputation’ section. This analysis used a sliding window size of 1000-bp with a 500-bp overlap and focused on a 20-Mb region on chromosome 6 (60 to 80 Mb). Then  predicted structural variants were ranked based on their genotype correlation with the top two QTL tag variants at the chromosome 6 locus (Chr6 g.64210286A>G rs451683615 and Chr6 g.71722665C>T rs463810013). Sequence alignments of relevant variants were visually inspected in IGV [] to assess evidence of a legitimate structural variant at each of these sites  weighted in the context of read mapping quality  gaps and/or other issues with the reference genome assembly  and whether the variant was polymorphic between samples. CNVnator-assigned genotypes were assessed in the same way for multimodality by visual inspection of copy number histograms. Since white spotting might be influenced by genes that operate via different mechanisms  we conducted two separate GWAS that differed in the definition of the phenotype. First  white spotting was scored as the presence or absence of white on the coat and encoded as a binary phenotype (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2973 animals). Second  white spotting was coded as a quantitative variable  where animals were scored based on the overall proportion of white (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2232 animals). Solid color animals were not included in the latter population  for which proportion of white was also log-transformed prior to association analysis to render data in a form approximating a normal distribution. All phenotypic measures were based on manual analysis of photographs (see Methods section)  that included images representing 699 Holstein–Friesian<U+2009>×<U+2009>Jersey (HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J) F2 cows scored as part of a previous QTL study []. The breed composition and sexes of the remaining animals are described in the Methods section  which include a mixture of HF  J  and HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J cows and bulls. Genome-wide association analysis was conducted based on imputed whole-genome sequence genotypes using the GCTA (v1.91.6) software. Genotypes were imputed to sequence resolution using a reference population of 565 whole-genome-sequenced animals and methods that are similar to those described previously (see “” section and Lopdell et al. []). The mixed linear models assumed additivity and incorporated adjustments for farm of origin  cohort []  and a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) computed in GCTA (v1.91.6). Imputed data were also filtered to remove variants that had a MAF lower than 0.005 and met other quality filtering criteria described in more detail in the Methods section. Results of the association analysis for presence/absence of white on the coat revealed three signals that surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold of <U+2009>=<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and were located on chromosomes 2  6  and 22 (Fig. a). The top variants for these QTL mapped to Chr 22 g.31769747A>G (rs209784468  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.51<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  Chr 6 g.64210286A>G (rs451683615  <U+2009>=<U+2009>3.73<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  and Chr 2 g.111576221A>C (rs109979909  <U+2009>=<U+2009>3.26<U+2009>×<U+2009>10).  Manhattan plot based on the GWAS results for the presence/absence of white color on the coat. The top variants on chromosome 22  6 and 2 have p-values of 1.51<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  3.73<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 3.26<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  respectively.  Manhattan plot based on the GWAS results for the proportion of white spotting. The top variants on chromosome 22  6 and 2 have p-values of 1.83<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  1.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 1.27<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  respectively. The red line indicates the genome-wide significance threshold <U+2009>=<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 For the analysis that treated white spotting as a quantitative variable (proportion of white spotting)  GWAS revealed the same three regions as those described for the binary-encoded trait (<U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10; Fig. b). Furthermore  this analysis presented the same three top-associated variants that were identified in the first GWAS  which suggested that these signals represented the same QTL. These results are in agreement with previous findings that described white spotting as a quantitative trait  i.e. under the control of multiple QTL [  ]. Given that the signals derived from the quantitative phenotype were also more significant than for the binary trait  this phenotype became the focus of the analyses that are presented below. Table  lists the top 10 associated variants and the effects of these QTL. Notably  the sizes of the effects of all three QTL were very large  with allele substitution effects of 3.2  12.9  and 11.5% for the top tag SNPs on chromosomes 2  6  and 22  respectively. A SNP at Chr22 g.31769747A>G (rs209784468) was identified as the most significant variant in our association analysis (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.83<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  and mapped to a region 284-bp upstream of the Ensembl-annotated transcription start site (TSS) of the  gene. The MITF transcription factor is involved in melanocyte survival  maintenance and differentiation []  and is therefore the most obvious candidate at this locus. Based on the Ensembl v92.31 gene build [  ]   is also one of the only two annotated protein-coding genes that are present within a 1-Mb window around rs209784468  which provides strong support for the causative status of this gene. Figure a shows a Manhattan plot of this interval  with the variants being color-coded according to predicted functional impact using SNPEff []. To assess whether the signal observed on chromosome 22 was likely representative of a single biallelic QTL  we ran an additional analysis  by fitting the top-associated SNP (rs209784468) as a fixed effect in the association model. This analysis removed significance at almost all the variants within a 1-Mb interval (Fig. a  b)  but a slight residual signal remained (smallest <U+2009>=<U+2009>8.53<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for Chr22 g.31730376 rs109549448; Fig. b). Although imputation error or unaddressed population stratification might explain the small residual signal revealed in this analysis  the well-described allelic heterogeneity for  supports the potential existence of multiple and/or multiallelic QTL. It should be noted that  in a recent analysis in Brown Swiss cattle  Hofstetter et al. [] identified a SNP (rs722765315)  located within the 5'-region of the  gene as a candidate causal variant for white spotting []. However  examination of this site in our whole-genome sequenced cohort shows that it is invariant in Holstein–Friesian and Jersey animals  which suggests the presence of one or more alternate causal variants in the New Zealand population. QTL analysis of chromosome 22 with variants color-coded according to predicted functional impact using SNPEff.  1-Mb window of imputed whole-genome sequence association data centred around the top variant Chr22 g.31769747A>G (rs209784468) with the corresponding annotated gene track above.  1-Mb window of imputed sequence association data with rs209784468 fitted as a fixed effect in the association model. The red line indicates the genome-wide significance threshold =<U+2009>5×10  Notably  we observed a predicted missense mutation that affects  at Chr22 g.31769331C>T (rs110881545; Fig. a). Although it could be a candidate mutation for the QTL  this variant was not significant  and was called at a very low frequency in the genome sequence reference population used for imputation (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01). Manual inspection of sequence alignments from animals heterozygous for this variant showed read depth anomalies around annotated intron–exon boundaries  which led us to analyze in more detail these features. Although we used DNA-based sequence data  at these boundaries we observed an increased sequencing depth for the exons  which are reminiscent of RNA-sequence alignments (see Additional file : Figure S1). Analysis of soft-clipped reads from the exons showed that the mismatches corresponded to neighboring exon structures  which suggest that they were derived from a mis-mapped  processed  pseudogene. Non-exonic read pairs from the apparent  pseudogene mapped to a single location on chromosome 12 at 58.7-Mb  indicating that this locus is the likely site of integration of the pseudogene. Notably  this pseudogene was polymorphic across animals  which raised the possibility that the QTL might be caused by this structural variant. String match searching for spliced  sequence reads from the whole-genome sequence alignments  allowed us to genotype the 565 whole-genome-sequenced animals in our reference population for the pseudogene  giving a MAF of 0.026 for the integrated allele. This MAF value contrasted markedly with that of the top tag variant from GWAS (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.304); and when pairwise linkage disequilibrium statistics were examined between the pseudogene ‘genotype’ and variants from the broader chromosome 22 and chromosome 12 regions  the most highly correlated markers were also non-significant in the GWAS (chromosome 12  maximum R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.72 for rs461882713 Chr12 g.6060748C>G  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.72; chromosome 22  maximum R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.69 for rs384283283 Chr22 g.31734120C>T  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.67). Although the processed  pseudogene was a good biological candidate for the modulation of coat color or pattern  these observations led us to assume that it was not responsible for the white spotting QTL in our study.  Apart from the  pseudogene identified above  no other protein-coding changes were identified in  that could explain this QTL. Although two synonymous  variants exceeded genome-wide significance  their association was sufficiently weak to discard them as underpinning the QTL (Fig. a). Together  these observations suggested an expression-based mechanism for a MITF-derived effect on white spotting. The top associated variant Chr22 g.31769747A>G (rs209784468) is a reasonable candidate in this regard  as it maps to a region immediately upstream of the annotated transcription start site (TSS). However  inspection of RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) data for black and white bovine skin samples published by Koufariotis et al. [] showed alternative gene structures that include additional 5' exons to the Ensembl-derived annotation (MITF-201; Ensembl v92.31)  in which the rs209784468 variant mapped to intron 2 of the two predominant RNA-seq derived structures (Fig. ). Similarly  examination of the transcripts annotated on the newest version of the bovine reference assembly at the time of the preparation of this paper (ARS-UCD1.2) showed alternative  structures  for which the skin-derived transcripts were best represented by the MITF-205 and MITF-206 transcripts (Ensembl v96.12). Notably  18 additional variants that displayed association statistics that were broadly similar to those of rs209784468 (<U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) also mapped within introns 1  2  3  and up to 100-kb upstream of the alternate  isoforms. To further investigate these variants  we downloaded genome evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) scores from the Ensembl portal to assess conservation metrics of the sites (Table ; [  ]). Although the location of this variant was less appealing than some of the others that map closer to the assumed 5'  promoter  the top-associated SNP is the only variant that mapped to a conserved element identified from the 32-way amniote vertebrate alignments (Fig. ). This SNP is also conserved on a site-wise basis (GERP score<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.21)  and based on its association ranking  it constitutes a plausible candidate regulatory mutation for this QTL. Detailed view of introns 1 to 3 of the Ensembl-derived  gene structure and introns 1 to 5 of the RNA-seq derived  structures  with constrained elements and GERP score for 32 amniota vertebrates from Ensembl (Bos taurus v92.31). g.31769747A>G (rs209784468) is highlighted and located to a highly conserved region within intron 2 of the RNA-seq derived MITF gene structures The top variant at the chromosome 6 locus (Chr6 g.64210286A>G rs451683615  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  maps to an intergenic region approximately 280-kb downstream of the  gene  which represents quite a considerable distance from the  gene (~<U+2009>7.5-Mb). However  the third and fourth most strongly associated variants map within the fourth intron of  (Chr6 g.71873479T>C rs109512689  <U+2009>=<U+2009>8.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and Chr6 g.71873455A>C rs385773341  <U+2009>=<U+2009>8.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Given the dispersion of the chromosome 6 signal  and the association of variants that are located within and adjacent to the strong a priori candidate gene   we considered a large interval (16-Mb) around the top variant rs451683615 for functional prediction of variant effects. The following genes map to this interval:  and . Figure  shows a Manhattan plot for this region  with variants color-coded according to predicted functional impact using SNPEff. Based on association statistics  none of the variants in the top 10 orders of magnitude are predicted to change the protein-coding sequence of these genes  although there is a modestly associated splice region variant in  (Chr6 g.71906518T>C rs109750754  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.94<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Given that the primary signals highlight non-coding variants  a QTL mechanism that incorporates one or more gene expression-based effects seems most likely. QTL analysis of chromosome 6 with variants color-coded according to predicted functional impact using SNPEff.  16-Mb window of imputed whole-genome sequence association data centred around the top variant Chr6 g.64210286A>G (rs451683615) with the corresponding annotated gene track above.  16-Mb window of imputed whole-genome sequence association data with rs451683615   Chr6 g.71722665C>T (rs463810013) and  both rs451683615 and rs463810013 fitted as fixed effects. The red line indicates the genome-wide significance threshold <U+2009>=<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  One explanation for the dispersed nature of the chromosome 6 QTL is that this locus comprises multiple  overlapping effects. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis between the top variant (Chr6 g.64210286A>G rs451683615) and the next three most strongly associated variants (Chr6 g.71722665C>T rs463810013  Chr6 g.71873479T>C rs109512689 and Chr6 g.71873455A>C rs385773341) supports this hypothesis  with rs451683615 being in relatively low LD with the other variants (maximum R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35). Furthermore  when rs451683615 was fitted as a fixed effect  the signal on chromosome 6 still exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold (<U+2009>=<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  with the two strongly correlated  variants (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.91) rs208251862 (Chr6 g.71692344C>A; <U+2009>=<U+2009>7.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and rs463810013 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) now being the top variants (Fig. b). When the rs463810013 variant was fitted as a fixed effect to represent these effects  rs451683615 once again became the most significant variant (=<U+2009>3.054<U+2009>×<U+2009>10; Fig. c)  and when both rs451683615 and rs463810013 were fitted as fixed effects  a small signal was still detected near  (smallest <U+2009>=<U+2009>3.31<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for Chr6 g.72007252A>T rs109258078; Fig. d). These results suggest that the signal observed on chromosome 6 is likely the result of two or more QTL  and/or alternatively  the consequence of one or more structural variants that are not well tagged  and therefore cannot be easily accounted for by fitting biallelic SNPs in the association models.  Given the ambiguity of the association signals at the chromosome 6 locus  and the implication of  structural variants that have a role in other coat characters in cattle (e.g. white face piebaldism in Hereford [] and color-sidedness in Belgian Blue  Brown Swiss  and other breeds [])  we performed a sequence-based structural variant analysis to attempt to identify segregating candidate mutations for this QTL. This analysis was conducted using the same population of 565 whole-genome-sequenced animals as that used for sequence imputation prior to GWAS  and we focused on a broad 20-Mb region (60 to 80-Mb) to capture the dispersed nature of the association peak. This region included the top 10 variants shown in Table   for which the CNVnator software (v0.3.3) [] was used to call structural variants within the interval based on a 1-kb sliding window approach with 500-bp overlaps (see Methods). This analysis revealed a large number of candidate polymorphic intervals (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>39 960). We used correlation analysis between estimated copy numbers and genotypes from the top two associated GWAS variants (Chr6 g.64210286A>G rs451683615 and Chr6 g.71722665C>T rs463810013) to prioritize the variants for subsequent investigations. Of the top 10 most highly correlated variants for each of the two tag SNPs  these intervals represented six discrete structural variants (and some variants could be merged because they spanned adjacent intervals). Table  shows the position  mutation-type  and LD correlation coefficient of these six variants for the tag-SNP of interest  with LD values based on re-calling of the intervals following merging and manual boundary refinement. Visualization of sequence alignments suggested legitimate polymorphic structural variation for all six variants  with four of these showing clear multi-modality in read depth (see Additional file : Figure S2). Notably  LD analysis between the six structural variants and the 124 445 other sequence variants within the 20-Mb chromosome 6 interval showed that five of the six variants were better tagged by other chromosome 6 polymorphisms  which all showed limited phenotypic association by comparison with the top-associated tag SNPs rs451683615 and rs463810013 (Table ). One exception was a 330-bp duplication at Chr6:72 060 120-72 060 450 bp  where this variant was best tagged by a SNP that is largely equivalent to rs463810013 (rs385773341 Chr6 g.71873455A>C; R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.98 with rs463810013; Table ). None of the six structural candidates mapped to protein coding sequences  although the apparent 330-bp duplication was also the polymorphism nearest to  (albeit 142-kb downstream). Assessment of the potential function for this variant did not present any obvious regulatory implication  since the duplication was devoid of noteworthy site-wise conservation or GERP-annotated constrained elements. Acknowledging the fact that our read-depth-based analysis of structural variation may represent the complexity of the identified candidate mutations  these data likely exclude five of six of the structural variants as candidates for the white spotting QTL. The potential role of the sixth candidate variant is unknown  and although the duplication was best represented by the top GWAS tag variants  its overall correlation was still low (maximum R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.43). This observation  and the fact that copy number genotypes were not clearly differentiated for this variant (see Additional file : Figure S2)  lead us to suggest that physical genotyping and more detailed investigation will be required to further assess the nature and candidacy of this polymorphism. The top variant at the chromosome 2 locus (Chr2 g.111576221A>C rs109979909  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.27<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) maps to intron 1 of the  gene. Considering all the genes in a 1-Mb interval centered on rs109979909  the - and  genes map to this region. In particular   is a striking candidate  since it encodes a  transcription factor (see “” section above) and was proposed as a causal gene for the ‘splashed white’ coat phenotype in horses []. Variant effect prediction for all variants in the 1-Mb interval (Chr2:111 076 221–112 076 221 bp) revealed a candidate causal missense mutation in   that codes for a threonine to methionine substitution at amino acid position 424 (rs208582518; p.Thr424Met; Fig. ; []). Although the p.Thr424Met variant shows a comparatively weaker association than the top associated variant at this locus (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.72<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 versus smallest <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.27<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  it is sufficiently strongly associated to remain a compelling candidate mutation for the QTL. Additional inspection of the sequence alignments across the 1-Mb region centered on rs109979909 did not show any evidence of segregating structural variants as alternative candidates at this locus. QTL analysis of chromosome 2 with variants color-coded according to predicted functional impact using SNPEff.  1-Mb window of imputed whole genome sequence association data centred around top variant Chr2 g.111576221AC (rs109979909) with the corresponding annotated gene track above.  1-Mb window of imputed whole-genome sequence association data with rs109979909 fitted as a fixed effect. The red line indicates the genome-wide significance threshold <U+2009>=<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  The p.Thr424Met (rs208582518) variant maps to exon 9 of the  gene. When fitted as a fixed effect in the association model  the variant accounted for the majority of the signal at this locus (smallest <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0149 for Chr2 g.111955758G>A rs41718011 for this model; Fig. b). The p.Thr424Met variant is located within the transactivating domain of the PAX3 transcription factor  which is also identified as a constrained element from the GERP 32-way amniote alignments. The variant has a site-wise GERP score of 1.72  and when assessing the predicted functional impact of the missense variant using the SIFT algorithm [] that is integrated as part of the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor []  this SNP is predicted to be ‘deleterious’ (score 0.01  low confidence). Likewise  p.Thr424Met is predicted to be ‘possibly damaging’ (score 0.86) by the Polyphen-2 functional prediction tool [  ]  and multiple alignment of PAX3 protein sequences representing a range of vertebrates also shows conservation of the threonine residue and surrounding amino acid acids in mammals (Fig. ). Overall  the  p.Thr424Met missense mutation is a compelling candidate causal mutation for the white spotting phenotype  although the strong association of other non-coding variants leaves open the possibility of expression-based effects  which again operate most likely through the  gene. Region around the p.Thr424Met mutation. Wild-type threonine at position 424 is conserved across cow ()  horse ()  human () and mouse ()  orthologues White spotting is a characteristic trait in HF and has been under selection for many generations. Although some J animals in New Zealand show white spotting  it is far less frequent in this breed. Thus  we expect that the alleles that are associated with a greater proportion of white spotting are more frequent in HF. Based on the allele frequencies of the top tag variants for each of the three major QTL in 589 purebred HF  and 274 purebreed J  we obtained the frequencies shown in Table  (see “”: Study populations for breed definitions). Here  we have denoted the white-increasing allele as   and the white decreasing allele as . Given the large sizes of the effect of the QTL  it is interesting to examine how ‘’ (more white) or conversely ‘’ (less white) alleles might combine across loci to impact the phenotype. To investigate the QTL in this way  ‘stacked’ genotypes were derived for each animal based on the top-associated tag variants representing the chromosome 2  6  and 22 loci. In this way  animals could be categorized based on the number of ‘’ alleles presented (possible range from 0 to 6). This analysis focused on a subset of 699 F2 cows (½HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>½J) to minimize possible confounding by admixture  where animals were also all derived from the same research group. The smallest number of  alleles carried in this population was two (‘2’; N<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 cows)  none of these cows displaying visible white color on their coat (based on pictures that show only a single side view). By comparison  animals that carry six  alleles (i.e. homozygous  for all three loci; ‘6’; N<U+2009>=<U+2009>160) displayed a striking increase in white spotting. Figure  compares the 10 2 animals (left panel) with a random selection of 10 6 animals (right panel)  and highlights the major impact of these QTL. The mean percentage of white spotting value was 0% for the 10 2 animals and 32.6% for the 160 6 animals (or 36.9% for the subset of 10 6 animals shown in Fig. ). These observations give some clue as to the somewhat counterintuitive finding that  alleles for two of the three QTL are the major alleles in J animals. Although this breed is best known for its solid  light brown coat  in F2 animals  only those with a large number of  alleles showed substantial proportions of white spotting on their coat. Additional file : Figure S3 and Additional file : Table S2 also show a breakdown of the  allele counts in purebreds  based on the 589 HF and 274 J animals referenced above. In this purebred dataset  the percentage of J animals with 6 alleles is only 1.8%  whereas in HF it reaches 91.7%. This is consistent with the observation that the numbers of J animals in New Zealand with prominent white spotting are small and the numbers of those that have splashes of white or white accents are larger. It is also noteworthy that the  alleles for the three major QTL are reference alleles in the UMD3.1 genome assembly  which is based on a single Hereford cow. The population frequencies of these variants in the Hereford breed are unknown  and although this breed is not as characteristically spotted as the Holstein breed  Herefords are well known for their white faces (attributed to another mutation in  [])  with substantial white markings concentrated on the belly  brisket  neck  and back. Black and white images of 10 ½HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>½J cows carrying the smallest number of  alleles observed (2; left)  contrasted with 10 ½HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>½J cows carrying the [maximum number of  alleles at the three major loci (6; right) We present the first association analysis for white spotting in dairy cattle using imputed whole-genome sequence data. This study comprises the largest GWAS for this phenotype  to date  providing details of the genetic effects on white spotting in a population of approximately 3000 HF  J  and their crosses. We provide evidence for the implication of the    and  genes in white spotting of the coat  and further suggest regulatory and missense variants that potentially explain the effects of the  and  genes.  is the only plausible candidate for the QTL on chromosome 22  which encodes a transcription factor that has been shown to impact pigmentation in cattle [  ]  mice []  horses [  ]  dogs [  ]  humans []  and most recently ducks []. It is also the only gene located near the top associated variant (Chr22 g.31769747A>G rs209784468)  which is situated in intron 2 of MITF transcripts based on the analysis of skin RNA-seq data. The rs209784468 variant falls within a conserved genomic region  which  in conjunction with its status as the lead associated variant  makes rs209784468 a candidate causal variant for this QTL. Given that this SNP and other lead variants are non-coding  and given the lack of other candidate variants that map to protein-coding sequences  we hypothesize that the mechanism underlying the QTL on chromosome 22 is a modulation of the expression of . However  how this effect manifests itself during development is unknown. MITF is required during embryonic development to stimulate the transition of neural crest cells into melanocyte precursors []. If the  gene is not expressed within the small window during which transition is meant to take place  future expression of  cannot rescue melanocyte development []. Impaired functionality or expression of the  gene during development will result in a reduced number of melanocytes  and manifest itself as white spotting on the coat []. However  impaired functionality of the  gene within the mature hair follicle may also impair melanocyte survival and differentiation []  thus decreasing the number of pigment producing melanocytes. In humans and mice  loss-of-function mutations in  cause severe symptoms including: coloboma  osteopetrosis  microphthalmia  albinism and deafness [  ]. Disruptive mutations in  also cause Tietz syndrome  which is characterized by depigmentation of the skin  hair  iris and severe hearing loss  and Waardenburg syndrome type 2A  which is characterized by patchy depigmentation of the skin and bi- or unilateral deafness in humans and mice [    ]. Interestingly  mutations with a strong effect have also been observed in cattle [  ]. The white spotting  variant that we describe in this study represents a common allele (or nearly fixed in the case of HF animals)  with no known effects on hearing or other undesirable phenotypes. The fact that this variant causes a less severe phenotype than the variants with a strong effect fits with an expression-based mechanism for this QTL  however it would still be interesting to compare the phenotype of the segregating individuals for the QTL identified in the current analysis with the phenotypes of individuals with more severe  syndromes (e.g. hearing loss). In terms of functional analyses  to unambiguously test the role of the rs209784468 SNP and other linked candidates  experiments analogous to those performed in an investigation of human hair color loci [] could be performed. Cell-culture-based analyses or studies on model organisms could be conducted to perturb the candidate loci that have an effect on gene expression or pigment formation/melanocyte function. The most significant variant for the QTL on chromosome 6 mapped to a region 7.5-Mb upstream of the  gene. Although seemingly too far away to cause this signal  the  gene is perhaps the single most famous and well-characterized pigmentation gene. There are 19 reported mutations within or near the equine  gene that cause either complete depigmentation  or white spotting [      ]  and there are approximately 76 known  alleles in mice that cause dominant or semi-dominant white spotting [  ]. A  translocation mutation has also been identified as the causative mutation for ‘color sidedness’ and the white coat phenotype in Belgian Blue and White Galloway cattle [  ]. Although it is possible that the white spotting QTL in the current study is underpinned by contributions from other genes  these facts make  worthy of consideration as the likely causal agent underlying the chromosome 6 signals. Thus  the inconsistency of the mapping data may instead represent an amalgamation of multiple signals at the locus  and/or some other complexity that is not well represented by our imputed genome sequence dataset. Indeed  when the lead variants were consecutively fitted in our association analyses  no single variant could account for the signal. Given the precedent regarding the  structural mutations that influence coat phenotypes  we also conducted a sequence-based structural analysis of a broad  20-Mbp region encompassing  and the top tag variants from the GWAS. This analysis did not reveal any obvious candidate but it is possible that these efforts were confounded by errors in the genome assembly around   an observation highlighted through analyses by Whitacre et al. []. If such confounders exist  breed-specific de novo assemblies and sequence information based on long-read sequencing technologies  such as single-molecule sequencing []  may be helpful in future investigations of the locus. Additional future work could also attempt to fine map the effects in alternative breeds in which fewer QTL could be segregating  or alternatively conduct functional analyses as mentioned in the previous section for the associated variants that map to intron 4 of  itself. To our knowledge  the observation of a likely role for  in white spotting of the coat in cattle is a novel finding. The top variant for this QTL on chromosome 2 mapped to a region 0.3-Mb upstream of the  gene  although bioinformatic prediction of variant effects revealed a highly associated p.Thr424Met missense mutation that could underlie this QTL. Previous studies have reported variants in  that cause pigmentation phenotypes in humans []  mice [] and horses [  ] and variation in ambilateral circumocular pigmentation in the Fleckvieh breed of cattle []. The latter phenotype describes pigmentation of the area that encircles the animals’ eyes in breeds that otherwise have a white head  which raises the possibility that white spotting in HF is influenced by the same QTL that is involved in ambilateral circumocular pigmentation in Flekvieh cattle. In humans  as for some mutations in  protein-changing variants in  have been shown to cause a similar form of Waardenburg syndrome  which is characterized by wide set eyes  hearing loss and regions of depigmentation in the iris  hair and skin [  ]. Studies in humans and mice have demonstrated that the  gene encodes a transcription factor that binds directly to the proximal M promoter of the  gene  thus facilitating expression of  [    ]. Studies of different spontaneous and radiation-induced  mutations in Splotch mice have suggested that  is required for proper development of neural crest cells  expansion of melanoblast populations  and prevention of melanoblast terminal differentiation []. Thus  if the function of the PAX3 protein is altered   transcription and activity may be impaired  which in turn may have an impact on regional melanocyte populations and melanogenesis  resulting in an increased proportion of white spotting on the animal’s coat. It is also interesting that Hayes et al. [] observed an association between variants that are located next to the bovine  gene and the proportion of black on the coat. We did not observe a genome-wide significant signal on chromosome 8  although this association was demonstrated in Australian Holsteins []; the highlighted tag SNP in their study was not tested for association here because it was nearly fixed in our population (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and was excluded from the dataset. Unlike   the associations of  and  with melanogenesis are unclear  but the implication of these two structurally related transcription factors in independent GWAS should be analyzed in future work. Regarding the other major QTL identified  functional studies are required to confirm a causative effect of the  p.Thr424Met mutation  and confirm the molecular mechanism through which this QTL acts. Our results add strength to previous analyses that suggest the involvement of the  and  genes in white spotting of the coat in cattle  and reveal a new QTL for this trait at the  locus. The genes identified highlight the commonality of the mechanisms that underlie the modulation of skin and hair pigmentation in animals  in which all three genes are key regulators of melanocyte development  migration  and differentiation. Moreover  these three genes have already been implicated in the modulation of pigment phenotypes in diverse species. In addition  the sizes of the effect of the major QTL being substantial  there is potential for selection of whiter or darker animals  depending on the farmers’ preferences. Phenotypic data representing the white spotting phenotype were uploaded as a submission to the Dryad database () []. Sequence-based genotype data representing the three QTL of interest were uploaded under the same submission ID.

After applying filtering criteria  information on 93 animals (9 CC individuals  50 NEAC animals and 34 CC<U+2009>×<U+2009>NEAC crossbred individuals) and 3 123 434 autosomal SNPs were used. Four genomic islands of divergence were identified on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12  which were mapped accurately based on SNP data and which extended in size from 11 to 18 Mb. These regions differed considerably between the two populations although the differences in the rest of the genome were small due to considerable gene flow between the populations. The estimates of selection pressures showed that natural selection was substantially more important than genetic drift in shaping these genomic islands. Our data confirmed results from earlier publications that suggested that genomic islands are due to chromosomal rearrangements that are under strong selection and reduce recombination between rearranged and non-rearranged segments. Our findings further support the hypothesis that selection and reduced recombination in genomic islands may promote speciation between these two populations although their habitats overlap considerably and migrations occur between them. Marine fish species are often distributed across a variety of habitats  which makes these organisms interesting models to study the interaction between gene flow and natural selection. Atlantic cod ( L.) exploits different ranges of salinity and temperature across an extensive geographical distribution. However  due to a large effective population size and to gene flow between habitats []  a weak population genetic structure is predicted. Two extensively studied populations of Atlantic cod are the migratory Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) population and the stationary population known as coastal cod (CC) [  ]. Generally  migratory individuals use deeper and more offshore habitats  and the NEAC animals migrate long distances from Lofoten  Norway  to the feeding areas in the Barents Sea. In contrast  stationary individuals usually occupy the Norwegian coastal water habitats during their entire life cycle. At present  NEAC is the largest population of Atlantic cod  and is located in the Barents Sea []. However  NEAC individuals can migrate to areas which are also inhabited by CC individuals (Fig. ). Accordingly  breeding between NEAC and CC individuals occurs  but  to date  the degree of gene flow and interbreeding between both populations is not well known. Geographical distribution of the wild CC (black points and light grey shading) and NEAC (dark grey shading) populations and the hybrid zone (where the distributions overlap) of individuals used for the National cod breeding program of Nofima in Tromsø (Norway) In addition to dissimilarities in migratory and feeding features  there are also clear differences in growth rate and age at maturity between these two populations []. Moreover  the CC population is less susceptible to viral nervous necrosis (VNN) than the NEAC population. Natural selection can explain these results  with the NEAC population being adapted to the Barents Sea environment  while the CC population is more resistant to pathogens that are present in a coastal environment []. Traditionally  differences in the structure of their otoliths have been used to differentiate individuals from either the NEAC or CC populations []. However  genetic differences between these two populations have also been identified (reviewed by []). On the one hand  differences have been found regarding blood type E []  haemoglobin (-) alleles []  10 microsatellite loci []  and alleles at the membrane protein gene  () (now named  or ) []. At the  locus  the frequency of the  allele is above 90% in the NEAC population  whereas the  allele predominates in the CC population []. On the other hand  little or no genetic differences between these populations have been detected at most allozymes []  microsatellites [] and at the mitochondrial cytochrome  locus []. It has been suggested that  during the early stages of divergence  genetic differentiation may have been restricted to a few specific genomic locations  called genomic islands  while the majority of the genome remained homogenised because gene flow is still in progress []. This has been supported by theoretical and empirical investigations []. Involvement of other mechanisms has been suggested  such as chromosomal rearrangements including inversions  divergence hitchhiking  and processes that promote the genomic co-localisation of genes []. In cod  several authors [             ] using different types of genomic data showed that population differentiation occurred at four discrete islands of genomic divergence located on different chromosomes (Table ). Recent developments have enabled next-generation sequencing technology to compare individual complete genomes with high precision. The objectives of our study were to identify genomic islands of divergence and to propose an approach to measure the strength of the natural selection within each genomic island in the NEAC and CC populations and their crosses using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Genomic information from 111 animals belonging to the National cod breeding program of Nofima in Tromsø (Norway) was used. More specifically  year-classes (YC) from 2003  2004 and 2005 were formed as progeny of wild Atlantic cod. Since the generation interval of Atlantic cod is 3 years  the data from YC 2006  2007 and 2008 represent the first generation (F1) of the progeny of the selected fish from YC 2003  2004 and 2005  respectively. Accordingly  the data from YC 2009 represent the second generation (F2) of the progeny of the selected fish from YC 2006. Each sire was mated to two dams  while each dam was mated to one sire. Furthermore  some sires and dams were also mated across YC to create genetic links between YC. The base population of the breeding program consisted of fish that were sampled from different geographical areas along the coast of Norway. The dataset consisted of fish with pure (CC and NEAC) and crossed origins (see [  ] for more details). Genomic DNA from these individuals was extracted for resequencing using the Truseq Library prep kit from Illumina (Illumina  San Diego  USA). Paired-end sequencing (2<U+2009>×<U+2009>100 nucleotides) was carried out using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument to generate<U+2009>~<U+2009>22× genome coverage for each sample. Reads were identified and filtered as follows: short reads were aligned against the cod genome assembly v 1.94 [] using Bowtie 2 []. SAMtools [] was then used to identify and retain uniquely mapped reads. SNPs were called using the FreeBayes (v0.9.18) software []. Finally  SNPs that were informative in more than 20% of the individuals and with a MAF higher than 0.05 were kept for further analysis. Individuals were classified based on their allelic differences at the  locus [] and their geographical origins. The final dataset included 93 animals (9 CC stationary individuals  50 NEAC migratory animals  and 34 CC<U+2009>×<U+2009>NEAC crossed individuals) and 3 123 434 autosomal SNPs. Figure  shows the number of SNPs analysed for each chromosome. Number of SNPs analysed per chromosome Following Malécot []  it is possible to calculate the coancestry coefficient  between individuals  and . Genomic estimates of coancestry for each chromosome were obtained using the SNPs genotyped on each chromosome. Accordingly  genomic estimates of coancestry within chromosomes were obtained as follows. Because neighbouring SNPs showed significant coancestry differences  such that it was difficult to identify specific regions with a higher or lower coancestry based on individual SNPs  coancestry was estimated over sliding 200-SNP windows. Following this approach  the noisiness of single-locus coancestry estimates can be reduced and the precision of the estimates can be increased by combining data from several adjacent SNPs. This was based on the method proposed by Weir et al. []. For each chromosome  the first sliding window was identified by taking the first 200 SNPs at the beginning of the chromosome. Subsequently  the window slides across the chromosome by moving one SNP to the right  until the end of the chromosome is reached  maintaining 200 SNPs in each window. For each window  coancestry was estimated by taking the average of all coancestry values of the SNPs lying in that window. Genome-based estimates of coancestry were obtained for the CC  NEAC  CC<U+2009>×<U+2009>NEAC populations  and we also calculated the coancestry coefficient  between the individuals of both populations. The Genepop software version 4.3 [] was used to calculate Wright’s  [] between the CC and NEAC populations.  was calculated by taking all the SNPs from each chromosome into account and also by using the same sliding window approach as above with a window size of 200 SNPs on each chromosome. Using the same sliding window approach  allele frequencies that were higher than 0 in the CC population and equal to 0 in the NEAC population  and vice versa  were averaged. The coancestry  the  genetic differentiation coefficients and the private allele frequency for all chromosomes (except for chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12  which clearly showed selection signatures; see Figs.  and ) were used to establish the distribution of these values under the null-hypothesis. Significance thresholds were estimated as the 0.01% highest and lowest values for coancestry and as the 0.01% highest values for genetic differentiation and private allele frequency. Since the sliding windows overlap  the statistical tests were not completely independent  which reduced the effective number of tests performed  but this was not expected to affect the significance threshold. For instance  the threshold for the top 10 out of 1 million tests is approximately the same as for the top 1000 out of 100 million tests (for a large number of tests as was the case here). Although a P-value of 0.01% is very stringent  no explicit multiple testing correction was performed  such that these should be interpreted as nominal P-values. Nominally significant values are indicated in grey on Figs.    and . Mean coancestry coefficients () across chromosomes. Bars indicate standard errors Patterns of coancestry () on chromosomes 1 ()  2 ()  7 () and 12 () for the CC  NEAC  CC<U+2009>×<U+2009>NEAC and  populations. Genomic islands with significantly higher or lower coancestry are shown in grey The R-package Adegenet package version 2.0.1 [] was used to calculate and plot the first two principal components based on the SNP data available for the genomic islands on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12 and using all the SNP information for the other chromosomes. An additional analysis was performed by classifying the individuals based on the PCA results. This analysis was performed for each genomic island on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12. With this classification  it was possible to test the hypothesis that all the segregating SNPs in the group of homozygous animals for the rearranged segment were not segregating in the group of homozygous animals for the non-rearranged segment  and vice versa. In theory  SNPs that segregate in the group of animals with the rearranged segment should not segregate in the group with the non-rearranged segment because the rearrangement occurred on a single chromosome that later accumulated new mutations. However  these new SNPs do not segregate in the group of animals with the non-rearranged segment because the rearrangement prevents recombination between rearranged and non-rearranged segments. Another analysis based on PCA results was performed to evaluate the possibility that the sampled fish resulted from recent crossbreeding between the CC and NEAC populations. In this situation  a rearranged segment on one chromosome would not be independent of the rearranged segment on the other chromosome. This is important because otherwise the use of the  locus [] to classify NEAC and CC individuals (as mentioned above) might bias the results on all the chromosomes and not just on chromosome 1. To test for this  we calculated the correlation between the rearranged alleles on different chromosomes  which was expected to be positive if the fish were recent crossbreds and vice versa. The inbreeding coefficient of the two populations relative to the population from which they diverged for each locus     can be estimated as: where  and  are the allele frequencies in the CC and NEAC populations  respectively. The average inbreeding () for all the chromosomes (except chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12; see Figs.  and ) is calculated and  (i.e. the product of effective population size  by migration rate ) is estimated as: Mean genetic differentiation coefficients () across chromosomes. Bars indicate standard errors Accordingly  the average inbreeding within the genomic regions on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12 (see Figs.    and )  is calculated. Based on these averaged inbreeding values and the above  value  it is possible to estimate  (i.e. the product of effective population size  by selection pressure ) as: Genetic differentiation coefficient () between populations CC and NEAC for chromosomes 1 ()  2 ()  7 () and 12 (). SNPs with a significantly higher differentiation coefficient are shown in grey Private allele frequency in populations CC (left column) and NEAC (right column) on chromosomes 1 ()  2 ()  7 () and 12 (). Markers with a significantly higher private allele frequency are shown in grey  are calculated separately for each of the chromosomes  i.e. 1 ()  2 ()  7 () and 12 (). Accordingly   was calculated for each individual SNP (as mentioned above) and also for the entire rearranged segment based on the separation of individuals in rearranged and non-rearranged genotypes obtained from the PCA analysis. If <U+2009>><U+2009>1  selection is strong  and if <U+2009><<U+2009>1  selection is weak relative to genetic drift/inbreeding []. More details about the estimation of the selection pressure are provided in . Mean coancestry across the genome did not differ significantly between CC (0.712<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.004) and NEAC individuals (0.718<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.006) (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.425). The mean coancestry for the CC<U+2009>×<U+2009>NEAC individuals was smaller (0.702<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.003)  and the corresponding value of  was 0.689<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.011. Figure  shows that the largest differences in coancestry for the groups of evaluated animals were on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12. When coancestry values were smoothed by using a sliding window approach  differences in coancestry within chromosomes became clearer at specific genomic islands on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12 (Fig. ). A block of high coancestry in both the CC and NEAC populations was observed between 9 and 27 Mb on chromosome 1. In the same genomic island  the values of  indicate a genomic region that has a much lower coancestry coefficient. The patterns of coancestry on chromosomes 2  7 and 12 in the NEAC population show islands of high coancestry between 18 and 25 Mb  13 and 24 Mb  and 0 and 13 Mb  respectively. In these genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 7  the values of  indicate regions of decreased coancestry. More specifically  the genomic islands were between 8 819 361 bp and 27 328 570 bp  18 352 060 bp and 25 309 797 bp  13 344 692 bp and 23 924 283 bp and between 446 989 bp and 12 636 074 bp on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12  respectively. No pronounced blocks of coancestry were observed on the remaining chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S1). The mean genetic differentiation () value across the genome between the CC and NEAC populations was 0.062<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.020. Using the SNPs that were genotyped on each chromosome  more precise genetic differentiation coefficients were obtained across the chromosomes (Fig. ). The highest values of genetic differentiation between the CC and NEAC populations were observed on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12. Genetic differentiation coefficients for chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12 are in Fig. .  values within each chromosome corroborate the genomic islands that were detected with the coancestry estimates. The most clear-cut genomic island with high  values was on chromosome 1 also between 9 and 27 Mb  which indicates that alleles at this genomic island differ significantly between the CC and NEAC populations. Similar results were observed for chromosomes 2  7 and 12. No marked differences in genetic differentiation were observed for the remaining chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S2). The analysis of private allele variants showed that the most differentiated chromosomes were also 1  2  7 and 12 (Fig. ). However  patterns of private allele frequency contrasted with the coancestry patterns. For example  on chromosome 1  the most evident block of high coancestry was found for the NEAC population  whereas the most clear-cut block of private allele frequency was found for the CC population. This means that NEAC is the population with the original inversion. All initial alleles not carried by the rearranged block were lost in NEAC and most private alleles are therefore in CC. Similarly  the frequencies of private alleles for the regions on chromosomes 2  7  and 12 were significantly increased in the CC population compared to the NEAC population. The reason is that if the private allele frequency is higher than 0 in the CC population  the other allele is fixed in the NEAC population. No marked differences in patterns of private allele frequency were detected on the remaining chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S3). Principal components analysis showed differences between the two populations that formed completely separated clusters for chromosome 1  but these differences were less clear for chromosomes 2  7 and 12 (Fig. ). Principal components analysis within the genomic islands of chromosomes 1 ()  2 ()  7 () and 12 () for populations CC and NEAC No marked differences in the results of the principal components analysis were observed for the remaining chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S4). The PCA analysis clearly separated three groups of genotypes: (1) homozygous for the rearranged segment (i.e. the group of individuals that contains most of the NEAC individuals in the PCA analysis)  (2) heterozygous for the rearranged segment (i.e. the group that includes both NEAC and CC individuals)  and (3) homozygous for the non-rearranged segment (i.e. the group of individuals that contains most of the CC individuals in the PCA analysis) (Table ). Table  shows the total number of SNPs within each genomic island per chromosome and the segregating loci within each genomic island for the groups of animals with the rearranged and non-rearranged segment after the classification obtained from PCA. It is important to note that some SNPs segregate in both groups. The coefficients of correlation between the rearranged and non-rearranged segments are in Table . Three of the four correlations were negative  which indicated that CC fish that carried one rearranged segment on one chromosome were unlikely to carry another rearranged segment on another chromosome. The values of the coefficient of correlation were not low  and the highest values were obtained for the negative correlation coefficients  which indicates that selection for a rearranged segment would not result in an increased fraction of rearranged segments on other chromosomes. The mean value of the product of effective population size  by migration rate   i.e.  was equal to 4.37  which means that the contribution of migration is substantial compared to that of genetic drift. Based on the differences in allele frequencies for each SNP within each genomic island  the estimates of the product of effective population size  by selection pressure  were       and   for chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12  respectively  i.e.  selection was strong relative to genetic drift in the genomic islands detected on chromosomes 1  2 and 7  but not on chromosome 12 (Fig. ). On chromosome 1  the same  values were found for many SNPs along the genomic island (Fig. a). In addition  the highest values are quite far from the highest values obtained for the other three chromosomes. From the 3200 highest  values found for this chromosome  23 and 1616 correspond to private alleles in the CC and NEAC populations  respectively. Estimates of the product of effective population size by selection pressure () for chromosomes 1 ()  2 ()  7 () and 12 () The resulting  values for the entire rearranged regions were equal to 11.87  15.42 and 2.86 for chromosomes 2  7  and 12  respectively. Chromosome 1 was removed from this analysis because the genotypes at the  locus (located on chromosome 1) were used to confirm the population identification  which would bias the allocation of non-rearranged regions to the CC and NEAC population. Thus  the selection pressures for the entire rearranged regions were higher than that for the individual SNPs within these regions. In this study  genomic islands of divergence were identified and estimates of selection pressures in these genomic islands were obtained in two populations of Atlantic cod. The results indicate that natural selection is more important than genetic drift on these detected genomic islands of divergence. The genomic islands of divergence identified on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12 showed differences in   which extended across 18  7  11 and 13 Mb  respectively for each chromosome  which suggest that these islands are considerably more related within populations and less related between populations than the rest of the genome (Fig. ). Results based on the estimation of  showed that the degree of divergence is higher for the chromosomes that carry these genomic islands (Fig. ). However  it has been suggested that some factors can mask the detection of small genomic islands of divergence []. The mean whole-genome  (0.062) estimated here agrees well with  values from previous studies  which range from 0.024 to 0.065 [  ]. The increased frequencies of private alleles in these regions confirmed the general result that there is more population differentiation in these regions  which contain larger rearrangements that repress meiotic recombination in the NEAC<U+2009>×<U+2009>CC crosses [    ]. The method used to estimate the migration rate between the two populations is well known and was previously described in the literature (e.g. []). A major assumption is that the allele frequencies have reached a balance between genetic drift (which is responsible for allele frequencies drifting apart) and migration (which reduces the differences in allele frequencies). In the case that these two forces are not (yet) in equilibrium and the populations are still drifting apart  migration will be overestimated  with the consequent implications in the estimation of the selection pressures. The estimation of the selection pressures in the genomic islands of divergence is a novel alternative approach  and is quite specific for the situation of a rearranged region. Assuming that there is no recombination between the non-rearranged and rearranged regions  selection will act on the rearrangement as a whole and thus cause the frequency of the rearrangement to differ between the populations. The difference in frequency at individual SNPs is caused by the difference in the frequency of the rearrangement but the former is usually smaller than the latter. This is because the rearrangement will often carry the allele that is most common on the non-rearranged chromosome. Consequently  the frequencies of individual SNPs lead to underestimate the strength of selection. If some recombination occurs  the selection pressure on the causal loci will be stronger than that on the neutral loci  and the average selection pressure across the loci will further underestimate the selection pressure at the most important alleles that drive the divergence in these regions. Assuming that a particular rearrangement only occurs once and does not recombine with the non-rearranged region  all the chromosomes that carry this rearrangement will descend from one original chromosome. Consequently  they will all carry the same alleles at each SNP within the rearrangement  and the original rearranged haplotype is thus monomorphic. Accordingly  the alternative region to the rearranged region will only occur in the wild-type haplotypes  and will be private to the wild-type haplotypes. This means that an increased private allele frequency points to wild-type haplotypes  which corresponds to the CC population  and the NEAC population corresponds to the rearranged haplotypes. It may be noted that the genome of NEAC individuals also has regions of increased private allele frequencies  which are due to mutations that occurred after the rearrangement. These later mutations may have drifted to considerable allele frequencies due to the originally low-frequency of the rearrangement  i.e. due to a hitchhiking effect. The principal component analysis within the genomic islands revealed three genotypic groups (Fig. ). For the genomic island on chromosome 1  these genotype groups match perfectly with the purebred NEAC and purebred CC population classification. For the other genomic islands  there is also a strong relationship between the population to which the individual belongs and the principal component classification. The classification of individuals into groups with and without the rearrangement from the principal components analyses highlighted that several SNPs segregate in both groups. There are three possible explanations for this. The first interpretation is that some individuals were erroneously allocated to the groups with and without the rearrangement. However  the principal components analysis showed a clear difference between the three groups. A second explanation is that the rearrangement was not a single event but happened several times. However  it seems unlikely that such a rearrangement occurred more than once at the same position in the genome. Finally  the most likely explanation is that a rearrangement will cause reduced recombination between the non-rearranged and rearranged alleles []  but some recombinations will still occur  at a notably reduced rate  which is sufficient to introduce some segregating SNPs from the non-rearranged region into the rearranged region  and vice versa []. The analysis of the private allele frequency indicated that the ancestral alleles occur mainly in the CC population  and that the derived state occurs mainly in the NEAC population. After the rearrangement event  the recombination rate is reduced between the non-rearranged and rearranged alleles. Thus  the rearranged region could accumulate mutations that increase fitness in the habitat of the NEAC population  which is to the benefit of the migratory life-style. However  in other parts of the genome the allele frequencies of such mutants would be decreased due to the sustained introduction of migratory alleles at a rate of <U+2009>~<U+2009>4 per generation. Currently   values between 2.26 and 15.42 suggest that haplotypes are diverging  which results in two populations that coexist in an overlapping habitat but with different migratory behaviours. In fact  it has been suggested [  ] that the rearrangement on chromosome 1 is associated with migratory behaviour  whereas the rearrangements on chromosomes 2  7 and 12 are most likely associated with temperature and/or salinity. Accordingly  the combination of these rearrangements could also have an effect on the migratory behaviour  temperature and/or salinity. The above situation may be an intermediate stage in the process of speciation of the two populations  where the fitness of the hybrid offspring is reduced  and consequently  the behavioural mating strategies that avoid matings with the wrong individuals will be favoured by natural selection. The latter results in a decreased migration rate and increases the divergence in the rest of the genome  which will promote the process of sympatric speciation throughout the genome. Hence the inverted chromosomal regions form the origin of a barrier to gene flow among populations that share a common habitat. Whole-genome SNP data for Atlantic cod were used to investigate genomic islands of divergence in the CC and NEAC populations. Our results show that gene flow between the populations was sufficient to limit divergence between the two populations except at four genomic islands. The high resolution of the SNP data used in this study enabled us to precisely locate four genomic islands of divergence on chromosomes 1  2  7 and 12 in the NEAC and CC cod populations and to estimate the natural selection pressures that lead to their divergence. The estimates of the selection pressures showed that natural selection was substantially more important than genetic drift in shaping the diverged regions on chromosomes 1  2  7  and 12.

We will consider two populations CC and NEAC where some individuals migrate between the populations with a migration rate . We will consider the homozygosity/inbreeding coefficient  of the populations relative to when the populations diverged  at which time homozygosity was assumed 0. Consequently  crossbred CCxNEAC individuals are considered non-inbred    and the same holds for crossbred chromosome segments that occur due to migration. To this end we define the inbreeding coefficient  relative to the crossbred (F1) population. The derivation of  is very similar to that of   except that the expected heterozygosity is taken in the aforementioned F1 population in order to express population differentiation (inbreeding) relative to this F1  i.e. where  is the observed heterozygosity   and  is the expected heterozygosity in the F1   where  is the allele frequency in population 1 (population 2). This  statistic is very similar to   and both statistics show a one-to-one relationship (result not shown). Now we assume that individuals which are crossbred in a particular region have a reduced fitness by a factor of  where  is the selection coefficient. Recombination within this region is assumed low  such that selection acts on the complete segment  and could not be directed against recombined parts of the segment (that e.g. carry particular loci that cause the fitness differences). The probability of a crossbred segment in generation  is: where  is the probability that one of the two gametes is a migrant; and  is the effective population size; and  is the  statistic in generation . We assumed here that the migrant segment hardly ever occurs in the homozygous state  and that the frequency of crossbred individuals is low  such that the overall population fitness remains close to 1. In addition  we assume that  is small relative to 1  i.e.  is close 1  such that 1 generation crossbreds do obtain (some) viable offspring  and a substantial part of the selection pressure against the migrant alleles occurs during later generations  when the migrant allele occurs in descendants from the original crossbreds. If the population is in equilibrium  i.e.   the above equation can be rewritten as (assuming  is small relative to 1): where  is the inbreeding coefficient for the population in equilibrium. In the absence of selection ()  the above equation reduces to the well-known  for populations in a migration-drift equilibrium []: The latter is assumed to be the case for the majority of the genome outside the (rearranged) non-recombining regions. Our strategy is thus to estimate the migration pressure    by calculating average  for all chromosomes  except the chromosomes carrying the rearranged  non-recombining regions using Eq. ()  and using Eq. () to obtain . Next  average  is calculated within each of the non-recombining regions  and this  and the aforementioned  estimate are used to obtain  from Eq. (). Estimates of  indicate that the selection against the migrant chromosome segments is much stronger that the population genetic drift  and  indicates that selection against these chromosome segments is an unimportant genetic force relative to the genetic drift.

Thus  our recommendation is to conserve breeding lines in a gene bank before they are merged. The pig is a major livestock species  which in 2016 accounted for 37% of the meat production worldwide []. The global pork production primarily relies on the use of a limited number of international commercial breeds  specifically Duroc  Large White  and Landrace. In the mid-twentieth century  a large number of breeding associations that operated regionally were responsible for pig breeding. Each of these breeding associations and breeding companies had their own breeding stock  which was usually based on the same limited number of commercial breeds  but often originated from national or regional  and therefore unique  populations. Over the past decades  the commercial breeding industry has seen considerable business consolidation through mergers and take-overs  which have resulted in a limited number of remaining internationally operating breeding companies []. Consequently  the breeding lines owned by these companies have experienced a high degree of consolidation as well. Breeding lines that lost the competition in terms of performance and genetic gain were often discontinued but perhaps more often  breeding lines were merged ‘asymmetrically’  keeping the old breeding line’s name  but with extraneous influences. The process of consolidation of breeding lines in domestic farm animals is most advanced in poultry  where both for broiler and laying chickens  the global market relies on just a handful of breeding lines/populations. Currently  the global poultry breeding market is primarily covered by just a few breeding companies  which has led to a loss of genetic diversity in these breeds []. Pig breeding shares similarities with poultry breeding in that it relies on a limited number of international breeds. Nevertheless  consolidation of pig breeding lines (and breeding companies  for that matter) has not yet progressed to the same extent. However  worldwide  genetic variation in pigs is threatened by the progressive marginalization of local breeds for the benefit of commercial breeds [  ]. The continued merging of the many distinct local populations of these commercial pig breeds and lines is expected to further increase the loss of genetic potential for pig production. Traditional pig breeds and pure breeding lines are valued resources  not only for meat production  but also for cultural  historical  sociological  and environmental aspects. The underlying genetic variation may disappear  or may already have disappeared  from the global highly productive breeds that dominate modern intensive livestock production systems. Thus  the continued merging of breeding companies increases the concern of losing essential genetic variation []. The consolidation of breeding lines is often poorly documented  with public records usually limited or absent. Even for breeding lines listed by the FAO  which include data on their current status and vulnerability  information is often limited or outdated. A post hoc evaluation of loss of diversity in the aftermath of company mergers by genotyping is further hampered by the absence of reference samples from the pre-merger breeding lines. Here  we present a relatively well-documented case of the merging of a number of breeding associations that operated at the national level (the Netherlands) into an internationally operating breeding company (Topigs Norsvin). Although consolidation affected all breeding lines owned by the breeding companies  we will focus on one particular breed in this paper  i.e. the Dutch Landrace. Our objective was to investigate the consequences of merging and discontinuing breeding populations on the genetic diversity of the Dutch Landrace breed over the past decades. To achieve this objective  we used genotype data of boars from the former Dutch Landrace breeding lines that have been conserved in the Dutch Gene bank to quantify their relationship with the current Dutch Landrace breed  and to estimate the loss (if any) of genetic diversity as a result of the merging of lines. The Dutch Landrace breed originated from the original native Landrace pig  with infusions of the German Landrace and the Danish Landrace around 1900 []. By 1933  the Dutch Landrace was officially recognized as a Dutch native breed. By 1960  different breeding associations started selecting their own Dutch Landrace populations for their specific breeding goals. In the 1970s  Finnish and Norwegian Landrace pigs were imported into the Netherlands for use in crossbreeding programs []. During the 1990s  the Cofok  Dumeco  Fomeva  and Stamboek breeding associations  which together represent the majority of pig sales in the Netherlands  merged into a new internationally operating breeding organization called Topigs []. During this period  semen from breeding lines that were owned by the parent breeding organizations was deposited into the Dutch Gene bank (). This practice has been continued by Topigs (now called Topigs Norsvin) during the last two decades  resulting in a unique collection of material from breeding lines that were either discontinued or altered by merging lines. The timeline of consolidation of the different Landrace breeding lines in the Netherlands since 1960s is illustrated in Fig.  []. Timeline showing the consolidation of the Landrace breeds in the Netherlands since the 1960s (after []).  Cofok Norwegian and Finnish Landrace   Dumeco L-line   Dumeco N-line   Stamboek Finnish Landrace   Fomeva Z1-line   Stamboek Dutch Landrace   Topigs Norsvin N-line The Centre for Genetic Resources  the Netherlands (CGN) of Wageningen UR  i.e. the Dutch Gene bank  stores cryopreserved genetic material  primarily semen  from the former pig breeding associations in the Netherlands. From 1995 to 2003  CGN collected genetic material from six Landrace breeding lines of breeding associations that existed at that time. Merging of Dutch Landrace lines was in full progress and consequently the number of animals was already reduced. To select the group of boars  from the available animals  with minimal kinship and maximum diversity  optimal contributions were estimated using Gencont []. From 2011 to 2016  CGN has preserved genetic material from the current Dutch Landrace line (Topigs Norsvin N-line; hereafter referred to as “TN line”) in the Dutch Gene bank. Genotype data  provided by CGN and Topigs Norsvin  were available for 187 animals from six former Dutch Landrace lines (Dutch lines from Fomeva  Dumeco and Stamboek  and Dutch Norwegian/Finnish lines from Cofok  Dumeco and Stamboek) and the current TN line (Table ). The 187 animals were genotyped using the PorcineSNP80 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA). All samples had a genotype call rate higher than 90%. For quality control  SNPs with a GenCall score lower than 0.20  a minor allele frequency lower than 0.02 and a per SNP genotype call rate less than 100% were removed from further analyses  the latter because some of the subsequent analyses cannot deal with missing genotypes. Imputing missing genotypes was not appropriate for this dataset  since it requires more animals for each of the lines involved to be genotyped. In addition  applying a call rate threshold of 100% left a sufficient number of SNPs in the dataset for subsequent analyses. The final dataset included 42 655 SNPs with calls for all 187 animals. To examine relatedness between the Landrace lines  a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the prcomp function in R []. To identify subpopulations (clusters)  genotypes of all individual animals were analysed by the model-based clustering algorithm implemented in the software Structure (version 2.3.4) [  ]. Subpopulation numbers (K) ranging from 2 to 7 were evaluated by repeating each analysis 10 times. A burn-in of 10 000 iterations and subsequent 50 000 iterations of the Markov chain Monte Carlo were applied  with all other program parameters set to their default values. The most likely number of subpopulations was inferred with the <U+0394>K method of Evanno []  implemented in the R package pophelper (version 2.2.3) []. The program CLUMPP [] implemented in pophelper was used to align the 10 independent runs for each K. Pophelper was also used to plot results for K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 to 7. The Structure analysis was performed a second time by applying the “Use Population Information” setting  such that individuals of the TN line (POPFLAG<U+2009>=<U+2009>0) were assigned to clusters that were defined by the allele frequencies of the other lines (POPFLAG<U+2009>=<U+2009>1). A neighbour-joining tree [] was computed based on the resulting distance matrix using the R package APE (version 4.1) []. Genetic divergence between each pair of Landrace lines was quantified by calculating pairwise st  as defined by Weir and Cockerham []  using the R-package ‘hierfstat’ (version 0.04–22) []. The contribution of breeds to genetic diversity was analysed using the marker-estimated kinships and the core set method of Eding et al. []. In this method  kinship coefficients are estimated based on SNP genotypes  and the genetic diversity within a breed is estimated as one minus the average kinship coefficient in that breed. The average kinship coefficient was also estimated across breeds to determine the genetic diversity of the whole set. The total genetic diversity of a set depends on the contribution of each breed to the total set. If all breeds contribute equally  the total genetic diversity is equal to one minus the average within- and across-breed kinship coefficients. Otherwise  the kinship coefficients of each breed have to be weighted by their contribution  as: where  is a vector of the  (number of breeds) contributions of each breed (summing to 1) and  is a  matrix with within- and across-breed kinship coefficients. Thus  if a relatively uniform breed contributes more to the total set  the genetic diversity of the total set will be lower than when a relatively diverse breed contributes. In the core set method of Eding et al. []  the contribution of each breed that maximizes the genetic diversity is estimated as: where  is the vector of contributions that maximizes the diversity in the total set   is a vector of  1s  and  is the  matrix with the average within- and between-breed kinships. Then  the total diversity in the set is estimated as: Thus  the contribution of each breed to this core set depends on both the between- and within-breed components of genetic diversity. However  this contribution is not the only one that determines the relative importance of a breed to total genetic diversity. A breed that only contributes a small amount to the core set (e.g. when their within-breed kinship is high) can  nevertheless  increase the total genetic diversity considerably  e.g.  when its across-breed kinships are low. Therefore  the average kinship coefficient of the core set when the breed is included is compared to the average kinship coefficient of the core set when the breed is excluded []. The required kinship coefficients were obtained by first computing the genomic relationship matrix () according to Yang et al. []  using the software Calc_grm []. Using   average within- and between-breed kinship coefficients were computed across all pairwise relationships within and between breeds  including self-kinship coefficients. Selection signatures were detected for each pairwise comparison between the current TN and the six former lines  by using the st-outlier approach implemented in the BayeScan software (version 2.1)  using default settings []. SNPs with a q-value lower than 0.05 were considered as outliers  which indicate regions potentially under selection. Genes that are located within 10 kb (5 kb downstream/upstream) of the SNP outliers were identified as candidate genes  based on the Ensembl annotation of Sscrofa10.2 (). The candidate genes were characterized using the PANTHER Classification System version 14.1 () []  in particular  with the GO-Slim Biological Process annotation dataset. Overrepresentation analysis of GO-Slim Biological Process terms was also done using PANTHER; GO terms with a p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 after Bonferroni correction were deemed significant. Compared to using the entire GO term database  GO-Slim uses a limited set of GO terms to provide a more general list of functions that map to genes. The current Dutch Landrace (TN: Topigs Norsvin N-line) is the result of the consolidation of six former Landrace lines that existed from the 1960s until early 2000 (CNF: Cofok Norwegian and Finnish landrace  DL: Dumeco L-line  DN: Dumeco N-line  FL: Stamboek Finnish Landrace  FZ: Fomeva Z1-line and SB: Stamboek Dutch Landrace). The PCA clearly indicates a division of the seven Landrace lines into two main clusters; on the one hand  the former Norwegian/Finnish Landrace lines (CNF  DN and FL lines)  which were introduced in the Netherlands between 1970 and 1980  and  on the other hand  the former Dutch Landrace lines (DL  FZ and SB) (Fig. a). Clearly  the current commercial Dutch Landrace line (TN) is a mixture of the former breeding lines  since the old breeding lines included the extremes of the first principal component (PC1). The widespread distribution of the animals along PC1 for the current TN line shows that the contribution of the Dutch and Norwegian/Finnish lines to the current line differs between pigs. The second principal component (PC2) distinguished the DN line from the other six lines. Population structure and relationships of Landrace breeding lines in the Netherlands.

Proportion of ancestry for each individual assuming different numbers of ancestral populations (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 to 7). Colors of each vertical line represent the estimated proportion of an animal’s genome that is assigned to a source population A unique genetic identity was identified for each of the six former Landrace lines based on the cluster analysis using the Structure software (Fig. c). At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2  the two ancestries clearly reflected Dutch Norwegian/Finnish versus Dutch Landrace origins. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3  DN was separated from CNF and FL (representative of Dutch Norwegian/Finnish Landrace). Based on <U+0394>K  the most likely number of genetic groups (clusters) was equal to 5. While all parent lines appeared to be well separated at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 (with the exception of FZ and SB)  TN is clearly an admixed population with substantial contributions from the former breeding lines CNF  FL  and FZ/SB. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5  the average proportion of membership of the founder breeds to TN was 0.205  0.043  0.350  0.290  and 0.112 for CNF (cluster 1)  DN (cluster 2)  FL (cluster 3)  FZ/SB (cluster 4)  and DL (cluster 5)  respectively. Results of the Structure analysis with no prior population information (POPFLAG<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 for TN line) is shown in Figure S1 (See Additional file : Figure S1)  and confirmed the results of the PCA  i.e. that the contributions from the former lines differed between individuals. A neighbor-joining tree separated the breeding lines from each other in separate clades  except for the current TN line (Fig. b). Genetic differentiation among the Landrace lines was low to moderate  as indicated by the pairwise st values that ranged from 0.02 to 0.10 (Table ). The genetic differentiation of the current TN breeding line from the six former lines was low  which indicates that the current breeding line is closely related to the former breeding lines. The average kinship coefficients between and within the Landrace lines are in Tables  and . As expected  within-line kinship coefficients were higher (Table ; ranging from 0.051 to 0.249) than the between-line kinship coefficients (Table ; ranging from -<U+2009>0.092 to 0.074). The higher negative between-line kinship coefficients between the former Dutch Norwegian/Finnish and the Dutch breeding lines indicates that the distance between these lines was greater than between individuals within the lines. The within-line kinship coefficient was lowest (0.051) for the current TN. The contribution of each line (in %) to the genetic diversity in the overall Landrace population is in Table . All lines contributed to the diversity of the core set. The largest contribution to the total genetic diversity of the Landrace breed was observed for DN (17.79%)  whereas it was smallest for SB (10.84%). Each line had a certain proportion of unique genetic diversity. The total genetic diversity of the Landrace breeding lines  estimated by Eding’s core set method  was 0.993  and that of the six former breeding lines was 0.990  while the genetic diversity of TN was 0.894. As breeding lines are merged  selection continues  although in some cases the breeding goal may be different in the consolidated line compared to the parent lines. SNP genotypes were used to estimate allele frequency differentiation (measured as st) in pairwise comparisons between the current TN and the six former lines. Outlier (high allele frequency differentiation) SNPs are an indication of regions that are potentially under selection. The 10log Bayes factor values for each SNP are shown in Fig. . The number of loci with statistically significant patterns of divergent genetic differentiation (q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05)  which were identified by pairwise comparisons  revealed that CNF and TN had the largest number (93) of outlier SNPs (Table ). The outlier SNPs were located close to or within 20 candidate genes. Among these outlier SNPs  29% (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>27) were located almost at the end of chromosome 13 (SSC13: 191 713 636–196 766 412). Almost all of these 27 outliers are intergenic variants  which lie in-between genes (see Additional file : Table S1). Additional file : Table S1 lists the outlier SNPs  candidate genes  and their respective assigned GO-slim terms (Biological Processes). Fifty-three SNPs were identified as loci that were under diversifying selection between the DL and TN lines  and these corresponded to 20 candidate genes. Seven outlier SNPs were located within small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Pairwise comparison between DN and TN revealed 46 SNP outliers (q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) with 13 candidate genes. Pairwise comparisons of TN with each of the other four lines revealed 46 significant SNPs (q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) between DN and TN  18 between FL and TN  21 between FZ and TN  and 7 between SB and TN. No candidate genes were found for the comparison between SB and TN. GO annotation of the candidate genes showed that most genes were linked to biological processes associated with cellular processes  metabolic processes  and intracellular transport (Table ) and (see Additional file : Table S1). However  no significant over-representation was observed for any biological process.

The threshold for significance of signatures of selection is denoted with a line (q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) In this study  we investigated the consequences for genetic diversity of the merging of lines within a breed  with the individual lines being discontinued thereafter. The data were derived from samples of boars that are included in the Dutch Gene bank collection  which led us to assume that these would encompass the genetic variation present in the modern breeding population []. Sample size of some Dutch Landrace lines used in this study were relatively small  due to limited availability of samples  and differed between lines  ranging from 11 samples for the lines FL and FZ lines to 49 for the DL line. Small sample size can lead to incorrect estimates of allele frequencies [] and a proportion of genetic diversity present in the lines may remain undetected. Nevertheless  the results showed that the sampled animals formed genetic clusters that corresponded to their line designations (Fig. ). The results also showed that  genetically  the current commercial Dutch Landrace line (TN) is a mixture of the six former Landrace lines in the Netherlands. In general  the results reported here are in good agreement with the known history of the different Landrace lines examined [  ]. Genetic differentiation between the lines (pairwise st) was moderate to low. Wilkinson et al. reported a mean st value of 0.156 between three British Landrace lines []. For wild pigs sampled across different locations of the state of Florida (USA)  pairwise st values ranged from 0.020 to 0.256 []. The st values (0.02 to 0.10) found in our study are at the lower end of this range. According to Willing et al. []  st can be accurately calculated based on small sample sizes (as small as n<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+200A>4 to 6) if the number of markers examined is large  i.e. larger than 1000. The results reported here show that the merging of commercial Landrace lines has reduced the genetic diversity of the Landrace population in the Netherlands. For poultry  Besbes et al. [] also reported that the merging of lines leads to a decrease in genetic diversity of the available gene pool. However  our results also showed that  after merging  a large proportion of the genetic variability was maintained  and that all former lines showed a lower genetic diversity than the current TN. This indicates that merging lines is a better strategy for maintaining genetic diversity than just continuing with one line and discontinuing the other lines. In this study  the total genetic diversity of the Landrace lines was estimated using the optimal contribution strategy. The optimal contributions of breeding lines were derived such that the average kinship coefficient in the core set was minimal  and thus the genetic diversity was maximal. Because breeding programs compete for market share  they select their lines intensively. Due to the breeding strategies that were followed over time  the actual genetic contributions of the different parent lines to the current Landrace line differed from the optimal contributions  indicating that part of the genetic diversity was lost. In addition  the DN line was poorly represented in the current Dutch Landrace. These observations support the recommendation that all breeding lines should be conserved before merging and discontinuing them. Commercial pig breeds have been subject to intense artificial selection for production traits. Functional analysis of regions under positive selection in pig breeds has identified genes that are involved in the development of the nervous system and of muscle  and in growth  pigmentation  metabolism  visual/odour perception  immune and inflammatory responses  and reproduction []. Functional annotation analyses of the candidate genes in our study are shown in Table . For the interpretation of our results  it should be noted that we used the Ensembl annotation of Sscrofa10.2 and not the latest version Sscrofa11.1 []. Furthermore  a small sample size can lead to poor population structure estimates  which affects the ability to differentiate between loci that were under selection and neutral population structure []. However  in our study at least 11 animals per line were used  in line with a previous study that suggested that detecting regions under selection with st methods requires at least 10 samples []. We detected no over-representation of any GO biological process among the candidate genes in our study. It should be noted that most traits that are under selection in pigs are complex traits that are regulated by many genes []. We identified a number of candidate genes that were located within 10 kb (5 kb downstream/upstream) of the SNP outliers  most of them being associated with cellular processes  metabolic processes and intracellular transport (Table ) and (see Additional file : Table S1). The candidate genes that were found in the comparison between the CNF and FN lines are involved in fertility ( [];  (sheep) [])  the immune system ( [])  and intramuscular fat content ( []). In the comparison between the DL and TN lines  we identified   which is a muscle-related gene [  ]   and   which are associated with meat quality [  ]  and   which is associated with the male reproduction trait “Seminiferous tubule diameter” []. In the comparison between the DN and TN lines  we detected several candidate genes:   which is assumed to be involved in fatness []  is important for nutrition energy intake and obesity []  and is connected with pig birth weight variability [];  and   which have been reported as candidate genes for intramuscular fat content [] and variation in pH of meat []  respectively; and   which was associated with metabolic body weight in a study on Holstein dairy cows []. In the comparison between the FZ and TN lines  we found the candidate gene   which is associated with total fat in Duroc and Yorkshire F2 intercrosses []. It should be kept in mind that  although these associated SNPs and respective genes may be involved in certain biological processes related to selection events  further experimentation needs to be performed to verify these associations. As shown by our results  differences can be pronounced even between populations that have common origins  which stresses the value of gene banks to record and preserve variation that is lost in the process of merging  even over short periods of time. The breeding industry has undergone a strong consolidation process in the past decades and this will likely continue [  ]. Economic reality forces breeding companies to discard breeding lines that are not of immediate value for product formulation or do not have potential to be used in the near future. Inevitably  maintaining genetic diversity in breeds and breeding lines has a cost  while the benefits are not immediately translated into profit. However  the consequences of losing genetic diversity are generally acknowledged; maintaining it is essential to provide future opportunities of selection for changing markets  consumer preferences  products etc.  to allow sustained genetic improvement  to develop alternatives to intensive management  to decrease disease incidence and increase health  and to anticipate future changes in climate [    ]. The current Dutch Landrace (TN line) shows a high level of admixture and is closely related to the six former Dutch Landrace lines. However  the merging of commercial Landrace lines has reduced the genetic diversity of the Landrace population in the Netherlands  and the DN line is poorly represented in the current Dutch Landrace. Thus  it is recommended to conserve selection lines in a gene bank before merging. Our findings also showed that the merging of lines results in a large proportion of the original variability being maintained.

They had various lengths and contained three groups of tandem repeats (some of them being very GC rich) that form highly organized arrays.

However  the chicken IGS shares some molecular organization features with that of the turtles  which are other representatives of the Sauropsida clade that includes birds and reptiles. Our current results on the structure of chicken IGS together with the previously reported ribosomal gene cluster sequence provide sufficient data to consider that the complete chicken rDNA sequence is assembled with confidence in terms of molecular DNA organization. Arrays of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeated units are extremely important components of eukaryotic genomes. They form nucleolus organizing regions (NOR) in one or several chromosome pairs. Active NOR build a nucleolus  which is a dynamic nuclear compartment involved in ribosome biogenesis. The functional state of the nucleolus is an indicator of the cell and tissue physiological states. Each rDNA unit consists of an rRNA gene cluster (5'ETS (external transcribed spacer)  18S rRNA  ITS1 (internal transcribed spacer)  5.8S rRNA  ITS2  28S rRNA  3'ETS) that is transcribed into a single pre-rRNA molecule and an intergenic spacer (IGS). In spite of numerous animal genome-wide studies conducted recently  the structural organization of the entire rDNA unit sequence  particularly the IGS  remains poorly investigated for most vertebrates. Nevertheless  in the species that have been studied  the IGS was found to play a key role in pre-rRNA cluster transcription regulation. In particular  it contains regulatory sites for RNA polymerase I (RNApol I). Transcription termination sites for the upstream rRNA gene cluster are located at the IGS 5' end and the transcription initiation site of the downstream cluster at the IGS 3' end []. In mammals  additional RNApol I promoters are located within the IGS  at least 2 kb upstream of the pre-rRNA start site  and spacer promoter transcripts are assumed to have a function in the NoRC (nucleolar chromatin-remodelling complex) directed transcriptional silencing of rDNA [  ]. Replication origins and replication fork barriers impede the entry of the replication machinery into the transcription unit [  ]. Certain regulatory elements in IGS are conserved at least between primate species []. A typical IGS includes specific repeats that vary in copy number  which causes heterogeneity in spacer length. They can serve as transcription terminator elements or have an enhancer activity [      ]. Progress in long-read sequencing methods makes it possible to capture entire rRNA repetitive units within individual reads and to establish their detailed structure  and thereby to unmask within-individual variability in humans []. The chicken () genome includes a single NOR  which maps to chromosome 16 and contains the rDNA array [   ]. As for many other eukaryote species  the chicken rDNA array is absent from the current version of the assembled GRCg6a chicken genome (). Nevertheless  the composition of the chicken rDNA array  in particular the IGS  has been investigated in earlier works based on rDNA restriction analysis and sequencing of fragments. By analyzing rDNA repeat units in various domestic chicken lines  Delany and coworkers [  ] established that the intra- and inter-NOR variability of the length of rDNA repeat units ranged from 11 to 50 kb and was mainly due to heterogeneity in IGS size. The overall 5 to 7 Mb variation in NOR lengths was assumed to depend on the heterogeneity of IGS size and variation in rDNA unit copy number. Delany and Krupkin established that the average number of rDNA repeat copies in diploid sets ranged from 279 to 368 []. A spacer promoter (9 bp) and the following RNApol I transcription start site (10 bp) were sequenced from a cloned fragment of chicken IGS []. The question of whether the function of the spacer promoter is related to the initiation of rRNA gene cluster transcription or serves to generate a regulatory RNA for NoRC dependent rDNA transcriptional silencing  as in mammals  has not been explored so far in other vertebrates. Undoubtedly  to date  the lack of available data on complete IGS sequences has prevented the study of the regulatory mechanisms of NOR. Our earlier attempt to assemble a complete chicken rDNA repeat unit (rRNA gene cluster plus IGS) using Illumina sequencing data was unsuccessful due to the complex structure of the repeats within the IGS  and only the transcribed part of the rRNA gene cluster was determined (NCBI Nucleotide: KT445934; []). To date  the description of the complete rDNA repeat unit sequences is not available for any representative of the Sauropsida clade that includes reptiles and birds  although such data are essential to study regulatory molecular interactions and evolutionary mechanisms in this group. Here  we describe the chicken IGS structure based on the PacBio single-molecule sequencing of a BAC clone containing a chicken NOR fragment that includes three complete IGS. We identified several novel tandem repeats in the chicken IGS  which form highly organized structures. The number of repeat variants is indicative of IGS heterogeneity within the chicken rDNA sequence. We selected the WAG137G04 BAC clone from the Wageningen BAC library []  which was constructed with DNA from a female White Leghorn chicken  for long-read PacBio RSII sequencing. This BAC clone is known to contain NOR elements [  ]. Library preparation and sequencing were performed at the GeT-PlaGe core facility  INRA Toulouse  according to the manufacturer’s instructions “Shared protocol-20 kb Template Preparation Using BluePippin Size Selection system (15 kb size Cutoff)”. At each step  DNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). DNA concentration and purity were measured using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer (Thermofisher) and size distribution and degradation were assessed using the Fragment analyzer (AATI) High Sensitivity Large Fragment 50 kb Analysis Kit. Purification steps were performed using 0.45X AMPure PB beads (PacBio). High-quality BAC DNA was extracted using the Nucleobond Xtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey–Nagel) following the manufacturer’s instructions using 100 mL of LB media that contains chloramphenicol to select clones (12.5 µg/mL). DNA damage repair and end repair were performed with the SMRTBell template Prep Kit 1.0 (PacBio). After ligation to blunt hairpin adapters  the library was treated with an exonuclease cocktail to digest unligated DNA fragments. A 10-kb cutoff size selection step was performed with the BluePippin Size Selection system (Sage Science) on 0.75% agarose cassettes  Marker S1 high Pass 15-20 kb. Conditioned Sequencing Primer V2 was annealed to the size-selected SMRTbell templates  which were then bound to polymerase P6-C4 with a polymerase: SMRTbell template ratio of 10:1. After performing a magnetic bead-loading step (OCPW)  the SMRTbell library was sequenced on one SMRTcell (RSII instrument at 0.25 nM with a 360 min movie). In fact  the WAG137G04 BAC clone DNA was sequenced in a pool with 12 other BAC clones. We obtained a mean read length of 9 kb for the pool of sequences and 7168 reads were obtained for the WAG137G04 BAC (NCBI SRA: PRJNA577229). The quality value was 48 as scored by the PacBio SMRT Analysis software suite that calculates this value after the assembly step and predicts the error probability of a basecall  based on Phred quality score. PacBio RS II reads were assembled following the HGAP workflow (). The SMRT Analysis (v2.2.0) software suite was used for HGAP implementation. The longest contig WAG137G4_utg0 (100 614 bp) was obtained by the HGAP3 method with an average coverage of 500X. However  the coverage was not regular  with two regions of repeated sequences with a high coverage (see Additional file : Figure S1). First  reads were aligned using BLASR against “ str. K12 substr. DH10B  complete genome”. The detected  reads and low-quality reads (read quality<U+2009><<U+2009>0.75 and read length<U+2009><<U+2009>500 bp) were removed from the data. The filtered reads (8390 reads  78 347 167 bp) were then preassembled to generate long and highly accurate sequences (776 reads  5 031 668 bp). For this step  we separated the longest reads (><U+2009>13 kb) in order to correct read errors by mapping the first ones to the second ones. Then  the sequences were filtered against vector sequences  and the Celera assembler was used to assemble the data into a draft assembly. A final “polishing” step of the HGAP workflow with the Quiver algorithm  which is a quality-aware consensus algorithm that uses the rich quality scores embedded in Pacific Biosciences bas.h5 files  decreased significantly the remaining InDel (short insertions or deletions) and base substitution errors in the draft assembly. Nucleotide sequence alignment  identification and annotation of IGS specific repeats in the chicken IGS sequence  analysis of the distribution of CpG islands and IGS transcription were carried out with the Geneious 9.0.5 software package (). WGS contigs that are homologous to the chicken rRNA repetitive unit were searched in the Gallus_gallus-5.0 assembly of the red junglefowl genome (NCBI Assembly: GCA_000002315.3  GCF_000002315.4) (NCBI WGS: AADN00000000.4) using BLAST (). Homologous repetitive sequences were identified by NCBI BLAST search and Repbase Update library () search. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 7.0 software [] was used for a statistical analysis of molecular evolution (see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2) and reconstruction of the genetic links between IGS specific repeats. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the maximum likelihood method combined with the evolutionary nucleotide replacement Kimura 2-parameter model with a Gamma distribution [5 categories (+G  parameter<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.8698)] [  ]. To assess the reliability of the tree topology  we applied a Bootstrap test (500 replications). To determine whether the IGS is transcribed in chicken  we analyzed raw transcriptomic data that were available from the Chickspress project (NCBI BioProject: PRJEB4677; PRJNA204941; )  in which RNA libraries were created from red junglefowl total RNA extracted with the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) []. We used the transcriptomes of chicken testis (NCBI SRA: ERX321399)  ovary (NCBI SRA: ERX321403)  kidney (NCBI SRA: ERX321415)  liver (NCBI SRA: ERX321417) and heart (NCBI SRA: ERX321421). The IGS sequence (15 241 bp) flanked by the 3'ETS (335 bp) and 5'ETS (1836 bp) sequences from the WAG137G4_utg0 contig was used as a reference. The WAG137G04 BAC clone was sequenced using PacBio RSII and a single contig (WAG137G4_utg0 contig) was obtained  which contained three full rDNA gene clusters and one incomplete cluster that lacked the 3' end of the 28S rRNA gene and the 3'ETS (Fig. ) and (see Additional file ). The lengths of the full rRNA gene clusters were 11 871  11 830 and 11 855 bp  respectively  and were all homologous to the described previously rRNA gene cluster of domestic chicken (NCBI Nucleotide: KT445934.2; []). Chicken rDNA repeat structure. Structure of the WAG137G4_utg0 contig obtained by PacBio sequencing of the WAG137G04 chicken BAC clone. The positions of three complete and one incomplete rRNA gene clusters together with three intercalary IGS are indicated. An enlarged diagram of the rRNA gene cluster is shown separately We performed pairwise alignment of these three rRNA gene clusters and detected 33 variable nucleotide positions (see Additional file : Table S3)  including 13 SNPs and 20 InDel. The 5'ETS region contained the largest number of polymorphic loci (12 of 33)  no variant was found in the 5.8S rRNA gene  only two in the 18S and 3'ETS  and a few in the 28S rRNA gene and in both ITS. In the WAG137G4_utg0 contig  we identified three fragments among the three rRNA gene clusters at positions 13 051–35 677 bp  47 508–62 677 bp  and 74 533–89 733 bp that were specified as IGS of different lengths (Fig. ). In addition  a 1179-bp sequence of an incomplete IGS was located upstream of the first rRNA gene cluster. According to the dot-plot analysis data  each IGS contained three internal arrays (blocks) of tandemly repeated sequences and relatively large (1937–1941 bp) and small (190–191 bp) unique regions that are conserved among the IGS (see Additional file : Figure S2). In the three IGS analyzed here: the lengths of the first block of repeats (5' block) ranged from 950 to 2290 bp; the lengths of the second repeat block (central block) ranged from 9297 to 14 414 bp  which represented the main source of the differences between chicken IGS; and the third repeat block (3' block) was 2400 to 3766 bp long. The structure of these three IGS was very similar to that of the 14 002-bp IGS in the AADN04001305.1 red junglefowl contig (see Additional file : Figure S2). Below  we provide a detailed description of the components of chicken IGS based on the four sequences investigated here. Chicken IGS length variants.

Detailed comparative figures of IGS structural elements distribution. Repeat deficiency regions are designated with fine black lines.  Contracted IGS figures  central block repeats are organized into tetrads The 5' repeat block is separated from the 3'ETS by a poly-T (9–21 bp) track and consists of two types of phylogenetically related repetitive sequences. The GC-rich repeats have an elementary unit of about 150 bp (hereinafter referred to as  repeats  or ) (Fig. a and Table ) (see Additional file ). The AT-rich repeats with a 200- and  more often  300-bp repeat unit (hereinafter referred to as  repeats  or ) have multiple oligoT tracks (Fig. b and Table ) (see Additional file ). Both  and  repeats alternate with each other according to the (–)n scheme  which ends with an additional  repeat unit at the end (Fig. ). The last  repeat unit is preceded by only the shorter (200 bp)  repeat. Tandem repeats at the chicken IGS 5' end.   () repeat unit;   () repeat unit. Both repeats are consensus sequences A unique region of about 1900 bp referred to as LUR (large unique region) is situated downstream of the 5' repeat block (Fig. ). The similarity between the 5' and 3' ends of the LUR and the adjacent repeats suggests a common origin but with a loss of sequence homology. The central part of the LUR contains regions of low complexity  such as T-rich  C-rich  G-rich regions  as well as several simple repeats: (CT)n  (AGGCG)n  (CCG)n  (CCA)n  etc. The central repeat block is the largest and most structurally complex sequence in the chicken IGS. It is composed of short repeats of 92 to 94 bp with a (C+G) content varying between 65 and 76% (Table  and see Additional file ). All these repeats represent one phylogenetically related group (hereinafter referred to as  repeats  or ) (Fig. ).  repeats are degenerated but their lengths are stable (Fig. ).  repeats in chicken IGS. Relationships between repeats in the  () group. The figure was plotted using the maximum likelihood method.

An expanded figure is attached in Additional file  Consensus sequences of  () repeat variants.  repeat variants: alignment of the sequences Reconstruction of the phylogeny of the  repeats by the maximum likelihood method showed that they fell into three clades 1  2  and 3 (Fig.  and see Additional file : Figure S3). 1 and 3 are monophyletic clades  whereas 2 is a polyphyletic clade. 1 comprises degenerated repeats of 94 bp with 73 to 76% of GC pairs (Fig. ). Based on their diversity  the 3 repeats (92–93 bp) can be classified into 3A  3B  3C  and 3D subgroups. 3 is the most common variant of the  repeats (Table ). The 2 clade comprises a few monophyletic evolutionary lines (2A  2B  2C  and 2D) that represent the variants of similar repeats (Fig.  and Table ). Some of the other EL2 lines combine into the 2F artificial group. Interestingly  each of the 2F lines consists of three identical repeats that belong to three different IGS from the WAG137G4_utg0 contig. These are the first five repeats and the last three or four repeats at each end of the central repeat block. Each repetitive sequence has its own unique SNP profile  which is conserved between the three analyzed IGS and occurs in each IGS as a single copy at a strict unique position. Therefore  these 2F repeats seem to be important structural components of the chicken IGS. Due to the presence of A-rich motifs at the 3' end of some 2F repeats  their variability was rather high i.e. on average 17%. A close examination of the distribution of the patterns of  repeats in IGS from the WAG137G4_utg0 contig and AADN04001305.1 scaffold reveals their highly organized structure. 2–1–3–3 repeats form tetrads with a total length of 372 to 373 bp  which is the main element of the  repeat type. Putatively  a deletion of one of the 3 repeats may result in the formation of a triad  although these represent exceptions. In general  the organization of the  repeats in all the IGS studied can be described as (2F)5<U+2009>+<U+2009>(2–1–3–3)n<U+2009>+<U+2009>(2)2<U+2009>+<U+2009>(2F)3. The 3' repeat block is separated from the central repeat block by a (A) motif. We identified repeats (hereinafter referred to as  repeats or ) that significantly differ from each other (Table ) within this block. Alignment (see Additional file ) and phylogeny reconstruction (Fig. ) showed that the  repeats are related. They can be classified into four main clades: 1  2  3  and 4. 1 repeats are variable and exist in multicopy  whereas only a few copies of 2  3  and 4 are present. In addition  the F clade includes several separate evolutionary lines of  repeats (Figs.   ).  repeats in chicken IGS. Relationships between repeats in the  group. The figure was plotted using the maximum likelihood method. The numbers following the repeat names indicate the repeat ordinal position in the IGS  and the numbers following a space—the IGS ordinal position in WAG137G4_utg0 contig Consensus sequences of  () repeat variants.  repeat variants: alignment of the sequences Similar to the 2F repeats  each F repeat variant has a specific set of SNPs and is located at a fixed position in all the chicken IGS studied here (Fig. ). F variants are the first  second and the seventh repeats at the beginning of the 3' repeat block in both the WAG137G4_utg0 contig and the AADN04001305.1 scaffold sequences. The very last copy in the 3' repeat block is also a F repeat. Low-copy 2–3–4 repeats appear to form multiple triads. The number of 1 copies can vary. In general  the profile of the 3' repeat block can be represented as (F)2<U+2009>+<U+2009>1<U+2009>+<U+2009>(2–3–4)<U+2009>+<U+2009>F<U+2009>+<U+2009>(1)n<U+2009>+<U+2009>((2–3–4)<U+2009>+<U+2009>(1)n)n<U+2009>+<U+2009>F. The small unique region of 190 to 191 bp is situated at the 3' end of the chicken IGS  just before the 5'ETS of the following rRNA cluster (Fig. ). For all four IGS studied here  no substitutions were detected in this region. The (C+G) content is lower than in the IGS tandem repeat arrays (58% vs 65 to 81%). According to the BLAST results  the chicken RNApol I promoter is located in this region (NCBI Nucleotide: DQ112354.1 []). We analyzed the distribution of CpG islands in the chicken IGS sequence studied here (NCBI Nucleotide: MG967540)  and in IGS of the following vertebrates:  (NCBI Nucleotide: KY962518)   (NCBI Nucleotide: MDXI01019244.1)   (NCBI Nucleotide: KX061890);  (NCBI Nucleotide: BK000964);  (NCBI Nucleotide: AF110804);  (NCBI Nucleotide: X98876);  (NCBI Nucleotide: EU325541);  (NCBI Nucleotide: AF133089);  (NCBI Nucleotide: FJ688028). This comparison shows that the chicken and terrapin IGS tandem repeat sequences are very GC-rich and enriched with CpG islands  whereas these features do not seem typical of the other vertebrate IGS sequences studied (Fig.  and see Additional file : Figure S4). GC content in Sauropsida and Mammalia IGS. (C+G) content and putative CpG island distribution in the IGS of chicken   terrapin   human   and mouse . Regions containing repeats are designated with horizontal green blocks (Rep); putative CpG islands—with light-green boxes (CpG Island); GC pairs distribution is shown in the graphs (GC content) The alignment of transcriptome reads from different chicken tissues against the most complete rDNA sequence from the WAG137G4_utg0 contig shows that the 5' repeat block is transcribed along with the rRNA gene cluster for all tissues. In addition  both the large and small unique regions are transcribed either partly or completely (Fig. ). Several reads align against some sites of the  and  repeats. However  most of the central region and the  repeat region of the IGS do not show any sign of transcription. IGS transcription. Analysis of the IGS transcription in different chicken organs. The vertical axis represents read counts aligned to each nucleotide position In 2016  we published a complete description of a chicken rRNA gene cluster  which consists of the successive 5'ETS  18S rRNA gene  ITS1  5.8S rRNA gene  ITS2  28S rRNA gene  and 3'ETS sequences []. In the present work  the sequence of the intergenic spacer (IGS) between the rRNA gene clusters in chicken NOR was analyzed. A chicken BAC clone  which hybridizes in situ to the NOR on GGA16 []  was sequenced using the PacBio technique. We found that the insertion in this BAC contained three complete and one incomplete rDNA repeat units with three complete IGS sequences between them. We compared the structure of three complete rDNA repeats from the same BAC clone with a non-annotated complete rDNA sequence identified in a red junglefowl contig AADN04001305.1 from the Gallus_gallus-5.0 assembly  each of these originating from two different chicken breeds. The only crucial differences between these sequences were in the IGS  and not in the rRNA gene clusters. All four IGS contain tandemly repeated sequences organized in complex arrays. A fundamental similarity in structure and sequential location of the key repeats was detected among the four IGS analyzed: we observed no signs of mixing or shifting of nucleotides or clusters of repeated nucleotides and no loss of the high-level organization in any of the four IGS compared. When aligned against each other  the IGS feature a notable difference in lengths which range from 22 627 to 15 170 bp in the same NOR and is equal to 14 002 bp in the other individual. This variability in chicken IGS length is the main cause of the length variation of the rDNA repeat unit that ranges from 11 to 50 kb as was earlier described by Delany and coauthors [  ]  who performed genome DNA restriction analysis on rDNA repeat sequences and IGS size ranging in several chicken lines and breeds. We examined in detail the molecular pattern of the IGS length variations  which appear to be due to the absence of individual IGS inner repeats and/or of larger blocks of entire repeats. Similar to the variability in rDNA repeat number  the mechanism that underlies the IGS inner repeat number instability can be unequal sister-chromatid recombination or slippage during DNA replication [  ]. According to Delany and Krupkin []  the rDNA repeat number ranges from 269 to 378 per diploid genome in chicken  depending on the genetic line examined. It should be noted that they found larger ribosomal gene copy numbers and smaller rDNA repeat unit sizes in broiler populations compared to egg laying breeds. In the best-known vertebrate to date  namely   IGS comprise several functional elements such as pre-rRNA promoters  several  box terminator sites  two sites for non-coding RNA associated with stress response  a cdc27 pseudogene  and putative c-Myc and p53 binding sites  most of these being conserved at least among ape species []. In chicken  we were unable to identify any known functional sites within the IGS inner repeats and any known motifs similar to the repeated 10–18 bp  boxes that have been shown to be a termination signal sequence in human and mouse IGS []. One of the  repeats () showed 100% similarity to a 24-bp chicken sequence of a microRNA that is deposited in GenBank (NCBI Nucleotide: AM691130.1). Both  and  were similar to a repeated sequence that is related to antiviral activity (NCBI Nucleotide: AB124589  AB124590.1). To date  no function is known for the majority of the repeats in chicken IGS. Our alignment of transcriptome reads from different tissues (Chickspress project: ) against IGS sequences indicates that  in chicken  the pre-rRNA transcription starts in the small unique region (SUR) followed by the 5'ETS sequence. These data match well the data reported by Massin et al. []. These authors sequenced a 1262-bp fragment of chicken IGS and identified an rDNA promoter immediately followed by the start point of transcription. The fact that the sequence of this promoter completely matches to a sequence located in the SUR and the transcriptome alignment data support the existence of a single promoter sequence in chicken IGS  which is the pre-rRNA transcription promoter. In mouse  Xenopus  and yeast  the rRNA gene cluster transcription termination was shown to end in a T-enriched sequence downstream of the 3'ETS sequence  which is a region that contained no repeats []. Chicken rRNA gene cluster transcription appears to continue into the 5' repeat block of the IGS  in which C-rich and T-rich repeats alternate  and gradually ends in the LUR sequence. Thus  in chicken rDNA  the sites of both the pre-RNA gene cluster transcription termination and the next cluster transcription initiation are situated within the unique sequences that are separated by a series of  and  repeats. The central IGS region occupied by the repeats of the  group and  repeats appears to be non-transcribed. As a rule  only a few transcriptome reads are aligned with the central region. Presumably  they represent a nonspecific reaction  since no functional sites were found in this region. An obvious exception is the NOR in the kidney cells  where the reads were more abundantly aligned against  and  repeat areas. To date  the regulation or the meaning of this phenomenon are unknown. Based on our results  the chicken IGS structure seems to be quite different from its counterpart in human rDNA. We compared the organization of IGS in two representatives of the Sauropsida group  i.e. chicken () and terrapin (. A complete terrapin ribosomal repeat sequence was found among the non-annotated data of the whole-genome shotgun sequencing project (NCBI Assembly: MDXI00000000.1). Unlike IGS of mammals  amphibians or fish  IGS of chicken and terrapin are GC-enriched and contain many putative CpG islands. Besides  they both include very long conservative GC rich tandem repeats and lack the inverted sequences that can form hairpins. These data seem to put the investigated Sauropsida representatives at odds with other vertebrates and should be taken into account when studying the evolution of the Sauropsida group. In spite of the fast development of genome sequencing techniques  chromosomal NORs are still quite difficult to sequence and assemble. Regarding   even in the last assembly version (GRCg6a) that includes PacBio and Nanopore data  the NOR bearing chromosome (GGA16) region contains only one complete and two reduced rRNA gene clusters (NCBI Nucleotide: NC_006103.5) and has no IGS sequence. Based on the chicken IGS structure presented here and the ribosomal gene cluster sequence that was determined and published earlier []  we are confident that a complete chicken rDNA repeat unit is now assembled in terms of molecular DNA organization. Our findings fill a knowledge gap about the ribosomal repeat nucleotide sequence in the first representative of birds— The data obtained on the nucleotide sequence of the chicken IGS and its features combined with our earlier analysis of the chicken ribosomal gene cluster []  as well as data from Delany et al. [  ] on the differences in the number and size of chicken rDNA repeats  allow to characterize the complete organization of chicken NOR rDNA. Remarkably  chicken IGS features a high (C+G) content  a complex repeat sequence organization  no known regulatory sites and only a single promoter sequence. The data presented in this paper allow us to suggest the existence of IGS heterogeneity in a single array of rDNA repeats but this deserves serious consideration. The comparison between chicken and turtle IGS sequences showed that they are very similar to each other and significantly different from IGS in rRNA genes of mammals  amphibians  and fish. This emphasizes the evolutionary separation of the Sauropsida group from representatives of both the lower and higher organized vertebrate taxa.  Jacob ST. Regulation of ribosomal gene transcription.

Genomic prediction (GP)  a method proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  in which breeding values are predicted using dense genome-wide markers  has become a routine procedure in livestock breeding programs. In GP  quantitative trait loci (QTL) are presumed to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one of the genotyped markers and the markers are used to estimate the level of genetic similarity between individuals and explain the genetic variance for the trait. Compared with pedigree-based prediction of breeding values  GP can be performed as soon as DNA is available  which allows accurate selection early in life. Generally  the accuracy of GP increases as the number of animals in the reference population increases. For small reference populations  combining populations of the same breed or populations of related breeds has been reported to increase the accuracy of GP  such as for Holstein populations in the EuroGenomics [] and North American consortiums []. However  GP using combined populations has not shown a clear advantage compared with GP using a single population [  ]. The reason may be that the populations that are combined are too divergent  such that LD between the QTL and genotyped SNPs is not sufficiently consistent between populations. Therefore  an important question in this regard is whether the accuracy of combined population GP can be improved by using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) markers instead of the lower-density SNP panels. The availability of next-generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to apply GP to WGS data. Generally  increasing the number of SNPs in a panel increases the level of LD between a SNP and a QTL  which should be beneficial for GP. WGS data include a large number of genomic variants  including most causal mutations. Thus  prediction depends much less on LD between SNPs and causal mutations. However  some studies have demonstrated that using WGS data did not increase prediction accuracy or increased it only slightly compared to using high-density SNP panel genotypes. For example  van Binsbergen et al. [] reported that using imputed WGS data did not increase the accuracy of GP in Holstein-Friesian cattle compared to using BovineHD SNP genotype data. Zhang et al. [] also showed that increasing marker density did not increase or only slightly the accuracy of GP of feed efficiency component traits in Duroc pigs. Nevertheless  Brondum et al. [] showed that the accuracy of GP could be improved by adding several significant QTL that were detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using WGS data. Ni et al. [] reported that using only SNPs in or around a gene from WGS data increased the accuracy of GP in laying chickens. Thus  GP with WGS data could be an attractive approach  although to date  the expectation of a higher accuracy has not been realized with real WGS data. In pigs  most previous studies on GP have concentrated on populations with the same or very similar genetic backgrounds [  ]. However  in some national pig genetic improvement programs  pigs from a wide variety of sources are available  e.g.  many Chinese pig breeding farms have no genetic links between them. To extend the size of the reference population  joint genetic evaluation can be performed by combining populations with different genetics  as in beef cattle [  ]. A previous study showed that using SNP genotypes from a combined reference population can improve the accuracy of GP  but this improvement was very small []. Using WGS data for combined population GP could be an attractive and meaningful approach to increase accuracy [  ]. Our objective was to evaluate alternate approaches for combined population GP by analyzing WGS data. Three Yorkshire pig populations with different genetic backgrounds were used to establish a combined reference population  and two reproduction traits and two production traits were investigated to assess the accuracy of GP using different methods. The procedure for collecting pig blood samples was carried out in strict accordance with the protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of China Agricultural University (Permit Number: DK996). Yorkshire populations were sampled from three breeding farms in China  designated LM  XD  and ZX. Information on the populations and phenotypes is in Table . The pigs in the LM and ZX populations are both American Yorkshire progeny but from different breeding companies  and pigs in the XD population are British Yorkshire. The phenotypic records of the reproduction traits of piglets born alive (NBA) and total number of piglets born (TNB)  and the production traits of days to 100 kg (AGE) and backfat thickness (BFT) were examined. BFT was measured between the 10th and 11th rib of pigs at a weight of ~<U+2009>100 kg by real-time B-mode ultrasound. AGE and BFT were measured from 85 to 130 kg  and then adjusted to 100 kg. AGE and BFT were calculated as follows:   where  is a correction factor (referring to the China National Swine Genetic Improvement Program) that is equal to 50.775 and 46.415 for males and females  respectively;   where  is equal to -<U+2009>7.277 and -<U+2009>9.440 for males and females  respectively. For the LM population  records were available for all reproduction and production traits  for the XD population only NBA and TNB records were available  and for the ZX population only production records were available. To avoid the double counting problem for parental information  corrected phenotypes that were derived from pedigree-based estimated breeding values (EBV) were used as response variables in GP analyses [  ]. The model used to estimate EBV is that defined by the Center of National Swine Genetic Evaluation of China (). Pedigree-based EBV and genetic parameters for reproduction traits were estimated based on a single-trait repeatability model  which was implemented separately for each population. In the model  the fixed effect included herd-year-season  in which season comprised four levels (1st<U+2009>=<U+2009>December to February; 2nd<U+2009>=<U+2009>March to May; 3rd<U+2009>=<U+2009>June to August; 4th<U+2009>=<U+2009>September to November)  and the random effects included additive genetic  residual  and permanent environment effects. For the production traits  a bivariate animal model was implemented with the fixed effect of herd-year-season-sex and the random effects of additive genetics  litter  and residual. In total  141 876 animals were traced back to construct a pedigree relationship matrix. Corrected phenotypic values () for reproduction were calculated as EBV plus the average of estimated residuals over parities for a sow  and as the EBV plus estimated residual for each individual for the production traits. Individuals with an EBV reliability lower than 0.3 were removed. The number of genotyped animals used in the study is in Table . EBV and EBV reliability were computed using the DMUAI procedure in the DMU software []. Whole-genome sequence data on 289 pigs from 6 breeds were used as reference data for imputation  comprising 32 Duroc  86 Large White  29 Erhualian  94 Yorkshire  24 China South  and 24 China North pigs. All pigs had an average sequencing depth of ~<U+2009>25X and were introduced by Yan et al. [] as a reference panel. SNP calling for these individuals was performed following the general next-generation sequencing data processing procedures  as described by Yan et al. []. After SNP calling  46 766 110 SNPs were retained for imputation. For the animals from the three populations used in this study  genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using a TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (catalog number DP348; Tiangen  Beijing). Genotyping was performed using the PorcineSNP80 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA)  which includes 68 528 SNPs across the pig genome. In total  6103 pigs  which represented all families as best as possible  were genotyped as the target panel for imputation. Furthermore  22 individuals in the target panel of 6103 pigs were sequenced (~<U+2009>10X) to calculate the genotype concordance rate (CR)  which was defined as the proportion of genotypes of the imputed variants  which were the same as the whole-genome sequence variants. Imputation from the 80K chip to WGS genotypes was performed with Beagle 4.1 []. Imputation accuracy was assessed by the allelic R-squared measure (AR2) in Beagle  which is an estimate of the squared correlation between the most probable and the true reference dose. Variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01 were excluded using the PLINK software (v1.90) [] and only variants located on autosomes were used for further analysis  resulting in 56 463 SNPs from the 80K panel  and 18 976 288 SNPs for the imputed whole-genome sequence  henceforth referred to as WGS data. The following additional quality control criteria were used to remove SNPs from the WGS data: SNPs with an overall amplification of less than 90% and a random pair of SNPs that were in high LD with each other (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9 []). After LD pruning  4 099 253 SNPs were retained for the WGS data. Based on the 80K SNP data  the WGS data  and the pruned WGS data  three methods were used to predict breeding values using the corrected phenotypes: the GBLUP method based on the genomic relationship matrix  the single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) method with a combined pedigree–genomic relationship matrix  and the genomic feature BLUP (GFBLUP) method  which included an additional genomic effect that quantifies the joint effect of a group of variants associated with a genomic feature. The GBLUP [] model was used to predict the genomic EBV (GEBV) of all genotyped individuals: where  is the vector of corrected phenotypes   is the overall mean   is a vector of ones   is the vector of genomic breeding values  following a normal distribution of )  where  is the additive genetic variance  and  is the marker-based genomic relationship matrix [].  is an incidence matrix linking  to   and  is the vector of random errors  following a normal distribution of )  where  is the residual variance. The ssGBLUP model uses the phenotype information of both genotyped and non-genotyped animals in the same model as GBLUP  except that  also contains the corrected phenotype values of the non-genotyped animals  and vector  is assumed to follow a normal distribution . The inverse of  is used in the mixed model equations  and is given by this simple form [  ]: where  represents the submatrix of the pedigree-based relationship matrix  corresponding to the genotyped animals and  to avoid singularity problems   [  ]  where  is an adjusted  according to Christensen et al. [] to avoid differences in scale and location between the elements of  and elements of : where  and  are adjustment factors derived from the following equations: where  is the average of the diagonal elements  and  is the average of the off-diagonal elements. The GFBLUP [] model  which uses prior information about genomic features  is based on a linear mixed model with two random genomic effects: where      and  are the same as in GBLUP   is the vector of genomic values captured by genetic markers associated with a genomic feature of interest  following a normal distribution of )   is the vector of genomic effects captured by the remaining set of genetic markers  following a normal distribution )  and  is an incidence matrix that links  and  to . Matrices  and  were constructed in the same way as   but using only the genetic marker set defined by a genomic feature  as described in the following  and the remaining markers  respectively. Variance components were estimated via the R package EMMREML (v3.1) []. Two strategies were used to define genetic markers that formed the different classes of genomic features used in GFBLUP model analyses. First  the following general linear model-based association analysis (GLMA) was conducted  as implemented in the MVP software []. After LD pruning  all WGS variants were tested for association: where          and  are the same as in GBLUP   is the additive effect of the variant to be tested for association  and  is the vector of the variant’s genotype indicator variable coded as 0  1 or 2. The analysis was based only on the reference data. Different p value cut-off levels (10 to 10) were used to assess the statistical significance of the effect of individual SNPs. When a SNP was determined to be significantly associated with corrected phenotypes based on the pre-specified significance cut-off level  the corresponding genomic region was considered to define a genomic feature. Second  we derived genomic features from the summary statistics of a group of genetic markers located in a previously identified QTL region. All QTL for a specific trait were downloaded from NRSP (National Animal Genome Research Program)  and gene annotation information was downloaded from Ensembl (). The markers were grouped according to the genomic locations of the QTL region for a specific trait category downloaded from the database. The genomic region spanned by each individual QTL was standardized to three bins of 100  500 and 1000 kb on each side of the QTL midpoint. The SNPs that were mapped to the QTL region were considered to define a genomic feature. The three methods  GBLUP  ssGBLUP  GFBLUP  were compared based on the accuracy of genomic predictions. The (ss)GBLUP models based on the 80K SNP panel  WGS data  and WGS data after LD pruning were termed (ss)GBLUP_80K  (ss)GBLUP_WGS  and (ss)GBLUP_LD  respectively. For GFBLUP  the genomic feature matrix was constructed based on prior information gained from QTL and GWAS strategies  and the results were termed GFBLUP_QTL and GFBLUP_GWAS  respectively. To evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction  the younger LM animals  based on birth dates after December 2013 for reproduction traits and after August 2014 for production traits  were selected as validation populations  with sizes of 223 and 270  respectively. Considering that  only reproduction records were available from the XD population and the small number of genotyped animals from the ZX population  younger XD animals (born after April 2013) were chosen as the validation population for reproduction traits  with a size of 196  which was similar to the size of the LM validation population. The accuracy of genomic prediction was evaluated as the correlation between GEBV and  in the validation population. To evaluate the impact of using a combined reference population  the accuracy of genomic prediction based on the single and combined reference populations were compared for the production and reproduction traits. To identify the population structure of the three Yorkshire populations  principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the 80K SNP panel. Figure  illustrates that the genetic backgrounds of the LM and ZX populations differed  although both were American Yorkshire progeny. Likewise  the XD population was distantly related to the LM and ZX groups due to its British origin. Principal component analysis (PCA) for three Yorkshire populations. XD  LM and ZX represent three Yorkshire populations from three Chinese pig breeding farms; PC1 (3.9%)<U+2009>=<U+2009>first principal component (variance explained by PC1<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.9%); PC2 (2.1%)<U+2009>=<U+2009>second principal component (variance explained by PC2<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.1%) Estimates of heritability of the reproduction and production traits in the three Yorkshire populations are in Table . Heritability estimates for the production traits ranged from 0.19 to 0.38 in the LM and ZX populations and for reproduction traits they were similar (0.07–0.09) in the LM and XD populations. To assess the imputation accuracy for the imputed variants  we removed variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF) lower than 9.9E-5 and calculated the mean AR2 and mean CR across the range of MAF for the remaining variants  as shown in Fig. . The average CR across all variants was 0.92  which is sufficient for further analysis. The AR2 was sensitive to MAF. Variants with a MAF lower than 0.15 accounted for ~<U+2009>77% of the total number of variants  and the AR2 was extremely low for variants with a MAF lower than 0.05. For the variants with a MAF higher than 0.15  the AR2 was greater than 80%. Imputation accuracy was also investigated for each chromosome. As shown in Additional file : Figure S1 there were no significant differences between chromosomes. Imputation accuracy for each minor allele frequency (MAF) interval. Genotype concordance rate (CR)  which was defined as the proportion of genotypes of the imputed variants that were the same as the whole-genome sequencing variants. AR2  allelic R-squared for consistent variants between imputation and whole-genome sequencing. AR2_ALL  allelic R-squared for all imputed variants Genomic relationship matrices for use with GBLUP were constructed based on the different marker densities of the 80K SNP panel  the WGS data  and the WGS data after LD pruning. Table  presents the accuracy of genomic prediction for the reproduction traits based on the different reference populations and the LM validation population. For the LM reference population  prediction accuracies obtained with GBLUP_80K were 0.453 and 0.450 for NBA and TNB and were similar with GBLUP_WGS  i.e. 0.456 and 0.452  respectively. We found a similar trend in accuracies for the XD validation population  as shown in Table . For the XD reference population  prediction accuracies with GBLUP_80K and GBLUP_WGS were almost the same for NBA but slightly decreased for TNB from 0.431 with GBLUP_80K to 0.425 with GBLUP_WGS. Table  presents the accuracy of genomic prediction of the production traits for the LM validation population. There were no obvious differences in accuracy between GBLUP_80K and GBLUP_WGS for the LM reference population  e.g.  the accuracy for AGE was 0.625 with GBLUP_80K and 0.633 with GBLUP_WGS. It should be noted that  compared to GBLUP_80K and GBLUP_WGS  GBLUP_LD resulted in a higher accuracy for all scenarios (Tables     ); improvements were on average 1.4 and 1.0% for reproduction traits and 2.2 and 1.0% for production traits  respectively. The highest increase was 3.3% for AGE with GBLUP_LD compared to GBLUP_80K for the LM+ZX reference population and the LM validation population. This result indicates that pruning SNPs that are in complete or high LD with other SNPs is an effective strategy to reduce the number of uninformative markers and increase the prediction accuracy with WGS data. To evaluate the effect of including prior information  GFBLUP methods with preselection and prior biology strategies were compared with GBLUP_WGS and other methods. Prediction accuracies differed for different QTL lengths or GWAS p values used for GFBLUP (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2  Additional file : Table S3  Additional file : Table S4  Additional file : Table S5  Additional file : Table S6  Additional file : Table S7  Additional file : Tables S8]. The best results for GFBLUP are in Tables    and . In the scenario in which a single population was used as the reference population  the accuracy of genomic prediction increased by on average 1.1 and 1.5% for GFBLUP_QTL and GFBLUP_GWAS  respectively  compared to GBLUP_WGS (Tables    and )  although in some scenarios  accuracy did not increase or slightly decreased  e.g.  with the XD reference and validation population for NBA  prediction accuracies were 0.390 and 0.378 for GBLUP_WGS and GFBLUP_GWAS  respectively (Table ). Therefore  preselection of variants that might be causal on the basis of prior biological knowledge (e.g.  Gene Ontology and pathway) may be key to improving prediction accuracy. In this study  the genomic relationship matrix  for ssGBLUP was based on the same marker densities as those used for GBLUP. Among the three approaches (GBLUP  GFBLUP and ssGBLUP) used to predict genomic breeding values  ssGBLUP performed best. For the LM validation population in Table   the accuracy of prediction obtained by ssGBLUP ranged from 0.641 to 0.686 for NBA and TNB. Averaged across the two traits  ssGBLUP yielded a 20.1% higher accuracy than GBLUP and a 19.3% higher accuracy than GFBLUP for a given scenario. A similar trend was also found for the XD validation population for reproduction traits and for the LM validation population for production traits (Tables  and ). As shown in Table   on average  ssGBLUP had a 4.1 and 3.1% higher accuracy than GBLUP and GFBLUP  respectively. The size of the increase in accuracy from using ssGBLUP was small  which could be due to the small number of genotyped animals (the XD reference population included 556 animals). In addition  with the XD reference population  accuracy was on average slightly higher for GFBLUP_GWAS (0.494) than for ssGBLUP (0.481) with the LM+XD reference population (Table ). Table  presents the accuracy of genomic prediction for production traits with ssGBLUP. Among the three genomic prediction methods used  ssGBLUP on average yielded a 17.0 and 16.4% higher accuracy than GBLUP and GFBLUP  respectively. The accuracies of prediction obtained with ssGBLUP when different marker densities were used for the construction of  were also compared  as shown in Tables    and . For most scenarios  ssGBLUP_LD performed better than ssGBLUP_80K and ssGBLUP_WGS for both the reproduction and production traits. However  ssGBLUP_LD performed almost as well as ssGBLUP_80K and ssGBLUP_WGS with the XD validation population (Table ). Furthermore  in the scenarios that used the LM and LM+ZX reference populations  the accuracy of ssGBLUP_LD was slightly lower than that of ssGBLUP_80K for the production traits (Table ). Our main objective was to investigate how much the accuracy of genomic prediction can increase by using combined populations with different genetic backgrounds and WGS data instead of lower-density marker panels. For the reproduction traits with the LM validation population (Table )  the accuracy of genomic predictions based on GBLUP_80K increased slightly from 0.453 and 0.450 to 0.459 and 0.460 for NBA and TNB  respectively  when the reference population was enlarged from only the LM population to the admixed population LM+XD. Corresponding average increases in accuracy were 1.4 and 1.2% for GBLUP_WGS and GBLUP_LD  respectively. For the same scenarios  the accuracy of prediction was not improved or decreased slightly when combining the reference populations for ssGBLUP_80K for NBA and TNB  while both GBLUP_WGS and GBLUP_LD yielded approximately 1% higher accuracy with the combined reference population. For the XD validation population (Table )  prediction accuracy for NBA and TNB decreased or slightly increased for GBLUP with the combined reference population based on the low-density marker panel. However  when WGS data were used  prediction accuracy on average improved by 2.3 and 1.4% for NBA and TNB with GBLUP_WGS and GBLUP_LD  respectively. For ssGBLUP  average prediction accuracy for NBA and TNB increased when combining reference populations  by 1.3  2  and 1.7% for ssGBLUP_80 K  ssGBLUP_WGS  and ssGBLUP_LD  respectively. The improvement in prediction accuracy from combining reference populations was greater for the WGS data than for the 80K SNP panel. For production traits  prediction accuracy for AGE and BFT based on the combined reference population LM+ZX compared to the single reference population LM decreased for GBLUP based on the 80K SNP panel (Table ). However  when WGS data were used  prediction accuracy increased  although the increase was small  at approximately 1%  for GBLUP_WGS and GBLUP_LD. A similar trend was also found for ssGBLUP  where a small advantage was obtained when WGS data were used compared to the 80K marker panel. The reason for the small advantage of the combined reference population for production traits may be because the LM population was already large  and the small size of the ZX population did not provide much additional information. Tables    and  show that there was no advantage from using the combined population genomic prediction for the GFBLUP method. For the reproduction traits with the LM validation population  as shown in Table   similar prediction accuracies were obtained with the single and the combined reference population. However  for the XD validation population (see Table )  the accuracy of genomic prediction with GFBLUP increased for reproduction traits when using the combined LM<U+2009>+<U+2009>XD reference population compared to using the XD population alone. For the production traits (see Table )  the accuracy of genomic prediction decreased slightly with the combined reference population  except that the accuracy for BFT increased from 0.444 to 0.452 with GFBLUP_GWAS. We also performed genomic prediction across populations with different genetic backgrounds. When the XD population was used for genomic prediction of reproduction traits in LM (see Table )  i.e. when no animals from the LM population were included in the reference population  prediction accuracies obtained with GBLUP_80K were as low as 0.026 and -<U+2009>0.016 for NBA and TNB  respectively. However  GBLUP_WGS and GBLUP_LD yielded a 1.6 (1.5) and 2.4% (4.4%) higher accuracy  respectively  for this scenario than GBLUP_80K for NBA (TNB)  while GFBLUP yielded a lower accuracy than GBLUP_80K. Likewise  when using LM to predict XD  the accuracy of prediction obtained with GBLUP_80K was 0.121 and 0.214 for NBA and TNB  respectively  and increased with GBLUP_WGS and GBLUP_LD. For the production traits (see Table )  when using ZX to predict LM  a higher prediction accuracy was also obtained for all scenarios when WGS data were used than when the 80K SNP panel was used  which further supports the advantage of using WGS data in combined population genomic prediction. In this study  we investigated the accuracy of genomic prediction based on imputed WGS data versus a medium-density SNP panel using real pig data. In theory  using WGS data in genomic prediction is expected to lead to higher predictive ability  because WGS data include most of the causal mutations that influence traits of interest  and prediction is much less limited by LD between SNPs and causal mutations [  ]. In addition  simulation studies suggested that WGS data could improve the accuracy of genomic prediction within a population by as much as 40%  depending on the trait  statistical method  and MAF of the causal mutations affecting the traits [  ]. However  we observed no increase in accuracy when imputed sequence data was used for within-population prediction compared to 50K or 80K SNP data. An example is the genomic prediction of reproduction and production traits when both the reference and validation populations were from LM  (see Tables  and )  and we observed an even lower accuracy with imputed sequence data than with the 80K SNP chip for TNB within the XD population (see Table ). Similar results were reported for feed efficiency component traits in Duroc pigs []  backfat thickness in pigs []  and body conformation traits in Chinese Holsteins using imputed HD data []. When using imputed WGS data for genomic prediction  several factors can affect accuracy of resulting predictions: Genotype imputation accuracy. In the current study  we obtained a high average imputation accuracy of 0.92 from 80K to WGS. However  potential imputation errors are difficult to detect  which affects the accuracy of genomic prediction. van Binsbergen et al. [] reported that the predictive accuracy was lower with imputed HD array data than with genotyped HD array data for a population of more than 5000 Holstein-Friesian cattle. Currently  sequencing all individuals in a population is not realistic. Thus  to benefit from the advantage of using WGS data instead of high-density genotype data for genomic prediction  it is necessary to target a large training set with a small average relationship between animals to increase imputation accuracy []. LD pruning of WGS data. One basic assumption of GS is that each QTL is in LD with at least one SNP; thus  SNPs that are distributed across the whole genome can explain most of the genetic variance []. However  when two SNPs are in high LD  their genotypic information is redundant and only one is necessary to represent the variation in neighboring regions  especially for WGS data. Too many SNPs with high LD may introduce noise and result in biased genomic prediction. Based on our results  pruning SNPs that are in complete or high LD with other SNPs is an effective strategy to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction  as higher accuracy was obtained with GBLUP and ssGBLUP for almost all the scenarios (Tables    and ) when high LD SNPs (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.9) were removed from the WGS data. Removing uninformative SNPs also decreased the computational demand for the construction of the  matrix. Similar results were obtained in Holstein-Friesian bulls with an LD threshold for pruning of 0.9 []. Preselection and prior biology of sequence variants. WGS data are expected to capture genetic variation more completely than SNP panels  but the direct use of WGS data did not yield an advantage in our study. Many studies have demonstrated that adding significant markers derived from HD marker panels or sequence data into medium (50K or 80K) density panel data can improve the accuracy of genomic prediction [    ]  since it treats significant SNPs as genomic features (as in GFBLUP  which is discussed below). However  in this study  accuracy did not increase by adding preselected GWAS markers from the WGS data to the 80K SNP panel (results not shown)  which agrees with the results of Veerkamp et al. [] and Calus et al. []. The lack of improvement in accuracy may be due to the genetic architecture of the trait or the limited ability to correctly estimate QTL. In this study  three different methods  GBLUP  ssGBLUP and GFBLUP  were compared. To date  the use of GFBLUP and ssGBLUP with WGS data in pigs has rarely been investigated. The ssGBLUP model uses a combined genotype-pedigree relationship matrix [  ]  and in this study  all ungenotyped animals were added to construct the  matrix. As expected  ssGBLUP performed better than GBLUP and GFBLUP for all scenarios  which is consistent with other reports [  ]. Our results show that ssGBLUP did not yield a higher accuracy of genomic prediction with WGS data than with the 80K SNP panel in the same scenarios. The possible reason is that the  matrix portion of the construction of the  matrix was the same  and that the other part of the genomic relationship matrix was based on the 80K SNP panel and WGS  whereas increasing the number of markers used for prediction to the WGS level does not increase the accuracy  as discussed above. In this study  we investigated the efficiency of GFBLUP based on two sources of additional information: incorporating prior knowledge of QTL from the literature (GFBLUP_QTL) and including significant SNPs obtained from GWAS (GFBLUP_GWAS) as known genomic features. Our results indicate that GFBLUP yielded approximately 1 to 2% higher accuracy than GBLUP based on the WGS data for the reproduction and production traits (see Tables    and ). This is consistent with other studies [  ]. Fang et al. [] reported that the accuracy of genomic prediction was marginally improved (approximately 3%) with GFBLUP compared to standard GBLUP when using imputed sequence variants in Holstein and Jersey cattle. The advantage of GFBLUP over GBLUP is attributed mainly to the fact that GFBLUP allows the assignment of different weights to the genomic variants in the different genomic relationship based on their estimated genomic parameters  which can better fit the genetic architecture of the trait [  ]. However  GFBLUP was not superior to GBLUP for all scenarios  e.g.  for prediction within the XD population  prediction accuracies for NBA were 0.390 and 0.378 with GBLUP_WGS and GFBLUP_GWAS  respectively (Table ). The imperfect imputation of WGS variants may be a factor that limits the predictive ability of GFBLUP  as noted in other studies [  ]. Genomic features based on published QTL includes non-causal markers  and the genetic architecture of complex traits is currently poorly revealed by GWAS  owing to the many individually undetectable QTL with small to moderate effects []  which could affect the predictive ability of GFBLUP. Furthermore  the model may be trait-specific  e.g.  the total heritability of a trait and the number of markers per genomic feature differ by trait  which can cause variation in the accuracy of genomic prediction (see Additional files  to : Tables S1 to S8). Moreover  published QTL are not available for some traits (e.g.  farrowing interval of sows)  and prior QTL information is far from complete for most traits of interest. All these factors limit the use of GFBLUP with publicly available QTL data. The number of SNPs in genomic features obtained by using QTLdb or GWAS affects the estimate of the genomic feature variance  as shown in Additional files  to : Tables S1 to S8. The prediction accuracy of GFBLUP is influenced both by the genomic variance explained by the genomic features and by the number of noisy SNPs that are present in each feature. In addition  any errors in estimates of variance components will reduce prediction accuracy  because using incorrect variance components results in the genomic relationships not being used for prediction in an optimal manner []. However  our results indicated that GFBLUP had no advantage for genomic prediction in the combined population compared to single-population genomic prediction  e.g.  as shown in Table   for the LM validation population  the accuracy of GS for TNB with GFBLUP_GWAS decreased from 0.459 for the LM reference population to 0.455 for the combined LM+XD reference population. Furthermore  GFBLUP_QTL did not increase accuracy of prediction for the combined LM+XD reference population compared to the LM reference population  which could be caused by non-persistent associations between SNPs and QTL or inconsistent LD patterns between SNPs and QTL across populations. Thus  the same genomic feature matrix in a single population for GFBLUP should not be used for the combined population. Reference population size and relationships between the reference and validation populations are key factors for the accuracy of genomic prediction. Generally  the accuracy of genomic prediction increases with increasing reference population size []. However  assembling a large reference population is challenging due to the relatively small population sizes of some breeds or farms. Combining populations into one common reference population has been very useful for genomic prediction  e.g.  in dairy and beef cattle [      ]. In this study  we assessed the advantage of a combined reference population for genomic prediction. Our previous investigation showed that the combined reference population in pigs did not have an advantage over a single population in all scenarios and even performed more poorly with the 80K SNP panel []. This was confirmed by our findings in this study  which enlarged the genotyped population compared to our previous investigation (Tables    and ). This phenomenon was also reported in other studies [    ] and can be due to three factors: (1) inconsistent LD between SNPs and QTL across populations in the SNP-chip panel [  ]; (2) an increase in the genetic distance between individuals of the reference and validation populations  resulting in lower accuracy for the combined reference population []; and (3) differences in allele substitution effects between populations  resulting in differences in the components of that variance in terms of the contribution of each QTL  which could impact prediction in the combined population []. However  our results also indicated that the accuracy of genomic prediction increased by 1 to 2.4% and by 1% when using WGS data instead of the 80K SNP panel with GBLUP and ssGBLUP  respectively  in all scenarios (Tables    and ). Iheshiulor et al. [] also reported that the use of WGS data was especially beneficial for multibreed prediction. This improvement is mainly due to improvements in the three factors discussed above. For example  when calculating the -matrix based on the LM and XD populations  the number of genomic relationships between the two populations that are greater than 0.1 increased from 741 for the 80K SNP panel to 21 310 for the WGS data. Hayes et al. [] also noted that the main reason for the benefit of WGS data in combined populations and across populations was that the presence of QTL in the WGS data increased the probability of picking up similar QTL that segregate between populations. However  the size of the increase in accuracy from using WGS was still small. Several other sources of improvement could be explored: (1) incorporating imputation accuracy into genomic prediction models by weighting all SNPs with imputation accuracy of AR2 for the construction of the  matrix; (2) using two Bayesian methods of split-and-merge Bayesian variable selection [] and BayesR to drop variants with a small effect [] for the combined population prediction to fit the model and reduce the computing time  since the Bayesian method can theoretically capture all the variants provided by the WGS data; (3) using an LD-adjusted kinship matrix instead of a standard kinship matrix in genomic prediction models to eliminate the biases due to overestimation in regions of strong LD and underestimation in regions of low LD  as described by Speed et al. []; and (4) using a multitrait model for genomic prediction in multipopulation reference populations  in which the same trait in different populations is considered as a different trait. For populations with similar genetic backgrounds  i.e.  for which genetic relationships between populations are sufficient  another advantage of using a multitrait approach is that it accounts for potential genotype-by-environment interactions (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction [  ]. For multitrait GBLUP  a multipopulation genomic relationship matrix can be used to account for the genetic relationships between populations []. However  it might not be possible to apply multitrait ssGBLUP if there is little or no pedigree relationship between populations. In addition  the computational demand of the multitrait approach will increase rapidly with an increase in the number of populations  as more (co)variance components will have to be estimated  and it will be more difficult to converge. However  the efficiency of these approaches in actual genome prediction requires further investigation. The use of WGS data holds potential to increase the accuracy of combined-population genomic prediction  and ssGBLUP performed best in all scenarios. However  WGS is still much more expensive than SNP-chip assays; thus  a more acceptable approach is to sequence a subset of a population as a reference panel to perform genotype imputation with high accuracy. Our results showed that simply increasing the number of markers used for prediction to the WGS level does not increase the accuracy of single-population prediction  while pruning WGS data and using GFBLUP based on prior information could yield higher accuracy than prediction based on a SNP panel.

In this paper  we examine the application of SS-T-BLUP to a large-scale multi-trait Australian Angus beef cattle dataset using the full BREEDPLAN single step genetic evaluation model and compare the results to the application of two different methods of using  in a single step model. Results clearly show that SS-T-BLUP outperforms other single step formulations in terms of computational speed and avoids approximation of the inverse of . Within the last decade  genotyping thousands of individuals with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips has become common practice in breeding programs of many species of economic relevance. However  due to cost effectiveness these individuals are being genotyped with low- to medium-density SNP chips  with usually not more than 50 000 markers. To date  genetic evaluation systems accommodate SNP genotypes via the so-called single step model  in which most often markers are used to pre-calculate a relationship matrix  which subsequently augments the usual pedigree derived relationship matrix into a so-called  matrix  (SS-H-BLUP) []. With the mixed model equations (MME) requiring the inverse of this matrix  and assuming that  is actually algebraically invertible  increasing numbers of genotyped individuals have imposed a large computational burden on genetic evaluation systems. To circumvent this problem an approximation of the inverse of  was proposed  but the effect of this approximation on estimated breeding values (EBV) is dataset-dependent and must therefore be empirically determined for every single application []. However  the situation described above of having more genotyped individuals than markers has led to a situation where  is not of full rank and therefore algebraically no longer invertible. An alternative solution is to not use  and move to a model which incorporates the markers directly (SS-SNP-BLUP). While SS-SNP-BLUP is generally equivalent to SS-H-BLUP  and some formulations such as [] offer huge model flexibility  many of its final implementations suffer from convergence problems with regard to iterative solving [] or demanding pre-conditioner computation []. However  recently an elegant intermediate model has been formulated  which may be seen as a mix of SS-H-BLUP and SS-SNP-BLUP and is called SS-T-BLUP [  ]. SS-T-BLUP does not need  or its inverse and fits the marker indirectly. As it also fits  indirectly  it is generally algebraically equivalent to SS-H-BLUP. Thus  it provides EBV at the individual level  which can be readily transformed into SNP solutions but avoids the complex co-variance structure of SS-SNP-BLUP [    ]. In this paper  we will examine the computational advantage of SS-T-BLUP for a large-scale multi-trait BREEDPLAN single step genetic evaluation of Australian Angus beef cattle. We will compare the results to those obtained by using an ordinary SS-H-BLUP approach. In the following  three equivalent representations of the inverse of the  matrix are derived which differ in their computational demand before and while solving the MME. Many of the formulas have been derived elsewhere [         ]  but for convenience they are presented below. The  matrix required for SS-H-BLUP can be written as: where  is the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix   denotes a diagonal block of  related to the set of  non-genotyped individuals   denotes a diagonal block of  related to the set of  genotyped individuals  and  and  denote off-diagonal blocks of  located between the non-genotyped and genotyped individuals.  is a genomic relationship matrix of dimension  which is constructed by <U+2009>=<U+2009>       where  is a centred and scaled matrix of marker genotypes of dimension    is an arbitrary but symmetric and positive definite matrix of dimension    is an arbitrary but symmetric and positive definite matrix of dimension   and  and  are arbitrary non-zero weights. Note that in applications where all markers are weighted equally and the co-variance between markers is set to zero   reduces to an identity matrix if  is centred and scaled. Furthermore   may be a diagonal matrix of random noise which ensures invertibility of     and  and  are set to 1. Or  =       where  is interpreted as the proportion of the total additive genetic variance not explained by markers [].  can be written as: or  replacing  by ()  as  where  is a respective block of the inverse of . Replacing  with    <U+2009>+<U+2009>  in Eq.  and inverting the resulting matrix yields: where according to the Woodbury matrix identity. Assuming that <U+2009>=<U+2009>  Eq.  simplifies to: Setting  =    reduces Eq.  to: Furthermore  defining  as the upper Cholesky factor of matrix (  +  ) simplifies Eq.  to: which  when setting  = ()simplifies to Following the derivation of   replacing  in Eq.  by () yields matrix : Given the matrices    and   three different BLUP models can be defined  SS-H-BLUP  SS--BLUP  and SS-T-BLUP  which differ solely in the formulation of the inverse of  used (   or ). The differences between the three approaches regarding computational time spent on preparing necessary data and solving the MME iteratively can be reduced to a set of very specific operations unique to the respective representation of the inverse of . This also applies to the differences in memory requirements. Assuming that <U+2009>=<U+2009>  preparation of SS-H-BLUP requires to build    and   and invert both  and . Preparing SS--BLUP involves building    and   and inverting   whereas setting up SS-T-BLUP requires building  and . Furthermore  SS--BLUP and SS-T-BLUP require a sparse factorisation of  to facilitate matrix-vector operations on () and sampling the diagonal elements of () if required []. Note that vector operations on  involve solving an equation for every single vector instead of doing an inversion once []. A widely used method when solving MME iteratively is the conditioned gradient descent method [also known as preconditioned gradient method (PCG)]. It requires the multiplication of a vector with the MME coefficient matrix once per iteration. Therefore  this method is affected by the way the inverse of  is presented. More specifically  during iteration the computational differences between the three approaches can be reduced to the multiplication of a vector of length   say   with a dense matrix  which is (<U+2009>-<U+2009>)  or   or    for SS-H-BLUP  SS--BLUP and SS-T-BLUP  respectively. Furthermore  SS--BLUP and SS-T-BLUP require the multiplication of  with the matrix ()  which involves solving () <U+2009>=<U+2009>  where = . Differences in peak memory requirement directly result from the size of the arrays  which must be kept in RAM simultaneously during preparation and iteration. Furthermore  for SS-H-BLUP and SS--BLUP  the computational task  in which peak memory usage occurs  changes as the number of genotyped individuals exceeds the number of markers. The SS-H-BLUP  SS--BLUP and SS-T-BLUP models were applied to an Australian Angus beef cattle dataset currently used in BREEDPLAN single step genetic evaluation []. The dataset comprised 35 traits with 9 565 814 records and 2 621 403 individuals in the pedigree. The number of animals with genotypes was 58 705 which comprised SNP genotypes of various densities and panel manufacturers imputed to a common set of 56 009 SNPs []. To increase the computational load  additional 91 295 and 341 295 dummy genotypes (total dataset size of 150k and 400k genotypes  respectively) were generated in a regression-sampling approach (see next paragraph). The 400k dataset was used only for SS-T-BLUP because the other models were computationally infeasible. Dummy genotypes for 91 295 (341 295) individuals  sampled from the pool of non-genotyped individuals  were generated by   where  is a matrix of dimension 91 295 (341 295)<U+2009><U+2009>56 009 of expected marker counts of the sampled non-genotyped individuals   is a matrix of real marker counts of dimension 58 705<U+2009><U+2009>56 009  which were centred using mean allele counts estimated from the data  and  is the off-diagonal block of  between the sampled non-genotyped individuals and the 58 705 genotyped individuals. Outliers in  ( and ) were truncated to 0 and 2  respectively  where the proportion of outliers was lower than 1%. Subsequently  each expected marker count  was translated into a dummy marker genotype by drawing two samples from a binomial distribution with parameters  and . Note that dummy genotypes that are generated this way may be affected by Mendelian inconsistency  but these were only generated for the purpose of increasing the computational load and are not part of the usual BREEDPLAN analysis. The BREEDPLAN multi-trait model included pre-corrected phenotypes []  a single fixed factor per trait  27 correlated random genetic factors (including direct and maternal)  27 correlated random genetic group factors with 19 genetic groups (including direct and maternal)  3 correlated random maternal permanent environmental factors and 22 correlated random sire-by-herd interaction factors. For traits with repeated observations  repetitions were modelled as correlated traits sharing the same genetic factor. Accounting for the extensive production system and the widespread use of natural mating in large herds using groups of bulls  the pedigree and its derivatives (e.g.   ) allowed for more than one pair of parents per animal if necessary []. The total number of equations was 76 823 378. For all three models matrix   was set to identity  matrix <U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>  and  and  were set as 0.05 and 0.95  respectively. The system of equations was solved with AGBU’s current large-scale linear mixed model library solver  which uses the PCG algorithm for iteratively solving linear mixed models and integrates Intel(R) MKL(R)  version 2017 update 8. For research and commercial purposes  the solver is available on request. Block-diagonal and diagonal pre-conditioners were used for random and fixed factors  respectively. Denoting the MME as <U+2009>=<U+2009>  where  is the coefficient matrix   is the solution vector and  is the right hand side vector  convergence was achieved when the L2 norm of vector (<U+2009>-<U+2009>) scaled by the L2 norm of vector  was . All computationally relevant integers and all real numbers were represented in 64 bit form. All matrices and vectors required for preparation and solving were stored in random access memory (RAM). Computations for the 150k dataset were carried out on a computer with two sockets each with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v3 with 2.60 GHz  a total of 28 cores and 528 GB of RAM. Computations for the 400k dataset were carried out on a computer with two sockets each with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v4 with 2.30 GHz  a total of 36 cores and 256 GB of RAM. Results for the different parts of the setup and solving steps are in Table . SS-H-BLUP  SS--BLUP  SS-T-BLUP and SS-T-BLUP converged in equal numbers of rounds which was <U+2009>2560 (see Fig. ). The major differences between SS-H-BLUP  SS--BLUP and SS-T-BLUP were the computing times for run preparation and per round of iteration. The solver convergence criterion on a log scale as a function of the number of iterations for SS-H-BLUP (black)  SS--BLUP (blue)  SS-T-BLUP (red) and SS-T-BLUP (green) The preparation time for model specific parts for SS-T-BLUP was 1.3 h  for SS-H-BLUP 4 h and for SS--BLUP 3.2 h. Thus  compared to SS-T-BLUP  SS-H-BLUP needed 3 times and SS--BLUP 2.5 times more real time for all necessary pre-calculations. In terms of time per iteration  SS-H-BLUP needed 7.5 real time seconds for a single round of the preconditioned gradient solver  followed by SS-T-BLUP with 8.5 real time seconds. With 11.2 seconds per iteration SS--BLUP was slowest. These differences were caused by multiplying a vector  say   with matrices    and . This can be narrowed down further to a single matrix vector operation  in SS-H-BLUP  or one matrix vector operation  and one solver operation <U+2009>=<U+2009>() in SS--BLUP  or two matrix vector operations    and one solver operation <U+2009>=<U+2009>  in SS-T-BLUP. In the example given here  computations of  and   required  floating point operations (FLOP)  whereas    required  1.510 FLOP. SS-T-BLUP and SS--BLUP have further computational costs for solving <U+2009>=<U+2009>()  which offset the FLOP advantage of SS-T-BLUP and produce an additional overhead for SS--BLUP when compared to SS-H-BLUP. For SS--BLUP  this disadvantage is not balanced by avoiding inversion of   which results in SS--BLUP having the longest total run time of all approaches. The combination of an advantage in terms of FLOPs  extra burden for operation <U+2009>=<U+2009>() and huge saving in preparation time made SS-T-BLUP the fastest of all approaches. Note that for SS--BLUP the operation <U+2009>=<U+2009>() is the only overhead compared to SS-H-BLUP when iterating  and therefore allows inference regarding the increase in seconds per iteration solely attributable to the sparse representation of . Due to major time savings for run preparation and only a slight increase in time per iteration  SS-T-BLUP needed only 80% of the total processing time required by SS-H-BLUP  and only 66% of SS--BLUP. The difference in total processing time between SS-H-BLUP and SS--BLUP was almost 2 h caused by a rapid inversion of  and fast iteration when using SS-H-BLUP. Additional approximate random access memory (RAM) requirements in gibabyte due to matrices and operations that are unique to the approaches are in the last row in Table . For SS-H-BLUP and SS--BLUP  the additional RAM requirement peaked when  and  or their inverse matrices were kept in RAM to calculate  or (<U+2009>-<U+2009>)  respectively. For SS-T-BLUP the additional RAM requirement peaked when operations (  +  ) and <U+2009>=<U+2009>()  required keeping matrix  and a matrix of dimension  in RAM simultaneously. The last column in Table  shows the computing time and additional RAM requirement for SS-T-BLUP. Note that SS-H-BLUP models using 400k dataset were computationally infeasible. SS-T-BLUP has been proposed as a single step model which can be helpful for datasets for which the number of genotyped individuals exceeds the number of markers and the  matrix is algebraically not invertible. These situations are becoming more common in commercial plant and livestock species where increasing numbers of individuals are genotyped with low- to medium-density SNP chips []. The method is enabled by reformulating the  matrix representation such that neither the  or  matrices  nor their inverse matrices need to be built or approximated. In terms of modelling capacity SS-T-BLUP  SS-H-BLUP  and SS--BLUP have drawbacks compared to SS-SNP-BLUP. The derivation of matrix  is dependent on a matrix  with weight   which is usually matrix  or a diagonal matrix of random noise. This applies to matrices  and  as well  because invertibility of  is never guaranteed. In addition  SS-SNP-BLUP can be reformulated such that every single genetic effect in the model can have different  and  and every single marker in the model can have a different genetic co-variance matrix. Such a situation arises when markers have different effects within a trait and different effects in different traits. The former requires  to be non-identity diagonal  the latter a unique matrix  for every single trait. In a multi-trait analysis  the genetic covariance matrix for marker  may then be  where  is a global genetic co-variance matrix and  is a diagonal matrix of weights of marker  in the different traits. This expansion is not possible for the models applied here. However  SS-SNP-BLUP usually comes at the cost of much higher model dimensionality and slow convergence rates when solved iteratively []. The latter can be dealt with by using a more elaborate pre-conditioner  which is still computationally demanding []. To our knowledge  it has not been shown yet that the model flexibility of SS-SNP-BLUP is required for more accurate EBV. Since all models were equivalent  it was expected that the number of iterations needed for convergence was the same. However  surprisingly there was no difference in the number of iterations for convergence when using only the 58 705 real genotypes (results not shown)  150k genotypes or 400k genotypes. A possible explanation is the way the dummy genotypes were generated. Thus  it is very likely that a dataset with 400k real genotypes may require more iterations but that the time needed for preparation and per iteration will be similar to that observed in this study. As shown by the results  SS-T-BLUP clearly outperforms SS-H-BLUP in terms of total processing time mainly due to the huge computational cost of setting-up    and inverting both. In particular  the inversion cost grows cubic with   whereas at a constant  the cost for generating  grows less than linearly and the cost for  grows proportional to . These results support the conclusion that SS-T-BLUP provides a feasible algorithm to calculate exact solutions for estimated breeding values when the number of genotyped individuals exceeds the number of markers. A limitation to the number of genotyped individuals is only set by the available RAM. Therefore  SS-T-BLUP allows solving single step equation systems iteratively without generating  or  or their inverse matrices or any approximation of these matrices. Legarra A  Aguilar I  Misztal I.

Our results show that different demographic patterns such as genetic isolation and cross-breeding have shaped the genomic diversity of Swedish native cattle breeds and that the Swedish mountain breeds have retained their authentic distinct gene pool without significant contribution from any of the other European cattle breeds that were included in this study. Based on the type of livestock management  European cattle breeds can be broadly categorized into either commercial or traditional/native cattle. Commercial cattle breeds are mainly used in intensive animal farming  which aims at maximizing the overall production and economic profit  with a few popular breeds being disseminated throughout the world [  ]. In contrast  traditional cattle breeds have a long history of adaptation to their respective environments []. Whereas commercial cattle far exceed the traditional cattle breeds in terms of milk and meat production  the latter breeds have great cultural value  are often adapted to the environment and climate conditions in which they are bred  and sometimes display a few superior production or functional traits compared with commercial cattle. For instance  Fjäll cattle produce milk with a superior protein composition that is particularly well-suited for cheese-making compared to commercial cattle such as Holstein-Friesian. In addition  a study  which compared the grazing pattern of Holstein-Friesian and Fjäll cattle in a grass-dominated pasture area  showed that the latter travelled over a larger area and had preferences towards diverse vegetation types [  ]. Thus  traditional/native cattle breeds can be valuable for grassland management with diverse vegetation. In a recent FAO report []  many cattle breeds were classified “at risk”. It should be noted that this classification was based only on a fraction of all the native breeds that currently exist worldwide. The diversity status of about 50% of all cattle breeds globally  is currently unknown  and therefore proper conservation strategies cannot be designed for these breeds. Advancement in affordable high-throughput genotyping techniques has made it possible to genotype a large number of molecular markers  i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  at a reasonable cost. Therefore  it is now feasible to infer the population history and diversity status of breeds for which only scant recorded information is available. In fact  many recent studies have used a relatively large number of SNPs to explore the genetic diversity  demographic history  and relatedness between different traditional Eurasian cattle breeds [     ]. For example  based on 30 000 SNPs  Mastrangelo and colleagues [] reported the patterns of gene-flow between different Italian native cattle breeds and detected recent inbreeding in several of them. In Sweden  the old local bovine breeds predominated until the twentieth century  although importation of some cattle from the Netherlands was documented as early as the sixteenth century []. For example  approximately 400 000 Fjäll individuals were raised in the north and middle parts of Sweden by the end of the nineteenth century []. With more efficient breeding schemes  targeted use of artificial insemination (AI) bulls  and competition from other breeds  the number of individuals from local breeds decreased rapidly. For instance  the Swedish Red Polled breed counted about 30 000 individuals in the 1930’s  but only 20 cows remained in 1979 []. During the more recent years  there has been an increasing interest for local breeds as a cultural and genetic resource and measures have been taken to preserve them. Swedish native cattle breeds display a large phenotypic diversity in terms of conformation- and production-related traits [  ]. For example  Fjäll cattle display a white coat color with black or brown spots  whereas most Swedish breeds such as Swedish Red  Swedish Red Polled  and Ringamåla cattle  display a solid/spotted red coat color. Another example is the large fraction of individuals that display polledness in Fjäll  Bohus Polled and Swedish Red Polled cattle breeds (for more detailed information  see Additional file : Table S1). In addition  many of these breeds have inhabited these local regions for many generations and may harbor unique gene variants that underlie adaptation to the local climate. Thus  these traditional cattle breeds are important resources for future breeding programs that focus on novel/alternate breeding goals. While many studies have investigated the patterns of the genetic diversity and structure in traditional European cattle breeds [    ]  to the best of our knowledge  there are only a few studies [     ] on Swedish native cattle breeds. Moreover  these studies included only a small number of Swedish cattle breeds and used either mitochondrial or microsatellite markers. In our study  we genotyped about<U+2009>~<U+2009>140 000 SNPs in 143 bovine samples that represent all the nine native cattle breeds from different parts of Sweden. We carried out standard population genetic analyses that use either independent SNPs or haplotypes with the aim to explore the genetic diversity  demography and relatedness among all the native Swedish cattle breeds defined by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. We genotyped samples from 147 individuals that represented nine Swedish cattle breeds (Fig.  and Table ): 145 samples were obtained from a collection of frozen samples kept in the Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences  i.e. old frozen blood samples  semen samples and DNA samples from 35  51 and 59 individuals  respectively; and nasal swabs were sampled from two additional individuals in 2017. All analysed samples were from animals that were born from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s  except for one Swedish Red polled individual born in 2016. When available  we used information about the farm of origin and pedigree to select animals from various locations and to avoid including very close relatives such as full-sibs or parents and offspring. For DNA extraction from blood samples  we used either a salt-extraction-based method [] or a QIAsymphony automated platform (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantified and quality-controlled using either the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen™ dsDNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific  Waltham  MA  USA) or a NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). A map of Sweden indicating the approximate geographic origin of the analysed Swedish cattle breeds. Important locations where remaining animals of local breeds were found are marked (star<U+2009>=<U+2009>Fjällnära  diamond<U+2009>=<U+2009>Bohus Polled  triangle<U+2009>=<U+2009>Väne  square<U+2009>=<U+2009>Ringamåla). Some of the breeds originated from a wider geographic area: the Fjäll breed from northern Sweden  the Swedish Red Polled from middle Sweden  the Swedish Red from south middle to southern Sweden  and the Swedish Holstein-Friesian from southern Sweden. The Swedish Polled cattle shares ancestry with the Swedish Red Polled and Fjäll breeds DNA samples from the 147 individuals were genotyped using the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler High-Density Bovine 150 K (GGP HD150K) array  with an average SNP spacing of about 19 kb. Genotypes were called using the GenomeStudio software (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA) and two samples with a genotyping rate lower than 95% were discarded from the dataset. Furthermore  analysis of the pedigrees revealed that two samples had a foreign origin and were excluded from the dataset. A bash script was used to convert the Illumina genotypes report file to plink-file —“ped” and “map”—format. To ensure that only high-quality SNPs were included in the dataset  we excluded SNPs that were assigned to sex chromosomes and unassembled contigs  SNPs with missing genotypes in more than 5% individuals  and SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05. All quality-filtering steps were carried out using PLINK 1.9 []. Filtering based on Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was not applied since several of the studied breeds were small and likely sub-structured and influenced by inbreeding and genetic drift. Thus  we expected that there would be deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg proportions. To assess the genetic diversity in each breed  we used the R package  [] to estimate the average observed heterozygosity (H) and the average expected heterozygosity (H). We also estimated the levels of runs of homozygosity (ROH)  which are long stretches of identical-by-descent (IBD) homozygous genotypes that can provide valuable insight into recent and past demography of a population []. For ROH estimation  we used PLINK (v. 1.9) with default settings except that we allowed only two missing genotypes per window of 50 SNPs (–-- 2)  two heterozygous SNPs along the entire ROH segment (–- 2)  and one or more SNPs per 80 kb region (–- 80). In addition  the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay between pairwise SNPs was generated for the breeds for which the sample included more than eight individuals to supplement the demographic pattern that was inferred based on ROH. For this purpose  we used SNeP [] to calculate pairwise r values between pairs of SNPs located within 2-Mb windows [  ]. To assess population structure among the nine Swedish native cattle breeds  first we used three approaches that consider individual SNPs: (1) principal component analysis (PCA)  (2) admixture analysis  and (3)  and construction of the maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic tree. To perform PCA  the “bed” format of PLINK was converted into “gds” format using the “gdsfmat” package before applying the “” function of the SNPrelate package [  ]. ADMIXTURE [] was carried out for population cluster analysis  with K-values ranging from 2 to 9. Prior to the ADMIXTURE analysis  LD pruning was performed using the “— function in PLINK (v 1.9) to reduce the overall pairwise LD to less than 0.15. The output from ADMIXTURE was visualized using the python package PONG []. Pairwise  distance was calculated using the “staMPP” R package []. A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was constructed from the  distance matrix using the “phangorn” R package []. We also generated a maximum likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic tree using the “Treemix” software []. Finally  the genetic structure/clustering pattern was assessed using the algorithm implemented in CHROMOPAINTER and fineSTRUCTURE []. Because these algorithms take phased data as input  we used Beagle 4.1 [] to phase the genotypes of each chromosome  separately. The underlying algorithm in CHROMOPAINTER considers the pattern of LD and the underlying recombination process along the markers to reconstruct each haplotype of a recipient individual as a series of chunks from the other “donor” individuals. As recommended by []  first we used the “fs” pipeline to calculate the nuisance parameters: n (similar to effective population size) and M (population mutation rate). The inferred values of these parameters were fixed in CHROMOPAINTER to obtain the ChromoPainter coancestry matrix (count matrix as well as length matrix) that measures the shared haplotypes between samples across the genome. Using the count matrix (number of chunks)  which represents the number of haplotypic chunks copied among all individuals  we ran a fineSTRUCTURE analysis to cluster the samples into genetically homogeneous groups. Note that we ran this entire analysis in parallel using fineSTRUCTURE v4 (version 4). To investigate the relationships between the Swedish native cattle breeds and other European cattle breeds  we recovered bovine SNP genotyping array data for various European cattle breeds previously reported [     ] from the web-interfaced genetic Diversity Exploration (WIDDE) database []  and merged these data with the TOP alleles using PLINK (v. 1.9) []. In addition  we included genotyping data for an indicine cattle breed  i.e. Gir  because it was used as an outgroup in the phylogenetic analysis. To have a sample size per breed similar to that of the Swedish cattle breeds genotyped in our study  we retained only 24 samples per breed in the analysis. In a later step  we merged these samples with the Swedish cattle samples into a combined dataset that was filtered by applying the following parameters in PLINK (v. 1.9): – 0.9  – 0.05  – 0.05. Sample information for the final merged dataset that was used for the downstream analysis is in Additional file : Table S2. We carried out the PCA  admixture  and phylogenetic analyses by using exactly the same pipeline as described previously in this “” section. After applying the filtering criteria  the final dataset for the Swedish native breeds consisted of 143 samples and 111 914 SNPs. The genetic diversity summary statistics are in Table . A majority of the Swedish native cattle breeds displayed a high proportion of polymorphic loci (P)  ranging from 0.7981 in Väne to 0.9736 in Swedish Holstein-Friesian. This indicates that the SNPs selected for the GGD HD150K array are highly informative for Swedish cattle breeds. Similarly  the expected heterozygosity (H) is relatively high with values ranging from 0.3041 in the Väne breed to 0.3883 in the Swedish Holstein-Friesian breed. Demographic inferences in Swedish cattle breeds were made based on the analyses of ROH and LD decay. The ROH profile (ROH count and cumulative ROH length) varied a lot both between and within the Swedish cattle breeds (Fig. a and see Additional file : Table S3). In Fjällnära  the ROH count and cumulative ROH length ranged from 8 to 78  and from ~<U+2009>6 Mb to ~<U+2009>1.3 Gb  respectively. In Swedish Holstein-Friesian  ROH count ranged from 2 to 31  and cumulative ROH length ranged from ~<U+2009>6 Mb to ~<U+2009>295 Mb  while the corresponding numbers in Fjäll were 1 to 45  and ~<U+2009>4.5 Mb to ~<U+2009>310 Mb  respectively. These results indicate relatively large/diverse ancestral populations for Swedish Holstein-Friesian and Fjäll breeds. Swedish Red Polled individuals also displayed a large variation in ROH profile (ROH count ranged from 1 to 74  and cumulative ROH length ranged from ~<U+2009>4.3 Mb to ~<U+2009>1.3 Gb). Moreover  the cumulative ROH size of some Swedish Red Polled individuals (such as Individual SRP5 and SRP 8) was similar to that of other individuals (such as VAC7 and RMC13)  but with lower ROH counts (see Additional file : Table S3)  which indicates that some mating has occurred between closely related individuals. Conversely  Väne and Ringamåla cattle display relatively large ROH counts and cumulative ROH size  which indicates genetic isolation and a relatively small founder population. As expected  inferences that are drawn based on the pattern of pairwise LD decay (Fig. b) are consistent with those from ROH profiles. For example  for the Ringamåla and Väne breeds  we inferred a low level of haplotype diversity since they have the highest r values at all pairwise SNP distances and an overall slow LD decay. For the Fjäll  Swedish Holstein-Friesian and Swedish Red breeds  we inferred a wide haplotype diversity since they have the lowest r value at all pairwise SNP distances and a rapid LD decay.  ROH profile of Swedish cattle breeds  where each circle represents an individual and  linkage disequilibrium decay in four Swedish cattle breeds for which the sample size was larger than 8 To assess the genetic relationships among the Swedish native cattle breeds  first we performed a PCA. The first principal component (EV1)  which explains 5.76% of the total variance  clearly separated the Fjäll  Swedish Polled  Fjällnära and Bohus Polled breeds from the Swedish Red  Väne and Ringamåla breeds. The second principal component (EV2)  which explains 3.03% of the total variance  separated the Swedish Holstein-Friesian breed from the cluster of native Swedish cattle breeds. Furthermore  among the native Swedish cattle breeds  Swedish Red Polled (which occupies the central position in the plot) and Väne clearly form separate clusters (Fig. a)  whereas the Fjällnära samples are dispersed across the plot  which indicates either sub-structure or large variability within the population. Moreover  the genetic differentiation between Fjäll  Swedish Polled and Bohus Polled cattle  and that between Ringamåla and Swedish Red cattle are low. Genetic relatedness among the Swedish cattle breeds using:  principal component analysis   F-based phylogenetic tree  and  maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree The NJ-tree constructed based on  (Fig. b and see Additional file : Figure S1)  and the ML-based phylogenetic tree (Fig. c) are in agreement with the patterns identified by using PCA (Fig. a). In general  these phylogenetic trees divide the Swedish native cattle breeds into two clusters: one cluster that comprises the Swedish Mountain cattle breeds  i.e. Fjäll  Swedish Polled  Fjällnära and Bohus Polled  and one cluster that includes the southern Swedish cattle breeds with horns—Swedish Red  Väne and Ringamåla. In particular  these trees also suggest close relationships between the Bohus Polled and Fjäll breeds  and between the Ringamåla and Swedish Red breeds. Moreover  the long branch observed for Väne cattle indicates considerable genetic drift/divergence. Interestingly  similar to the PCA pattern  the Swedish Red Polled breed displays an ambiguous clustering pattern  i.e. in the ML-based phylogenetic tree (Fig. c)  it does not cluster with any of the Swedish cattle breeds  whereas in the -based phylogenetic tree  it forms a sister clade with the cluster of Swedish mountain cattle breeds. The clustering pattern (Fig. ) based on shared ancestry that was inferred from the ADMIXTURE analysis also indicates a first split (at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) between the Swedish mountain breeds (Fjäll  Swedish Polled  Fjällnära  and Bohus Polled) and the southern Swedish breeds (Swedish Red  Väne and Ringamåla). Conditioning the ancestral population to K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 separate the Swedish Holstein-Friesian breed from the clusters of native Swedish cattle breeds  and at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4  the Väne breed form a separate cluster. Starting from a K value of 5  we observe sub-structures within the Fjällnära breed. Furthermore  at all K values  the Ringamåla and Swedish Red breeds share a remarkably similar distribution of genetic variation. Likewise  Fjäll  Swedish Polled and Bohus Polled cattle also show a similar distribution of genetic variation  which indicates ancestral relatedness. It is worth noting that Swedish Red Polled cattle display a mosaic of ancestries between K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 to 5 but forms a separate cluster at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>6. Model-based clustering of Swedish cattle breeds based on the estimated membership fraction of individuals Haplotype sharing analysis by using ChromoPainter and fineStructure reveals a pattern (Fig. ) that not only reinforces the findings of all our previous analyses but also refines the clustering pattern of the Swedish native cattle breeds. In particular  these results helped to characterize in more detail the low differentiation between the Swedish mountain cattle breeds. In particular  we observed a low differentiation between Fjäll and Swedish Polled cattle. Interestingly  refined investigation of the Fjällnära individuals revealed four sub-clusters  which correspond to the farms from which the sampled individuals had their ancestries. Furthermore  similar to our previous analyses  the Ringamåla  Swedish Red  and Väne breeds are loosely included in the same cluster. However  Ringamåla and Swedish Red seem to be genetically closer to each other than to Väne. The Swedish Red Polled and Swedish Holstein-Friesian breeds seem to cluster together  but based on the  and PCA analyses  we hypothesize that this is due to the clustering of two other groups (Swedish mountain and southern Swedish breeds). fineSTRUCTURE-based phylogenetic tree. The intensity of colours indicates the number of shared haplotypic chunks. The asterisk (*) indicates low differentiation between Swedish Polled cattle and Fjäll cattle We investigated the relationships between Swedish cattle breeds and other European cattle breeds through analyses based on PCA  ADMIXTURE  and phylogenetic trees. The other European cattle breeds mainly originated from north-western Europe  and Norway (see Additional file : Table S2). In PCA  the first principal component  which explains 6.25% of the total variance  separated the Jersey breed from all the others (Fig. a). This can be attributed to the fact that the Jersey breed has remained genetically isolated for many generations. The second principal component (PC2) separated “red-coloured” cattle breeds (Swedish Red  Ringamåla  Väne and Norwegian Red) from the remaining breeds. As expected  the Swedish Holstein-Friesian individuals cluster with the Dutch cattle breeds. The clustering of “red-coloured” cattle breeds and of the Holstein-Friesian-derived breeds is also observed in the phylogenetic trees (Figs. c and b). Interestingly  we did not identify any historical relatedness between the Swedish mountain cattle breeds and the European cattle breeds studied here  which probably means that their contribution was not significant. Genetic relationships between the Swedish cattle breeds and several European cattle breeds using:  principal component analysis and  model-based clustering of different European cattle breeds based on the estimated membership fraction of individuals Rare native cattle breeds are vulnerable and represent important genetic resources since they harbour unique gene pools that result from long-term adaptation to the local environment. Because most of these breeds have not been under intense selection for production traits  they may carry more diverse alleles than their commercial counterparts. For example  based on a high-density genome-wide SNP analysis  Herrero-Medrano et al. [] identified about 100 non-synonymous polymorphisms that were nearly fixed in commercial breeds whereas  at these same positions  a relatively high frequency of alternative alleles was found in local cattle breeds. Therefore  conservation of local cattle breeds is necessary to preserve these diverse gene pools. However  the development of optimal conservation strategies requires sufficient knowledge about the genetic diversity and population structure of a breed. To achieve this objective in the case of native Swedish cattle breeds  we genotyped nine Swedish cattle breeds with about 140 000 SNPs and analyzed the data using standard techniques of population genetics. Our results suggest varying degrees of genetic diversity and historical relatedness among the Swedish cattle breeds. The relatively high average expected heterozygosity and proportion of polymorphic SNPs among the Swedish cattle breeds (Table ) indicate that the SNPs selected on the GGP HD150K array are polymorphic in these breeds. SNPs on this same 150 K array were also found to be highly polymorphic in Russian cattle breeds []. However  the possibility of ascertainment bias cannot be ruled out since we observed the largest proportion of polymorphic markers in Swedish Holstein-Friesian  which has a history of recent cross-breeding with Dutch dairy cattle breeds. The overall summary statistics (P and H) indicate low genetic diversity in the Väne  Bohus Polled and Ringamåla breeds. Inferences drawn based on ROH pattern and LD-decay (Fig. ) provide further insight into the demographic changes that led to the low level of genetic diversity in these breeds. Ringamåla and Väne cattle display an overall large ROH count and cumulative length as well as the highest r values across the entire pairwise distances up to 2 Mb. These patterns indicate high autozygosity in the genome of Ringamåla and Väne individuals  which can be attributed to small founder populations that result in ancestral relatedness and lack of gene flow from distantly related populations due to isolation. These inferences are consistent with the known recorded history for these breeds (see Additional file : Table S1)  which have been maintained isolated from the other Swedish dairy breeds for a long time and have very small-sized populations (see Additional file : Table S1) [  ]. Interestingly  the relationship between ROH count and cumulative length (Fig. a) in the Ringamåla and Väne breeds is similar to the trend observed for other breeds  which indicates a low frequency of long ROH. Long ROH are often the consequence of consanguineous mating resulting in a low-level recombination since there has not been enough time to break the haplotypes. Therefore  a low frequency of long ROH is an indication that the breeding management of Ringamåla and Väne cattle succeeded in avoiding mating between closely-related individuals. The overall summary statistics  i.e. P  and H (Table ) indicate a relatively high genetic diversity in the Fjäll and Swedish Red breeds. Furthermore  these breeds also display relatively small ROH counts and cumulative lengths as well as rapid LD-decay (Fig. )  which is an indication of high haplotype diversity in these populations. Before the beginning of the twentieth century  Fjäll cattle had a large population size and were phenotypically diverse [  ]  but thereafter the effective population size of the breed declined until the end of the twentieth century because as intensive farming developed  other breeds were preferred. Our results suggest that in spite of this reduction in population size  the genetic diversity of the Fjäll breed is still significant  probably as a result of using distantly related purebred individuals in breeding programs. The high genetic diversity in the Swedish Red breed can be attributed to the fact that its gene pool has been influenced by the introduction of other Nordic red cattle breeds. Indeed  our analyses (Fig. a  b) revealed that the Swedish Red and Norwegian Red breeds cluster together. The large variation in ROH profile found for the Fjällnära breed may be related to sub-structuring in the population that we identified using ADMIXTURE and fineStructure analyses (Figs.  and ). Moreover  unlike for the Fjäll breed  several Fjällnära individuals display an abundance of ROH counts and a large portion of their genome in ROH  which indicate that mating between closely-related individuals occurred rather frequently. The clustering pattern of the Swedish cattle breeds (Figs.    and ) is in concordance with their known history (see Additional file : Table S1). Based on their shared ancestry  we identified two major clusters within the Swedish cattle breeds studied here. Low differentiation between the Fjäll  Bohus Polled  and Swedish Polled breeds in the first cluster was observed in all the analyses (Figs.    and ). Indeed  the Swedish Polled breed was formed in 1938 by merging Swedish Red Polled and Fjäll cattle []. Although the two original breeds were crossbred several times  purebred groups of each breed were also maintained. Swedish Red Polled and Fjäll cattle became separate breeds again in 1984 and in 1995  respectively; however  Swedish Polled cattle persists as a separate breed. Attempts have been made to improve the production of Swedish Polled cattle by crossbreeding with commercial cattle breeds. Bohus Polled cattle originates from the south-western part of Sweden (Fig. ) and it is phenotypically similar to Fjäll cattle. Moreover  the use of semen from Fjäll bulls in Bohus Polled cattle has also been documented. Earlier studies [  ] based on analyses with microsatellite markers in northern European cattle  also assigned the Bohus Polled breed to the cluster that includes the Fjäll and Fjällnära breeds. Similarly  the Fjällnära breed was recognized as a subpopulation of Fjäll cattle that has not been intensively selected for milk production. Interestingly  we also identified sub-structures within the Fjällnära population using ADMIXTURE and fineStructure based analyses (Figs.  and )  which correspond to the farms from which these sampled individuals have their ancestry. The second cluster (Figs.    and ) includes the Ringamåla  Swedish Red and Väne breeds. The Ringamåla breed  which originates from southern Sweden (Fig. ) shares some resemblance with the Swedish Red breed  and it has been suggested that these two breeds share some ancestry []. In addition  the clustering pattern (Fig. ) inferred from the fineStructure-based analysis indicated a low differentiation between the Swedish Red and Ringamåla breeds. Based on ADMIXTURE and fineStructure analyses  we also observed two sub-structures in the Ringamåla population  which suggests that the origin of the samples studied could come from different farms. Based on PCA (Fig. ) and ADMIXTURE analyses (Fig. )  we conclude that Väne is the most diverged breed in this cluster  possibly as a result of drift due to genetic isolation. Swedish Red Polled occupies an intermediate/central position on the PCA plot (Fig. a)  and shows an ambiguous clustering pattern (Figs. b  c)  and some within-breed sub-structuring based on the fineStructure analysis (Fig. ). Genetic comparison of Swedish cattle breeds with other European cattle breeds revealed that native southern Swedish breeds—particularly Swedish Red and Ringamåla cattle— seem to have been influenced by Nordic red cattle breeds (Fig. a and see Additional file : Figure S1). Similarly  our analyses also confirmed the historical relatedness between Swedish Holstein-Friesian and Dutch cattle breeds. Interestingly  none of the Swedish mountain cattle breeds displayed genetic proximity to any of the European cattle breeds included in our comparison  which indicates that non-indigenous cattle breeds have had little genetic influence on the Swedish mountain cattle breeds. However  it is necessary to genotype a much larger number of individuals from Norwegian or Finnish cattle breeds to investigate comprehensively the genetic relatedness between different Nordic cattle breeds. To conclude  we provide the first detailed analysis of the genetic relatedness and diversity of all Swedish native cattle breeds under the auspice of the Swedish Board of Agriculture. Our findings will aid in the conservation management of these breeds and demonstrate that the magnitude of the genetic drift in some Swedish cattle breeds (such as Väne and Ringamåla) is relatively large  and thus  they require special attention for conservation. Moreover  we also show that the Swedish Mountain cattle breeds (including Fjällnära) are unique in that they have maintained authentic local ancestry. Future studies should aim at genotyping a larger number of individuals using high-density genome-wide SNP arrays or whole-genome sequencing approaches  to help identify the genetic factors involved in their adaptive potential.

Accounting for dominance effects in genetic evaluations is easier in a genomic context  than in a classical pedigree-based context because the combinations of alleles at loci are known. The objective of our study was two-fold. First  dominance variance components were estimated for age at 100 kg (AGE)  backfat depth (BD) at 140 days  and for average piglet weight at birth within litter (APWL). Second  the efficiency of mate allocation strategies that account for dominance and inbreeding depression to maximize the overall genetic merit of future offspring was explored.ResultsGenetic variance components were estimated using genomic models that included inbreeding depression with and without non-additive genetic effects (dominance). Models that included dominance effects did not fit the data better than the genomic additive model. Estimates of dominance variances  expressed as a percentage of additive genetic variance  were 20  11  and 12% for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. Estimates of additive and dominance single nucleotide polymorphism effects were retrieved from the genetic variance component estimates and used to predict the outcome of matings in terms of total genetic and breeding values.

Accounting for dominance effects in genetic evaluations is easier in a genomic context  than in a classical pedigree-based context because the combinations of alleles at loci are known. The objective of our study was two-fold. First  dominance variance components were estimated for age at 100 kg (AGE)  backfat depth (BD) at 140 days  and for average piglet weight at birth within litter (APWL). Second  the efficiency of mate allocation strategies that account for dominance and inbreeding depression to maximize the overall genetic merit of future offspring was explored. Genetic variance components were estimated using genomic models that included inbreeding depression with and without non-additive genetic effects (dominance). Models that included dominance effects did not fit the data better than the genomic additive model. Estimates of dominance variances  expressed as a percentage of additive genetic variance  were 20  11  and 12% for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. Estimates of additive and dominance single nucleotide polymorphism effects were retrieved from the genetic variance component estimates and used to predict the outcome of matings in terms of total genetic and breeding values. Maximizing total genetic values instead of breeding values in matings gave the progeny an average advantage of -<U+2009>0.79 days  -<U+2009>0.04 mm  and 11.3 g for AGE  BD and APWL  respectively  but slightly reduced the expected additive genetic gain  e.g. by 1.8% for AGE. Genomic mate allocation accounting for non-additive genetic effects is a feasible and potential strategy to improve the performance of the offspring without dramatically compromising additive genetic gain. Mate allocation has been used in animal breeding schemes mainly to control inbreeding but also to increase connectedness among herds  to preserve genetic diversity  and to exploit dominance [   ]. The total genetic merit of future progeny can be maximized by selecting pairs of mates to better exploit dominance  especially in crossbreeding programs (across breeds)  but also within a population [  ]. In the classical pedigree context  obtaining accurate estimates of dominance effects is difficult because it requires large groups of individuals with dominance relationships (the probability of identical genotypes of two individuals at a locus)  such as full-sibs  and also because estimations are computationally demanding [  ]. With the availability of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels and large numbers of genotyped animals  genomic selection has improved the efficiency of animal breeding programs  essentially by reducing generation intervals and improving prediction accuracies of breeding values of difficult-to-measure and lowly heritable traits []. Accounting for dominance effects in a GBLUP (genomic best linear unbiased prediction) framework is easier than in a classical pedigree-based context because  instead of probabilities of identical genotypes  we have observations of heterozygous states at SNPs across the genome []. Thus  the availability of genomic information has renewed interest in non-additive genetic effects. Genomic models that include dominance have been implemented in several livestock populations  including dairy cattle  pigs  sheep  and layer chickens [      ]. The inclusion of dominance in genetic evaluation models has allowed the quantification of the magnitude of non-additive genetic effects and determination of the genetic structure of traits. In general  inclusion of dominance effects in genomic prediction models did not increase the accuracy of estimates of breeding values [] but may be important for implementing mate allocation strategies to exploit non-additive genetic effects [    ]. Mate allocation strategies are based on the idea that  although selection should be based on estimated breeding values (heritable effects)  the animals used for commercial purposes can be the product of planned matings that maximize the total genetic merit (additive plus dominance effects) of the offspring []. Mate allocation accounting for dominance increased progeny performance in one simulated population [] and when based on dairy cattle data [  ]. In pig breeding schemes  although the goal is to improve crossbreed performance (for commercial production)  selection is traditionally performed within purebreds [  ]. Pig breeding schemes could benefit from mate allocation strategies and secure additional profit from across- and within-breed dominance variation []. In pigs  estimates of dominance variance based on pedigree-based estimation ranged from 11% of the additive genetic variance for backfat to 78% for litter weight at 21 days []. The large magnitude of these estimates suggests a potential gain in total genetic merit if matings are allocated to exploit dominance. The aim of this study was twofold. First  the dominance variance for age at 100 kg  backfat depth at 140 days  and average piglet weight at birth within litter was estimated in Landrace pigs. Second  mate allocation strategies that focus on maximizing either the average breeding value or the average total genetic value for prospective progeny were compared. Data were provided by a collective French Landrace pig program led by the breeding companies NUCLEUS (Le Rheu  France) and AXIOM (Azay-sur-Indre  France). Animal Care and Use Committee approval was not requested for this study because the data used were routinely collected data according to standard practices in breeding herds. Performances recorded in their selection herds and test stations are centralized to perform common genetic evaluations. The main selection objective of the collective program is the improvement of reproductive criteria. However  improving growth and feed efficiency traits without impairing carcass composition and meat quality is also considered in the breeding goal []. The Landrace breed is renowned for its high prolificacy  excellent maternal instinct  and milking abilities. It has also good rusticity  fattening performance  and meat quality and carcass composition characteristics []. Data on age at 100 kg (AGE)  backfat depth (BD) at 140 days  and average piglet weight at birth within litter (APWL) were analyzed. Performances were recorded in breeding herds at around 100 kg live weight for AGE and BD. Backfat depth was measured ultrasonically at the shoulder  last rib and hip joint on each side of the animal (4 cm from the mid-dorsal spine line) and an average BD was calculated for each animal using these six measurements. AGE and BD were adjusted to a 100 kg live weight; AGE was adjusted to 100 kg based on individual age () and weight () at the test  and mean age () and weight () of the batch as:   with  equal to 1.05 and 1.125 for males and females  respectively; BD was adjusted to 100 kg as:   with  equal to 0.1 and 0.12 for males and females  respectively. APWL was considered as a sow trait and was the average of individual birth weights of piglets. It was recorded for each litter  with an average of 2.7 parities per sow. Only Landrace animals with genotypes were included in the analysis. Average performance and number of animals and records used for analyses of the three traits are in Table . Pedigrees were extracted from the collective French Landrace pig program and included all available ancestors of the genotyped animals in the datasets. Three generations were traced back from the pedigree for each trait  resulting in 5534  6541  and 3331 animals for AGE  BD and APWL  respectively. Two medium-density panels were used for genotyping: the porcine SNP60 Illumina BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA) and the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler HD 80 k (GeneSeek  Licoln  NE)  on 98% and 2% of the genotyped animals  respectively. SNPs with a call rate lower than 0.98  a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05  and deviating from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) were removed. Six animals with a call rate lower than 0.98 were discarded. Three offspring that displayed Mendelian inconsistencies with their parents were removed. After quality control  39 353 SNPs that were in common between the two panels were retained for analyses and used to build the genomic relationship matrices. Three linear mixed models (one pedigree-based and two genomic-based models) were used to estimate variance components for each trait. The first model (model A) was a classical additive genetic model in which the genetic relationship matrix was computed based on pedigree information from genotyped animals (a sample of the French Landrace population). The genomic models included either additive genetic effects (model G) or additive and dominance genetic effects (model GD). The two genomic models included a genomic inbreeding depression parameter and were implemented using a GBLUP framework. Fixed effects for AGE were the combination of farm-year-sex (68 levels) and the covariate of birth weight. Fixed effects for BD included the combination of farm-year-sex (90 levels)  parity of the dam (6 levels)  and litter size as a covariate. The APWL trait included farrowing batch (283 levels) and parity of the dam (6 levels) as fixed effects and an animal permanent environmental random effect (1226 sows). In matrix notation  model G can be represented as follows: where  is the vector of phenotypes of a trait;  is the vector of fixed effects;  is the vector of genomic inbreeding coefficients  calculated as the proportion of homozygous SNP genotypes for each animal  and  is the inbreeding depression parameter;  is the vector of additive genetic effects (i.e. breeding values);  is the vector of random permanent environmental effects specific to APWL ; and  is the vector of residual effects . Breeding values were assumed distributed as   where  is the additive genomic relationship matrix (model G). The incidence matrix  relates observations to fixed effects  and  is the incidence matrix for breeding values and permanent environmental random effects. Model A did not include the inbreeding depression parameter and breeding values were assumed distributed as   where  is the additive pedigree-based relationship matrix. Parameters     and  refer to permanent environmental  additive genetic  and residual variances  respectively. The additive genomic relationship matrix was calculated according to VanRaden [] as: where  is a matrix with dimensions of number of animals  by number of SNPs   with elements equal to    and   for genotypes    and  respectively;  is the frequency of allele  of the  SNP (with )  and . Elements of  for missing SNP genotypes were set to the average of the population. Model GD is an expansion of model G  which takes dominance genetic effects into account: where  is the vector of random dominance deviation effects  assumed distributed as   where  is the variance of dominance deviations. The dominance genomic relationship matrix  was built as in Vitezica et al. []: where  has the same dimension as   with elements equal to    and  for the    and  genotypes  respectively. Elements of  for missing SNP genotypes were set to the average of the population. Matrices  and  were scaled in order to improve numerical stability as   and   where  is the identity matrix. Genomic inbreeding was used to account for directional dominance [  ] by including it as a covariate in the model to obtain the correct estimate of dominance variance [  ]. Variance components for the three models described above were estimated by EM-REML with the  software []  which is available at . Asymptotic standard errors of variance components and variance proportion estimates were obtained as in Houle and Meyer []. The three models were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) []. The model with the minimum AIC value was considered as the best model to fit the data. Marker effects were estimated by using a BLUP-SNP model that assumes that the variance components estimated above are known parameters ( software available at   Legarra et al. []). This marker-level model (in contrast to the previous animal-level models) is represented as follows: where  and  are random vectors of additive and dominance marker effects  respectively  and all other terms are as described for the animal-level models. Xiang et al. [] proved analytically that inclusion of genomic inbreeding in genetic models accounts for directional dominance and inbreeding depression. The vector of dominance marker effects was defined as   where   which makes . Incidence matrices  and  relate data to additive and dominance marker effects  respectively  and they are coded as 1  0 and -<U+2009>1 for additive effects and as 0  1 and 0 for dominance effects of the three SNP genotypes    and   respectively. Variances of the vectors of additive and dominance effects are  and   where  is the identity matrix  and  and  are the variances of additive and dominance SNP effects  respectively. Variance components at the marker level ( and ) were obtained from genetic variance components [] that were estimated by EM-REML with model GD ( and )  as follows: After estimating the SNP effects  and   estimates of the marker dominance effects were recovered as   where  is the inbreeding depression parameter estimated in this model and  is the number of SNPs []. From the estimates of additive and dominance SNP effects  the total genetic value  of the progeny from a mating between the th boar and th sow  was predicted following Toro and Varona [] as: where    and  are the probabilities of genotypes    and  from the progeny of the mating between the th and the th individuals at the th SNP  and  and  are the additive and dominance estimated effects of the th SNP. Analogously  the breeding value  of the progeny of the same mating was predicted as: where  is the allele substitution effect for the th SNP  calculated as  []. Missing genotypes were ignored and did not contribute to the prediction of progeny values. The total genetic and the breeding values of the progeny were computed for all potential matings between 120 boars  representing the number of boars that are selected per year  and all available genotyped sows for each trait. In total  789  1007 and 1446 males were available for AGE  BD  and APWL (Table )  respectively  of which the best 120 were selected based on their genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) based on the estimated SNP effects. For example  for BD  the total number of possible matings was 321 000 (120 boars<U+2009>×<U+2009>2675 sows). From all possible combinations  the best set of 600 matings was selected based either on the expected additive breeding value of the progeny  to maximize additive genetic gain of the expected progeny  equivalent to the traditional selection program for genetic improvement  or on the expected total genetic value of the progeny  to maximize total genetic gain of the expected progeny. The task of maximizing additive gain or total genetic gain of progeny was addressed via linear programming [] using the R []  package []. Two constraints were set for the optimization: (1) each boar could be mated to up to 15 sows and (2) each sow could not be mated to more than one boar. In this setting  optimization was done for both boars and sows. The total number of sows was always equal to the number of selected matings (600)  but the number of boars and their contribution to the progeny could differ depending on the mate allocation strategy. As a result  the objective function for the linear program  for instance for the total genetic value   was defined as: with constraint  for boar  and:  for sow   where  are binary decision variables  with 0 representing that the mating between boar  and sow  was not selected  and 1 that the mating was selected;  and  correspond to the number of boars (120) and sows (2179  2675  and 1226 for AGE  BD and APWL (Table )  respectively). In order to compare the results for these two mate allocation strategies (i.e. based on  or on )  differences between the mean  (or the mean ) of selected matings and the mean  (or the mean ) of all possible matings were calculated. These differences were called expected additive genetic gain () and expected total genetic superiority (). Table  shows the estimates of variance components  narrow-sense heritabilities and variance ratios that were obtained with the three models for the three traits under investigation. Our estimates of additive and dominance variances are presented in terms of breeding values and dominance deviations []. For AGE and BD  estimates of additive genetic variances were similar between the two genomic models (G and GD)  regardless of whether non-additive genetic effects (dominance and inbreeding) were included. Estimates of additive genetic variance obtained with model A differed to some extent from those obtained with the genomic models for AGE  and especially for BD. In all cases  standard errors of the estimates of additive variance were higher in model A than in the genomic models. Estimates of heritabilities for AGE and BD were lower when based on the genomic models compared to the pedigree-based model  but these differences were not significant. For APWL  estimates of heritability were consistent across the three models. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by dominance genetic effects were 5  2  and 4% for AGE  BD and APWL  respectively. The influence of dominance genetic effects was greater for AGE than for BD and APWL. In addition  AGE also had the highest ratio of dominance genetic variance to additive genetic variance (0.20)  while this ratio was similar for BD and APWL (0.11 and 0.12  respectively). When dominance was included in model GD for analyses of AGE and BD  a small reduction in residual variance was observed for both traits compared to model G. This means that most of the dominance variance was absorbed in the residual variance for these traits in model G. For APWL with model G  where a repeatability model was used  most of the dominance variance was included in the permanent environmental variance. The average proportion of homozygosity or genomic inbreeding per animal was 0.62 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015) in this Landrace population. Estimates of inbreeding depression (b)  expressed as the change in phenotypic mean per 10% increase in genomic inbreeding (standard error)  were equal to 4.29 (1.17) days  -<U+2009>0.01 (0.18) mm  and 42.38 (32.66) g for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. The impact of inbreeding was negative for AGE (i.e. inbred animals required more days to reach 100 kg)  negligible for BD  and positive for APWL  but not different from zero for BD and APWL. Table  shows the AIC value for each model. For all traits  genomic models fitted the data better than the pedigree-based model. The two genomic models had very similar AIC values for BD and APWL. For AGE  which was the trait with the highest ratio of dominance to additive variance  model GD fitted the data slightly better than model G but this improvement can be considered irrelevant. Selection in pigs aims at reducing age at 100 kg (AGE) and backfat depth (BD)  and increasing the average piglet weight at birth within litter (APWL). As expected  when matings were selected on the mean breeding value   40 boars and 600 sows were selected  i.e. those with the best GEBV. Thus  mate selection on  was equivalent to randomly mating males and females that were selected by standard truncation selection on GEBV. When the matings were selected on the mean total genetic value   most selected sows were the same as those selected when maximizing   with the number of sows in common between the selection strategies being equal to 560  583  and 590 out of 600 for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. The number of boars selected when maximizing  was equal to 56  44  and 55 for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. This indicates that different boars were contributing when mates were selected to optimize . The top 40 boars selected to maximize  were also selected when maximizing   but they contributed differently (i.e. they were mated to different numbers of sows) and they were mated with different sows. For example  for BD  38 boars reached the restriction of 15 sows per boar and these boars had the highest GEBV. The remaining six boars were mated to 14  6  6  2  1  and 1 sows. For AGE and APWL  32 and 34 boars  respectively  reached the restriction of 15 sows  and these boars had the highest GEBV as well. The mean  (or ) for all possible matings was -<U+2009>2.02 (-<U+2009>2.03) days  -<U+2009>0.35 (-<U+2009>0.35) mm  and 78.08 (78.08) g for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. The difference between the mean  (or ) of selected matings and the mean of all matings was called expected additive genetic gain () and expected total genetic superiority ()  respectively (Table ). The expected additive genetic gain and total genetic superiority that were obtained with the selected matings are presented for each mating strategy in Table . Note that negative values for AGE and BD are favorable  while a positive value is favorable for APWL. For all traits  the expected total genetic superiority ( in Table ) of the progeny was clearly higher when matings were selected based on  compared to on   giving the offspring an advantage of -<U+2009>0.79 days  -<U+2009>0.04 mm  and 11.34 g  for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. These advantages amounted to 0.20  0.07  and 0.09 genetic standard deviations (SD) for AGE  BD  and APWL  respectively. The expected additive genetic gains ( in Table ) were very similar when matings were selected on  or on  for BD (-<U+2009>0.58 SD) and APWL (0.49 SD)  but was slightly lower (1.8%) for AGE when matings were selected on total genetic value (-<U+2009>0.56 SD vs -<U+2009>0.55 SD). This indicates that selecting the candidates to maximize total genetic merit of progeny did not have a detrimental effect on the expected additive genetic gain for these traits. The consistency of the estimates of additive genetic variance across genomic models (G and GD) is attributed to the orthogonality of the models by using the classical parameterization in terms of breeding values and allele substitution effects proposed by Vitezica et al. []. The genomic models resulted in lower estimates of additive genetic variance for AGE and BD than the pedigree-based estimates  although the differences were not relevant for practical purposes. This was also observed in other studies in pigs [    ] and in dairy cattle []. For instance  estimates of genomic heritabilities were approximately half of those estimated with a pedigree-based model in a Duroc population [] and in a Landrace population []. Using different marker densities and sequences  Zang et al. [] attributed this difference to the so-called “missing heritability” (i.e. incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and markers)  the genetic architecture of the traits and genotype-by-environment interactions. In our study  the main reason for this reduction is that genotyped animals represented a small proportion of the population. For AGE  reported pedigree-based heritabilities for the French Landrace breed ranged from 0.23 to 0.36 [  ]  which are in agreement with our pedigree-based estimate of 0.33. To our knowledge  genomic estimates of heritability have not been published for Landrace or any other pig breed for this trait. The only comparable genomic estimate refers to lifetime daily gain  which was reported to be 0.27 by Lopes et al. [] in a Landrace pig population. Pedigree-based estimates of the heritability for backfat reported for the French Landrace breed ranged from 0.46 to 0.55 [  ] and the only reported genomic estimate in a Landrace population was 0.48 (see File S1 in additional information of Lopes et al. []). The heritabilities estimated for BD in our study are lower than those reported in the literature  which may be because the genotyped animals represented a small proportion of the animals in the population and/or because many causal variants for this trait are not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the SNPs that were used. Our heritability estimate for APWL was consistent with estimated in previous studies in the same French Landrace population using both genomic and pedigree-based models [  ]. Our estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by dominance effects (Table ) show that dominance effects contributed only slightly to the phenotypic expression of the traits investigated  and their contributions were lower than the contributions of additive genetic effects. A study in a Yorkshire pig population  using a pedigree-based model that accounted for dominance genetic effects and inbreeding depression  reported proportions of dominance to additive variance of 31 and 11% for days to 104.5 kg and backfat at 104.5 kg  respectively []. Our genomic estimate of the proportion of dominance to additive variance for BD (0.11) agrees with this estimate  but our estimate for AGE (20%) was smaller. There are no published genomic estimates of dominance variance for AGE and APWL in any pig breed. In the literature  estimates of dominance variance are reported based on models with or without inclusion of inbreeding as a covariate. When genomic inbreeding is not included in the model  the dominance variance estimate is inflated  as explained by Xiang et al. [] and supported by other studies [    ]. In our study  the ratio of dominance variance to additive variance was 0.11 for BD but estimates of 0.16 and 0.23 have been reported for backfat [] using models that ignored inbreeding. This phenomenon has also been observed in cattle [] for fertility and milk production traits. In our analyses  estimates of dominance variance were less accurate than estimates of additive variance  which is the case in most studies that estimate dominance effects (e.g. [    ]) possibly because of the low magnitude of this variance component  the reduced amount of data available  and the effect of the genotyping strategy. For instance  if only one or two piglets from each litter are genotyped  the proportion of full-sibs is small and  therefore  little dominance-specific information is available for the estimation [  ]. A larger number of genotyped individuals per litter allows the detection of identical genotypes among individuals and dominance relationships. The observed reduction of the permanent environmental variance when dominance was included in the genomic model GD  suggests that a large part of the dominance variance is confounded with the permanent environmental effects when dominance genetic effects are not accounted for. Similar results have also been observed in other studies in cattle [  ]. The dominance variance can also be confounded with common-litter effect which was not included in the model as fixed effect. The average  across animals  of the proportion of homozygosity or genomic inbreeding in our Landrace population was similar to that (0.69  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019) reported by Xiang et al. [] for a Danish Landrace pig population. Genomic estimates of the effect of inbreeding for these traits are scarce in the literature. One study in a Yorkshire pig population based on a pedigree model reported estimates of inbreeding depression of around 2.10 (days) and 0.00 (mm) per 10% inbreeding  for days to 104.5 kg and backfat at 104.5 kg  respectively []. Our results agree with the values reported in the literature for AGE and BD. Our estimate of the effect of inbreeding depression was positive for APWL  but not significantly different from zero. Genomic models fitted the data better than the pedigree-based model  probably because realized relationships among individuals are better captured by marker information. This is in agreement with previous findings (see e.g. de Los Campos et al. []). Differences in AIC between genomic models were small  which means that the inclusion of dominance effects did not significantly improve the goodness of fit of the data. This was in part because model G already included the inbreeding depression parameter  which improved the goodness of fit in a previous study []. Aliloo et al. [] also did not find a difference in goodness of fit between an additive genomic model with average heterozygosity (or inbreeding) and a model that accounted for additive and dominance genetic effects with average heterozygosity. Our results confirm that within-breed selection on  profits from dominance effects to maximize the total genetic value of the progeny (productive performance) without compromising the additive genetic gain (based on breeding values). These results are important since the additive genetic value is the genetic component that can be accumulated and inherited by subsequent generations. The negligible reduction in additive genetic gain can be attributed to the fact that almost the same sows and the best boars (based on GEBV) were selected in the matings to optimize  or . In addition  the number of selected boars was larger when selecting on  than when selecting on   which could result in a reduction in the overall inbreeding of the population. Nevertheless  the part of the total genetic gain that is attributable to non-additive genetic effects obtained from mate allocation disappears in subsequent generations  as demonstrated in a simulation by Toro and Varona []  because non-additive genetic effects depend on the specific allelic combinations that are present between the parents involved in a mating. Other studies on mate allocation accounting for non-additive genetic effects have also reported increases in total genetic merit compared to selecting on estimated breeding values only. Using simulation  Toro and Varona [] showed that mate allocation provides an additional selection response in expected progeny of up to 22% (assuming a narrow-sense heritability of 0.20 and a ratio of dominance to phenotypic variance of 0.10) over random mating. In dairy cattle  Sun et al. [] reported an increase in total genetic gain for milk yield of 9.8 and 7.6% for Holstein and Jersey cows  respectively  from doing mating allocation. Ertl et al. [] obtained an increase of 14.8 (milk yield) and 27.8% (protein yield) in expected total genetic superiority when matings were selected on  instead of   and  as in our results  only a slight reduction of 4.5% and 2.6% on additive genetic gain was observed. Aliloo et al. [] reported increases in expected total genetic superiority of 27  25  and 22% for milk  fat  and protein yield  respectively  in a Holstein population. Our results agree with those reported in the literature in the sense that a greater expected total genetic superiority can be obtained by including non-additive genetic effects to exploit dominance  with a slight or negligible reduction in expected additive genetic gain (1.8% for AGE and 0% for BD and APWL). The largest increase in total genetic gain was observed for AGE (0.20 genetic standard deviations)  which had the highest ratio of dominance to additive genetic variance (20%). This greater increase in total genetic gain with a higher ratio of dominance variance was also observed in previous studies that used mate allocation [  ]  except in []. Different mating design scenarios can be found in the literature. Ertl et al. [] and Aliloo et al. [] performed a pre-selection of bulls based on their estimated breeding values and only the selection and allocation of females were optimized based on the expected total genetic value of the offspring. This strategy minimizes loss of additive genetic gain since selection intensity is higher for males than for females. Nonetheless  pre-selection of bulls may preclude the opportunity to select other bulls that can potentially produce progeny with a higher total genetic merit when used in specific matings. In our study  optimization on  was made for both males and females  which provides more opportunity to choose matings that have a high total genetic merit in the progeny. To rule out the possibility that preselection of males based on the GEBV influenced our results  120 boars were chosen at random and included in the optimization process to select the best set of 600 matings for each mating strategy. Optimization based on  and  yielded similar responses in  (i.e. -<U+2009>2.93 vs. -<U+2009>2.91) but optimization based on  resulted in a higher  than optimization based on  (i.e. -<U+2009>3.70 vs. -<U+2009>2.90). These results confirm that the optimization of the offspring based on  is feasible without reducing   regardless of the preselection of males. Our results show that mate allocation strategies for boosting total genetic gain could benefit production levels in the sow herds without placing a cost on additive genetic progress. However  its implementation on a large scale would require some organizational changes  for instance  additional genotyping when not all females are genotyped and high computational costs. An alternative to additional genotyping is to take the maternal grand-sire SNP information into account  as was proposed by DeStefano and Hoeschele []. As stated above  genetic gain that is attributable to non-additive genetic effects is expressed in the immediate offspring and is not inherited in subsequent generations. Thus  selection and mating of parents that produce crossbred commercial animals are expected to benefit most from mating allocation strategies for improving total genetic gain in pig production schemes. We focused on single-trait selection but the use of mate allocation strategies can be extended to multiple traits by using an index as objective function to improve total genetic gain as in []. The feasibility and the success of mate allocation strategies in a multiple trait approach will depend highly on the dominance genetic correlation between the target traits. Hence  dominance genetic correlations different from 1 will indicate that matings will perform differently between traits. If this is the case  this will inevitably complicate the mating allocation strategy and a compromise between the expected total genetic gains of the traits will be needed. In this study  we estimated non-additive genetic variance components and addressed their use to improve the performance of offspring of selected parents by means of mate allocation strategies. Inclusion of non-additive genetic effects is straightforward in a genomic prediction context. For the traits analyzed here  estimates of dominance genetic variance were small  ranging from 11 to 20% of the additive genetic variance. Addition of dominance genetic effects to a model that included additive genetic effects and genomic inbreeding did not improve the goodness of fit of the model. Inbreeding depression was estimated to have an undesirable effect on AGE and no effect on other traits. Genomic mate allocation improved the performance of future offspring of -<U+2009>0.79 days  -<U+2009>0.04 mm  and 11.3 g for AGE  BD and APWL  respectively  but slightly reduced the expected additive genetic gain  e.g. by 1.8% for AGE. Our results show that genomic mate allocation  accounting for non-additive genetic effects  is a feasible and a potential strategy to improve the productive performance (total genetic value) of future offspring without compromising the additive genetic gain. Our conclusions are limited to a single population  to a few tested scenarios of mate allocation strategies and under a single-trait approach. Further research is very much needed to explore the benefits of mate allocation strategies in a broader context.

There were no clear differences between effects of long ROH (recent inbreeding) and short ROH (ancient inbreeding). Inbreeding depression was observed for yield  fertility and udder health traits. For yield traits and based on pedigree  inbreeding on recent generations was more harmful than inbreeding on distant generations and there was evidence of purging. Across all traits  long and short ROH contributed to inbreeding depression. In future work  inbreeding depression and purging should be assessed in more detail at the genomic level  using higher density information and genomic time series. Inbreeding depression is the decrease in mean performance due to mating between relatives. Many important traits in dairy cattle  such as yield and fertility traits  show inbreeding depression [   ]. The genetic basis of inbreeding depression is increased homozygosity with inbreeding  which increases the frequency of unfavourable genotypes [  ]. Although overdominance and epistasis may contribute to inbreeding depression  partial dominance is expected to account for the major proportion of inbreeding depression [    ]. A variety of methods can be used to assess inbreeding depression. Traditionally  inbreeding depression has been assessed by regression of phenotypes on pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients [  ]. Nowadays  with the wide availability of genotype data  pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients can be replaced by genomic inbreeding coefficients [  ]. Genomic inbreeding can be computed from a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) or from the proportion of the genome covered by regions (or runs) of homozygosity (ROH) [  ]. Genomic inbreeding coefficients are expected to be more accurate than pedigree-based coefficients  because they account for Mendelian sampling variation (e.g. []) and do not depend on pedigree completeness and quality (e.g. []). Moreover  the use of ROH provides additional opportunities to distinguish recent from ancient inbreeding [    ]. Not all inbreeding is expected to be equally harmful. Recent inbreeding (i.e. inbreeding arising from recent common ancestors) is expected to have a larger unfavourable effect than ancient inbreeding (i.e. inbreeding arising from more distant common ancestors). This hypothesis is based on the expected decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles over time  which is the result of (natural and/or artificial) selection. Since most deleterious alleles are (partially) recessive  inbreeding increases the efficiency of selection against these alleles by increasing homozygosity  which is called purging []. Purging is more likely to occur when there is strong selection pressure and when inbreeding accumulates slowly over many generations [  ]. With pedigree data  recent inbreeding may be distinguished from ancient inbreeding by including only a limited number of ancestral generations in the computation of inbreeding coefficients [  ]. Alternatively  one may use a purging-based approach to split the classical inbreeding coefficient into a new and an ancestral component  based on whether alleles are identical-by-descent (IBD) for the first time or have also been IBD in previous generations [  ]. The few studies that have applied the latter approach to commercial cattle populations found that the new inbreeding component was more harmful than the ancestral component  suggesting the presence of purging in these populations [  ]. With genomic data  age of inbreeding may be derived from the length of ROH [    ]. Longer ROH reflect more recent inbreeding  because they have not yet been broken up by recombination. More specifically  the length of ROH derived from a common ancestor  generations ago roughly follows an exponential distribution with a mean of  Morgan [  ]. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of ROH of different lengths on phenotypes in livestock  and the results of these studies vary [    ]. The objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of inbreeding depression due to recent and ancient inbreeding in Dutch Holstein–Friesian dairy cattle. We expected to find stronger unfavourable effects for recent inbreeding compared to ancient inbreeding  because of selection against deleterious alleles over time (strengthened by purging). For a population of almost 40 000 genotyped cows  we determined the degree of inbreeding depression for yield  fertility and udder health traits. We used various pedigree-based and genomic inbreeding measures to compare these measures in terms of inbreeding depression. This study was performed in the context of artificial selection  meaning that all traits were under artificial selection and that natural selection will have had a relatively small contribution (or no contribution at all). In total  38 792 first-parity cows (fraction Holstein–Friesian<U+2009>><U+2009>87.5%  either red or black) from 233 herds were included. These cows calved in the period 2012–2016 and were from herds with a data-agreement with the Dutch-Flemish cattle improvement cooperative (CRV; Arnhem  the Netherlands). Initially  47 254 first-parity cows from 440 herds during the 2012–2016 period were considered. From this initial dataset  herds with less than 10 genotyped cows per year were discarded (<U+2009>=<U+2009>207; <U+2009>=<U+2009>8462) in order to exclude herds in which only a few cows were occasionally genotyped. Pedigree  genotype and phenotype data were provided by CRV. The total pedigree comprised 167 924 individuals. To assess pedigree completeness  the number of complete generations (NCG) and the complete generation equivalent (CGE) were computed. The CGE was computed as the sum of  of all known ancestors of an individual  with  being the number of generations between the individual and a given ancestor. To limit the effect of missing pedigree information on results  cows with a NCG lower than 3 and/or a CGE lower than 10 were excluded from pedigree-based analyses (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1731). The mean NCG and CGE in the remaining cows equalled 6.5 generations and 12.5 generation-equivalents  respectively. Cows were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (versions v1 and v2) or the CRV custom-made 60 k Illumina panel (versions v1 and v2). Genotypes were imputed to 76 k from the different panels  following Druet et al. []. Prior to imputation  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a call rate lower than 0.85  a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.025 or a difference of more than 0.15 between observed and expected heterozygosity were discarded. In addition  SNPs with an unknown position on the Btau4.0 genome assembly were discarded. The final dataset contained 75 538 autosomal SNPs. Yield  fertility and udder health traits were considered. For yield  the 305-day milk yield (MY; in kg)  305-day fat yield (FY; in kg)  and 305-day protein yield (PY; in kg) were included. For fertility  the calving interval (CI; in days)  interval calving to first insemination (ICF; in days)  interval first to last insemination (IFL; in days)  and conception rate (CR; in %) were included. For udder health  the mean somatic cell scores for day 5 through to 150 (SCS150; in units) and day 151 through to 400 (SCS400; in units) were included. Somatic cell scores were calculated as 1000<U+2009>+<U+2009>100*[log2 of cells/mL]. Various inbreeding measures were used to assess inbreeding depression and distinguish recent from ancient inbreeding. These measures were divided into four groups: (1) pedigree generation-based measures  (2) pedigree purging-based measures  (3) ROH-based measures  and (4) GRM-based inbreeding. The classical inbreeding coefficient based on all information in the pedigree () was calculated with PEDIG []. The  was defined as the pedigree-based probability that two alleles at a random locus in an individual were IBD []. In addition to   inbreeding coefficients based on the first  ancestral generations ()  with  ranging from 4 to 8  were computed with the  program in PEDIG [  ]. Inbreeding for specific age classes was computed as the difference between successive coefficients (e.g. inbreeding on ancestors from 5 generations ago was computed as ; abbreviated as ). The  was chosen as the most ancient category  because of the limited pedigree completeness for more ancient generations (e.g. only 78 cows had a NCG<U+2009>><U+2009>8) (see Additional file : Figure S1). The  was chosen as the most recent category  because very few individuals were inbred on ancestors in the first ancestral generations (see Additional file : Figure S2). Based on the hypothesis of purging  a few additional pedigree-based measures were calculated. Following Kalinowski et al. []  the  was split into two components: an ancestral component () and a new component (). The  was defined as the probability that alleles were IBD while they had already been IBD in at least one ancestor  and  was the probability that alleles were IBD for the first time in the pedigree of the individual. The ancestral history coefficient () introduced by Baumung et al. [] was also calculated.  was defined as the number of times that a random allele had been IBD during pedigree segregation []. Kalinowski’s inbreeding coefficients and the  were obtained by gene dropping  using 10 replications. The in-house script used for gene dropping is available upon request. To illustrate the differences between all pedigree-based inbreeding measures  two example pedigrees are provided (Fig. ). In example (1)  the  of individual X equals 7.03%  since it is the sum of the inbreeding on ancestor A (0.5) and on ancestor D (0.5). Since ancestor A is in the 5th ancestral generation and D is in the first 4 generations   equals the partial inbreeding on A (i.e. 0.5) and  equals the partial inbreeding on D (0.5).  is the probability that X is IBD for an allele that was already IBD in an ancestor  which in example (1) has to be ancestor E (since E is the only inbred ancestor).  can be manually calculated by multiplying the probability that E is IBD for an allele of A (0.5) with the probability that X inherits this allele from E given that E is IBD (1) and with the probability that X inherits this allele through D-F-G-X given that D is a carrier of the allele (0.5). Thus  it is equal to 0.78% (i.e. 0.5). In example (2)  the  of individual X is higher (31.25%) than in example (1)  while  equals 0% based on the known information. The calculation of  in example (2) depends on both D and E  since both ancestors are inbred.  can be derived manually by tracing the possible genotype combinations. Individual A has two alleles  alleles 1 and 2. Consider the scenario in which individual B inherits allele 1 from A such that B has genotype 1/3  with 3 referring to a random allele inherited from the unknown parent of B. The possible genotypes of C are 1/4 and 2/4  where 4 is a random allele inherited from the unknown parent of C. If the genotype of C is 1/4  there are four possible genotypes for D and E (namely 1/1  1/4  3/1 and 3/4)  resulting in 16 possible combinations of D and E and in 64 genotype possibilities for X. Among these 64 possibilities  there are 12 possibilities with X being 1/1 while D and/or E are 1/1 (four of which occur when D and E are both 11; the others occur when D or E is 1/1 while the other is 1/3 or 1/4). If C has genotype 2/4  while B is 1/3  there are also 64 genotype possibilities for X  but for none of these possibilities X will be IBD. Thus  if B is 1/3  there are 12 out of 128 possibilities for which X is IBD for allele 1 while D and/or E is also IBD for this allele. Similarly  if B is 2/3  there are 12 out of 128 possibilities for which X is IBD for allele 2 while D and/or E are also IBD for this allele. Therefore  the  equals 24 out of 256 (i.e. 9.38%).

The following criteria were set to define a ROH: (i) a minimum physical length of 1 Mb  (ii) a minimum of 10 SNPs  (iii) a minimum density of one SNP per 100 kb  (iv) a maximum of one heterozygous call within a ROH  and (v) a maximum gap of 500 kb between consecutive SNPs. A scanning window of 10 SNPs  with a maximum of one heterozygote per window  was used. After identification  ROH were classified into five length classes: (i)<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb  (ii) 8 to 16 Mb  (iii) 4 to 8 Mb  (iv) 2 to 4 Mb  and (v) 1 to 2 Mb. The expected age of inbreeding increased from the first to the last class  since shorter ROH reflect more ancient inbreeding. To illustrate this in more detail  the expected age was determined for each length category (Fig. ). The expected age of inbreeding was based on the concept that the length of ROH derived from a common ancestor  generations ago follows an exponential distribution with mean  Morgan [  ]. For simplicity  a mean genetic distance of 1 Morgan per 100 Mb [] was used and it was assumed that recombination rates were uniform across the genome and across sexes. Note that non-uniform recombination rates may result in deviations from the exponential distribution. For example  Speed and Balding [] performed extensive simulations for the human genome and found that length of ROH was best approximated with a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.76. Since recombination rates may differ across the bovine genome and across sexes []  Fig.  only provides a rough approximation of the expected length per ROH length class. Expected age of inbreeding (in ancestral generations) for ROH classes  based on underlying exponential distributions. Note that this figure is an approximation  assuming a uniform distribution of inbreeding across ancestral generations  a uniform recombination rate across the genome and sexes  and a genetic distance of 1 Morgan per 100 Mb For each ROH length class  the inbreeding coefficient was calculated as the proportion of an individual’s autosome that was covered by ROH of that class (e.g. ). Autosome length was corrected for uncovered regions (i.e. ends of chromosomes and gaps of more than 500 kb without SNPs) and the corrected autosome length was 2469 Mb. A total inbreeding coefficient based on all ROH () was also computed. Genomic inbreeding coefficients () were obtained as a measure of marker homozygosity. First  a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) was computed with  []  according to the method of VanRaden []. Then  inbreeding coefficients were derived as the diagonal of the GRM minus 1 (since the relationship of an individual with itself equals 1 plus its inbreeding coefficient). When computing the GRM  allele frequencies were fixed to 0.5  such that  was equivalent to the proportion of homozygous SNPs  except for a difference in scale []. The degree of inbreeding depression was estimated by regressing phenotypes on inbreeding coefficients. For the total inbreeding measures (   and )  the following linear mixed model was used: where  is the  herd-year of calving (1165 classes)   is the  month of calving (12 classes)   is the regression coefficient for   which was the age at calving for the  cow   is the regression coefficient for   which was the inbreeding coefficient for the  cow   is the random genetic effect for the  cow  and  is the random error term. The -effect was assumed to follow )  where  is the numerator relationship matrix and  the additive genetic variance. When  or  was partitioned into classes based on inbreeding age  Model (1) was extended to fit these classes simultaneously (e.g.        and ): where  is the regression coefficient for   which was the inbreeding coefficient for the  cow and the  inbreeding class  and  is the number of inbreeding classes. All analyses were performed with ASReml 4.1 []. Regression coefficients and corresponding standard errors (SE) for inbreeding measures were obtained from output. In addition  P-values for the Wald test were obtained from output and were used to check for significance of effects. Descriptive statistics for the evaluated traits are in Table . Heritability estimates  obtained by running Model (1) without an inbreeding effect  were high for yield traits (0.36 to 0.47)  moderate for somatic cell scores (0.11 and 0.14) and low for fertility traits (0.03 to 0.11). Inbreeding based on ROH-coverage () was highly correlated with inbreeding based on marker homozygosity ()  with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 (Fig. ). Pedigree-based inbreeding () was moderately correlated with  and   with correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.61  respectively. The majority of cows (63%) were not inbred on ancestors in the first four ancestral generations  as illustrated by the distribution for  (see Additional file : Figure S2). For cows that were inbred in the first four ancestral generations  clear peaks were visible at expected -levels  for example at 0.78% (inbreeding on a single ancestor with an inbreeding loop of eight “steps”) and at 1.56% (a single loop of seven steps  or two loops of eight steps). In line with pedigree-based results  only a few cows had very long ROH (which indicate very recent inbreeding). About a fourth of the cows (26%) had no ROH<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb  32% had a single ROH<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb  21% had two ROH<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb and the remaining 21% had three or more ROH<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb. Pearson correlations suggest that the pedigree generation-based and the ROH-based measures partly captured the same age effects (Fig. ). For example   showed a higher correlation with  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.50) than with  (0.34)   (0.22)   (0.10) and  (-<U+2009>0.03). Similarly   showed higher correlations with short ROH than with long ROH. Correlations among pedigree generation-based classes ranged from -<U+2009>0.23 to 0.27 and correlations among ROH-classes ranged from -<U+2009>0.10 to 0.26  suggesting rather independent inbreeding age classes. Notably  the  showed a negative or very low correlation (ranging from -<U+2009>0.10 to 0.06) with all other calculated inbreeding measures  including overall homozygosity ().

For example  a 1% increase in  was associated with a decrease in 305-day milk yield of 36.25 kg (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  an increase in calving interval of 0.48 day (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) and an increase in mean somatic cell score in day 151 to 400 of 0.80 units (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01). All estimated effects  including those that were not significant at the 0.05-level (e.g. for ICF)  were unfavourable. To further illustrate differences in performance associated with changes in inbreeding  the expected phenotypes of cows with low (5% percentile) and high (95% percentile) inbreeding coefficients were compared (Table ). These differences were computed only for traits that showed a significant depression effect for each of the total inbreeding measures. Differences between cows with low and high inbreeding coefficients were smaller for pedigree-based inbreeding than for genomic inbreeding measures. For example  the differences in 305-day milk yield between lowly and highly inbred cows were 198  301 and 315 kg for    and   respectively. To compare depression effects across traits  the estimated regression coefficients from Table  were also expressed as the percentages of the corresponding trait means  as well as in phenotypic and genetic standard deviations (see Additional file : Table S1). When expressed in percentages of trait means  yield traits showed a relatively large depression effect (of 0.39 to 0.47%) and somatic cell scores a relatively small effect (of 0.02 to 0.05%). The effect for fertility differed across traits and inbreeding measures. It was relatively high for CR and IFL (0.33 to 0.67%) and intermediate for CI and ICF (0.11 to 0.21%). When compared in phenotypic standard deviations  yield traits showed the highest degree of inbreeding depression. When compared in genetic standard deviations  yield traits also showed the highest degree of inbreeding depression  in spite of the lower heritability of fertility and udder health traits. Only conception rate  which had a very low heritability of 0.03  showed a depression effect similar to that of yield traits when compared in genetic standard deviations. When  was split into generation-based classes  recent inbreeding significantly reduced milk  fat and protein yield whereas more ancient inbreeding had a non-significant neutral or even favourable effect (Fig. ). For example  the estimated effects for 305-day protein yield from the most recent to the most ancient class were equal to -<U+2009>1.3 kg (for )  -<U+2009>1.4 kg ()  -<U+2009>0.6 kg ()  0.3 kg () and 0.7 kg (). For fertility and udder health traits  estimated effects were generally not significantly different from zero and no clear pattern was visible for these traits. For example  the interval between calving and first insemination seemed to be unfavourably affected by all classes  but none of the effects was significant. For all traits  standard errors increased with age of inbreeding. This may be explained by a lower degree of variation for more ancient inbreeding (see Additional file : Figure S2).

For example  a 1% increase in  was associated with a 2.42 kg (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.41) decrease in 305-day fat yield  while a 1% increase in  was associated with a 0.03 kg (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.71) increase in fat yield. For fertility and udder health traits  both new and ancestral inbreeding effects were not significantly different from zero. For most traits (MY  FY  PY  IFL  CR  SCS150  SCS400)  the estimated effect of new inbreeding was more unfavourable than the effect of ancestral inbreeding. For some traits (e.g. IFL)  the estimated effect of ancestral inbreeding was even slightly favourable  whereas the effect of new inbreeding was always unfavourable.

When  was fitted simultaneously with   fat yield also tended to increase with an increase in  (<0.1). Interactions between  and  were not significant. When  was split into classes based on ROH length (><U+2009>16  8–16  4–8  2–4 and 1–2 Mb)  the effect of these classes differed across traits (Fig. ). For 305-day milk yield  for example  all five classes showed a significant decrease in yield per 1% increase in inbreeding  with a slightly stronger effect for ancient inbreeding (; effect of -<U+2009>60 kg) than for more recent inbreeding (longer ROH-classes; effects varying from -<U+2009>29 to -<U+2009>40 kg). For 305-day fat yield  an increase in  and  was associated with a decrease in yield  while for shorter ROH this decrease was less pronounced. For fertility and udder health traits  most effects were not significantly different from zero. However  some of these traits did show a trend. For calving interval and for the interval between calving and first insemination  inbreeding based on long ROH seemed to increase these intervals  whereas that based on shorter ROH seemed to decrease these intervals. In contrast  for somatic cell score for day 151 through to 400  there seemed to be a larger unfavourable effect of short ROH compared to long ROH. Across all traits  standard errors were larger for inbreeding based on short ROH compared to long ROH. This may be the result of less variation in inbreeding based on short ROH (see Additional file : Figure S2).

For example  a 1% increase in pedigree inbreeding has previously been associated with a reduction in 305-day milk yield of 20 to 30 kg [    ] and with an increase in calving interval of 0.2 to 0.7 days [    ]. Inbreeding depression for somatic cell score has also been observed before [  ]  but estimates were not directly comparable because of different scales and because of the use of separate measures for early (SCS150) and late (SCS400) lactation in the current study. In general  the accuracy of pedigree-based results depends largely on pedigree quality and completeness. Incomplete pedigrees may lead to downward bias of inbreeding coefficients and  therefore  to misleading estimates of inbreeding depression []. In an attempt to limit this bias  we decided to include only the individuals with a NCG of at least three generations and a CGE of at least 10 equivalents in this study. Estimates of inbreeding depression based on genomic inbreeding measures were similar to those estimated for pedigree-based inbreeding and to those reported in other studies. In US Holstein–Friesian cattle  Bjelland et al. [] found a decrease in 205-day milk yield of 20 and 47 kg for a 1% increase in  and   respectively. They also observed an increase in days open (a trait similar to calving interval) of 1.72 and 1.06 days for  and   respectively. They did not observe an effect on SCS. In Australian Holstein–Friesian cattle  Pryce et al. [] estimated inbreeding depression based on a  measure that was corrected for allele frequencies of the contemporary population. They found that a 1% increase in their -estimates was associated with a decrease in lactation yields for milk  fat and protein of 28 kg  1.3 kg and 0.9 kg  respectively. In addition  they observed a slight increase in calving interval of 0.12 days  although this increase was not significant. As illustrated by the current and previous studies  genomic measures of inbreeding can be effectively used to estimate the effects of inbreeding on performance. In fact  we found that  and  captured more phenotypic differences between lowly and highly inbred cows than  (Table )  in spite of the larger estimated change in phenotype per 1% increase in  compared to  (Table ). This finding was in line with the results of Bjelland et al. [] and is the direct result of a wider distribution for  compared to  (see Additional file : Figure S2). The finding that  captures less inbreeding depression than  and  may be explained by the random nature of recombination and segregation  which is captured with genomic measures but not with pedigree. Since there will be more measurement errors in pedigree inbreeding than in genomic inbreeding  there will be more attenuation or “flattening” of the slope towards zero for  (a statistical phenomenon known as regression dilution). For the various inbreeding measures  which Keller et al. [] investigated in their simulation study  ROH-based inbreeding showed the highest correlation with the homozygous mutation load. Our results suggest that  and  capture similar effects of inbreeding depression at the population level  which is not surprising because of the high correlation between these two measures (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.93 in this study). Costs of inbreeding should be considered in the framework of a breeding program. For example  for a trait such as 305-day milk yield  we estimated a reduction of around 38 kg per 1% increase in pedigree-based inbreeding. If we consider that the pedigree-based inbreeding level in Dutch Holstein–Friesian cattle has increased from around 0.5% in 1980 to around 4.5% in 2010 [  ]  this would roughly imply a mean loss of 150 kg due to inbreeding depression. Such a loss is small compared to the realised genetic progress in the same period  which was equal to approximately 2200 kg []. Although the rate of inbreeding has increased with the introduction of genomic selection []  contrary to expectation []  the increased genetic gains [] are expected to still outweigh the losses caused by inbreeding depression. It should be noted that overall costs will be larger than the cost for single traits  especially since components of economic return may combine multiplicatively rather than additively []. In addition  it is important to realise that inbreeding will also affect traits that were not included in the present study  such as stillbirths []. Previous economic analyses of inbreeding depression suggested lifetime losses per cow in the order of tens of US dollars per 1% increase in inbreeding [    ]. These analyses confirm that  by affecting various traits  inbreeding depression reduces net income. Combined with the importance of conserving genetic diversity for future adaptability  the costs of inbreeding depression provide incentive to monitor and manage inbreeding in dairy cattle populations. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that recent inbreeding is more harmful than ancient inbreeding. This hypothesis was based on the expected decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles over time as a result of selection  strengthened by purging. Computer simulations have shown that purging is more effective when selection pressure is strong and when inbreeding accumulates slowly over many generations [  ]. We expected that purging would have occurred in the Dutch Holstein–Friesian population  because the population has undergone decades of intense artificial selection and inbreeding has accumulated (at least until 2012) at approximately 0.13% per year [  ]. Pedigree-based results support our hypothesis. For yield traits  inbreeding on recent generations was more harmful than inbreeding on more distant generations (Fig. ). In addition  there was evidence of purging for these traits (Fig. ). For most traits  Kalinowski’s  was more harmful than Kalinowski’s  (Fig. ). For some traits  the estimated effect of  was even favourable. In other words  to be IBD for alleles that were already IBD in the past had a neutral or favourable effect  whereas to be IBD for alleles for the first time was generally unfavourable. These findings are in line with the hypothesis of purging  which states that loci that have undergone inbreeding in the past have been exposed to an increased selection efficiency (against deleterious recessive alleles)  compared to loci that have not undergone inbreeding before. Our results are largely in line with previous studies that have investigated purging in commercial cattle populations [  ]. In German Holstein–Friesian cattle  Hinrichs et al. [] studied the effects of new and ancestral inbreeding on reproductive traits. They found that a 1% increase in  was associated with a decrease in birthweight of 11.9 kg  while a 1% increase in  was associated with an increase in birthweight of 41.6 kg. They also observed a significant increase in the rate of stillbirths for   while  showed a slight reduction in stillbirths that was not significant. In Irish Holstein–Friesian cattle  Mc Parland et al. [] investigated the effects of new and ancestral inbreeding on yield and fertility traits. They found that a 1% increase in  was associated with a decrease in 305-day milk  fat and protein yields of 32.4 kg  2.4 kg and 1.1 kg  respectively. They also found unfavourable effects for   but these effects were less strong  namely 8.9 kg  0.5 kg and 0.3 kg  respectively. For calving interval  they estimated an increase of 4.1 and 0.6 days for  and   respectively. Differences across studies may be partly explained by the way that  and  have been fitted. In this study and in the study of Hinrichs et al. []  the  and  were fitted simultaneously in the model  thereby accounting for the correlation between the two measures (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.67 in this study). In the study of Mc Parland et al. []  however   and  were fitted individually. Differences between effects of recent and ancient inbreeding (Fig. ) and between effects of Kalinowski’s  and  (Fig. ) were most apparent for yield traits  which is in accordance with Mc Parland et al. []. This finding may be explained by the selection history of Dutch Holstein–Friesian cattle. Targeted selection for fertility and udder health has taken place only since these traits were included in the breeding goal around the year 2000  whereas selection for yield traits has taken place for many more decades []. Therefore  there has been less time for selection to act on alleles that affect fertility and udder health traits compared to alleles that affect yield traits. In addition to Kalinowski’s new and ancestral inbreeding  we also considered the ancestral history coefficient ().  is defined as the number of times that a random allele in an individual has been IBD in the individual’s pedigree []. The rationale behind this recently introduced measure is that purging is not fully efficient and that the probability of purging increases with the number of times the alleles have been IBD. In other words  an allele that has been IBD many times in an individual’s pedigree is more likely to have a neutral or positive effect on traits under selection  compared to an allele that has been IBD only once or never before. An increase in   therefore  is expected to be associated with a favourable effect on the phenotype. Indeed  we observed a few favourable effects  i.e. an increase in protein yield and a tendency for an increase in fat yield (Table ). Most traits showed no significant effect  but the estimate was generally favourable. In Thoroughbred horses  Todd et al. [] found a strong positive association between  and racing performance. Compared to their study  where the mean  was 1.97 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.09)  the mean  in the current study was rather low at 0.31 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05). This can be explained by the very comprehensive pedigree of the Thoroughbred population  which dates back to the late eighteenth century  with individuals from 2000 to 2010 having a mean CGE of 24.6 []. A purging-based measure that we did not include in this study is Ballou’s [] ancestral inbreeding coefficient (). The  is defined as the probability that any allele in an individual has been IBD in an ancestor at least once []. It can be calculated by using an iterative formula [] or with gene dropping []  where gene dropping provides more robust estimates by accounting for dependence between  and  []. To assess the effect of purging  one has to include the product of  and  in the model [    ]  because  does not consider the IBD-probability for an individual itself. The product of  and  is the probability that an individual is IBD for an allele that was already IBD in at least one ancestor  which is in fact the definition of Kalinowski’s  []. Similarly  the product of () and  is equivalent to the  of Kalinowski. Because of this equivalence  we decided to include only Kalinowski’s measures in this study. More recently  an inbreeding-purging (IP) model was proposed to assess purging based on genealogical information []. This model  which was developed in a conservation biology context  predicts how fitness evolves in a population undergoing inbreeding by means of a purged inbreeding coefficient ().  is the traditional inbreeding coefficient weighted by the reduction in frequency of deleterious alleles induced by purging. Using simulations  López-Cortegano et al. [] showed that inbreeding depression estimates based on the IP model are similar to those obtained using Ballou’s approach  with smaller standard errors for the IP model. We considered using the IP model for the current study. Since the model and associated software (PURGd) have been developed outside the context of artificially selected populations  various limitations exist for its application to livestock data. First  random effects cannot be fitted in the model  making it impossible to directly correct for additive genetic relationships. To overcome this limitation  one could first run an animal model in a different software environment (e.g. ASReml) and subsequently use the residuals as phenotypes for the IP model. This two-step process is not desirable  because it will affect the inbreeding depression estimates. Second  the model assumes that inbreeding load is due to deleterious alleles that have a low initial frequency in the (base) population. In the context of livestock breeding  where animals are selected based on a breeding goal composed of various traits []  we do not expect that alleles that are deleterious for a single trait necessarily segregate at a low frequency. Given these limitations  we decided not to use the IP model in the current study. For future research  it would be valuable to explore further the application of the IP model in (livestock) populations undergoing artificial selection. We expected that inbreeding based on long ROH (recent inbreeding) would be associated with stronger depression effects than inbreeding based on short ROH (ancient inbreeding). For some traits (e.g. fat yield and calving interval) our results were in line with this hypothesis  but for other traits there was no clear pattern across ROH-length classes or there was even a pattern in the opposite direction (Fig. ). Overall  both long and short ROH seemed to contribute to inbreeding depression. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of ROH of different lengths on phenotypes in livestock populations  with various results [    ]. In Austrian Fleckvieh  Ferencakovic et al. [] found stronger inbreeding depression for number of spermatozoa when considering both long and short ROH (e.g.<U+2009>><U+2009>2 Mb) than when considering only long ROH (e.g.<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb). For autosome 3 in Iberian pigs  Saura et al. [] observed that inbreeding based on long ROH (><U+2009>5 Mb) significantly decreased the number of piglets born  whereas inbreeding based on short ROH (0.5 to 5 Mb) had a non-significant favourable effect. In Australian Holstein–Friesian cattle  Pryce et al. [] observed a stronger depression effect for 305-day milk yield when only very long ROH were included than when also shorter ROH were included. To further investigate and compare our results to the findings of Pryce et al. []  we also ran Model (1) for cumulative ROH-based inbreeding coefficients (i.e.        and ). We obtained a similar trend (see Additional file : Figure S3) as Pryce et al. []  with  showing the strongest effect and the inclusion of shorter ROHs reducing the effect size. The difference between results for fitting multiple length classes simultaneously (Fig. ) and for fitting cumulative measures one by one (see Additional file : Figure S3) may be due to the correlations between classes. We believe that fitting length classes simultaneously provides the most accurate estimates  since this approach accounts for the correlations between classes. Based on computer simulations  Keller et al. [] concluded that long ROH correlate better with the homozygous mutation load than short ROH for a population with an effective population size of 100 (which is the approximate size of the Holstein–Friesian population [  ]). Functional predictions of deleterious variation have led to inconsistent conclusions as to whether short or long ROH harbour more deleterious genetic variants [  ]. For the human genome  Szpiech et al. [] predicted that long ROH (of several Mb) are enriched with deleterious variants compared to short ROH. In contrast  for four Danish cattle breeds Zhang et al. [] predicted that short (<<U+2009>0.1 Mb) and medium (0.1 to 3 Mb) ROH are significantly enriched in deleterious variants compared to long (><U+2009>3 Mb) ROH. For domestic dogs  Sams and Boyko [] recently reported that the relative risk of a ROH carrying a known deleterious variant is similar across ROH of different lengths  suggesting that ROH of all lengths may contribute to inbreeding depression in dogs. This latter finding is more in line with our results  where both short and long ROH seem to contribute to inbreeding depression. There are various aspects that affect the accuracy of identification of ROH and the inference of inbreeding age based on ROH. First  the density of the SNP panel determines the size of ROH that can be accurately identified. Previous studies have shown that the use of a 50 k panel may result in false positive ROH shorter than 5 Mb and especially in many false positives ROH shorter than 2 Mb [  ]. For a more accurate estimation of ancient inbreeding  and to apply this approach to even more generations in the past  high-density SNP data or sequence data is required. Second  in this study we assumed a uniform recombination rate  while it actually varies across the genome (e.g. []). A ROH of a given physical length in a region with high recombination will reflect more ancient inbreeding than a ROH of the same length in a region with low recombination. One may account for this effect by computing ROH based on genetic distances. However  this is rarely done in practice  since it requires a high-quality linkage map []. Third  recent inbreeding may mask more ancient inbreeding []. If both chromosomes at a position in the genome trace back to a distant common ancestor  you expect to find a short ROH. If the same region also traces back to a recent common ancestor  then you would observe only the long ROH. As a result  one may expect a negative correlation between recent and ancient ROH-based inbreeding. In Iberian pigs  Saura et al. [] report such a negative correlation of -0.641 between inbreeding based on short ROH (0.5 to 5 Mb) and based on long ROH (><U+2009>5 Mb). In this study  we found some negative correlations between the very short ROH () and the other classes (Fig. ). However  these negative correlations could also be an artefact of the unreliable estimation of short ROH. To correct for the masking of ancient inbreeding by recent inbreeding  one could subtract the length of long ROH of the total length of the genome when calculating  for short ROH. The effect of this or other correction(s) should be investigated in future studies. Lastly  various approaches can be used to identify ROH. In this study  we applied the sliding window approach implemented in Plink 2.0 []  with a set of (rather arbitrary) rules to define a ROH. As an alternative to this rule-based approach  one may use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify ROH and infer age of inbreeding [  ]. In the future  it would be valuable to compare the different approaches and investigate the benefit of using linkage maps to infer inbreeding age based on ROH. As sequencing costs continue to decrease  genomic data (including that of cows) will become increasingly available. This offers opportunities to perform large-scale analyses on genomic inbreeding depression based on high-density information  e.g. to identify regions associated with inbreeding depression [    ]. In addition  genomic time series (consisting of genomic data of an individual and its ancestors) could be used to study purging in more detail at the genomic level. Inbreeding depression was observed for yield  fertility and udder health traits in Dutch Holstein–Friesian dairy cattle. Observed inbreeding depression was stronger for yield traits than for fertility and udder health traits  when compared in (phenotypic or genetic) standard deviations. Genomic inbreeding captured more inbreeding depression than pedigree-based inbreeding at the population level. For yield traits and based on pedigree information  inbreeding on recent generations was found to be more harmful than inbreeding on distant generations and there was evidence of purging. Based on ROH  there was no clear difference between the effects of long ROH (recent inbreeding) and short ROH (ancient inbreeding). Future work should investigate inbreeding depression and purging in more detail at the genomic level  using higher density information and genomic time series.

The results of the multivariate Bayesian analyses in this study showed that genetic evaluation for production and feed efficiency traits should take sex and age differences into account to increase accuracy of selection and genetic gain. Moreover  for communicating with stakeholders  it is easier to explain results from selection on  than selection on   since  is genetically independent of production traits and it explains the efficiency of birds in nutrient utilization independently of energy requirements for production and maintenance. Genetic improvement of body weight (BW) and feed efficiency (FE) traits has received major consideration in the poultry industry due to their economic and environmental implications. Body weight is the live weight of birds at a given age  while feed efficiency is the ability of birds to convert kg of feed into kg of body weight gain. Among the different ways of measuring FE in poultry  residual feed intake (RFI) is a popular partial measure of FE due to its phenotypic independence of production traits  the presence of considerable variation in RFI among birds and the moderately high heritability of the trait []. Classically  RFI is defined as the difference between actual feed intake and predicted feed intake based on energy requirements for production (e.g. body weight  body weight gain) and maintenance []. Since RFI is phenotypically independent of production traits  variation in RFI reflects differences in efficiency with which birds use feed for production and maintenance of BW  as well as errors in its prediction []. Prediction of RFI has been largely based on phenotypic regression of feed intake on measures of production from multiple regression analysis. This is called phenotypic RFI since direct consideration has not been given to underlying genetic regressions in the computation of RFI and it is not genetically independent of production traits. Kennedy et al. [] derived phenotypic RFI using phenotypic regression coefficients  which were obtained from phenotypic co(variance) matrices of feed intake and production traits that were assumed to be known without error  and showed that phenotypic RFI is phenotypically independent of production traits but not genetically independent of production traits. In the same context  Kennedy et al. [] proposed the term genetic RFI to explain the component of feed intake that is genetically independent of production traits and derived by using genetic regression coefficients obtained from genetic co(variance) matrices of feed intake and production traits that were assumed to be known without error. In this regard  direct consideration is not given to phenotypic regressions in the computation of genetic RFI ()  therefore   is not phenotypically independent of production traits []. Jensen et al. [] extended the definitions of phenotypic and genetic RFI provided by Kennedy et al. [] to a Bayesian framework  which estimates the co(variance) function for RFI  using proper distributions of feed intake conditional on production traits in a one-step procedure. This one-step procedure estimates the partial phenotypic and genetic regression coefficients from co(variance) matrices of feed intake and production traits that result from a multiple trait analysis of feed intake and production traits  and then simultaneously derives phenotypic and genetic RFI within the model. This one-step approach properly accounts for errors in the estimation of regression coefficients as compared to the classical two-step approach of Kennedy et al. []  which assumes co(variance) matrices of component traits of RFI to be known without error and that of Koch et al. []. In the classical two-step procedures  first feed intake and production traits are analyzed in a multiple regression analysis and regression coefficients are obtained before genetic analysis. Then  RFI for each animal is computed using the regression coefficients and the genetic analysis is performed together with production or body composition traits. In these procedures  the resulting covariance functions of RFI and production traits are usually singular because RFI is defined before genetic analysis as a linear combination of other traits []. However  the one-step procedure in the Bayesian analysis avoids singularity of the co(variance) matrices by simultaneously estimating the co(variance) functions of RFI based on the conditional distribution of FI given production and possibly body composition traits []. In addition  the Bayesian one-step procedure ensures that parameter estimation in the regression analysis is not biased by including “fixed effects” in the model and effects due to genetic trends for component traits in the population under study []. Thus  the objectives of this study were to (1) simultaneously estimate genetic parameters for body weight  feed intake  and body weight gain in broiler chickens from a multi-trait Bayesian analysis; (2) derive phenotypic and genetic RFI and estimate genetic parameters for these traits; and (3) compute a Bayesian measure of direct and correlated superiority of a group selected on phenotypic or genetic residual feed intake. Data from 16 selection rounds (SR) for growth rate of broiler chickens  which were reared under strict bio-secure environmental conditions  were collected using procedures by Cobb-Vantress. In total  56 649  male and female broilers with phenotypic data were available. For the first 10 SRs  body weight was recorded at  days of age in males  and females   however  as selection continued  the birds started to mature earlier and the age at which they were weighed was changed to 6 days earlier ( days) for the last six SRs in males  and females . The heaviest 22 281 male and female birds in the two periods ( and  days of age) entered to the feed efficiency (FE) test  and feed intake (FI) was recorded over the test period on males () and females () at  days of age or on males  and females  at  days of age. The proportion of birds that entered the FE test was the same for each selection round. Body weight gain during the FE test for males  and females  at  days of age or body weight gain (Gain) for males  and females  at  days of age were calculated as the difference between final body weight and body weight at the start of the FE test. Preliminary univariate and bivariate restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) analyses were conducted to determine whether BW  FI and Gain in males and females at the two ages should be considered as the same trait or separate traits. The REML results showed that genetic parameters were significantly different between sexes (males and females) and at the two ages ( and  days)  which suggest that records on males and females as well as records at both ages should be considered as separate traits in the subsequent analyses. This resulted in four different traits for each of the BW  FI  and Gain traits. For example  BW for males at two different periods with different recording ages  and  and BW for females at two different periods with different recording ages . Thus  the final analysis was a Bayesian multivariate (12-trait) analysis using Gibbs sampling where the following model was specified for each of the BW  FI and Gain traits in males and females and the two ages ( and  days). where  is a vector of                       and  observations of chicken  that hatched in the selection round and hatch batch    is the interaction between selection round of chicken  and hatch batch  of the individual chicken   is the effect of  age of dam   having 32 levels   is the additive genetic effect of chicken    is the maternal permanent environmental effect of dam   and   is the random residual effect of chicken . Flat priors were used for all “fixed” location and dispersion parameters. Prior distributions for random vectors in the model were:    and   where  is the numerator relationship matrix   is the co (variance) matrix for direct additive genetic effects of dimension 12 (four variance components for each of the BW  FI and Gain traits)   is an identity matrix   is the co (variance) matrix for maternal permanent environmental effect of dimension 12  and  is the residual co (variance) matrix of dimension 12  which was assumed to be heterogeneous with a different variance for each of the 12 traits. Symbol  denotes the Kronecker (direct) product. The random effects     and  were considered independent of each other. The Gibbs sampler was used to obtain posterior distributions for all parameters included in the 12-trait model. The Gibbs sampler was run for 1 000 000 rounds; the first 250 000 rounds were discarded as burn-in and from the remaining samples  every 250th sample was saved for post-Gibbs analysis. The RJMC module in the DMU software package was used for analysis []. From the joint posterior distribution of all location and (co) variance parameters of the 12-trait model  3000 samples were saved for post-Gibbs analysis. Posterior means of breeding values and co (variance) components were computed as the average of samples after the burn-in period. The boa package in the R program was used to evaluate convergence of co (variance) parameters []. Functions to define the posterior distribution of genetic  maternal permanent environment and residual (co)variances for the 12 original traits                        and the eight derived RFI traits namely  phenotypic RFI for males at  days of age  phenotypic RFI for females at  days of age  phenotypic RFI for males at  days of age  phenotypic RFI for females at  days of age   genetic RFI for males at  days of age   genetic RFI for females at  days of age   genetic RFI for males at  days of age   and genetic RFI for females at  days of age  were derived based on Shirali et al. []. Phenotypic RFI () and genetic RFI () were derived using phenotypic partial regression coefficients and genetic partial regression coefficients  respectively for each sex and age class. This ensures that the phenotypic covariance between  and production traits (BW and Gain) is zero and the genetic covariance between  and production traits is zero  since  and  are linear combinations of BW  FI and Gain. For   the partial phenotypic regression coefficients () for BW and Gain were computed from the phenotypic (co)variance matrix while for   the partial genetic regression coefficients () for BW and Gain were computed from the genetic (co)variance matrix. Within a posterior sample  the two RFI definitions have conditional normal distributions  and were derived as follows: let  be the phenotypic and  the genetic (co)variance matrices  which were computed based on each sample from the posterior distribution of parameters  where  is 12<U+2009>×<U+2009>12 phenotypic co(variance) matrix   is 12<U+2009>×<U+2009>12 maternal permanent environmental co(variance) matrix   is 12<U+2009>×<U+2009>12 residual co (variance) matrix. Bayesian estimates of partial phenotypic () and genetic () regression coefficients were computed as follows: where  and  are 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vectors obtained in each sample from the Gibbs output for each sex and age;  and  are 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 phenotypic and genetic (co)variance matrices for the production traits of BW and Gain from  and   respectively for each sex and age; and  and  are phenotypic and genetic (co)variance matrices  respectively  between the production traits (BW and Gain) and FI in each sex and age. The predicted breeding values for  can be obtained for all animals from the conditional distribution of breeding values for FI  given the breeding values of BW and Gain  using   and the predicted breeding values for  can be obtained for all animals from the conditional distribution of breeding values for FI  given the breeding values of BW and Gain using  []. For example  a given sample from the posterior distribution of breeding values for phenotypic () and genetic () RFI can be computed as follows: The distribution of  for a given sample was obtained as the distribution of FI  conditional on BW and Gain. Similarly  the distribution of  for a given sample was obtained as the distribution of FI  conditional on BW and Gain. The corresponding co(variances) can be computed as follows: where  is the new 20<U+2009>×<U+2009>20 phenotypic co (variance) matrix and  is the new 20<U+2009>×<U+2009>20 genetic co (variance) matrix that includes the eight derived traits of RFI  in addition to the original 12 traits included in the Bayesian multivariate model.  and  are 12<U+2009>×<U+2009>12 phenotypic and genetic co (variance) matrices of the original traits  respectively and   represents 20 linear functions used to derive the new set of traits. The first 12 are identity functions for the 12 original traits and the remaining eight are functions for the eight derived traits of RFI. Details are in Shirali et al. []. The Bayesian measure of the direct and correlated genetic superiority of a group of selected birds was calculated as the difference between the mean of the predicted breeding values in the selected population and the mean of the population corrected for genetic trend. Unlike the classical selection index calculations  it is possible to make probability statements on the expected response to selection in the Bayesian analysis and their posterior standard deviations can be derived easily. This gives an expression of superiority of the selected group in each sample from the posterior distribution. The mean of the selected group for trait  when selecting on trait  was calculated based on the formula following Shirali et al. [] as: where  is the mean of the selected group for trait  when selection is on trait    is the sampled additive breeding value for trait  on animal  conditional on the genetic trend;  is the total number of animals  and  is the sampled additive genetic value for a ranked individual () when ordering animals based on sampled breeding values for trait . If   the superiority is for the trait under selection  and if   the superiority is for trait  due to selection of a possibly correlated trait . This study includes 20 traits (12 original and 8 derived traits). Therefore  20 scenarios were developed to compare direct and correlated superiorities of the selected group for production or feed efficiency traits. However  only the results of the eight scenarios for the derived traits are presented. The number of individuals ranked for the analysis was decided based on truncation selection of the best 5  10 and 20% of animals  however  only the results of truncation selection when selecting the best 10% are presented  because the results are consistent across all selection percentages. Production traits (BW and Gain)  were selected upwards and FE traits (FI   and ) were selected downwards. Descriptive statistics of the data are in Table . Males had a higher mean BW  FI and Gain than females at the two ages. The higher mean BW in males than females is consistent with previous studies [  ]. The posterior mean and posterior standard deviations (PSD) of genetic variance  residual variance  and heritability for the 12 original traits and the eight derived traits of RFI are in Table   in which all trait abbreviations are also summarized. All the reported parameters are posterior means  which were computed as averages of 3000 samples from the posterior distribution. For ease of presentation and interpretation of the results  comparison of genetic parameters for males and females is limited to the same age  and comparison of genetic parameters for the two ages is limited to the same sex in “” and “” sections. The genetic variance of BW for males and females was significantly different  males having a larger genetic variance than females at both ages. However  heritability estimates were higher for females than males at both ages. Similarly  the genetic variance of BW was significantly different at both ages and decreased as the weighing age decreased from  to  days. However  the heritability estimates of BW increased slightly as weighing age decreased due to the relatively higher residual variance at the older age than the younger age. Unlike BW traits  the heritability estimates of FI  Gain   and  were higher for males than females at both ages except for  at  days of age for which heritability estimates were the same for males and females. The posterior means of the heritability estimates of FI and Gain were low to moderate (0.19–0.38) for males and females at both ages  with males having significantly higher estimates than females. Moreover  the genetic variance and heritability estimates of FI were significantly higher than that of Gain for males and females at both ages (Table ). The heritability estimates of the two RFI definitions were low (0.14–0.28); with  having slightly higher heritability estimates than  for both sexes and at both ages. This was followed by a slightly higher genetic variance for  than  and higher residual variance for  than  for both sexes and at both ages. The posterior means of the genetic correlations between the 12 traits included in the multivariate model are in Table . PSD of correlations are not shown to simplify presentation of results  however  they were within a lower range (0.01–0.06). The posterior mean of the genetic correlation of BW (PSD in parentheses) between males and females at  days was 0.90 (0.02) and the genetic correlation of BW between males and females at  days was 0.90 (0.03). The genetic correlations of FI between males and females were 0.82 (0.04) and 0.86 (0.04) at  and  days of age  respectively. The genetic correlations of Gain between males and females were 0.75 (0.06) and 0.81 (0.06) at  and  days of age  respectively with genetic correlations being significantly higher at early ages ( days) than later ages () for both FI and Gain. Posterior means of genetic correlations between BW and FI were moderate (0.49–0.63) for males and females at both ages. Genetic correlations between BW and Gain were also moderate (0.30–0.50) for males and females at both ages  except for the low genetic correlation (0.25) between BW and Gain for males at  days of age. Genetic correlations between FI and Gain were high (0.82–0.90) for males and females at both ages (Table ). Posterior means of genetic correlations between the two RFI definitions are in Table . Genetic correlations between  and  at the same sex and age were high and significantly different from 1 at  days of age  however  at  days of age  genetic correlations were not significantly different from 1 (Table ). Genetic and phenotypic correlations between production traits and the two RFI definitions are in Table .  was derived using genetic partial regression coefficients of FI on production traits. Therefore  the posterior mean of genetic correlations between  and BW at the same sex and age were equal to 0 (results not shown) and the genetic correlations between  and BW at the same sex and age were low (0.04–0.24) but different from 0 (Table ). Similarly   was derived using phenotypic partial regression coefficients of FI on production traits. Therefore  phenotypic correlations between  and BW at the same sex and age were equal to 0 (results not shown) and phenotypic correlations between  and BW at the same sex and age were low (-<U+2009>0.002 to -<U+2009>0.15) but different from 0 (Table ). The same holds true for genetic and phenotypic correlations between the two RFI definitions and Gain. Posterior means of genetic correlations between  and Gain at the same sex and age were confirmed to be 0 (results not shown) and genetic correlations between  and Gain at the same sex and age were low to moderate (0.11–0.32) (Table ). Similarly  phenotypic correlations between  and Gain at the same sex and age were confirmed to be 0 (results not shown) and phenotypic correlations between  and Gain at the same sex and age were low (-<U+2009>0.09 to -<U+2009>0.27) but different from 0 (Table ). Estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations between FI and the two RFI definitions are in Table . The correlations were moderate for both males and females and at the two ages  with higher genetic correlations between FI and  (0.51–0.66) than between FI and  (0.39–0.45). Phenotypic correlations between FI and  at the same sex and age ranged from 0.48 to 0.57  and phenotypic correlations between FI and  at the same sex and age ranged from 0.31 to 0.43  but were lower than the genetic correlations between FI and the two RFI definitions (Table ). Table  shows the posterior mean of the direct and correlated genetic level of the selected groups under single trait selection for low  and . Direct selection for low  in males at  days of age resulted in a direct selection response of -<U+2009>63.0 g and a correlated response of decreasing  by 55.6 g at the same age for males. Similarly  direct selection for low  in males at  days of age resulted in a direct selection response of -<U+2009>59.4 g and a correlated response of decreasing  by 59.0 g at the same age in males. As shown in Table   the correlated response in  from direct selection on  was slightly different at  days of age  however  the correlated response in  was the same as the direct response on  at both ages. The slight differences in the correlated response at  days of age might be because the genetic correlations between  and  at  days of were significantly different from 1. Table  shows the posterior means of the genetic level of the selected groups for correlated traits under single trait selection for low  or . Direct selection for low  at  days of age in males had a correlated response of decreasing FI by 98.2 g  while decreasing BW and Gain by 17.3 and 33.8 g  respectively at  days of age in males. Thus  direct selection for low  had a favorable correlated response of decreasing FI by a relatively larger amount than decreasing BW and Gain. Moreover  direct selection for low  in males at  days of age resulted in a correlated response of decreasing FI by 58.2 g at the same age in males  with no significant change in BW and Gain. Similarly  direct selection for low  in females at  days decreased FI by -<U+2009>43.2 g  with no significant change on BW and Gain at  days of age in females (Table ). As expected from the definition  direct selection on  did not show considerable correlated response on BW and Gain at the same sex and age  however  it resulted in a correlated response of decreasing FI (Table ). We used a Bayesian method to analyze genetic parameters for production and feed efficiency traits for male and female broiler chickens recorded at two different ages  to derive phenotypic and genetic RFI  and to estimate a Bayesian measure of direct and correlated superiority of a group of animals selected on feed efficiency traits. The Bayesian method allows posterior means of the two RFI definitions to be derived simultaneously within the model  with their posterior standard deviations  while integrating over all unknown model parameters  including “fixed” and dispersion parameters. Different authors have estimated genetic parameters for BW of males and females at different ages of broiler chickens and reported heritability estimates ranging from 0.20 to 0.53 [    ]. Our heritability estimates of BW for males and females were moderate (0.31–0.37) at both ages and within the range of those in previous studies. Moreover  our results showed that the genetic variance of BW was higher for males than females at both ages. The higher genetic variance for males than females might be partly due to a scale effect because males had a higher mean BW than females at a given age; however  the heritability estimates were significantly higher for females than for males due to higher residual variance for males. The genetic correlation of BW between males and females was significantly different from 1 at both ages  which is in agreement with results of Mebratie et al. []. The difference in heritability estimates between BW for males and females  and the lower than 1 genetic correlations of BW between males and females suggest that there is sex-by-genotype interaction for BW in broiler chickens. This implies that  genes may react differently in male and female “physiological environments” due to differences in hormonal regulations or growth metabolism in male and female broiler chickens []. The proportion of phenotypic variance that was due to maternal permanent environmental effects was low in the current study but not negligible. This might be due to the relatively older age of the birds since a maternal permanent environmental effect often influences birds at an early age and decreases as they grow older  which is in agreement with different studies in poultry [      ]. The genetic variance and heritability estimates of BW differed between the two ages and the genetic correlation of BW between the two ages was significantly different from 1. This is consistent with Mebratie et al. []  who reported different heritability estimates for BW at three ages and genetic correlations (standard errors in parenthesis) of BW between the three ages that ranged from 0.81 (0.05) to 0.97 (0.01) in broiler chickens. Aslam et al. [] also reported genetic correlations between BW at six ages that ranged from 0.86 (0.06) to 0.98 (0.01) in turkeys  which significantly deviated from 1. Differences in heritability estimates between the two ages and genetic correlations of BW between the two ages suggest that genes that affect BW might change with age in broiler chickens. This confirms the statement by Schaeffer []  which highlighted that there are genes  which “turn on” and “turn off” with age of animals  causing changes in physiology and performance. Alternatively  the same genes may increase or decrease in their effect. In general  the different heritability estimates of BW for males and females and the lower than 1 genetic correlations of BW between males and females at the two ages suggest that there is sex-by-genotype interaction for BW and that the genetic background of BW might be partly different in male and female broiler chickens. Similarly  heritability estimates of BW at the two ages and the genetic correlations of BW between the two ages suggest that there is an age-by-genotype interaction for BW and that the genetic background of BW in broiler chickens changes between the two ages. Therefore  genetic evaluation of BW in broiler chickens should take sex and age differences in to account  otherwise assuming genetic correlations of 1 between sexes and ages and average heritability estimates across sexes and ages may decrease the accuracy of selection and genetic gain. One can argue that the genetic correlations are too high to make such a conclusion  however  they are significantly different from 1  thus male and female records as well as records at the two ages cannot simply be considered as the same trait. Instead  phenotypes on male and females and at the two ages should be considered as separate traits in order to maximize the accuracy of predicted breeding values. Considering male and female records and records at the two ages as separate traits will of course cost extra computation time  but this is negligible compared to the very expensive selection experiments and the potential improvement in accuracy and genetic gain. The heritability estimates of FI and Gain for males and females at the two ages were moderate (0.26–0.38) but lower than those reported by Aggrey et al. []  i.e. 0.46 and 0.48 at 5 and 6 weeks of age  respectively. These authors also reported heritability estimates of 0.48 and 0.51 for Gain at 5 and 6 weeks of age in broiler chickens  respectively. However  our estimates are slightly higher than those of Begli et al. []  who reported average heritability estimates of 0.24 for FI in chickens from weeks 2 to 10  and of Case et al. []  who reported heritability estimates of 0.25 for FI in turkeys. Similar to the observed sex and age differences in genetic parameters for BW  the different heritability estimates for FI and Gain between males and females and the genetic correlations between them that were significantly different from 1 suggest that there is a sex-by-genotype interaction for FI and Gain. Moreover  the higher genetic correlations for FI and Gain between males and females at the earlier age () than at the later age () suggest that there is a sex-by-age interaction for FI and Gain that increases with age  as the broilers start to attain sexual maturity. The significantly different heritability estimates of FI and Gain in males and females and the genetic correlations between sexes  which differed significantly from 1  suggest that the genetic background of these traits might be partially different in males and females. Similarly  the significantly different heritability estimates for FI and Gain at the two ages and the genetic correlations of the traits between the two ages  which differed significantly from 1  suggest that there is an age-by-genotype interaction between these traits. Moreover  it suggests that the genetic background of FI and Gain might differ partly between the two ages. Therefore  models for the genetic analysis of the two traits should consider the sex and age in order to increase accuracy of selection and genetic gain. The moderate genetic correlation (0.30–0.50) within production traits (BW and Gain) and between BW and FI (0.49–0.63)  as well as the high genetic correlation between FI and Gain (0.82–0.89) in the current study  is not surprising since higher BW and Gain might require higher feed intake and vice versa. Case et al. [] reported a genetic correlation of 0.67 between BW and FI and a genetic correlation of 0.41 between BW and Gain in turkeys. Previous studies have reported low to moderate heritability estimates (0.10–0.49) for phenotypic RFI for male and female broiler chickens at different ages [    ]. In pigs  Shirali et al. [] reported low heritability estimates for  (0.20 (0.03)) and  (0.15 (0.03))  respectively. Our heritability estimates of  (0.18–0.28) were within the range of those previously reported in chickens; although heritability estimates of  are rare in the literature; our estimates (0.14–0.26) were within the range of previous estimates of  in broiler chickens. In addition  the estimates of genetic variance and heritability for  were higher than for  (0.14–0.26)  which was expected since the genetic variance of  is influenced by the residual covariance between the component traits of feed intake and production traits  in contrast to the genetic variance of  []. Estimates of heritability for  and  differed significantly between males and females and at the same age and between the two ages for the same sex. The significantly lower than 1 genetic correlations of the two RFI definitions between males and females at the same age  suggest that there is a sex-by-genotype interaction for these traits. Similarly  the significantly lower than 1 genetic correlations for the two RFI definitions between  and  days at the same sex suggest that there is an age-by-genotype interaction for these traits. In agreement with our findings  Aggrey et al. [] noted a moderate but significantly lower than 1 genetic correlation of 0.59 between phenotypic RFI of broiler chickens measured at two ages (28–35 and 35–42 days of age). In our study  estimates of the genetic correlation between  and  were high but significantly different from 1 at  days of age for both sexes  however at  days of age the genetic correlations were high and not significantly different from 1. This suggests that selection for FE using either of these measures in breeding programs will yield the same genetic response at  days but may not result in the same response at  days of age. Shirali et al. [] conditioned FI on average daily gain and a body composition trait (lean meat percentage) and reported a genetic correlation (standard error in parentheses) of 0.92 (0.04) between  and  in pigs  which was high but significantly different from 1. The non-zero estimates of the genetic correlations (0.04–0.32) between  and production traits (BW and Gain) in our study were as expected based on the definition of  since it is a component of FI that is phenotypically  but not genetically  independent of production traits. Genetic correlations of  with production traits can vary considerably in sign and magnitude  depending on the genetic and phenotypic parameters of its component traits []. Moreover  the genetic covariance of  with production traits involves the environmental covariance between feed intake and production traits  therefore the partial phenotypic regression coefficients of  and production traits do not ensure that  is genetically independent of production traits []. According to Kennedy et al. []   will be genetically independent of production traits only if the heritabilities of FI and production traits are equal and the genetic correlations between them are equal to the corresponding environmental correlations. In the same context  the phenotypic correlation between  and production traits is not necessarily 0  except when heritabilities of FI and production traits are equal and the genetic correlations between FI and production traits are equal to their corresponding environmental correlations []. Our results confirm this  since the phenotypic correlations of  with production traits were low (-<U+2009>0.002 to -<U+2009>0.27)  whereas the phenotypic correlations of  with production traits were 0. Aggrey et al. [] reported low (-<U+2009>0.05 to 0.06) genetic correlations of  with average daily gain and moderate genetic correlations (0.31–0.45) of  with metabolic BW in broiler chickens. In pigs  Shirali et al. [] reported a moderate genetic correlation (0.35) between  and average daily gain and phenotypic correlations of -<U+2009>0.30 between  and average daily gain. The estimate of the genetic variance of FI was considerably and significantly higher than the estimate for either  or  for males and females at the two ages  which means that most of the variation for FI is determined by production traits (BW and Gain). For example  at  days of age  84.3 and 82.2% of the genetic variation in FI is determined by production traits for males and females  respectively. Moreover  heritability estimates were considerably lower for  and  than for FI at both ages  which might be because the genetic correlations between FI and production traits were higher than the environmental correlations between the traits. Kennedy et al. [] reported that the genetic variability in  relative to feed intake depends on the phenotypic correlation between FI and production traits (BW and Gain)  which is a function of the heritabilities of FI  the heritabilities of production traits as well as the genetic and environmental correlations between FI and production traits. The heritability of  increases as the genetic covariance between FI and production traits decreases and as the environmental correlation between feed intake and production traits increases relative to the genetic correlation []. Estimates of genetic correlations between FI and  ranged from 0.51 to 0.66  which is in line with the results of Kennedy et al. []  who stated that genetic correlations between FI and  are highly positive except  when the heritability of FI is low compared to that of the production traits and their genetic and environmental correlations are both high. In such situations  the genetic correlation between FI and  can be even negative []. In our study  genetic correlations between FI and  were higher than between FI and  because the genetic correlation between FI and  involves the environmental covariance between FI and production traits  in contrast to the genetic correlation between FI and . In addition  the phenotypic correlations between FI and the two RFI definitions being lower than their corresponding genetic correlations might indicate that the environmental covariance between FI and production traits is lower than the corresponding genetic covariance. Pym and Nichols [] noted that phenotypic correlations between traits such as BW  Gain  FI and feed conversion ratio are generally lower than their corresponding genetic correlations. Aggrey et al. [] reported genetic correlations of 0.51 and 0.56 between FI and  in broiler chickens at 35–42 and 28–35 days of age  respectively  which are in line with our estimates at  days of age. Our results show that direct selection on one of the 12 traits included in the model results in a positive correlated response on the other traits  including a positive correlated response in FI (results not shown)  which is not desirable. The observed positive correlated responses for the traits in our study is a reflection of the moderate to high positive genetic correlations between them. The Bayesian analysis suggested that direct selection for low  does not result in a correlated response in production traits since the model ensures that genetic correlations between  and production traits are 0. However  direct selection for low  results in a correlated response in production traits since  is derived using phenotypic partial regression coefficients  which ensure that phenotypic correlations between phenotypic RFI and production traits are zero but genetic correlations between the traits are not necessarily 0. The correlated response in FI to selection for low  was very similar to the direct response to selection for low  at the same sex and age. This is in agreement with Kennedy et al. []  who noted that the direct response in  is expected to be equal to the correlated response in FI when selection is on  because there is no change in FI due to BW and production. However  direct genetic response for  and correlated response for FI will only be equal when there is no correlated response for production traits. Otherwise  the correlated response for FI to direct selection of  depends partly on the correlated response in production traits. If the correlated response for production is positive  FI will decrease less which also means a positive response for FI  which is not desirable  and vice versa. Superiority of the selected group was slightly but not significantly lower when selection was for  compared to selection for  in our study. This is in agreement with Kennedy et al. [] who reported that response to selection for low  is less than or equal to response to selection for low  because selection for low  results in a reduction of the proportion of feed intake used for production. Moreover  Kennedy et al. [] noted that response to selection for  increases if the genetic correlation between feed intake and production traits is low or the heritability of feed intake is higher than the heritability of production traits. In our study  the heritability of FI was higher than that of production traits; however  the genetic correlation between FI and production traits was moderate to high. Our results show that selection for FE based on  or  gives the same genetic response at  days but might result in a different response at  days of age in both sexes. Since   captures the efficiency of birds in nutrient utilization irrespective of energy requirements for production and maintenance  it is easier to explain results from selection on  to stakeholders than selection on FI or   which are not genetically independent of production traits. Genetic parameters were estimated simultaneously for feed intake  body weight  and body weight gain using a multi-trait Bayesian analysis. The heritability estimates of the traits were moderately high but significantly different between males and females at the same age. Moreover  estimates of the genetic correlation for BW  FI and Gain between males and females at the same age were significantly different from 1  which suggests that these traits are influenced by a sex-by-genotype interaction in addition to direct genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects. Similarly  the different heritability estimates for BW  FI and Gain between the two ages within sexes and estimates of genetic correlations of BW  FI and Gain between the two ages within sexes show that there is an age-by-genotype interaction for these traits. In our study  heritability estimates for  and  differed significantly between sexes and between the two ages. Furthermore  estimates of the genetic correlation between the two RFI definitions were significantly different from 1 at an older age but not at a younger age. Direct selection for low  resulted in a decrease in FI and a decrease in production traits  whereas direct selection for low  resulted in a correlated response of decreasing FI  without a significant change in production traits.

In this context  the goal of our study was to understand the impact of genomic selection on the genetic diversity of bulls from three French dairy cattle breeds born between 2005 and 2015 (Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein) and the factors that are involved. We compared annual genetic gains  inbreeding rates based on runs of homozygosity (ROH) and pedigree data  and mean ROH length within breeds  before and after the implementation of genomic selection. Genomic selection induced an increase in mean annual genetic gains of 50  71 and 33% for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein bulls  respectively  and in parallel  the generation intervals were reduced by a factor of 1.7  1.9 and 2  respectively.

The mean ROH length was longer for bulls from the Holstein breed than for those from the other two breeds. With the implementation of genomic selection  the annual genetic gain increased for bulls from the three major French dairy cattle breeds. At the same time  the annual loss of genetic diversity increased for Holstein bulls  possibly because of the massive use of a few elite bulls in this breed  but not for Montbéliarde and Normande bulls. The increase in mean ROH length in Holstein may reflect the occurrence of recent inbreeding. New strategies in breeding schemes  such as female donor stations and embryo transfer  and recent implementation of genomic evaluations in small regional breeds should be studied carefully in order to ensure the sustainability of breeding schemes in the future. In France  genomic evaluations started to be implemented in dairy cattle breeds in 2009. After a brief transition period for the breeding companies to adopt this technology  these new evaluation methods have drastically changed dairy cattle breeding schemes since 2011. Genomic evaluations have allowed breeding companies to increase the number of male candidates for selection and the use of new bulls [  ]. At the early selection stage  genomic selection (GS) allows exploiting a major part of the genetic variance compared to the previously used models based on parents’ average values [  ]. In fact  Mendelian sampling variation  which is defined as the difference between the genetic value of an individual and the average of the parental genetic values  can be captured from molecular markers without any information on the parents’ phenotype or the offspring’s phenotype. This makes it possible to obtain breeding values with higher reliability sooner in the life of an individual compared with those based on pedigree data []. Indeed  the estimation of pedigree-based breeding values at birth depends mostly on information about related individuals  resulting in a low reliability and a high correlation between estimated breeding values of relatives. These high correlations decrease only later in the life of an animal when information based on its own performance or performances of the progeny becomes available. Consequently  GS reduces the number of related individuals chosen as candidates for selection []. Moreover  collecting genotype data is less expensive than collecting phenotype data  which means that more male candidates can be evaluated with high reliability. Furthermore  methods to balance inbreeding and genetic gain in breeding schemes  such as optimal contribution selection []  allow for better conservation of genetic diversity when based on genomic information rather than on pedigree data [  ]. Thus  GS was expected to reduce the rate of inbreeding and to increase genetic gain per generation at the same time []. However  since animals with high genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) can be selected as parents at a very young age  generation intervals are significantly shortened []. As a result  the annual inbreeding rate could then increase and this has already been observed in Dutch-Flemish Holstein–Friesian cattle [] and in North American Holstein cattle []. Such an increase in inbreeding rate results in a loss of genetic diversity  with lower additive genetic variance leading to a lower response to selection []. Moreover  a lower overall genetic variability leads also to a loss of adaptive potential for selecting new breeding goals in the context of climate change []  and more severe inbreeding depression [  ]. Measuring genetic diversity is necessary in order to manage it. Typically  genetic diversity is estimated and managed with the help of inbreeding and kinship coefficients based on pedigree data (e.g. [  ]). These coefficients reflect the proportion of genome expected to be identical-by-descent (IBD) in an individual and between two individuals  respectively. The reliability of these estimates depends on the quality of the pedigree records and their depth [    ]. In particular  pedigree-based inbreeding and kinship may be underestimated due to incomplete pedigree data and the assumption of arbitrary non-inbred and unrelated founder individuals  thus leading to an overestimation of genetic diversity. Falling costs in the field of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing make it possible to obtain more and more genotyping data  and thus to estimate genetic diversity more precisely. These data allow the computation of inbreeding coefficients and genomic relationship matrices (GRM) [  ]. The calculation of inbreeding coefficients from GRM computed using all the allele frequencies set to 0.5 globally consists in computing observed and expected proportions of homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered as identical-by-state (IBS). Another method to estimate genetic diversity consists in detecting IBD segments  called runs of homozygosity (ROH)  by considering that segments of consecutive homozygous SNPs originate from common ancestors [  ]. Thus  it is possible to compute ROH-based inbreeding coefficients defined as the proportion of the autosomal genome that is actually included in ROH above a given length threshold []  corresponding to the realized proportion of genome that is IBD. This approach to estimate inbreeding coefficients seems to reflect IBD better than genomic inbreeding coefficients calculated from molecular data based on the GRM [    ]. The length of such ROH segments follows an inverse exponential distribution with expectation 1/2G Morgan  with G being the number of generations to the common ancestor from which the segment arises (e.g. []). Due to recombination  ROH length tends to decrease over generations [  ]  which allows to estimate the age of inbreeding events along the genome and to trace back population history [    ]. Shorter ROH tend to result from older inbreeding (older common ancestors) whereas longer ROH tend to result from more recent inbreeding (more recent common ancestors) [    ]. However  different criteria have been proposed to define ROH-based inbreeding estimates and there is no consensus about which one should be preferred (e.g. the number of heterozygous loci allowed in one ROH  the minimal length  etc.). Consequently  ROH-based inbreeding estimates might differ  depending on the criteria used []. Pedigree data are useful to evaluate genetic diversity for individuals that are not genotyped  whereas measures based on molecular data (such as ROH) allow the study of the realized proportion of genome that is autozygous and the pattern of inbreeding along the genome. In spite of their advantage over pedigree-based inbreeding estimates  genomic-based estimates began to be used to manage genetic diversity in selection programs only recently [  ]. In this context  the goal of our study was to understand the impact of GS on genetic diversity in three French dairy cattle breeds: Montbéliarde and Normande  two national breeds  and Holstein  an international breed. We measured the relative changes in rates of genetic merit and in three different estimates of genetic diversity: (i) pedigree-based inbreeding and kinship  (ii) ROH-based inbreeding coefficients  and (iii) mean length of ROH; and these estimates were taken before and after the implementation of GS in these three breeds in France. Based on our findings  we compare pedigree and ROH-based inbreeding rates within breeds and explore the changes in breeding schemes that could explain the differences observed between national and international breeds. We used three datasets that consisted of all progeny-tested bulls born between 2005 and 2010 and all marketed bulls born between 2012 and 2015 from three French dairy cattle breeds: 1307 Montbéliarde bulls and 1016 Normande bulls (national breeds)  and 4694 Holstein bulls (international breed) (see Table  and Fig. ). We chose these categories of bulls in order to obtain cohorts of comparable sizes and to compare bulls that are selected for artificial insemination by breeding companies (either to be marketed or to be tested). Key data about these breeds in France are available in Additional file : Table S1. Breeding schemes of bulls under progeny testing () and genomic () selection Genealogies of all bulls in the three datasets were traced back as far as possible. The mean numbers of generations traced back for bulls in the datasets were 15.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.7  15.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.6 and 15.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.9 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively (longest paths computed with R [] package pedigree []). All the bulls in the datasets were genotyped for 50 K SNPs (Illumina Infinium BovineSNP50 BeadChip). Quality control filtering was performed by removing SNPs that were genotyped in less than 95% individuals and SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 1%. No individual had less than 95% genotyped SNPs. After quality control filtering  39 992  40 135 and 41 377 SNPs remained in the datasets for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  with on average one SNP every 62.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>66.5 kb  62.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>66.4 kb and 60.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>63.8 kb  respectively. The total genetic merit index ISU (standing for ) is an individual index that combines production  functional and type traits  which are weighted depending on the breed and subsequent breeding goals. The formula to obtain total genetic merit index ISU is built in order to obtain a standard error of the index of 20 points within each breed []. Within each breed  all genetic merit estimates were calculated relative to the same arbitrary base. Pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients  and kinship coefficients  were computed with the Pedig software [] for all the animals in the three datasets. The mean of all kinship coefficients  for bulls born between 2005 and 2010 and the mean of all kinship coefficients  for bulls born between 2012 and 2015 were compared with a two-sample  test. We also computed pedigree-based coefficients by taking only the last five generations for each bull into account  with the Pedig software [] for all animals in the three datasets. ROH reflect autozygous segments of the genome. A ROH was defined as a homozygous segment of at least 15 SNPs or 1000 kb long  with at least one SNP per 75 kb. Two consecutive SNPs could not be included in the same ROH if they were more than 150 kb apart. ROH were detected using the PLINK 1.9 “homozyg” function [  ] (command line: plink --cow --bfile genotyping_data_filename --homozyg --homozyg-kb 1000 --homozyg-snp 15 --homozyg-window-snp 15 --homozyg-density 75 --homozyg-gap 150 --out output_filename). ROH-based inbreeding estimates    were computed as the proportion of genome included in ROH [  ] as follows: where  is the total length of ROH for individual   and  the length of the autosomal genome covered by SNPs after withholding gaps longer than 150 kb between two SNPs  corresponding to the length of the autosomal genome on which ROH can be detected. These parameters allowed the detection of ROH on 77.0  77.0 and 78.6% of the autosomal genome of Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein bulls  respectively (see Additional file : Table S2). For each individual  the mean ROH length  i.e.   was computed as: where  is the total length of ROH for individual  in kb  and  the total number of ROH for individual . Pearson’s product-moment correlations between pedigree- and ROH-based inbreeding coefficients were computed for each breed in order to check if it was relevant to compare both inbreeding estimates. To compare the variability of pedigree and ROH-based inbreeding rates  we calculated the coefficient of variation of these two parameters within each breed as the ratio between the overall standard deviation of inbreeding and its overall mean for each dataset. We obtained approximate inbreeding rates per generation for a selection type by multiplying the mean inbreeding rate by the mean parental generation interval for this period (in years) (see Additional file : Table S3). Generation interval  was computed with an adapted version of Pedig software [].  was defined as the mean difference between the birthdate of an individual and its parents  in months. For each breed  the number of bulls born per year was divided by the number of bulls born in 2005 in the three datasets  giving : where  is the number of bulls born in year . The effective number of bulls    for a given breed and a given type of selection was computed as: where  is the number of bulls for a given breed and a given type of selection and  the number of offspring of bull  [  ]. We also computed the effective/census number of bulls ratio  . The two types of selection were progeny testing selection (PTS) (individuals born between 2005 and 2010)  and genomic selection (GS) (individuals born between 2012 and 2014). 95% confidence intervals for  and  were generated by random resampling with replacement of the datasets (bootstrap with 1000 iterations). For a given breed   and   or  and  were statistically different if confidence intervals did not overlap. In order to assess the impact of GS on genetic diversity and genetic gain  we used the following linear model  using the R function lm []: where  is the variable of interest for bull  (       for genetic diversity and ISU for genetic gain)   is the birth year of bull   and  the associated coefficient of regression if bull  was born between 2005 and 2010 (PTS) or  if born between 2012 and 2015 (GS). The impact of GS was measured with the  coefficient. Its significance was tested with an analysis of variance. The quality of linear regressions was checked by looking at the square root of the standardized residuals of each linear regression (see Additional file : Figures S1–S7). The relative change    of the slopes of regression before and after GS was computed as: For a better interpretation of relative change  please note that the sign of  quantifies the direction of the change of the slopes (if <U+2009>><U+2009>0  the new slope will be higher than the previous slope and if <U+2009><<U+2009>0  it will be lower) and its absolute value quantifies the magnitude of the change of the slopes. The total genetic merit index ISU increased at a significantly higher rate in Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein under GS (between 2012 and 2015) than under PTS (between 2005 and 2010)  with respective relative changes of 0.50  0.71 and 0.33 (see Table  and Fig. a). The slopes of ISU during GS are equivalent to increases of<U+2009>~<U+2009>4.4  5.0 and 7.4% per year relative to the mean genetic merit ISU in 2012 of 111  118 and 139 points for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. Trends of the different parameters estimating genetic gain and genetic diversity. The yellow line represents the mean for each birth year and the error bars the standard deviation. Total merit indices (ISU) ()  inbreeding () and kinship () based on pedigree data  inbreeding based on runs of homozygosity (ROH) () and mean ROH length (in kb) () were retrieved or computed for progeny-tested bulls born between 2005 and 2010 and for marketed bulls born between 2012 and 2015  for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein Pedigree-based inbreeding rates increased significantly in Normande and Holstein under GS schemes (between 2012 and 2015) compared to PTS (between 2005 and 2010)  i.e. from 0.059 to 0.088% per year to 0.19 and 0.49% per year for Normande and Holstein  respectively (from 0.34 to 0.46% per generation to 0.70 and 1.39% per generation  respectively) with respective relative changes of 2.20 and 4.50 (see Table ). This was not the case in Montbéliarde  for which the inbreeding rate per year between 2005 and 2010 was 0.090% (0.52% per generation) (see Table ). In 2005  the overall pedigree-based inbreeding level in Holstein did not differ significantly from that in Montbéliarde and Normande (see Fig. b). However  in 2015  the pedigree-based inbreeding level was significantly higher in Holstein than in Montbéliarde (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10) and Normande (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10) (see Fig. b). The slopes of pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients during GS are equivalent to increases of<U+2009>~<U+2009>2.0  3.5 and 8.9% per year of the mean pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients in 2012 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. For inbreeding coefficients based on pedigree and calculated over the last five generations only  the slope of regression was negative during PTS for the three breeds. Under GS  it decreased significantly for Montbéliarde and Normande  reaching -<U+2009>0.32% and -<U+2009>0.23% per year  respectively (-<U+2009>1.22% and -<U+2009>0.86% per generation  respectively)  whereas it increased significantly for Holstein  reaching 0.27% per year (0.78% per generation) (Fig. ) (see Additional file : Tables S4  S5). Pedigree-based inbreeding calculated from the last five generations. The yellow line represents the mean pedigree-based inbreeding calculated from the last five generations for each birth year and the error bars the standard deviation. Pedigree-based inbreeding calculated from the last five generations was computed for progeny-tested bulls born between 2005 and 2010 and for marketed bulls born between 2012 and 2015  for Montbéliarde ()  Normande () and Holstein () Pedigree-based kinship increased at a significantly higher rate in Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein under GS (between 2012 and 2015) than under PTS (between 2005 and 2010)  with respective relative changes of 0.91  1.64 and 0.092 (see Table ). The slopes of pedigree-based kinship coefficients during GS are equivalent to increases of about -<U+2009>0.20  1.1 and 3.1% per year of the mean pedigree-based kinship coefficients in 2012 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively (see Fig. c). In Montbéliarde and Normande  pedigree-based kinship coefficients seemed to plateau during both PTS and GS  although we observed a drop in the average pedigree-based kinship in Montbéliarde in 2008 (see Fig. c). The mean value of pedigree-based kinship coefficients was significantly lower for Montbéliarde born between 2012 and 2015 than for Montbéliarde bulls born between 2005 and 2010 (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10)  as well as for Normande bulls (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10) (see Fig. c). By contrast  this value was significantly higher for Holstein bulls born between 2012 and 2015 than for those born between 2005 and 2010 (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10) (see Fig. c). The rate of ROH-based inbreeding increased significantly in Holstein under GS (between 2012 and 2015) compared to under PTS (between 2005 and 2010)  i.e. from 0.080% per year to 0.55% per year for Holstein (from 0.39% to 1.36% per generation) with a relative change of 5.93 (see Table ). This was not the case for Montbéliarde and Normande  for which inbreeding rates of 0.17 and 0.12% per year were found between 2005 and 2010  respectively (0.96 and 0.71% per generation) (see Table ). In 2005  the overall ROH-based inbreeding level in Montbéliarde was significantly lower than that in Normande and Holstein (-values<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0031 and 2.1e-08  respectively) (see Fig. d). However  in 2015  the level of ROH-based inbreeding was significantly higher in Holstein than in Montbéliarde and Normande (-values<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10  in both cases) (see Fig. d). The slopes of ROH-based inbreeding coefficients during GS are equivalent to increases of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.8  1.4 and 5.4% per year of the mean ROH-based inbreeding coefficients in 2012 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. Mean ROH length increased at a significantly higher rate in Holstein under GS (between 2012 and 2015) than under PTS (between 2005 and 2010)  with a relative change of 7.77 (see Table ). This was not the case in Montbéliarde and in Normande  for which the mean ROH length plateaued under GS (see Fig. e). From 2005 to 2015  the overall mean ROH length for Montbéliarde was significantly shorter than that for Normande  which in turn was significantly shorter than that for Holstein (-values<U+2009><<U+2009>1e-10 in all cases  with average mean ROH lengths of 1.68  1.71 and 1.80 Mb  respectively) (see Fig. c). The slopes of mean ROH lengths during GS showed increases of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.005  0.07 and 0.7% per year of the mean ROH lengths in 2012 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. Pearson’s product-moment correlation between pedigree- and ROH-based inbreeding coefficients were equal to 59% (95% confidence interval: [55%  62%])  50% [45%  55%] and 59% [57%  61%] for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. Coefficients of variation of pedigree-based inbreeding were equal to 0.33  0.25 and 0.31 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. Coefficients of variation of ROH-based inbreeding were equal to 0.22  0.18 and 0.21 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively. The mean difference  between the birthdate of an individual and its parents reached a plateau at<U+2009>~<U+2009>70 months in Montbéliarde and in Normande  and 59 months in Holstein between 2005 and 2009.  was reduced by a factor 1.7 in Montbéliarde  by 1.9 in Normande and by a factor 2 in Holstein between animals born between 2005 and 2009 (under PTS) and animals born in 2015 (under GS). To date  this interval has not reached a new plateau for the three breeds (see Fig. ). Parental generation intervals  (in months).  were defined as the difference between the birthdate of an individual and its parents’ (in months). The yellow line represents the mean for each birth year and the error bars the standard deviation. Generation intervals  were computed for progeny-tested bulls born between 2005 and 2010 and for marketed bulls born between 2012 and 2015  for Montbéliarde ()  Normande () and Holstein () A histogram of the proportion of the total number of offspring per bull for each breed and selection type is available in Additional file : Figure S8 and Additional file : Table S6. The ratio between number of marketed bulls born in 2014 and number of progeny-tested bulls born in 2005 was equal to 77.6% (128 compared to 165) in Montbéliarde  70.4% (88 compared to 125) in Normande  and 50.7% (294 compared to 580) in Holstein (see Fig. ). Proportion of bulls born each year in comparison with 2005. Proportions were computed for progeny-tested bulls born between 2005 and 2010 and for marketed bulls born between 2012 and 2015  for Montbéliarde (green)  Normande (blue) and Holstein (red) The effective number of bulls used was significantly larger between 2005 and 2010 (under PTS) than between 2012 and 2014 (under GS) in Normande and Holstein  but not in Montbéliarde (see Fig. ). The ratio of the effective and the actual number of bulls ratio under PTS    was significantly lower than the same ratio under GS    in Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  with  of 0.009  0.021 and 0.003%  respectively (see Fig. ).

Black bars represent 95% confidence intervals  generated by random resampling with replacement of the datasets (bootstrap with 1000 iterations) Effective/census number of bulls ratios of three French dairy cattle breeds. Effective number of bulls/Number of bulls ratios  were computed for progeny-tested bulls for individuals born between 2005 and 2010 for progeny testing selection (blue) and for marketed bulls born between 2012 and 2015 for genomic selection (red) for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein. Black bars represent 95% confidence intervals  generated by random resampling with replacement of the datasets (bootstrap with 1000 iterations) In dairy cattle breeds  GS was expected to increase the annual genetic gain by up to 70 to 108% depending on the scenarios used for the breeding schemes (with different proportions of young genotypes bulls and proven bulls used) [    ] but only a few studies have examined its impact on genetic diversity. These studies were preliminary and mainly predictive since they were conducted before GS had really started. Genomic evaluations were implemented in 2009 in French dairy cattle breeds [] and they have drastically changed dairy cattle breeding schemes for the three major French dairy cattle breeds. Thus  after a decade of GS  we can evaluate the impact of new breeding schemes on both the genetic gain and diversity in these three breeds in France. The Holstein  Montbéliarde and Normande breeds in France vary in population size with 628 000  319 000  2 402 000 cows  respectively  as of January 2018 []. These breeds differ also in terms of breeding program: the Holstein breed is widespread and genetic material is exchanged globally ( it is an international breed)  whereas Montbéliarde and Normande are French typical breeds managed at the country level ( national breeds). Thus  the results drawn from our study can compare these two situations. To conduct this study  we focused on bulls of these three breeds born between 2005 and 2010 for PTS  and bulls born between 2012 and 2015 for GS. An increase in annual genetic gain with GS has been observed in most dairy cattle populations. For instance  in the US Holstein cattle breed  the annual genetic gain for milk  fat and protein yield in cows born before or after 2010 has increased by 71  111 and 81%  respectively  between 2008 and 2014 [  ]. This can be explained by a drastic decrease in the generation interval by<U+2009>~<U+2009>50% on average for Holstein bulls [  ]. This effective decrease in generation interval is consistent with previous predictions [] and is mainly due to the withdrawal of progeny testing prior to marketing of bulls. We obtained similar results for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein bulls. Their mean annual genetic gains (<U+0394>G) increased by 50  71 and 33%  respectively  after implementation of GS. At the same time  the bulls’ parental generation intervals were reduced by a factor 1.7  1.9 and 2 for the Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein breeds  respectively  suggesting that  similar to the US Holstein situation  most of the extra genetic gain is due to reduced generation intervals. However  there are differences between breeds in terms of increase in annual genetic gain and decrease in generation interval  with the Holstein breed having less increase in gain relative to the reduction in generation interval. This may be due to different formulas used for total merit indices and different breeding goals. Given this global increase in genetic gain for all the breeds studied here along with the decrease in generation interval  one might be concerned about the trend in genetic diversity. Indeed  on the one hand  an accelerated decrease in genetic diversity could be expected due to the decrease in generation interval. On the other hand  genomic evaluations can lead to a more diverse offer in terms of candidates for selection  and thus a moderation of inbreeding rate over time []. To study the possible change of inbreeding rate  we first looked at various estimates of inbreeding and diversity to recognize whether and why they differed. ROH-based inbreeding estimates aligned well with pedigree-based inbreeding estimates when averaged per breed. However  pedigree-based inbreeding estimates had a higher coefficient of variation between bulls within a breed (0.33  0.25 and 0.31 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively) than ROH-based inbreeding estimates (0.22  0.18 and 0.21 for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein  respectively)  for the three breeds. Pedigree depths were substantial and similar in the three breeds and there was limited variation among individual bulls; the mean number of generations traced for Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein bulls was 15.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.7  15.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.6 and 15.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.9  respectively. Therefore  pedigree completeness was not a major cause of the higher coefficient of variation of pedigree-based inbreeding estimates in comparison with ROH-based inbreeding estimates. Pedigree-based estimations of individual inbreeding coefficients are based on expected IBD probabilities and because of Mendelian sampling these values might differ from ROH-based estimates  which reflects more the realized or effective inbreeding []. The correlations between pedigree- and ROH-based inbreeding estimates ranged from 50 to 59%  depending on the breed. These correlations were in the range of those previously reported for Jersey and Danish red cattle (52 and 54%  respectively) [] but lower than those reported for Holstein (around 80%) [] and simulated cattle (around 70%) []. Errors and depth of pedigree are very plausible reasons for these differences between reported and presented correlations. Moreover  such differences in these correlations are expected because pedigree-based inbreeding corresponds to the expected value of inbreeding while ROH-based inbreeding corresponds to its realized value. In groups of highly selected bulls  linkage disequilibrium and homozygosity can be strong  which leads to large discrepancies between expected (based on pedigree) and observed (based on ROH) inbreeding and subsequently lower correlations. In all three breeds  the ratio between the effective and actual number of bulls (Ne/N) increased after implementation of GS. This reflects changes in breeding schemes in all three breeds  which should allow for a decrease in inbreeding rate and more generally for a slowdown in the annual loss of genetic diversity. However  we distinguished two contrasting types of behavior of inbreeding based on ROH. First  for the two national breeds  Montbéliarde and Normande  we did not detect any significant change in the annual inbreeding rate (<U+0394>F). Second  for the Holstein international breed there was a significant increase in <U+0394>F  which has increased from 0.080% to 0.55% per year based on ROH  and from 0.088% to 0.49% per year based on pedigree. This result does not align with the fact that all three breeds experienced a significant increase in annual genetic gain  with the lowest increase observed in Holstein while the inbreeding rate in Holstein was highest. This result suggests that changes in breeding schemes reflected by an increase of Ne/N of bulls in Holstein did not allow for a slowdown in the annual loss of genetic diversity. For Holstein  <U+0394>F per generation also increased from 0.39% to 1.36% based on ROH  and from around 0.46% to 1.39% based on pedigree. Thus  the decrease in generation interval did not explain all the increase in <U+0394>F per year for Holstein  since <U+0394>F per generation increased too. The observed inbreeding rate in Holstein is higher than the 1% per generation acceptable rate of inbreeding according to FAO guidelines []. Since the accumulation of inbreeding through ROH is not linear  and the observed level and rate of inbreeding could be underestimated when based on ROH  the inbreeding problem is likely even more severe than suggested by these figures. We used a linear regression to estimate the rate of ROH-based inbreeding because it gave better results than a logarithmic regression in terms of residuals of the model (see Additional file : Figures S1–S7). When estimated from pedigree data  the slope of inbreeding increased significantly for both Normande and Holstein bulls  reaching 0.19% and 0.49% per year  respectively. The inbreeding rate reached 0.70% and 1.39% per generation  respectively  so the decrease in generation interval did not explain all the increase in inbreeding rate per year. Thus  the Normande breed remained under the recommended FAO threshold whereas Holstein exceeded this when estimating inbreeding on pedigree data as well as on ROH data. Why there are such differences between these two breeds should be further investigated  and in particular  the differences in breeding schemes  such as the use of foreign bulls or the setting-up of quotas for the number of inseminations allowed per bull. From 2005 to 2015  the overall mean ROH length for Montbéliarde (1.68 Mb) was significantly shorter than that for Normande (1.71 Mb)  which in turn was significantly shorter than that for Holstein (1.80 Mb). The length of ROH depends on two main criteria  for given detection parameters and genotyping density: (i) the effective population size and the level of linkage disequilibrium []; and (ii) the number of generations that separates an individual from the ancestor from which the ROH originated  with longer ROH reflecting more recent inbreeding [  ]. We investigate these two possibilities to explain the differences in mean ROH lengths between breeds. Estimated effective population sizes (Ne) of French dairy cattle breeds were equal to 79 for Montbéliarde  87 for Normande and 96 for Holstein in 2017 []. Based on these results  effective/census population sizes ratios (Ne/N) of 0.009  0.021 and 0.003% for these breeds  respectively  were calculated []. The effective number of bulls born under GS for the period between 2012 and 2015 was estimated to be 144 for Montbéliarde  124 for Normande and 229 for Holstein  and effective/census number of bull ratios were 28  35 and 13%  respectively. In both cases  the ratios between effective and census effective population sizes were lowest for Holstein and higher for Normande and Montbéliarde. We can hypothesize that these differences are probably linked to the small numbers of bulls that have strong contributions and the low ratios between effective and census number of bulls  particularly in Holstein []. Moreover  whereas the distribution of the number of offspring per bull became less skewed for the three breeds under GS than under PTS  this change seemed to be less pronounced in Holstein (see Additional file : Figure S8  Additional file : Table S6). This was consistent with a relatively low ratio between effective and census number of bulls in Holstein under GS in comparison with Montbéliarde and Normande  and with the hypothesis of a remaining effect of a few bulls with strong contributions. There can be two effects explaining the greater observed ROH length for Holstein. The first is the small effective population size relative to census population size resulting in a highly structured genome in this breed with long haploblocks [] where recombination is unlikely to have occurred leading to long ROH. The second is recent inbreeding  likely to have occurred because of the massive use of few elite bulls. This was suggested by kinship estimated from pedigree being higher for the period between 2012 and 2015 than for the period between 2005 and 2010 for Holstein and not for national breeds  which can be explained by the intensive use of a few individuals as grandfathers of bulls  mostly coming from the USA []. We chose not to compute kinship from GRM because of their high sensitivity to the estimation of allelic frequencies (data not shown) []. The hypothesis that a few individuals were used as grandfathers of bulls in Holstein was consistent with the increase by a factor 8.77 (with a relative change of 7.77) of the annual rate of mean ROH length in Holstein breed after the beginning of GS  whereas it remained unchanged in the Montbéliarde and Normande breeds. This increase might be counterintuitive. Indeed  GS may lead to relatively shorter ROH than PTS []. Therefore  the increase in mean ROH length in Holstein might be underestimated and was corroborated by the increase in the number of long ROH per individual in Holstein with the beginning of GS  whereas it was not the case in Montbéliarde and Normande (see Additional file : Table S7  Additional file : Figures S9–S11]). Therefore  the increase in the number of long ROH per individual in Holstein might be responsible for the increased mean ROH length within the breed. Shorter ROH tend to result from older inbreeding (older common ancestors) whereas longer ROH tend to result from more recent inbreeding (more recent common ancestors) [    ]. Thus  the increase in the mean ROH length and in the number of long ROH in Holstein suggests an increase in the number of ROH segments arising from recent inbreeding. This introduction of recent inbreeding was confirmed by the observed increase in pedigree-based inbreeding calculated from the last five generations that started when GS was implemented  with an inbreeding rate ranging from -<U+2009>0.083% per year for PTS to 0.27% per year for GS (-<U+2009>0.40% and 0.78% per generation  respectively). In conclusion  in Holstein  this increase in the mean ROH length might reflect the substantial introduction of recent inbreeding  but also a reduction in the number of selected bulls. After the introduction of genomic selection  the annual genetic gain increased based on estimated breeding values for bulls of three large French dairy cattle breeds: Montbéliarde  Normande and Holstein. At the same time  the inbreeding rate per year and per generation increased in Holstein bulls  an international breed  but not in Montbéliarde and Normande bulls  two national breeds. Small effective population sizes resulted in highly structured genomes with long haploblocks  particularly in Holstein  as a consequence of the low effective/census number of bulls ratios. A joint increase in genetic gain and conservation of genetic diversity is possible by (i) applying optimal contribution selection; (ii) carrying out on-farm mating plans; and (iii) ensuring that these tools are flexible enough to be used effectively in the field. Our study highlights the fact that changes in breeding schemes can impact genetic diversity  and thus  it is important to continue monitoring genetic diversity and to study the future impact of different breeding schemes strategies on genetic diversity. The recent implementation of genomic evaluations in small regional breeds  for which effective population size can be limited  should be studied carefully in order to ensure sustainability of breeding schemes in the future  in terms of both genetic gain and diversity. The spread of new technologies in breeding schemes  such as female reproductive technologies and embryo transfer that might increase global selection intensity through the dams of bulls  represents a risk in terms of genetic diversity that should be anticipated in the light of our conclusions.

On the one hand  systemic salmonellosis results in considerable animal mortality and reduced poultry production. On the other hand  poultry is a major global reservoir of nontyphoidal   which is one of the most important pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses []. Pullorum disease is an acute poultry infectious disease that is caused by the chicken-restricted facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterium   (SP). This disease usually results in high mortality of chicks less than 20 days old  especially in developing countries where cleaning and disinfection procedures are usually not effective []. SP infection generally leads to three disease outcomes: the most susceptible birds die within about 2 to 20 days showing typical SP infection symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly  white diarrhea and cecal cores []; some chicks survive by clearing the pathogen through a series of immune responses; and other chicks develop a carrier state with SP present in their splenic macrophages for a long period of time []. These carriers can transmit the pathogen to other chickens horizontally or to their offspring via the eggs []. In many developed countries  the pullorum disease has been eradicated from commercial flocks by culling infected birds. However  this method does not work well in most developing countries due to the emergence of novel bacterial strains []  poor hygienic conditions  and limited technology; in addition  there are restrictions on the use of antibiotics in food animal production. Thus  there is need for an alternative sustainable strategy to control the disease in farm animals. In addition to novel vaccines and food additives  selective breeding of animals based on the development of chicken genomic data is becoming a promising approach to improve their resistance to infectious diseases []. Host genetic factors have been reported to play an important role in the resistance of animals to  infection in many studies [      ]. Previously  we estimated the heritability of the death and carrier state traits based on an elaborately designed challenge experiment []. The results showed low-to-moderate heritabilities (0.09 to 0.32) in different chicken lines  which means these traits are heritable. However  the molecular mechanism that underlies the genetic resistance to SP remains largely unknown. In recent years  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to identify the genetic architecture of many disease traits in chickens [   ]. However  only a few GWAS have been carried out on infectious diseases because it is difficult and expensive to obtain accurate phenotypes for large populations; furthermore  the results of an infection are affected by many factors such as bacterial dosage  maternal antibodies  and the environment []  which are difficult to control. To the best of our knowledge  no large-scale GWAS has been performed to identify genomic loci and candidate genes for death and carrier state  through a carefully organized SP challenge test. In this study  818 pure-bred chicks were genotyped with a commercial 600 K high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array []. A GWAS using a single-marker linear mixed model and 302 927 SNPs allowed us to detect genomic regions that are associated with resistance to SP. The identified candidate genes were evaluated based on their functional annotation and expression level. The potential mechanisms of these genes in immunity to infection in chickens are discussed. For this study  842 chicks from three pure lines were available  namely 384 Rhode Island Red  381 Dwarf Chicken  and 77 Beijing You individuals. Rhode Island Red (RIR) is an intensively selected commercial breed  Dwarf Chicken (DW) is a synthetic layer line  and Beijing You (BY) is a Chinese local chicken breed. These animals all came from our previous SP challenge experiment []. Briefly  SP pathogen-free and antibody-free chicks were orally inoculated with 4.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 colony forming units (CFU) SP strain 533 culture at 4 days of age and then raised in negative pressure isolators up to 40 days of age. All chicks had free access to sterile water and food  and the environment was managed such that it remained the same for all the birds in the experiment. Three different disease-related traits  i.e. death  clearance and carrier-state  were measured and used as SP resistance phenotypes. First  chicks that died with visible signs of SP infection symptoms (white diarrhea and splenomegaly) were classified as the most susceptible. In the case of chicks that survived the challenge  the carrier-state was analyzed by plating spleen homogenates on MacConkey agar medium under sterile conditions to determine bacterial load. The identity of the pathogen was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the SP specific  gene [] after PCR amplification with the following primers: sense 5'-ATTAACAGGAGGAGGCTGG-3'; antisense 5'-CCATTCCCAAAAGCCTGCAT-3'. More details on how the population was established and on the bacterial challenge process are in our previous report []. We isolated individual genomic DNA from blood or muscle samples by the classical phenol–chloroform procedure. DNA integrity was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and purity was checked by A260/280 ratio using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific™). In total  842 qualified individual genomic DNA samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix 600 K chicken high-density array (Affymetrix  Inc. Santa Clara  CA  USA). For SNP calling and initial quality control  the raw genotyping data (CEL files) were analyzed by using the software Axiom Analysis Suite 3.1 following the Best Practices Workflow. Only the samples with a dish quality control (DQC) of 0.82 or more and a call rate higher than 95% were retained for subsequent analyses. The SNP QC metrics were set to the default values recommended by Affymetrix  except that only “PolyHighResolution” SNPs were included in our analysis. Furthermore  we excluded SNPs with unknown or repeated physical positions with an ad hoc R script. SNPs on the sex chromosomes were also discarded because the current statistical methods are not powerful enough to detect associations between phenotypes and sex-related genotypes. After these QC steps  818 samples and 452 291 SNPs remained. A Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test was conducted within each breed  and 62 450 variants that deviated from HWE (P<U+2009><<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) were filtered out. To increase the power of the association analysis  we removed 85 140 SNPs because of their low level of variation among subpopulations (i.e. SNPs that were monomorphic in any one of the three breeds)  and 1774 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05 using PLINK v1.90 []. Missing genotypes were imputed based on information from the remaining SNP genotypes for each subpopulation separately  according to the software Beagle Version 4 []. In total  818 samples and 302 927 SNPs were included in the subsequent genome-wide association analysis. Population structure and relatedness are major sources of confounding effects in genetic association studies []. The most popular method for GWAS that include related individuals is the linear mixed model (LMM) method because of its effectiveness in controlling population stratification bias and reducing the inflation from many small genetic effects (polygenic background) [      ]. In this study  we assessed population structure by conducting a principal component analysis (PCA) implemented in the PLINK package. Considering that clusters of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium may bias the PCA results  first we pruned the full SNP set to 23 870 independent SNPs using the—indep-pairwise 25 5 0.2 command parameters in PLINK. Then  we used these unlinked SNPs to calculate the top three principal components (PC) that were used as covariates in the mixed model. Furthermore  a pairwise kinship matrix was built using the pruned SNPs. A single-marker univariate linear mixed model was used for testing associations between the results of SP infection and the qualified SNPs. The disease phenotype was divided into two binary traits: death (200 deaths vs. 618 survivals) and carrier-state (161 carriers vs. 457 clearance). Both death and carrier-state were analyzed using the following model: where  denotes the trait values for death or carrier-state  namely either ‘0’ or ‘1’;  is a matrix of covariates (i.e. fixed effects that contain the top three PC  genotyping batch and a column of 1s) that control population structure and batch effect;  is a vector of corresponding coefficients that includes the intercept;  is a vector of SNP genotypes;  is the corresponding effect of SNPs;  is a vector of random polygenic effects with a covariance structure that follows a normal distribution   where  is a genomic relationship matrix derived from independent SNPs and  is the polygenic additive variance; and  is a vector of random errors. The association analysis was performed using the GEMMA v0.96 software []. The Wald test statistic  was used to test the null hypothesis  for each SNP. The Manhattan and quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plots were drawn with the “qqman” package in R. Moreover  correction for population stratification was evaluated by calculating the genomic inflation factor <U+03BB> with the “GenABEL” package []. We calculated genome-wide significance P-value thresholds with the simpleM method implemented in a R script for multiple testing correction []. simpleM calculation resulted in 72 648 independent effective tests and the genome-wide and suggestive significance values were then calculated as 6.88<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (0.05/72 648) and 1.38<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (1.00/72 648)  respectively. The contribution of significant SNPs to the phenotypic variance was estimated by a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method implemented in the GCTA v1.91 software []. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed for the significant SNPs using the solid spin algorithm implemented in Haploview version 4.2 []. Candidate genes for resistance to SP were identified based on functional annotation and expression level data. First  we performed functional annotation by searching for candidate genes within 500 kb regions on either side of the lead significant SNP with the help of the Variant Effect Predictor [] and Biomart tools supported by Ensembl () using the Gallus_gallus-5.0 genes dataset. Then  we investigated the biological functions of these candidate genes on PubMed (). The gene expression levels in the spleen of infected and mock-infected birds (54 samples) were determined by RNA-Seq (three replicates) at three time points [4  10 and 21 days post-infection (dpi)] for the three breeds. Spleen tissue was sampled and immediately preserved in RNAlater (Ambion) at room temperature for 24 h and then at -<U+2009>20 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen  Carlsbad  CA  USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries for each sample were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA)  and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Raw reads were filtered and trimmed using fastp (version 0.19.1) []. Clean reads were mapped to the chicken reference genome (galGal5) using the HISAT2 program []. Reads mapped to a gene were counted with featureCounts [] against the gene annotation from Ensembl database. The gene counts were normalized by the Bioconductor package DESeq2 [] and differential expression P-values of candidate genes were then calculated with default parameters. To evaluate the correlation between time and gene expression levels of the control group  we conducted regression analysis by fitting the linear model with the function implemented in the R software version 3.5.1 (Foundation for Statistical Computing  Vienna  Austria). Inbreeding has long been reported to affect fitness traits such as resistance to disease [    ]. To investigate the relationship between inbreeding and resistance to SP  we estimated the genomic inbreeding coefficients by measuring the genome-wide distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) using the PLINK software. The genomic inbreeding coefficient F was calculated as the proportion of the genome which is found in runs of homozygosity. The total physical length of all autosomes from the first to the last SNP is 930 016 100 bp. A ROH is defined as a segment of consecutive homozygous DNA that meets the following criteria: (1) a minimum size of 1000 kb and at least 50 homozygous SNPs; (2) a maximum of five missing SNPs allowed in a ROH; (3) a maximum of one heterozygous SNP per ROH  so that ROH segments are not disrupted by an occasional heterozygous SNP; and (4) a maximum gap between SNPs of 1000 kb to ensure that SNP density does not affect a ROH. The details of the results of the SP challenge were previously reported []. Briefly  mortality rates for the RIR  BY  and DW chicks reached 25.1  8.3  and 22.7%  respectively  and the corresponding carrier-state levels in the spleens were equal to 17.9  0.6  and 15.8%  which indicate that BY chicks are more resistant to SP infection than DW and RIR chicks. Only part of the chicks that participated in the SP challenge test were genotyped. Since nearly all the BY chicks that survived could clear the pathogen (except three)  we did not genotype the carriers in this breed. In the group of chicks that died  only the individuals that had conclusive symptoms and for which high quality DNA was available were genotyped. Furthermore  in the group of chicks that cleared the pathogen  we removed randomly some individuals to match the corresponding phenotype proportion. In total  842 samples were genotyped and after a series of strict quality control procedures  24 samples were eliminated because of a low genotyping call rate. Thus  the final GWAS population consisted of 818 samples (392 males and 426 females). The phenotypic composition of each line is given in Table . Based on the PCA plot (Fig. )  three subpopulations are clearly distinguished  which indicates that population stratification can be accounted for in the linear mixed model of the GWAS by including these principal components as covariates in the analysis. PCA plot for population structure. The red  green and blue dots represent BY  DW and RIR individuals  respectively The Manhattan and Q–Q plots for the death trait are in Fig. a. The single-marker analysis identified 42 SNPs that were significantly associated with death at the suggestive association threshold. Of these 42 SNPs  17 genome-wide significant SNPs spanned a narrow 0.55 Mb region (33.48–34.03 Mb) on chicken chromosome GGA4 (GGA for )  which was the highest peak. Based on SNP annotation (Table )  we found that 10 of the significant SNPs were located at intergenic regions  five were in introns and two were upstream of the coding sequences. Through a REML analysis implemented in the GCTA software  we found that the most significant SNP  i.e. rs314483802  (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.38<U+2009>×<U+2009>10; intergenic) explained 11.73% of the phenotypic variance. An LD analysis revealed that all the genome-wide significant SNPs were in high LD (Fig. b)  which makes it difficult to identify causal SNPs. The genomic control inflation factor (<U+03BB>) calculated for the death trait was equal to 1.08  which is a little higher than the ideal value of 1 and indicates a mild but acceptable population stratification. We identified three genes that involved the eight upstream and intronic SNPs:  ()  - ()  and - ().  is a protein coding gene about which little is known in the literature.  modulates the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway by targeting - for ubiquitination and destruction [  ]. NF-<U+03BA>B is one of the most important signaling pathways of the inflammation and immune system. According to Fukushima et al. []  the depletion of  (synonymous to ) in mice leads to reduced NF-<U+03BA>B activity and perturbed T cell differentiation. Thus   is a very promising candidate gene that may affect immune response after SP infection.  is an important gene that is involved in a syndrome of immune deficiency and autoimmunity. Deleterious mutations in  cause defects in B cell activation and autophagy  and can increase susceptibility to apoptosis []. Furthermore  a new study has recently linked  to the NF-<U+03BA>B immune pathway []. GWAS results for death.  Manhattan plot and Q–Q plot.

The Manhattan plot contains -<U+2009>log10 observed P-values for genome-wide SNPs (y-axis) plotted against their corresponding position on each chromosome (x-axis)  while the Q–Q plot contains expected -<U+2009>log10-transformed P-values plotted against observed -<U+2009>log10-transformed P-values.  LD plots for significant SNPs Our gene expression data provided further evidence that supports implication of these candidate genes during a SP infection. As shown in Fig.   expression of  was significantly downregulated after SP infection at all three time points in RIR chicks. Although this downregulation was not significant in BY chicks and was significant at 21 dpi in DW chicks  overall the same trend was observed in the three lines. Expression of  was downregulated at a later time post-infection in all three lines. Interestingly  these two genes showed a time-dependent expression in the control group. To confirm this  we performed a regression analysis of gene expression levels and time (see Fig. ) that showed that the expression levels of  and  are positively correlated with time  which is consistent with the fact that the chicks are considerably more resistant to SP when they are more than 20 days old. Our results provide more evidence that  and  are associated with resistance to SP. Candidate gene expression levels (normalized counts) in the three chicken lines (BY  DW and RIR) at three time points (4  10  21 dpi) Regression analysis between gene normalized counts and time. The analysis was conducted using a linear model for    -- and    - In the GWAS for the carrier-state trait  the linear mixed model GWAS could not identify genome-wide significant SNPs. However  three SNPs were above the level of suggestive significance (Fig. ). The genomic control inflation factor (<U+03BB>) for carrier-state was equal to 1.07  which is similar to the value found for death. Two of these three potential SNPs are located on GGA5 and the other one on GGA2. The rs312524326 SNP on GGA5 was located close to several candidate genes including the  gene ().  participates in the signal transduction of CD40  a member of the TNFR family that is important for the activation of immune response []. Besides   controls the activation of the canonical and alternative NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway via the lymphotoxin beta receptor []. In our experiments  the expression level of  was up-regulated at 4 dpi in all three lines; however  it showed no difference at later times (Fig. ). The SNP on GGA2 (rs312970356) was close to the miRNA --. Expression of -- increases in CD30hi cells and is connected to Marek’s disease herpesvirus infection []. We used the miRDB tool [  ] to predict the target genes for -- and found that one of the predicted target genes was  () with a high target score of 98. The protein encoded by  binds to the FAS antigen (TNFRSF6) and can initiate apoptosis or enhance apoptosis via the FAS antigen. Down-regulation of  can activate the TNF-a/NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway []. We found that the expression of  was up-regulated at 4 dpi in BY and RIR chicks after SP infection in our study (Fig. ). Manhattan plot and Q–Q plot for carrier-state. Each dot on this figure corresponds to a SNP within the dataset  while the horizontal blue line denotes the suggestive significance thresholds (1.38<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) We found that  did not differ between the traits analyzed here (Fig. )  but the DW and BY chicks that died of SP infection showed the lowest values. In contrast  at the breed level  all comparisons of genomic inbreeding coefficient involving the RIR breed were significant. Genomic inbreeding coefficients (F) in the three chicken breeds (** indicates P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  infections are a serious health risk to both humans and animals. In humans  typhoid fever outbreaks occur every few years and cause significant morbidity and mortality []. A human GWAS for  resistance conducted between infected individuals and a large control population reported a significant association with the MHC region []. Non-human research has the potential advantage of obtaining accurate phenotypes through bacterial challenge tests. However  only a few successful studies have been reported on infectious diseases owing to the difficulty in phenotyping the affected individuals and the complex genetic architecture of diseases. With the development of animal genomics  more domestic animals are being used as models for biomedical research []. To the best of our knowledge  this is one of the few large-scale GWAS  which have been carried out on both the death and carrier-state traits following a well-organized SP challenge experiment. We investigated the genetics of resistance to SP in 818 pure-bred chicks from three chicken lines by genotyping 302 927 SNPs from a high-density chip and performing a GWAS. Although difficult  it would be highly useful to find a general mechanism of disease resistance among populations; towards this aim  we used three chicken lines with different genetic backgrounds. We identified a strong association at a region that was located between 33.48 and 34.03 Mb on GGA4 for death  and two suggestive signals on GGA5 and GGA2 for carrier state. Combining the biological functions of the genes found in these regions and RNA-seq data  we identified four candidate genes that could account for resistance to SP  namely  and  for death  and  and -- (targeting ) for carrier state. Interestingly  these four genes have been reported to participate in the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway [      ]  which suggests that this pathway may play a central role in the host’s resistance to SP infection. As a major transcription factor  NF-<U+03BA>B regulates many genes that are involved in both the innate and adaptive immune response []. Because SP is an intracellular bacterium  we suspect that the T cell development process related to the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway may constitute the underlying mechanism of resistance to SP and thus deserves more research. Until now  many  resistance genes have been identified in fowl []  for example   and . However  most of these studies were carried out within a single population. A GWAS performed across multiple populations can increase the power to detect novel loci and achieve a higher mapping resolution than in previous studies [  ]. The regions and gene candidates reported in our study have not been detected in previous studies on resistance to Salmonella infection  which may be explained by the fact that we used different chicken lines and  strains. The immunobiology of typhoidal and non-typhoidal Salmonella diseases differs substantially []  and these diseases correspond to different host genetic resistances; thus  it is important to compare the mechanisms for different Salmonella diseases. Our study provided new data for the genetic determinism of typhoidal  resistance. Because disease resistance is a complex trait  it is likely that there are many more disease-related genes that could not be identified here due to the limited sample size. The candidate genes identified in our study showed a time- and breed-related expression  which might be linked to different development stages of the affected individual. Analysis of the expression data reveals the complexity of the transcription of these genes at the different time points and in the different breeds. In the SP challenge test  the BY chicks were the most resistant to SP; however  RIR chicks (the most susceptible breed) showed more consistent results at different time points. Interestingly  the association between the candidate genes and resistance to SP was stronger in the RIR chicks with high susceptibility. BY is a local breed of chickens with the highest level of resistance to the disease and the lowest inbreeding coefficient; DW is a synthetic line with both a low level of resistance to and a low inbreeding coefficient; RIR is the most intensively-selected line with a low level of resistance to SP and a high inbreeding coefficient. Many studies have reported that inbreeding is associated with disease resistance [    ]  which is not the case in our study. One of the reasons could be that inbreeding depression in farm animals is more complex and different from that in wild populations. Considerably more research is required before we can completely understand the genetics of any complex trait  especially traits that concern elaborate immunological functions. In this study  we show the feasibility of using a domestic animal for mapping the genomic regions that underlie an infectious disease and for providing new information that will be useful in subsequent comparative immunology studies. The genetic determinism of immunity is extremely complex and shaped by the contribution of multiple genes and environmental factors []. Therefore  more GWAS on domestic animals will help identify genes that are involved in the immunity mechanisms occurring during infectious diseases. Our GWAS on death and carrier state after SP infection identified new loci and genes associated with resistance to SP. The NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway is likely to play a central role in immunity against SP. These results provide new information on the genetic determinism of the resistance to infectious diseases; offer theoretical basis for breeding SP-resistant chicks using marker-assisted selection; and provide new data for research on salmonellosis in humans and other animals. The data on the 54 chickens used in RNA-Seq analysis are accessible at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under BioProject accession number PRJNA511038.

However  benefits of the use of genomic information and methodology for genetic evaluations are missing when genotype-by-environment interactions (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) exist between bio-secure breeding (B) environments and commercial production (C) environments. In this study  we explored (1) G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions for broiler body weight (BW) at weeks 5 and 6  and (2) the benefits of using genomic information for prediction of BW traits when selection candidates were raised and tested in a B environment and close relatives were tested in a C environment. A pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) multivariate model was used to estimate variance components and predict breeding values (EBV) of BW traits at weeks 5 and 6 measured in B and C environments. A single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) model that combined pedigree and genomic information was used to predict EBV. Cross-validations were based on correlation  mean difference and regression slope statistics for EBV that were estimated from full and reduced datasets. These statistics are indicators of population accuracy  bias and dispersion of prediction for EBV of traits measured in B and C environments. Validation animals were genotyped and non-genotyped birds in the B environment only. Several indications of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions due to environmental differences were found for BW traits including significant re-ranking  heterogeneous variances and different heritabilities for BW measured in environments B and C. The genetic correlations between BW traits measured in environments B and C ranged from 0.48 to 0.54. The use of combined pedigree and genomic information increased population accuracy of EBV  and reduced bias of EBV prediction for genotyped birds compared to the use of pedigree information only. A slight increase in accuracy of EBV was also observed for non-genotyped birds  but the bias of EBV prediction increased for non-genotyped birds. The G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction was strong for BW traits of broilers measured in environments B and C. The use of combined pedigree and genomic information increased population accuracy of EBV substantially for genotyped birds in the B environment compared to the use of pedigree information only. The difference in production conditions between highly bio-secure breeding (B) and commercial production environments (C) can lead to genotype-by-environment interaction (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) in broiler chicken []. Indications of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E may include heterogeneous variances  different heritabilities  and correlations lower than 1 between the same trait expressed under the B and C conditions []. To model G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E  the same trait expressed in the two environments can be defined as two correlated traits. Identification of the presence of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E  especially a genetic correlation between traits measured in B and C  is important for optimizing breeding programs. For example  Chu et al. [] showed that the genetic correlation between traits measured in B and C environments can change the optimal proportion of birds to be tested in the B versus the C environment. For body weight (BW) of broiler chicken  G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions have been reported with genetic correlations ranging from 0.46 to 0.69 []  from 0.74 to 0.76 [] and from 0.75 to 0.76 [] between traits measured in environments B and C. The ultimate goal of a breeding program for broilers is to increase the genetic gain of the birds’ performance in the C environment only. To improve genetic gain  sib-testing of purebred birds in environments B and C is an option []. Due to bio-security restrictions  only the birds in the B environment are selection candidates  whereas the birds in the C environment provide information on the performance in C only. Because of limited reproductive capacity of broiler dams  a restricted number of birds can be moved to the C environment for phenotype testing  and thus accuracy of prediction for performance in C might be relatively low with pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) []. In this situation  genomic information can be of interest to improve accuracy of prediction. There has been growing interest for genomic selection in poultry breeding programs because of the higher accuracy of prediction compared to pedigree-based evaluation. The increase in accuracy of prediction from using dense genotypes is due to improved measurement of the relationships between animals and better prediction of the Mendelian sampling terms []. Improved knowledge of the relationships may help the transfer of information from birds in the C environment to selection candidates in the B environment. The benefit of genomic selection over pedigree-based selection has been well documented from simulations [     ] and empirical studies in chicken [    ]  cattle [   ] and pig [    ] breeding schemes. However  none of the empirical studies reported a benefit of the use of genomic information in a breeding program with G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E sib-testing designs. In such a program  a multivariate joint model is required to model traits measured in commercial and breeding environments. When the number of genotyped individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are large  the use of a multi-trait model can be computationally challenging  and estimation of variance components from the model that uses a realized genomic relationship matrix can be tedious. Model-based accuracy or individual accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV) cannot be computed because it is not feasible to obtain prediction error variances by direct inversion of the left hand side (LHS) of mixed model equations. Cross-validation strategies for accuracy of EBV based on correlations between EBV and corrected phenotypes cannot be applied. In a G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E sib-testing breeding program  validation animals are the birds in the B environment  which do not have corrected phenotypes for the traits measured in environment C. Legarra and Reverter [] proposed cross-validation measures that can compare competing prediction models in situations of breeding programs where traits are influenced by G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions. These validation measures [] are based on statistics of EBV that are estimated from full and reduced datasets. In addition  a typical breeding program that uses genomic selection in broiler chicken often applies a selective genotyping strategy. In broilers  important traits such as BW and feed efficiency can be recorded before sexual maturity. In situations of limited resources for genotyping  only a proportion of the birds that are potential parents with best performances will be genotyped. The selective genotyping strategy can increase accuracy of selection and genetic gain compared to random genotyping strategies []. However  the selective genotyping can create bias and lead to overestimation of genetic variances when single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) is used to estimate variance components []. To exploit genomic information  as well as pedigree data and phenotypes of non-genotyped birds in genetic evaluation  ssGBLUP models [] can be used. However  accurate prediction of breeding values requires accurate estimates of variance components. An animal model using the pedigree relationship matrix is currently recommended to estimate variance components in the situation of selective genotyping []. Two main objectives of our study were: (1) to explore genotype-by-environment interactions for BW in broilers raised in breeding bio-secure (B) and commercial production (C) environments  and (2) to use genomic information to increase the accuracy of predicted breeding values of birds in the B environment for BW traits measured in the C environment. Data obtained from the poultry breeding company  Cobb-Vantress  included (BW) performances of purebred broiler chicken that were tested in breeding bio-secure (B) and standard commercial production (C) environments. These two environments represent the standards for biosecurity used in commercial breeding programs and the C environment represents normal commercial production conditions in Western countries. In both systems  birds were reared in large flocks under floor conditions. The data included BW records from 16 time-steps (TS) of selection that covered roughly 2.5 generations. A time-step involves selection and testing activities in the breeding programs that are carried out within a relatively short period of time. Birds that hatched at each TS were transferred to either the B or C environment for phenotype testing. Each full sib group was split between the B and C environments such that each bird will have full and half-sibs in both environments. Parents were selected from birds tested in the B environment only. In other words  parents did not have any phenotypic records in the C environment. In each TS  all the offspring of birds in the C environment were hatched at the same time while the offspring of birds in the B environment were hatched at several successive time points. Sires and dams of the offspring in each TS were from several previous TS. BW of the broilers tested in the B environment was recorded once  at 6 weeks of age (BW6.B)  for TS 1–10 and recorded once or twice  at 5 and 6 weeks of age (BW5.B and BW6.B)  for TS 11–16. All birds in the B environment at TS 11–16 had BW5 records  but only 33% of those birds had BW6 records. The BW of the broilers tested in the C environment were recorded at 5 and 6 weeks of age (BW5.C and BW6.C) for TS 5–10 and only at 5 weeks of age (BW5.C) for TS 11–16. Data editing was performed as in Chapter 4 of Chu [] by removing records of the birds with unidentified sex  missing dam age or duplicated records. Records of BW that were more than four standard deviation units from the mean were also removed for each of the four BW record types. In total  0.04% of all BW records were removed. After data editing  54 757 and 15 412 birds remained in the B and C environments  respectively  with respectively 61 589 and 23 569 BW records. The birds with BW records were from 319 sires and 1528 dams. The pedigree covered roughly 3.5 generations back from the youngest birds and included 70 174 birds. A medium-density SNP chip with 55 792 SNPs was used for genotyping (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). For quality control  the missing rate for SNPs was set at<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 and the call rate for birds at<U+2009>><U+2009>0.95. Also  SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.01 were removed. After quality control  39 767 genotyped birds with 50 562 SNPs remained for constructing the genomic relationship matrix. All parents had genotype information. Although all the birds in the C environment were genotyped  after quality control  genotyping information of 41 birds in C was not used to construct the genomic relationship matrix. Only part of the birds in the B environment were genotyped. A preliminary study showed that male and female BW had different variances  but were highly correlated  which reflects scaling effects []. Modelling male and female BW as two traits led to convergence problems because of paramete at the edge of the parameter space. To model heterogeneous variances between male and female BW  standardization was applied to male and female BW  separately []. Male and female phenotypic records of the four BW traits were standardized to their corresponding phenotypic standard deviations that were estimated by the following univariate model: where  is a vector of male or female phenotypic records of BW at the original scale;  is a vector of fixed factors of hatch TS of the bird  TS of the parents  and dam age in classes of 1 week;     and  are incidence matrices;    and  are the vectors of the direct additive genetic effects  permanent environmental maternal effects and residuals  respectively. These random effects were assumed to be normally distributed:    and   where  is the pedigree relationship matrix;  is the identity matrix for dams;  is the identity matrix for individual birds;    and  are variances at the original scale of BW. Standardization was applied  so that each phenotypic record was divided by the corresponding phenotypic standard deviation estimated from model (1). A multi-trait PBLUP model was used to estimate variance components and predict EBV from the standardized phenotypic records of BW in the B and C environments. The PBLUP model (2) includes eight traits but after transformation  the variances of genetic and maternal effects were equalized and correlations between sexes were equal to 1  so rank reduction was used for these effects whereas individual variances and covariances were estimated for the residual. The model was as follows: where      and  are the vectors of standardized phenotypic records of BW5.B  BW6.B  BW5.C  and BW6.C  respectively  for males;      and  are the vectors of standardized phenotypic records of BW5.B  BW6.B  BW5.C  and BW6.C  respectively  for females;              and  are the vectors of fixed factors as in the above model (1);                                              and  are incidence matrices;      and  are vectors of the direct additive genetic effects that were reduced ranks [] for male and female traits:      and    where  is the 4<U+2009>×<U+2009>4 covariance matrix;  is the pedigree relationship matrix;  is the multivariate normal distribution; and<U+2009><U+2009>is the Kronecker product.      and  are the vectors of permanent environmental maternal effects that were reduced ranks [] for male and female traits:      and   where  is the 4 × 4 covariance matrix; and  is the identity matrix for dams.             and  are the vectors of residuals   where  is the 8 × 8 covariance matrix because heterogeneous variances between sexes were applied to the residuals in model (2);  is the identity matrix for individual birds. In the matrix    covariances between male and female traits  and between traits in B and C were zero. The covariance matrices    and  are at the standardized scale. Variance components were estimated using the PBLUP multivariate model (2) for two reasons: (1) the selective genotyping applied to birds in the B environment might lead to overestimation and bias of variance components estimates with a ssGBLUP model []; and (2) the complexity of the models and large number of genotyped animals and non-genotyped animals in the pedigree would make ssGBLUP computationally demanding. The estimation of variance components and EBV prediction with the PBLUP models were carried out by using the REML module in the DMUAI procedure of the DMU package []. For the convergence of the model  the Frobenius norm of the update vector was set to less than 10 []. In addition  the PBLUP models used to estimate the variance components were re-run several times using different starting values to check that the global maximum likelihood of the model was reached. The model was converged  and no change in estimates was observed for different starting values. The standardized variance components of the PBLUP model estimated from the REML module were used to calculate EBV for ssGBLUP multivariate models using the DMU5 procedure in the DMU package []. Because the use of genomic information led to a relatively dense relationship matrix  calculation of the sparse inverse of the LHS was not possible. Therefore  the DMU5 procedure was used to iteratively solve the mixed model equations with the preconditioned conjugate gradient method []. However  this procedure does not provide the prediction error variance of breeding values. The ssGBLUP models were identical to the PBLUP model (2)  except that the pedigree relationship matrix  was replaced by a combined relationship matrix . Matrix  was constructed from the pedigree relationship matrix  and the genomic relationship matrix  with the weight value <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01 [  ] on the pedigree relationships. The genomic relationship matrix  was constructed based on SNP data  using method 1 from VanRaden []. Cross-validation was carried out to evaluate accuracy  bias and dispersion of EBV for genotyped and non-genotyped validation birds in the B environment. Validation was based on EBV estimated from the full and reduced datasets. The full dataset contained all the phenotypic records from TS 1–16  whereas the reduced dataset contained only phenotypic records from TS 1–12. The reduced dataset was a subset of the full dataset  from which records of 14 187 birds in the B environment and 5988 birds in the C environment at TS 13–16 were removed. The validation birds were individuals in the B environment at TS 13–16. Such a design was used to avoid having two or more generations of validation birds. The validation individuals can be genotyped birds or non-genotyped birds. Cross-validation measures were EBV statistics for validation birds that were estimated from the full and reduced datasets []  i.e. the correlation () between  and   the difference ( in means between  and  and the regression slope () of  on   where  and  are vectors of EBV of the validation birds that are estimated from the full and reduced datasets  respectively. The statistics    and  are indicators of population accuracy  bias and dispersion of EBV  respectively []. Expectation of  is  []  where  is the population accuracy of EBV defined as the correlation between the true breeding values and ;  is the population accuracy of EBV defined as the correlation between the true breeding values and . Expectations of  and  are 0 and 1  respectively []. The two validation models were the PBLUP and ssGBLUP models. Standardized covariance components that were estimated from the PBLUP model using the full dataset were used to predict EBV in the PBLUP and ssGBLUP models using the full or reduced datasets. The vectors  and  were at the standardized scale. Scaling does not influence  and . However  scaling applied differently to records of each sex  which means that  would have two values for males and females at the original scale. To compare models   was computed at the standardized scale. Standard errors of    and  were calculated using the formula in . Parameters that were estimated from the PBLUP model (2) were on the standardized scale for all BW traits. The estimates were re-scaled back to the original scale for male and female BW traits. Rescaling of (co)variance matrices used formula () to (): where the matrices of direct additive genetic  permanent environmental maternal  residual and asymptotic covariances were    and   respectively  at the original scale  and    and   respectively  at the standardized scale. The transforming matrix  was: Matrix  is an 8 × 8 matrix  where the off-diagonal elements are zero  the diagonal is vector of phenotypic standard deviations with trait orders: male BW5.B  female BW5.B  male BW6.B  female BW6.B  male BW5.C  female BW5.C  male BW6.C and female BW6.C. The phenotypic standard deviations of diagonals from matrix  were computed from the univariate model (1) for the corresponding traits. The asymptotic covariance matrix  which was used to compute approximate standard errors  was also transformed to the observed scale as in Fischer et al. []. The number of records  means  and standard deviations of BW records for broiler chicken raised in the B and C environments are in Table . The mean BW in the B environment was larger than that in the C environment for the same week and sex. However  the standard deviation of BW in the B environment was smaller than that in the C environment  and thus the coefficient of variation of BW in the B environment was lower. For example  coefficients of variation were 0.098 and 0.174 for male BW5 measured in the B and C environments  respectively. The standard deviation of BW records increased from 5 to 6 weeks of age and the mean BW increased by 500 to 600 g between weeks 5 and 6. As a result  the change in the coefficients of variation was relatively small. For example  the coefficient of variation for BW records of male birds in B environment was equal to 0.098 at both weeks 5 and 6 and those of male broilers in the C environment were equal to 0.174 and 0.163 at weeks 5 and 6  respectively. Mean BW was greater in males than in females at the same age. The standard deviation of BW was also higher in males than in females  and thus the difference in coefficients of variation between sexes was relatively small. The relative difference in means of BW between males and females was larger for records in the B than the C environment. The relative difference in standard deviations between males and females was smaller for records in the B than the C environment. Table  does not show separated statistics for genotyped and non-genotyped birds in the B environment. However  genotyped birds in the B environment had larger means and lower standard deviations for BW records than the non-genotyped birds at the corresponding weeks of age. For example  the mean and standard deviation of BW6 of males were equal to 2814 and 248 for genotyped birds  while they were 2707 and 278 for non-genotyped birds  respectively. Additive genetic variances  heritabilities and permanent environmental maternal effects of traits measured in the B and C environments for male and female BW5-6 were estimated from the PBLUP model (2) and are in Table . Genetic variances of the traits measured in the C environment were considerably higher than those measured in the B environment. The relative differences in variances between traits measured in the B and C environments for male BW5  female BW5  male BW6 and female BW6 were equal to 2.39  2.29  2.29 and 2.04  respectively. Estimates of the heritability of traits measured in the C environment tended to be higher than those measured in the B environment. Heritabilities of BW5-6 ranged from 0.27 to 0.30 and from 0.31 to 0.37 for the same traits measured in the B and C environments  respectively. With age increasing from 5 to 6 weeks  heritability of the traits measured in C decreased  whereas that of the traits measured in B tended to increase. The ratio of the permanent environmental maternal variance to the total phenotypic variance for the traits measured in C decreased from week 5 to 6  whereas that for the traits measured in B tended to increase. The genetic variance for BW was considerably larger in males than in females when considering the traits in the same environment and at the same week of age. The absolute and relative differences in variances between male and female traits were larger for traits measured in C than in B. However  the differences in heritabilities and permanent environmental maternal effects were mostly negligible between male and female traits measured in the same environment and at the same week of age. Estimates of variances  heritabilities and permanent environmental maternal effects differed between male and female traits because the PBLUP model uses heterogeneous residual variances and different scaling for sexes. However  genetic correlations and permanent environmental maternal correlations between sexes were assumed to be 1 for the same traits. Therefore  a single correlation estimate was obtained for the different sexes combined. Table  shows the estimated values from the PBLUP model of the genetic correlations and permanent environmental maternal correlations between BW measured in B and C at weeks 5 and 6. The genetic correlations between BW measured in B and C ranged from 0.48 to 0.54. The genetic correlation of BW between the B and C environments tended to decrease as week of age increased from 5 to 6. Genetic correlations of 0.54 between BW5.B and BW5.C and 0.48 between male BW6.B and BW6.C were obtained. Genetic variances in each environment were larger for BW6 than BW5. The correlation between BW5 and BW6 tended to be higher when measured in C (0.99) than when measured in B (0.96). The permanent environmental maternal correlations between traits measured in B and C ranged from 0.59 to 0.72. The permanent environmental maternal correlations between BW at 5 and 6 weeks and BW measured in B and C followed similar trends as the genetic correlations. For example  the environmental correlations between environments B and C were lower for BW6 than for BW5. Permanent environmental maternal correlations between BW5 and BW6 in the same environment were very high but still a bit higher for traits measured in C than in B. The    and  statistics for the PBLUP and ssGBLUP models were calculated based on EBV estimated from the full and reduced datasets (Table ). These cross-validation measures were computed separately for genotyped and non-genotyped validation birds for EBV of all BW traits. The use of ssGBLUP increased  for all validation birds  and decreased  for genotyped birds compared to the use of PBLUP. With the PBLUP model   and  for the genotyped birds were respectively lower and higher than for the non-genotyped birds. For BW traits measured in B   for the genotyped birds was closer to 1 than that for the non-genotyped birds. In contrast  for BW traits measured in C   for the non-genotyped birds was closer to 1. With the PBLUP model  EBV of BW traits measured in B were deflated  but EBV of BW traits measured in C were inflated. With the ssGBLUP model   for the genotyped birds was higher than for the non-genotyped birds. When the model was changed from PBLUP to ssGBLUP   increased for both genotyped birds and non-genotyped birds. However  the increase in  was much larger for genotyped birds than for non-genotyped birds. For example  the relative increase in  ranged from 31.7 to 73.1% for the genotyped birds and from 6.3 to 14.9% for the non-genotyped birds.  for the genotyped birds was lower with the ssGBLUP than with the PBLUP model  whereas  for the non-genotyped birds was higher with the ssGBLUP than with the PBLUP model. When the model was changed from PBLUP to ssGBLUP   for the genotyped birds increased for traits measured in B and decreased for traits measured in C  but  for the non-genotyped birds decreased for traits measured in B and increased for traits measured in C. With the ssGBLUP model  EBV were deflated for all traits. Regardless of the model used   and  were respectively lower and higher for traits measured in B than for traits measured in C. For example  with PBLUP   for non-genotyped birds was 0.59 for BW5.B and 0.68 for BW5.C  and  for non-genotyped birds was - 0.081 for BW5.B and - 0.052 for BW5.C. Genetic parameters for male and female BW at 5 and 6 weeks of age raised in bio-secure breeding (B) and commercial production (C) environments were estimated using a PBLUP multivariate model. A multivariate ssGBLUP model was used to predict EBV of BW measured in B and C environments. Cross-validations were carried out to assess population accuracy  bias and dispersion of EBV predictions of traits measured in C for genotyped and non-genotyped birds in the B environment when the PBLUP and ssGBLUP models were used. The difference between the B and C environments is mainly determined by hygiene conditions. The strict bio-secure conditions of the B environment are regulated to prevent worldwide spread of diseases to production farms and to avoid the risk of losing the purebred lines []. In contrast  the less strict hygiene conditions of the C environment can result in a higher incidence of diseases. For example  purebred birds in large commercial breeding companies are typically disease-free from salmonella  mycoplasma  leucosis  avian influenza and Newcastle disease []. However  these diseases remain chronic problems in many commercial poultry flocks [  ]. The difference between the B and C environments may also be related to diet and litter management. Commonly  wood shavings are used and are loose  dry  free-flowing in the B environment []. The better litter management in the B environment results in a substantially lower incidence of food-pad dermatitis compared to the C environment []. In our study  several indications of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions due to the differences between the B and C environments were found such as a change in average performance  re-rankings  heterogeneous variances and different heritabilities for the traits measured in the B and C environments. At the same age  the mean BW measured in B was larger than that measured in C  but the standard deviation of BW measured in B was lower than that measured in C. This result agrees with that of Kapell et al. [] who reported larger means and lower standard deviations for BW measured in B than in C for four different purebred lines of broiler chicken raised in the B and C environments. In N’Dri et al. []  slow-growing broiler chicken also had significantly higher BW performance when raised in the B environment compared to the C environment. In our study  estimates of the genetic correlation between BW measured in B and C ranged from 0.479 to 0.535. Statistically  re-ranking refers to genetic correlations different from 1  but in practice  re-ranking is commonly considered important in breeding programs when the correlation is lower than 0.8 []. The genetic correlation in our study refers to a significant re-ranking of birds in the B and C environments. Such a significant re-ranking was also observed by Kapell et al. [] with genetic correlations between B and C environments of 0.46  0.54  0.56 and 0.69 for their four studied lines  respectively. In N’Dri et al. []  the genetic correlations ranged from 0.74 to 0.76. In Lwelamira []  the genetic correlation between BW of indigenous chicken measured in breeding station and village environments was around 0.75–0.76. However  the estimates in Lwelamira [] and N’Dri et al. [] might be slightly overestimated because no permanent environmental maternal effect was included in the model and the datasets comprised a small number of records for only one generation. With the more challenging C environment  we did expect larger variances for traits measured in C than for those measured in B  but we also obtained higher heritabilities for traits measured in C than for the same ones measured in B. Kapell et al. [] found that  in three of their four lines  the heritability of BW5 measured in C (0.32–0.34) was lower than that measured in B (0.36–0.40)  while in the remaining line  the heritability of BW5 measured in C (0.36) was higher than that measured in B (0.32). N’Dri et al. [] reported heritabilities of traits measured in C that ranged from 0.54 to 0.56  whereas for those measured in B the heritability was 0.56. In addition  as week of age increased from 5 to 6  the heritability of traits measured in B tended to increase  whereas that of traits measured in C decreased. There is no clear explanation for these opposite trends. As age increased from 5 to 6 weeks  the genetic correlation between traits measured in B and C decreased. To our knowledge  no such trend in the genetic correlation between traits measured in B and C environments with increasing age has been previously reported in poultry. The production environment also influenced the maternal environmental effects. Permanent environmental maternal correlations between BW measured in B and C were significantly lower than 1. The permanent environmental maternal effect of traits measured in C became smaller as age increased from 5 to 6 weeks. In contrast  the permanent environmental maternal effect of traits measured in B tended to increase as age increased from 5 to 6 weeks. In previous studies in poultry  a reduction in the permanent environment maternal effect on BW with increasing age was found [   ]. However  some studies [  ] also show increasing trends around the age of 5 to 6 weeks  i.e. Begli et al. [] showed that the ratio of the permanent environmental maternal variance to the total phenotypic variance for BW increased slightly from 0.10 at week 2 to 0.12 at week 6  and then decreased to 0.07 at week 10 and Mebratie et al. [] showed that the maternal effect on BW of broiler chicken raised in B tended to increase as the age of the birds increased from -7  to -4 to  days. The effects of the production environment on age-by-genotype interactions were not clear  but the genetic correlation between BW5 and BW6 tended to be lower for traits measured in B than in C. The effects of the production environment on sex-by-genotype interactions were mainly related to the relative difference in variances between male and female BW traits because the genetic correlation between male and female BW within each environment was assumed to be 1 in the multivariate model (2). This assumption was based on our preliminary results that the sex-by-genotype interaction only led to the scaling effect between male and female BW. Based on the strong G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction found in our study  selection for performance under commercial conditions will greatly increase response to selection for BW in broiler breeding programs when birds are phenotype-tested in both B and C environments [  ]. In contrast to the breeding programs that test birds in the B environment only  the breeding programs that test birds in both environments can exploit the re-ranking of birds in B and C  the larger genetic variances of traits measured in C (than those measured in B) and the higher heritability of traits measured in C (than those measured in B). Chu et al. [] showed that with a genetic correlation between traits measured in B and C of 0.5  the scheme that placed 70 and 30% birds in the B and C environments  respectively  for phenotype testing  had substantially larger genetic gains than the scheme that had all birds tested in the B environment. An increase in population accuracy of EBV for genotyped birds has been shown in many studies [              ]  in which population accuracy was assessed by the correlation between EBV and corrected phenotypes. Simulation studies have also shown that correlations between true breeding values and genomic EBV of genotyped individuals were significantly higher with ssGBLUP than with PBLUP models [   ]. Applications of ssGBLUP to improve accuracy of selection have been well-documented in studies on chicken [    ]  cattle [   ] and pig [    ]. However  the extent of the benefits from using genomic information for the accuracy of prediction has not been reported for breeding programs where sib-testing is used because of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions. In these breeding programs  the ultimate goal is to increase the genetic gains in the performance of traits in C for selection candidates that were raised in B  thus only the accuracy of EBV of BW traits measured in C is relevant. Our discussion focusses primarily on the accuracy of EBV of traits measured in C for the selection candidate birds in B that do not have own records for the traits measured in C. The    and  statistics were indicators of population accuracy  bias and dispersion of EBV  respectively []. The  statistic is a ratio of accuracies and prediction of EBV is expected to be more accurate when  is higher with  expected to be always lower than 1. Prediction of EBV is more biased as  deviates more from 0. EBV would be more inflated or deflated when  deviates more from 1. The use of combined pedigree and genomic information in ssGBLUP increased substantially the population accuracy of EBV for genotyped validation birds compared to the use of pedigree data only in PBLUP. Genomic information explains the relationships between individuals better than pedigree information. Thus  genomic information can be beneficial for an efficient “flow” of information from C to validation birds in B in several ways. With pedigree information  only up to 50% of the total genetic variance of the traits measured in C is exploited for the prediction of EBV of the candidates in a G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E sib-test. With genomic information  this percentage can be higher because the realized genomic relationships between full-sib individuals can range from 0.27 to 0.70 for broilers []. The prediction of PBLUP for validation birds typically treats phenotypic performances of their full-sibs in C as an average information whereas phenotypic performances of the full-sibs in C are treated individually in genomic prediction of EBV. In addition  information from related  more distantly related and even unrelated animals can be exploited in genomic prediction when genomic markers are in linkage disequilibrium with genotypes at causal loci []. The Mendelian sampling terms are better exploited with genomic information than with pedigree information [    ]  and thus accuracy of prediction from genomic information increases compared to the accuracy from pedigree information. Most studies [              ] reported the regression slope of corrected phenotypes on EBV as bias  and showed an improvement in bias with genotyped animals. However  the methodology used for cross-validation in those studies is different from that in our study regarding e.g. validation animals and definition of bias. In our study  when the model was changed from PBLUP to ssGBLUP  dispersion or the regression slope of  on  for genotyped birds was improved for traits measured in B  but not for traits measured in C  and bias or difference in means between  and  for genotyped birds was improved for traits measured in B and C. In the literature  an increase in accuracy of EBV for non-genotyped individuals has also been reported when changing from PBLUP to ssGBLUP [    ]  but the bias of prediction of these birds increased [    ]. The cross-validation in these studies was based on corrected phenotypes and EBV. Nonetheless  these results are in agreement with our findings that show that accuracy of EBV of non-genotyped birds increased and bias of the prediction also increased. Validation groups of genotyped and non-genotyped birds had different population accuracies of EBV even with the PBLUP model  which might be related to a non-random distribution of validation birds into the groups. In our dataset  the mean of BW measured in B was higher for genotyped birds than for non-genotyped birds  but the standard deviation of the records in B was lower for genotyped birds than for non-genotyped birds. All parents had genotyping information. This indicated that a selective genotyping strategy was applied for birds raised in B. Within the validation birds  the genotyped birds that are from the top of the distribution have higher relationships between individuals than the non-genotyped birds. From the numerator relationship matrix that was calculated from all animals in the pedigree  the average additive genetic relationship was 0.024 between validation genotyped birds and 0.019 between validation non-genotyped birds. The higher average relationship between genotyped birds results in less variation in EBV estimated from PBLUP  and thus lower population accuracy [] for genotyped birds. When genomic information was used and evaluated in a G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E sib-testing breeding program for broilers  our study was faced with several challenges. The estimation of variance components was challenging with such a large number of genotyped birds  computation-demanding multi-trait models  and selective genotyping. In addition  it was not clear which cross-validation strategies to use in the situation where selection candidates reside in B and do not have performance records in C. Cross-validation is commonly based on the correlation between phenotypes that are corrected for fixed effects from the PBLUP model using the full dataset and EBV that are estimated from PBLUP or ssGBLUP model using the reduced dataset []. However  corrected phenotypes for traits measured in C were not available for validation birds in B. To deal with these challenges  we used the PBLUP model to estimate variance components. The EBV statistics that were estimated from the full and reduced data for validation birds in B were used for validation measures e.g. indicators of population accuracy  bias and dispersion of EBV following the derivation of Legarra and Reverter []. Strictly  the  statistic is not population accuracy  but a ratio of accuracies which is a direct indicator of population accuracy []. It describes the increase in population accuracy of EBV from reduced data to full data. We observed higher values of  for traits measured in B than for those measured in C  but these values are not comparable for different traits. Without realizing that  is a ratio  Putz et al. [] reported a poor performance of this statistic for estimating accuracy of EBV. To estimate population accuracy from   we need prediction error variances and covariances  and genetic variance at equilibrium in a population under selection []. However  instead of transforming it to population accuracy   can be used directly for comparisons of accuracy between competing statistical models or between subsets of animals in a population. Analytical properties of    and  were presented in Legarra and Reverter []. Using data of a simulated population and empirical data of a Brahman beef cattle population  they showed that there was very good agreement between the commonly used cross-validation that is based on corrected phenotypes and EBV estimated from a reduced dataset and the new cross-validation that is based on EBV estimated from reduced and full datasets. The  statistic is an indicator of population accuracy  not an indicator of individual accuracy []. Individual accuracy or model-based accuracy that could be obtained from prediction error variances was not used for model comparisons in our study  because it was not possible to obtain prediction error variances for the ssGBLUP model. In addition  individual accuracy reflects “the credibility of an individual EBV” or “a measure of the standard error of prediction of an individual EBV” []. Population accuracy reflects “the correlation between true breeding values and EBV among the candidates for selection  which is a property of a population  not of an individual” []. For example  when only parent average is known  individual accuracy of full-sibs is up to 0.71. However  the predicted differences between full-sibs have zero accuracy  or population accuracy among full-sibs is zero because full-sibs have the same parent average. Individual accuracy should be used for individual decisions  but population accuracy should be used for the choice of model and the assessment of genetic gain []. Sex-by-genotype interaction has been investigated for different traits in broiler chicken [    ]  other poultry [  ]  pig and cattle [  ]. These studies showed that variances between sexes differed by a factor of 2 or more  but very little re-ranking between sexes was found with genetic correlations between male and female traits higher than 0.85. With a high genetic correlation  the implementation of a bivariate model that treats each sex as different traits could encounter convergence problems in the estimation of variance components. However  when the existence of heterogeneous variance for sexes was not accounted for in the model  a serious re-ranking could occur and thus lead to reduced response to selection []. Failure to account for different variances between sexes could also lead to bias in variance components and predicted breeding values []. Therefore  a relatively simple standardization was applied to male and female records to model heterogeneous variances between sexes without affecting convergence of the model. This standardization was also applied in Chapter 4 of Chu []. The data on BW5-6 of the birds measured in C used in the current study is the same as in Chapter 4 of Chu []  but the models differed. Permanent environmental maternal effects in our study were higher than those reported by Chu []. The multivariate model in Chu [] used BW1-2 and weekly weight gains from weeks 2 to 6 to model BW1-6  and this linear transformation led to the same inferences  but had much better convergence properties. However  because of the trade-off between the complexity of the model and convergence challenge  permanent environmental maternal effects were not included in the model for weekly weight gain from weeks 5 to 6. Therefore  in Chu [] the direct additive genetic effects might be overestimated and the maternal effects underestimated. The model used in the current study was less complex since it included only BW at 5 and 6 weeks. In addition  to facilitate convergence  this study had slightly lower convergence criteria than the recommended value of 10 to 10 [] for the Frobenius norms of the update vector and the gradient vector. Therefore  to ensure that the global maximum likelihood of the model was reached  the PBLUP models to estimate variance components were re-run several times with different starting values. Genetic parameters were estimated for male and female body weight (BW) at 5 and 6 weeks of chicken that were raised in breeding bio-secure (B) and production commercial environments (C). Several indications of interaction between genotype and testing environment (B and C) were found including different average performances  correlations significantly lower than 1  heterogeneous variances and different heritabilities for traits measured in B and C. In addition  genomic information on birds raised in both B and C was used for prediction of EBV of birds in B for BW traits measured in the B and C environments. To evaluate the prediction of EBV  cross-validation statistics of EBV were estimated  namely population accuracy  bias and dispersion of EBV from reduced and full datasets. We found that the use of combined pedigree and genomic information in ssGBLUP substantially increased population accuracy of EBV for genotyped birds compared to the use of only pedigree data in PBLUP. Accuracy of EBV also increased for non-genotyped birds  but bias of EBV prediction increased for non-genotyped birds. In summary  the differences between the B and C environments result in a strong G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction with genetic correlations ranging from 0.479 to 0.535 between BW traits of broilers measured in the B and C environments. In order to ensure maximum genetic gain under commercial conditions  breeding programs should establish recording systems under commercial conditions to provide their customers with genotypes that are well adapted to the commercial environment. Compared to the use of pedigree data only  the use of combined pedigree and genomic information increases population accuracy of EBV substantially for genotyped birds that are raised in the B environment.

In salmon breeding programs  full-sibs of selection candidates are subjected to performance tests for traits that cannot be recorded on selection candidates. While marginal gains in the aggregate genotype from phenotyping and genotyping more full-sibs per candidate decrease  costs increase linearly  which suggests that there is an optimum in the allocation of the budget among these activities. Here  we studied how allocation of the fixed budget to numbers of phenotyped and genotyped test individuals in performance tests can be optimized. Gain in the aggregate genotype was a function of the numbers of full-sibs of selection candidates that were (1) phenotyped in a challenge test for sea lice resistance (2) phenotyped in a slaughter test (3) genotyped in the challenge test  and (4) genotyped in the slaughter test. Each of these activities was subject to budget constraints. Using a grid search  we optimized allocation of the budget among activities to maximize gain in the aggregate genotype. We performed sensitivity analyses on the maximum gain in the aggregate genotype and on the relative allocation of the budget among activities at the optimum. Maximum gain in the aggregate genotype was €386/ton per generation. The response surface for gain in the aggregate genotype was rather flat around the optimum  but it curved strongly near the extremes. Maximum gain was sensitive to the size of the budget and the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits  but less sensitive to the accuracy of genomic prediction and costs of phenotyping and genotyping. The relative allocation of budget among activities at the optimum was sensitive to costs of phenotyping and genotyping and the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits  but was less sensitive to the accuracy of genomic prediction and the size of the budget. There is an optimum allocation of budget to the numbers of full-sibs of selection candidates that are phenotyped and genotyped in performance tests that maximizes gain in the aggregate genotype. Although potential gains from optimizing group sizes and genotyping effort may be small  they come at no extra cost. When the genetic level of a breeding stock from a breeding company is superior to that of its competitors  the breeding company may want to sell its products at a premium price or to increase its market share [  ]. Since genetic gain is cumulative  even small differences in the rate of genetic gain between breeding companies become significant over time. In Atlantic salmon breeding  the sale price of eggs does not vary much between breeding companies because either the differences in the genetic level of eggs are small or these differences are not reflected in the sale price of eggs. In contrast to the sale price of eggs  market shares vary a lot between salmon breeding companies []. The turnover of a breeding company increases with its market share. If a breeding program has a fixed cost  a larger turnover will generate higher profits. Assuming that the market share of a breeding company is related  at least partly  to the genetic level of its products  there is a clear incentive to maximize the rate of genetic gain from the breeding program with regard to the limited annual budget that is available. Salmon breeding programs often use nested mating designs to create both full- and half-sib groups. Since in salmon  family sizes are large  a portion of the members of each family is used as selection candidates  while the remaining individuals are subjected to dedicated performance tests for traits that cannot be recorded on selection candidates  such as disease resistance and slaughter traits. These large family sizes allow for within-family genomic selection  with the use of pedigree information to predict family means and genomic information to exploit within-family variation  i.e. to estimate the Mendelian sampling terms []. In pedigree-based selection  accuracy increases at a declining rate with the number of test individuals that are phenotyped  such that marginal gains in the aggregate genotype decrease. Similarly  with genomic selection  accuracy increases at a declining rate with the number of test individuals that are genotyped [  ]  such that marginal gains in the aggregate genotype decrease. In contrast  the cost of a performance test increases (more or less) linearly with the number of test individuals that are phenotyped and the number of test individuals that are genotyped. When the annual budget of a breeding company that is available for its breeding program is limited  the budget allocated to phenotyping and genotyping individuals in one performance test is at the expense of the budget for an alternative performance test. In other words  such a limited budget has to be allocated among multiple competing activities. Since each activity has decreasing marginal returns  we hypothesize that there is an optimum allocation of the budget. Here  we studied how allocation of a budget to the number of test individuals that are phenotyped and the number of test individuals that are genotyped for performance tests can be optimized in a breeding program for Atlantic salmon. Furthermore  we evaluated the sensitivity of maximum gain in the aggregate genotype and the sensitivity of the relative allocation of budget among activities at the optimum level to (1) the cost of phenotyping in a performance test (2) the cost of genotyping (3) the size of the budget  and (4) the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits. In the \"\" section  we elaborate on the mechanisms that underlie optimum allocations strategies and their implications for any breeding program that uses performance tests on sibs of selection candidates. The simulated nucleus breeding program was based on a simplified version of the real-life breeding program of the Norwegian breeding company SalmoBreed  as it was set-up until 2016 (Håvard Bakke  pers. comm. 2018). The breeding program in our analyses used two performance tests: one challenge test for resistance to sea lice ()  and one slaughter test. Our aim was to maximize gain in the aggregate genotype () by optimizing allocation of the budget to phenotyping and genotyping in each performance test. First  we describe the optimization and sensitivity analyses  and then we provide a detailed description of the prediction of .  is a function of the number of phenotyped full-sibs per family in the challenge test ()  the number of phenotyped full-sibs per family in the slaughter test ()  the number of genotyped full-sibs per family in the challenge test ()  and the number of genotyped full-sibs per family in the slaughter test (). Three hundred families were phenotyped each generation. Females were selected based on estimated breeding values (EBV) that were derived from pedigree data only. Males were selected in a two-step procedure: selection was based first on pedigree EBV and second on genomic EBV. Males from only 120 families were selected in the first step  such that the number of families used for genotyping was 120. This two-step selection strategy allows major savings in the costs for genotyping  while it has little effect on  []. Costs were assumed to be linearly related to the number of records. Costs were €15/fish for   €60/fish for   and €20/fish for genotyping ( and ). The annual budget for performance tests was €444 000  which was based on the budget necessary to phenotype (300 families) and genotype (120 families) 20 full-sibs per family in the challenge test and 15 full-sibs per family in the slaughter test  as in the SalmoBreed breeding program. Using formal notation  the optimization problem was defined as:  where  is a vector with elements  ()  300 is the number of full-sib families that were phenotyped  and 120 is the number of full-sib families that were genotyped. To solve this optimization problem  we performed a grid search. First  we computed all possible  at which the budget was exhausted  i.e. when there was no more budget available to increase any of the activities by one unit. This was done by first generating the sequence   where   with  being the maximum within the budget constraint. For each   a sequence  was generated  where   with  being the maximum for the remaining budget. For each  and   a sequence  was generated  where   with  being the maximum for the remaining budget  provided that it did not exceed . Finally  for     and   a sequence  was generated  where   with  being the maximum for the remaining budget  provided that it did not exceed . Any  for which the budget was not exhausted was removed. We predicted  for each remaining . The point at which  reached a maximum returned the optimal solution for . The maximum  and the solutions for  and  are indicated by an asterisk as:     and . First  as a simple example  we performed the optimization for pedigree-based selection. In this case  only  and  were allowed to vary  while  and  were set to zero  and  was predicted for one-step truncation selection on EBV. Then  we performed the optimization for genomic selection  where      and  were allowed to vary. When allocation of the budget was optimized for genomic selection  we estimated the shadow value of the budget constraint  defined as the gain in the objective function  from a marginal relaxation of the budget constraint. Because we subsequently found that solutions for  and  were fixed at the boundary  i.e.  and   the shadow value was estimated as the increase in  per euro cost of a simultaneous increase by one unit of either  and   or  and . In sensitivity analyses  we evaluated the sensitivity of  and the relative allocation of budget among activities at  to (1) the accuracy of genomic prediction  by reducing the accuracy (Eq. ) by 10 or 20%; (2) the cost of phenotyping in the challenge test  by increasing the cost for  from half to double the original cost (€15/fish) in steps of €7.5/fish; (3) the cost of phenotyping in the slaughter test  by increasing the cost for  from half to double the original cost (€60/fish) in steps of €30/fish; (4) the cost of genotyping  by increasing the cost for  and  from half to double the original cost (€20/fish) in steps of €10/fish; (5) the size of the budget  by increasing the budget from zero to double the original budget (€444 000) in steps of €111 000; and (6) the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits  by changing the economic value of sea lice resistance ( by a factor 0.5  1.5  or 2. In an additional scenario  we used the desired gains [] to maintain fillet fat content (FilletFat) close to its current level for the index corresponding to  by deriving the corresponding breeding goal weight for FilletFat by iteration. Then  this weight was used in the breeding goal to find  in the grid search as before. To speed up the optimizations  we excluded any  from the grid search that was unlikely to be   based on previous results. For example  when the original budget was doubled  there were more than 10 possible  that exhausted the budget  but we expected any new  to be at least as high as in the solution for the original budget. This reduced the possible  to only 3017 options  thereby reducing computation time substantially. The actual SalmoBreed breeding program was more complex than presented in this paper. In this section  we describe only the aspects of the breeding program that were relevant to the prediction of  in the context of this study. The breeding goal included thermal growth coefficient (TGC)  thermal feed intake coefficient (TFC)  fillet yield (FY)  and  for sea lice. TGC is a measure of growth rate that accounts for heterogeneity in smolt weight  rearing period and temperature. TFC is the TGC-analogue for feed intake []. FY is the ratio of fillet weight to whole round weight in %.  is the rate at which sea lice spread across the farmed population  which  combined with the management strategy  determines disease prevalence []. Economic values for TGC and TFC were derived using an adapted version of the bio-economic model described in Janssen et al. []. The bio-economic model accounted for quota on the number of smolts stocked per cage and on biomass at the farm level. The number of smolts stocked per cage was optimized before and after simulated changes in trait levels. The economic value of FY was derived by substituting  for the price of fish in the profit equation of Janssen et al. []  such that the economic value equalled the ratio of the sale price of fish over FY. Survival was ignored in the breeding goal  because response in this trait is difficult to predict accurately  while its economic effect was expected to be small []. Parameters used to predict  are in Table . Year classes in the SalmoBreed breeding program overlapped  resulting in a 3.7 year generation interval. Here  we predicted  per year class  assuming that the 4 year classes in the nucleus were discrete. An overview of the annual selection procedure is in Fig. . Each year class consisted of 150 males and 300 females. Each male was mated to two females  such that 300 full-sib families were produced. Families were reared in separate tanks until tagging. After tagging  each full-sib family was divided into three groups. From each family  a group of 170 fish was reared as selection candidates  a group of  full-sibs was subjected to a challenge test for sea lice resistance  and a group of  full-sibs was subjected to a slaughter test. All selection candidates had a phenotypic record for TGC. In the challenge test  lice density [] was recorded to estimate breeding values for . Schematic overview of selection of parents in the nucleus In the slaughter test  TGC  deheaded gutted yield (DGY)  fillet fat content (FilletFat)  and visceral fat score (ViscFat) were recorded. DGY was the ratio of deheaded gutted weight to whole round weight in %  and was used to predict FY. FilletFat and VIscFat were used to predict TFC. From the challenge test  a group of  full-sibs per family was genotyped  and from the slaughter test  a group of  full-sibs per family was genotyped. Genotyping was performed on a 55k SNP array. At the time of selection  120 candidates per full-sib family had survived and reached sexual maturity. Their sex ratio was 1:1. Females were selected in a single step based on pedigree EBV  obtained using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). Males were selected in two steps: selection was first on pedigree EBV using BLUP  and second on genomic EBV using within-family genomic selection  as described in Lillehammer et al. []. Genomic selection was applied only in males and not in females  because its impact was strongest on males due their higher selection intensity and because nucleus males were also used to fertilize females in the multiplier tier. Females in the multiplier tier  about 10 000 in total  were mass-selected from about 50 000 female offspring of the very best sires and dams of the nucleus. Heritabilities and genetic and phenotypic correlations used are in Table . Genetic parameters for TGC and TFC were estimated from a simulated bivariate normal distribution for gain in bodyweight and cumulative feed intake at harvest  as in Janssen et al. []. The underlying assumptions were a genetic coefficient of variation of bodyweight of 0.15 and a heritability of 0.36 []. For the regression of cumulative feed intake at harvest on gain in bodyweight  a slope of 1.17 g feed/g gain  an intercept of 145 g feed  a genetic correlation of 0.70  and phenotypic correlation of 0.60 were assumed. For   genetic parameters were unknown  but we assumed that a change in the EBV for lice density in the challenge test would give a proportional change in  [  ]. Thus  we used the same phenotypic coefficient of variation and heritability as for lice density []. This is equivalent to including lice density in the selection index and  in the breeding goal  while assuming a genetic correlation of 1 between the two traits. Breeding programs that apply genomic selection can be simulated deterministically by using extended selection index theory  as outlined by Dekkers []. For each trait for which phenotypes were recorded (TGC    DGY  FilletFat  and ViscFat)  an additional genomic trait was added to the selection index. Each of these genomic traits had a heritability of 0.999  a phenotypic variance of 1  and a genetic correlation with the corresponding breeding goal trait equal to the expected accuracy of genomic prediction for that trait (). Hayes et al. [] developed deterministic equations to estimate  from full- and half-sib records  but here we ignored the information from half-sib records  because they were not available for some of the preselected males. The genomic prediction accuracy for  full-sib records was estimated as in []  using:  where  is the effective number of chromosome segments that segregate independently in the population  which was estimated from the variation in kinship among full-sibs () as in Hayes et al. []: where  was estimated as in Hill []: where  is the total length of the genome in Morgan (M)   is the number of chromosomes  and  is the length of chromosome . For Atlantic salmon   M in males and  M in females   is equal to 29  and values for  were obtained from Moen et al. [].  was calculated separately for each sex and averaged  resulting in . To compute  for TGC  we made the simplifying assumption that the number of preselected male selection candidates was the same for each of the 120 remaining families  such that the number of genotyped selection candidates per family was 33  i.e. 32 full-sibs per candidate. An additional  full-sibs per family from the slaughter test had records for TGC  hence  for TGC was computed for  full-sibs per family. For    was based on records for  full-sibs per family. For DGY  FilletFat  and ViscFat   was based on records for  full-sibs per family. Correlations of genomic traits with other traits were derived using path coefficients []. A table with all the correlations for the optimum index for genomic selection is in . As an example  for DGY with  (Eq. ). Thus  the corresponding index included a genomic trait with a heritability of 0.999  a phenotypic variance of 1  a genetic correlation with DGY of 0.674  a phenotypic correlation with DGY of   a genetic correlation with FY of   and a phenotypic correlation with FY of . Gain in the aggregate genotype    was predicted by deterministic simulation of two-step selection in SelAction []. Selected proportions () for males were set to  in the first step and to  in the second step  and for females  in the first step and  in the second step. For all non-genomic traits  the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the effects that were common to full-sibs ( was set to 0.05. Selection indices are in Table . The rate of inbreeding was not evaluated  because it is not computed by SelAction for two-step selection and  in reality  generations overlapped. When the objective was to maximize  with pedigree-based selection (Table )  the optimum number of phenotyped full-sibs per family was equal to 22 in the challenge test () and 19 in the slaughter test ().  was equal to €351/ton  corresponding to €95/ton per year for a 3.7 year generation interval  of which 81% was due to improvement of TGC and TFC. The combined effect of gains in TGC and TFC reduced feed conversion ratio (FCR) from 1.20 to 1.08 (results from the bio-economic model). The gain in  corresponds to an expected reduction in treatment frequency from 3.7 to 3.3 treatments per production cycle  while the average number of lice remains unchanged. The  for any combination of  and  that exhausted the (fixed) budget is in Fig. . At the maximum value of   most of the budget was allocated to the slaughter test. Around the maximum value of   the curve in Fig.  is relatively flat  which means that  was rather robust to changes in budget allocation to  and . However  at both extremes  and particularly with few full-sibs per family in the slaughter test   was compromised. Marginal gains from phenotyping an extra full-sib per family were relatively high when the number of full-sibs per family was small  and decreased as it increased. The selection intensity was constant for any combination of  and  and  therefore  differences in  were largely due to differences in the accuracy of the index and to a minor extent due to differences in genetic variation in the breeding goal caused by the Bulmer-effect (results from SelAction output). Gain in the aggregate genotype () for varying numbers of phenotyped full-sibs per family used in performance tests. The vertical dashed line indicates the optimum and the red point is at  When the objective was to maximize  with genomic selection (Table )  the optimum number of phenotyped and genotyped full-sibs per family was equal to 17 in the challenge test ( and ) and 16 in the slaughter test ( and )  so that .  was €386/ton  corresponding to €104/ton per year for a 3.7 year generation interval  which represents an increase of 10% compared to pedigree-based selection  mostly due to extra gain in TGC. The shadow value of the budget constraint was €3.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10/ton per euro costs when estimated from a one unit increase in  and   and €3.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10/ton per euro costs when estimated from a one unit increase in  and . Figure  gives the maximum  for varying numbers of full-sibs per family for each of the four activities. At all maxima  the number of full-sibs per family in the other three activities was optimum for the given value of the activity. As in the case of pedigree-based selection  the curve is relatively flat around the maximum value of   which means that  was rather robust to changes in budget allocation among  around the optimum.

The slope of the relationship between  and size of the budget  at a budget of €444 000  equalled the average shadow value of the budget constraint. Furthermore   itself became more sensitive to changes in budget allocation among  around the optimum when the budget decreased  and more robust when the budget increased. When the economic value of  increased and allocation of the budget among activities remained constant   increased at an increasing rate. This trend was somewhat more pronounced for  (Fig. b)  because an increasing proportion of the budget was allocated to the challenge test (Fig. f). Note that if the actual economic value would remain constant while only the emphasis on  is increased   would decrease instead. Sensitivity of gain in the aggregate genotype at the optimum () to  the budget  where the slope of the dashed line is equal to the shadow value of the budget constraint   the economic value of  The relative allocation of the budget among activities at  was unaffected by a 20% reduction in the accuracy of genomic prediction (Table ). Figure  shows the relationship of the relative allocation of the budget among activities at  with the other parameters evaluated in the sensitivity analysis. When the cost of phenotyping in the challenge test increased  an increasing proportion of the budget was spent on  (Fig. a). When the cost of phenotyping in the slaughter test increased  an increasing proportion of the budget was spent on  (Fig. b). When the cost of genotyping increased  an increasing proportion of the budget was spent on  and  (Fig. c). For a fourfold change in costs of genotyping  the reduction in  and  was relatively small (Table ). When the size of the budget increased  the relative allocation of the budget among activities remained fairly constant (Fig. d). When the economic value of  increased  the proportion of budget spent on the challenge test ( and ) increased  at the expense of the slaughter test ( and ) (Fig. e).

As a result   was €242/ton for the desired gains index  which represented a decrease of 37% relative to the baseline. For the desired gains index  relative contributions of TGC and TFC to  decreased to 50% compared to 81% in the baseline  whereas relative contributions of  and FY increased. At the maximum  for the desired gains index  more budget was allocated to the challenge test  at the expense of the slaughter test  such that . Results for optimization of the breeding program showed that there is an optimum allocation of the budget to phenotyping and genotyping effort in performance tests that maximizes gain in the aggregate genotype. The curves of H were rather flat around the optima for the scenarios evaluated  hence gains in the aggregate genotype were relatively robust to changes in budget allocation among activities around the optimum value. However  at the extremes  i.e. when the number of full-sibs per family in one of the activities was very small or very large  gains were substantially lower. Although potential gains from optimizing phenotyping and genotyping efforts for a fixed budget may be small  they come at no extra cost (except for the optimization itself). Sensitivity analyses showed that maximum gain in the aggregate genotype was sensitive to the size of the budget (Fig. a) and to the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits (Fig. b)  but was less sensitive to the accuracy of genomic prediction and the costs of phenotyping and genotyping (Table ). The relative allocation of budget among activities at the optimum was sensitive to the costs of phenotyping and genotyping (Fig. a–c) and the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits (Fig. e)  but was less sensitive to the accuracy of genomic prediction (Table ) and the size of the budget (Fig. d). At the optimum  the numbers of phenotyped and genotyped full-sibs were similar for both performance tests  but due to different costs of phenotyping  most of the budget was allocated to the slaughter test. For both performance tests  the optimum number of full-sibs that was genotyped was equal to the number that was phenotyped. The results of this study can be better understood when considering the underlying mechanism of the four activities. Accuracy of selection increases at a declining rate with number of individuals allocated to each of the four activities. Any increase in accuracy increases gain in the aggregate genotype. Thus  gain in the aggregate genotype is maximum at some point where the budget is exhausted. When the budget is exhausted  a further increase in one of the activities should coincide with a decrease in other activities to meet the budget constraint. At the optimum  marginal gains in the aggregate genotype per unit cost are approximately equal for all activities that are bounded by the same constraints  and any deviation thereof is due to the non-continuous nature of the objective function. Since for both performance tests marginal gains per unit cost of genotyping were higher than those per unit cost of phenotyping but the number of genotyped full-sibs was bounded by the number of phenotyped full-sibs  the optimum number of genotyped full-sibs per family equalled the optimum number of phenotyped full-sibs per family. With equal numbers of phenotyped and genotyped full-sibs per family per performance test ( and )  gain in the aggregate genotype is a function of only two variables  which are both only bounded by the budget constraint. At the optimum  marginal gains per unit costs of these two variables are approximately equal  as evidenced by the similar shadow values calculated from a simultaneous increase by one unit of either  and  (€3.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10/ton)  or  and  (€3.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10/ton). When marginal gains per unit costs are equal  moving budget from one activity to another has no effect on gain in the aggregate genotype  i.e. what is lost by decreasing the budget for one activity is gained by increasing the budget for the other activity. Since marginal gains per unit cost converge for all activities (bounded by the same constraints) when approaching the optimum  moving budget from one activity to the other has little effect on gain in the aggregate genotype around the optimum. Thus  when costs of phenotyping or genotyping change  budget can be reallocated among activities (Fig. a–c)  such that maximum gain in the aggregate genotype does not change much (Table ). However  when costs of all activities change simultaneously in the same direction  which is equivalent to a change in size of the budget  the maximum gain in the aggregate genotype will change (Fig. a). The above mechanism explains why the curve for H is rather flat around the optimum (Figs.  and ). This result is consistent with the few studies in the literature that focused on the economic optimization of test group sizes. Some of the older studies that dealt with optimization of cattle and pig breeding programs were reviewed by Cunningham [] and Lindhé and Holmquist-Arbrandt []  respectively. More recently  De Vries and Van Der Steen [] evaluated the distribution of testing capacity across a sire and dam line in pig breeding for a fixed total testing capacity. In their optimizations  they did not compute the full range of possible solutions  hence their solutions may have been somewhat off the optimum. However  differences in the objective function (the selection response) between scenarios were small close to the optimum. Dekkers et al. [] optimized the size of progeny groups in a dairy cattle breeding program and computed several points on the response surface  which they interpolated. For a large range of options  such an approach may be more efficient than the grid search in our study. However  we managed to keep the feasible region of the solution relatively small by using previous results  such that the grid search was not so computation intensive. Similar to our study  De Vries and Van Der Steen [] and Dekkers et al. [] found that marginal gains in the objective function decreased with increasing group size  and that the curve of the objective function was relatively flat around the optimum. The simulated breeding program used within-family genomic selection  for which the reference population was limited to sibs of selection candidates. Alternatively  a breeding program could use population-wide genomic selection  for which the reference population would include both sibs of selection candidates and largely unrelated individuals. In population-wide genomic selection  the reference population increases in size when additional animals are genotyped. The value of these additional animals depends strongly on their relatedness to selection candidates []  which decreases over time  such that older generations contribute relatively little to the overall accuracy. Furthermore  the relatedness between individuals in the reference population and selection candidates is higher within than between year classes. Thus  sibs of selection candidates contribute most to the accuracy of genomic prediction. This is evidenced by similar accuracies of population-wide and within-family genomic prediction in salmon breeding programs []. The accuracy of population-wide genomic prediction is difficult to estimate deterministically  whereas the accuracy of within-family genomic prediction can be estimated more precisely  as in our study (Eq.   []). Since accuracies of population-wide and within-family genomic prediction are similar but deterministic methods are preferable for optimization  within-family genomic prediction may be assumed here  even when population-wide genomic prediction is used in practice. To predict genetic gain in  for sea lice  some assumptions were inevitable. We assumed that lice density is genetically the same trait as susceptibility in field conditions  which is supported by a genetic correlation of 0.88 between lice count in a challenge test and under field conditions []. We assumed that susceptibility and infectivity were genetically uncorrelated  although these traits might have the same genetic basis []. Susceptibility and infectivity have multiplicative effects on   such that a genetic correlation of 1 between susceptibility and infectivity approximately doubles genetic progress in  []. For example  with a genetic correlation of 1  a 10% improvement in lice density reduces both susceptibility and infectivity by 10%  such that  reduces by . The economic effect of a genetic correlation of 1 can thus be predicted by doubling the economic value of   which is covered by the conducted sensitivity analysis. If the genetic correlation between susceptibility and infectivity is equal to 1  more budget needs to be allocated to the challenge test (Fig. e) and  increases to €456/ton (Fig. b). The objective of the optimization was to maximize gain in the aggregate genotype averaged over males and females  which maximizes the rate of genetic gain in the nucleus. Since nucleus males are also used in the multiplier tier  the strategy of genotyping males shortens the genetic lag between the nucleus and multiplier tier. Furthermore  it allows the breeding company to create production lines that are selected on quantitative trait loci for specific disease resistance. However  for the above objective  it would be relevant to test how much extra gain could be achieved by genotyping also female nucleus selection candidates. Similar to the selection of males  two-step selection could be used for females  with the second step based on within-family genomic selection. Such two-step selection would increase the genetic selection differential for females relative to pedigree-based selection  although somewhat less than for males due to the lower selection intensity in females. When preselected females are taken from the same full-sib families as preselected males  the increase in costs could be limited to the costs of genotyping preselected females  while making better use of genotyped full-sibs in performance tests. Such a strategy would  however  increase the rate of inbreeding  because the first selection step would force preselected females to belong to the same families as preselected males. The rate of inbreeding  however  can be controlled by other measures  such as optimum contribution selection []. Thus  genotyping a preselected fraction of female selection candidates may be a cost-effective option to further accelerate genetic gain in the nucleus. When FilletFat was given zero weight in the breeding goal  records of fat content in the slaughter test served to explain variation in TFC that was not explained by variation in TGC. The consequence was that FilletFat decreased (Table ) and FCR improved  which agrees with theory []. In the desired gains index  the positive genetic correlation between FilletFat and TFC was antagonistic  because weights on FilletFat and TFC had opposite signs  whereas this correlation was not antagonistic when FilletFat had zero weight. Therefore  the proportion of variation in the breeding goal explained by a given number of phenotyped or genotyped individuals in the slaughter test was lower in the desired gains index than when FilletFat had zero weight. As a result  the relative importance of the slaughter test decreased in the desired gains index and at the optimum  a larger proportion of the budget was allocated to the challenge test  at the expense of the slaughter test. The optimization of full-sib test group size and genotyping effort is not restricted to breeding objectives based on economic values but can also be used for any desired gains index. In the desired gains index used here  the weight given to FilletFat may be perceived as its shadow price []. This shadow price indicates the maximum amount that producers can afford to pay for a marginal change in FilletFat  i.e. the value of a 1% increase with other traits held constant. In other words  the weight given to FilletFat implies that producers would expect the sale price of fish to decrease by €170/ton when FilletFat decreases by 1%. Underlying this shadow price is the assumption of a negative genetic correlation between TGC and FilletFat. This genetic correlation is negative when genetic improvement of TGC leads to a shorter time interval to reach a constant harvest weight  but it is positive when  instead  genetic improvement of TGC leads to a greater harvest weight in a constant growing period [    ]. If a positive genetic correlation was more appropriate  FilletFat would increase when its economic value is zero and a negative weight would be required to keep its level constant. Thus  the shadow price of FilletFat strongly depends on the genetic correlation of FilletFat with TGC  which depends on an uncertain management response to improvement of TGC. Based on our predictions  the transition from pedigree-based to genomic selection increased the rate of genetic gain by 10% per generation. This increase is only moderate  because TGC contributed most to gain in the aggregate genotype and its accuracy was already high with pedigree-based selection. Still  most extra gains from genomic selection were due to extra gain in TGC. Thus  although genomic selection may be particularly useful for traits that cannot be recorded on selection candidates  most of the extra gain may come from a slightly higher accuracy on a trait that already dominates gain in the aggregate genotype in pedigree-based selection  such as TGC in this study. For the optimized genomic selection program  gain in the aggregate genotype was €386/ton per generation. This is an optimistic estimate of the increase in benefits from genetic improvement  because it was computed as if economic values were used to balance the emphasis on breeding goal traits in an optimal way  which may not be the case in practice. In practice  for example  FilletFat is held constant using desired gains. For the optimized desired gains index that keeps FilletFat constant  gain in the aggregate genotype was €242/ton per generation. For a generation interval of 3.7 years  as in the SalmoBreed breeding program  this would correspond to an increase in benefits of about €66/ton per year. This estimate is only slightly higher than a previous estimate of €50/ton per year reported by Gjerde et al. []  which was a crude estimate based on realized gains in growth and feed conversion ratio. If we assume a yield of 3.8 kg product per egg  the genetic value of an egg increases by about €0.25 per year. In contrast  the sale price of eggs is about €0.18/egg and has increased by only<U+2009>~<U+2009>€0.01 per year over the last couple of years. This suggests that only a minor proportion of the benefits of genetic improvement are accrued by the breeding company  while most of the benefits are passed on to fish producers and consumers. In the short term  benefits from genetic improvement may be accrued by fish producers  when genetic improvement generates a competitive advantage. These benefits may be passed on to the consumer in the long term when competition pushes profit margins downwards []. The uneven distribution of benefits from genetic improvement between the breeding company and the fish producers causes underinvestment in genetic improvement. If the breeding company received a premium of €0.01/egg for its annual sales of 120 million eggs  it would accrue an extra 1.2 million euro. The shadow value of the budget constraint on performance tests was about €3.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10/ton per euro costs. This means that if gain in the aggregate genotype increased linearly with size of the budget  it would increase by €3.2/ton per €100 000 costs. Thus  assuming linearity  with a premium of €0.01/egg  the use of the extra returns to increase the budget for performance tests could increase gain in the aggregate genotype by €1.2 million<U+2009>×<U+2009>€3.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10/ton per euro costs  which equals €38/ton per generation. Using the same assumptions as before  a premium of €0.01/egg would increase the genetic potential of an egg by an extra (€0.038/kg per generation<U+2009>×<U+2009>3.8 kg/egg)/(3.7 year per generation)  which equals €0.039/egg per year. Such higher genetic gains would improve the competitive position of the breeding company  while at the same time increasing the benefits to producers. As long as discounted benefits from extra genetic gain exceed the discounted costs  such a premium on genetic superiority would be profitable for both the breeding company and producers. An optimum allocation of a fixed budget to phenotyping and genotyping efforts in performance tests exists that maximizes gain in the aggregate genotype. Maximum gain in the aggregate genotype was sensitive to the size of the budget and to the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits  but was less sensitive to the accuracy of genomic prediction and the costs of phenotyping and genotyping. The relative allocation of budget among activities at the optimum was sensitive to the cost of phenotyping and genotyping and to the relative emphasis on breeding goal traits  but was less sensitive to the accuracy of genomic prediction and the size of the budget. Although potential gains from optimizing phenotyping and genotyping efforts may be small  under a fixed budget  they come at no extra cost.

The 829 selected SNPs explained 61% of the phenotypic variance of RFI  which constitutes a promising perspective for applying genetic selection on FE relying on molecular-based prediction. Improving feed efficiency (FE) has become a relevant but challenging focus for pig breeding selection schemes due to its strong influence on the economic sustainability and environmental impact of pig production. FE is a complex phenotype that depends on genetics [  ]  on the health and physiological status of the animals []  on environmental factors [  ]  and on the gut microbial composition [  ]. An additional complexity for genetic improvement of FE is the definition of adequate selection criteria relative to feed intake and other production traits  such as growth  which in turn show a mutual dependency. Besides the conventional feed conversion ratio (FCR)  the most widely used measure of FE during the last decade is residual feed intake (RFI)  i.e. the deviation of the animal’s feed intake from the amount of feed predicted to be required for maintenance  growth  and back fat deposition []. Estimates of the heritability of RFI range from 0.14 to 0.53 [  ]  whereas the reported accuracies of RFI genomic prediction range from 0.40 to 0.53 [  ]. Selection for RFI has proven to be a successful strategy for improving FE in pigs [    ] but requires recording of individual feed intake  body weight gain  and back fat  which is expensive and time-consuming. Thus  identifying candidate genes and potential regulators of FE that are predictive of the animal’s genetic potential for this phenotype is of paramount interest. Several studies at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels have been performed to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated to FE and to unravel the genetic architecture of this complex trait in pigs [  ]  including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [  ] and whole-genome expression analyses [    ]. Among the tissues that are relevant for FE  several studies have focused on the muscle transcriptome [  ]. Muscle plays a central role in maintaining overall energy balance by controlling the storage of lipids and carbohydrates [  ]. However  the results from different studies are not always consistent and most studies ignore gene-by-gene interactions and fail to integrate structural and functional genomics data. Holistic approaches that combine multiple sources of information increase the power to identify candidate genes [  ] and provide a more complete picture of the biological processes under investigation. To date  a limited number of studies targeting FE in pigs and other livestock species have implemented integrative approaches  such as system genetics- or gene network-based methods [  ]. The objective of our study was to use a systems-based approach that integrates information from several FE-related phenotypes  SNP co-associated networks  and gene-expression data to disentangle the molecular mechanisms that underlie FE in pigs. Our aim was also to identify candidate genes and their potential regulators in order to develop a panel of markers that can be used as predictors of an individual’s genetic potential for FE. In this study  we integrated several genome and gene expression analyses that aimed at identifying candidate genes  putative regulators  and predictors of FE in pigs. The different approaches used are described below and outlined in Additional file : Figure S1. A population of 350 Duroc barrows from five paternal half-sib families was used in this experiment. Pigs were raised under intensive standard conditions at the Institut de Recerca i Tecnologia Agroalimentàries (IRTA) Experimental Pig Farm in Monells (Girona). They were distributed across four fattening batches in a partially balanced but connected design: one batch included the offspring of all five sires  while the remaining batches contained the offspring of four of the five sires. All animals were subjected to the same management procedures  with ad libitum access to feed  with two standard diets with energy densities of 10.27 MJ/kg until the animals reached 90 kg of live weight (<U+25B2>150 days of age)  and of 9.94 MJ/kg during the last 40 days before slaughter. A detailed description of the experimental population and management conditions is in Gallardo et al. [] and Quintanilla et al. []. Animal care and experimental procedures were performed by following national and institutional guidelines for the Good Experimental Practices and were approved by the IRTA Ethical Committee. Pigs were weighed individually at<U+2009>~<U+2009>65 days of age and every 3 weeks during the fattening period  plus on the day of slaughtering (~<U+2009>190 days of age). Backfat thickness (BF) was also measured every 3 weeks using PIGLOG 105 ultrasound equipment. Individual feed intake was recorded by electronic feeders located in each pen (IVO-feeding station  Insentec  Marknesse  The Netherlands). The average daily feed intake (ADFI) of each individual during the trial was computed. Two measures of individual FE during fattening were computed: FCR  measured as the simple ratio of ADFI and average daily gain (ADG) (kg/kg)  and RFI  computed as the residual of the following model: where  is the average daily feed intake of individual  (in batch ) during the whole fattening period (from<U+2009>~<U+2009>70 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>190 days of age);  is the effect of batch level (four batches);  is the age of individual  at the midpoint of the analysed period (135 days on average but ranging from 121 to 148 days)  and  is the corresponding regression coefficient;    and  are  respectively  the metabolic weight (computed as body weight 0.75) at the midpoint of the trial  the ADG during the period  and the BF at the end of the period for individual ;        and   are the corresponding partial regressions coefficients nested within batch; and  is the residual feed intake of individual . Pigs were slaughtered at an approximate age of 190 days (average live weight of 122 kg). After recording live body weight and BF in vivo  pigs were slaughtered according to a commercial protocol. Carcass weight (CW) was registered  the killing out percentage (KO  %) computed  and lean percentage (LEAN) was inferred based on fat and muscle thickness data measured with an AutoFOM ultrasound device. Finally  the percentage of intramuscular fat content (IMF) was determined on a sample of  (GM) muscle by near infrared transmittance (NIT  Infratec ® 1625  Tecator Hoganas  Sweden)  as described in [  ]. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of the 350 Duroc pigs was performed using the porcine SNP60 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA)  which contains 62 163 SNPs. SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 5%  a rate of missing genotypes higher than 10%  and those that did not conform to Hardy–Weinberg expectations (threshold set at a  value of 0.001) were filtered out. We also excluded SNPs that did not map to the porcine reference genome (Sscrofa11.1 assembly) and that were located on the X chromosome. After these filtering steps  we obtained a subset of 30 096 SNPs that were used in the GWAS and in the expression GWAS (eGWAS). Quality control of genotypes and the filtering steps were performed with the GenomeStudio (Illumina) and PLINK [] programs  respectively. The association weight matrix (AWM)  which has been applied in previous studies [  ]  allows gene co-association networks with regulatory significance to be generated by combining GWAS results with network inference algorithms. In this study  we used the AWM approach to identify candidate genes and regulators that underlie FE. Nine phenotypes were considered in the analysis: RFI  FCR  ADFI  ADG  CW  IMF  KO  BF and LEAN. Since the most accepted FE measure is RFI  it was set as the key (target) phenotype in the AWM procedure  whereas the other traits were selected based on their association with FE  but also on their relevance in pig production. In a first step  a GWAS was performed for each of the nine aforementioned traits by using the genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) software []. The additive effects of each SNP () on each trait were estimated according to the following model: where  corresponds to the phenotype of the th individual in the th batch;  corresponds to the th batch effect (4 levels);  is the covariate of age at slaughter of individual   and  is the corresponding regression coefficient;  is the infinitesimal genetic effect of individual   with   where  is the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) calculated using the filtered autosomal SNPs based on the methodology of Yang et al. []  and  is the additive genetic variance;  is the genotype (coded as 0 1 2) of individual  for the th SNP  and  is the allele substitution effect of SNP  on the trait under study; and  is the residual term. Following a previously published procedure []  in order to build the AWM  we retained the SNPs that were associated (nominal p-value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) with RFI (target trait) and/or with three or more of the remaining eight phenotypes. Considering both cis-action and the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in pigs  only the SNPs that were located within or less than 10 kb from the nearest annotated gene (Sscrofa11.1 assembly) were retained. Next  we used the z-scores of the estimated allele substitution effects of the SNPs to build the AWM matrix of dimension number of retained SNPs (rows) per number of traits (columns). Hierarchical clustering of traits from allele substitution effects of SNPs was estimated and visualized using the ‘hclust’ R function. The AWM matrix allowed us to explore both correlations between traits based on SNP additive effects (column-wise) and gene-by-gene interactions (row-wise). Gene-by-gene interactions were predicted using the partial correlations and information theory (PCIT) algorithm []. The resulting network was used to identify potential regulators by focusing on the transcription factors (TF) within the network. Once the TF were identified  we applied an information lossless approach [] to the inferred co-association network  which explored the combinations (trios and quartets) of TF that spanned most of the network topology with minimum redundancy. Gene expression profiles in muscle were obtained for three groups of 35 pigs with high  medium  and low lipid metabolism  respectively  which were selected from the 350 pigs in the population by a principal components analysis  as described in Ref. []. The objective  here  was to select animals with divergent profiles regarding fat deposition and lipid metabolism  but these animals covered the whole spectrum of the population’s variability regarding RFI and the other analysed traits. GM muscle samples from these 104 pigs were immediately collected after slaughter and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until storage at -<U+2009>80 °C. Total RNA was extracted by using the acid/phenol method [] implemented in the Ribopure isolation kit (Ambion  Austin  TX). The mRNA expression profile of each sample was characterized by hybridization to the GeneChip Porcine Genome Array (Affymetrix Inc.  Santa Clara  CA)  which includes 23 998 probes  in two laboratories (66 and 38 samples in each laboratory). Details about RNA isolation and microarray hybridisation procedures are in []. Pre-processing  background correction  normalization  and log-transformation of the expression data were performed by computing a robust multi-array average (RMA) per probe []. The gene intensity significance level for detecting expressed probes was calculated by using the MAS 5.0 algorithm []. Control probes and probes for which the expression level was lower than the detection threshold in 75% of the pigs were discarded for further analyses. The remaining probes were mapped to the  genome assembly (Sscrofa11.1) using the Biomart database available at the Ensembl repository (). Expression values for probes that mapped to the same locus were averaged in order to obtain a global estimate of transcript expression at the gene level. Probes that failed to map to a known gene were also removed. The effect of the laboratory where microarrays were assayed on gene expression levels was estimated to be an additive effect  thus  a systematic laboratory effect was included in subsequent analyses of the gene expression data. Twenty pigs with extreme RFI were selected for differential expression (DE) analysis: 10 highly feed-efficient (HFE) pigs with low RFI and 10 lowly feed-efficient (LFE) pigs with high RFI. Offspring of four sires were present in both the HFE and LFE groups and all 20 animals had different dams. The DE analysis between HFE and LFE animals was done by following the limma-trend pipeline recommendations [  ]  fitting a model with batch and laboratory effects  in addition to FE-group. The limma’s empirical Bayes procedure was modified to incorporate a mean–variance trend that models the relationship between variance and gene signal intensity. Fold-change (FC) was computed as the difference between the logarithms of mean expression levels in LFE and HFE pigs  i.e. a positive FC corresponds to higher expression in the LFE group compared to their HFE counterparts. Genes were considered to be DE when |FC| was higher than 1.5 and the q-value lower than 0.05  after adjusting for multiple-testing with the false discovery rate method []. The same dataset of the expression level of 7007 genes on 20 extreme pigs for RFI was used in a multivariate framework to perform a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) [] in order to identify a subset of genes that discriminated samples according to RFI classification (HFE vs. LFE). In a first step  we determined the classification error rates for the sample group assignation with respect to the number of variables (genes) selected for each component. The classification error rates and optimal number of variables to select for each component are represented in Additional file : Figure S2. The classification performance of the final model was assessed in a fivefold cross-validation repeated 500 times  by a function of the maximum distance between overall misclassification error rate and balanced error rate that considers the proportion of incorrectly classified samples weighted by the number of samples per group. Finally  a regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) was performed using the whole expression dataset for all 104 individuals. The rCCA is an unsupervised multivariate approach to identify subsets of canonical variables that maximize the correlation between two datasets  and   of sizes (n<U+2009>×<U+2009>p) and (n<U+2009>×<U+2009>q)  respectively []. In our analysis   was the matrix of phenotypes for all 104 animals for the traits that were most directly associated with FE (i.e. RFI  FCR  ADG and ADFI) and  was a matrix with gene expression values for all 104 animals. The shrinkage method was used to tune the regularization parameters <U+03BB> and <U+03BB>  with shrinkage values of <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.121138 and <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.128887. Instead of considering all genes that were included in the first canonical component (CC1)  we decided to apply a more conservative approach and keep as candidates only the genes for which the correlation between gene expression and FE related traits (RFI  FCR  ADG and ADFI) was higher than 0.29 (median<U+2009>+<U+2009>2*SD). The aim of the eGWAS was to identify SNPs that are associated with the expression of the candidate genes identified in the AWM approach  as well as genes reported by at least two of the three following methods mentioned before: rCCA  sPLS-DA and DE. The association of each SNP with the expression of each gene was estimated by fitting the following model using the GCTA software []: where  corresponds to the gene expression of individual  raised in batch  and processed in laboratory ;      and  are as defined in the previous GWAS model; and  is the fixed effect of the laboratory where the microarray was assayed (2 levels). After multiple testing adjustment  the cut-off for a significant association at the whole-genome level was established at a q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05. Functional classification and pathway analyses of the list of candidate genes were carried out using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (IPA; Ingenuity Systems  ). Significance levels for enrichment of each canonical pathway in the list of candidate genes were calculated using Fisher’s exact test and the resulting p-values were corrected for multiple-test using the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm []; the cut-off for considering an enrichment as significant was established at a corrected p-value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. The proportion of phenotypic variance of RFI that was explained by the SNPs identified in the previous analyses was estimated by a Bayesian Gibbs sampling approach  using the gibbs2f90 program included in the Blupf90 package [  ]. We performed three estimations of genomic variance by considering different subsets of SNPs: (1) SNPs that were selected by the AWM procedures (829 SNPs); (2) the former AWM-SNPs plus the eSNPs identified by the eGWAS (1078 SNPs); and (3) all SNPs that passed quality controls (~<U+2009>31K SNPs). The single-step method [] implemented in Blupf90 was used. Subsequently  we also performed a pedigree-based estimation of RFI heritability  in order to define a baseline for comparing the proportion of variance explained by the SNPs. All estimates of variance components were obtained with the following animal model: where all terms are defined as previously described for the GWAS. For the Bayesian implementation  the additive genetic effect  was assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of zero and different (co)variance matrices depending on the analysis: (1)  for genomic-based estimations  where  is the genomic relationship matrix computed for the different SNP subsets  as described in []; and (2)  for pedigree-based estimation  where  is the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix. A  uniform distribution was assumed for batch and age effects. The Gibbs sampler algorithm was run for 100 000 iterations with a burn-in of 10 000 rounds  and then saving one out each 10 samples. The accuracy for predicting RFI phenotype based on the different sources of genetic (pedigree) and genomic (all SNPs  and AWM or AWM-eGWAS subsets of SNPs) information was assessed by cross-validation. The cross-validation scheme comprised 20 random replicates. In each replicate  the whole dataset was split randomly into training and validation datasets that contained approximately 88 and 12% of records  respectively. The training dataset was used to predict the genetic additive effects of SNPs by solving the mixed model equations (blupf90) with variance components estimates that were obtained with the complete dataset. Subsequently  phenotypes in the validation dataset were predicted from model solutions obtained in the training set and the prediction accuracy was defined as the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed records in the validation dataset. The accuracy of each model/SNP subset was computed by averaging correlations across replicates. In our study  we focused on the genetic regulation of FE  but we considered nine traits that are directly or indirectly associated with FE  such as growth rate  feed intake  carcass traits  and fat deposition. The analysed pigs belonged to a commercial Duroc line that is used to produce highly cured products and characterised by its high IMF depot. Summary statistics of the phenotypes considered for the analysed population (350 pigs) are in Table . Due to being a residual term  RFI has a mean of zero  whereas the mean for FCR indicated that  on average  the analysed Duroc pigs consumed 3.16 kg of feed for 1 kg of growth. The values for the remaining phenotypes are consistent with the general characteristics of this Duroc line: carcasses weighing<U+2009>~<U+2009>95 kg with a KO percentage of<U+2009>~<U+2009>75%; high subcutaneous fat deposition (mean BF of 24 mm) and intramuscular compartments (mean IMF in GM reaches values<U+2009>><U+2009>5%)  and a low lean percentage in the carcass of 40.8% compared with other breeds []. It should be noted that age and weight at slaughter were substantially greater than the values normally reached in commercial production conditions. Phenotypic means in the two groups selected for extreme RFI (HFE and LFE) are also in Table . The two groups diverged significantly for all FE phenotypes  particularly in the classification criterion RFI (mean values of -<U+2009>0.30 vs. 0.26 kg/d in the HFE vs. LFE groups) but also in FCR (mean values of 2.72 vs. 3.30 for the HFE vs. LFE pigs  p-value<U+2009><<U+2009>10). These two groups of animals also differed in feed consumption and production traits  with the HFE animals displaying lower feed intake (0.70 kg less per day)  smaller weight at slaughter (carcasses 9 kg lighter)  higher lean content (42.6 vs. 37.0%) and lower IMF (4.8 vs. 7.7%) than the LFE pigs. Correlation coefficients between the analysed phenotypes (r) are in Table . High but less than 1 phenotypic correlations (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.68) were observed between the two FE indicators RFI and FCR. Both these traits were significantly correlated with feed intake (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.46 and 0.43 for RFI and FCR  respectively). Conversely  only FCR was associated with ADG and BF  because RFI was the residual term from a regression function that encompassed ADG and BF and was  therefore  independent from these two phenotypes. The strongest phenotypic relationships were observed between feed intake (ADFI)  growth (ADG)  and CW (r ranging from 0.71 to 0.81). Subcutaneous fat deposition (BF) showed a moderate to high correlation with all traits  except with RFI and KO  whereas IMF had a low to moderate  but always significant  correlation with all analysed traits  including RFI. LEAN displayed negative associations with fat deposition traits (BF and IMF)  but also with ADG  ADFI and RFI. Finally  the phenotypic correlations of KO with the other traits were negligible  except with CW. The GWAS results served as the basis for the AWM approach. After the SNP selection process  829 SNPs were retained to build the AWM co-association matrix with RFI plus the eight other analysed phenotypes. Consistently with the AWM procedure  most selected SNPs (620 out of 829) were associated with the key phenotype RFI and with on average two other traits  while the remaining 209 SNPs were associated with at least three of the other traits but not with RFI. Annotation of the 829 SNPs that were selected in the AWM procedure identified 879 genes  since several SNPs were annotated to more than one gene. The list of selected SNPs and the corresponding annotated genes is in Additional file : Table S1. Among the genes that were associated with several of the analysed traits  we would like to mention those related to the nervous system  such as  ()   ()   ()  and  (). We also identified genes that are linked to the immune system such as - () and  ()  which are among the genes that were associated with a large number of traits. Using the AWM columns  correlations between traits were also computed based on the estimates of the standardized allele substitution effects of the set of 829 SNPs across traits. Sample size and experimental design did not allow us to properly estimate genetic correlations between traits; using pedigree information only  the uncertainty regions for these parameters covered the whole parametric space. Therefore  phenotypic correlations (Table ) were used as a basis to compare the relationships between traits based on SNP effects. The correlation coefficients obtained from AWM were in general consistent with but larger than the estimated phenotypic correlations between traits (Table ). For instance  the AWM-derived correlation coefficient between RFI and FCR increased to 0.76 (vs. r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.68)  and that between BF and IMF was 60% higher than the corresponding phenotypic correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.61 vs. r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.39). In contrast  the correlation between ADG and ADFI captured by AWM was only slightly higher than that the estimated phenotypic correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.77 vs. r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.74). The map of associations between phenotypes based on the AWM additive effects of selected SNPs was not identical to the observed phenotypic relationships between traits  and this result is reflected by the hierarchical tree cluster in Fig.   in which traits that are mainly associated with FE  i.e. RFI and FCR  cluster together. This FE block was associated with a second block that included the remaining traits distributed in two groups: Group 1 included growth  feed intake  and fat deposition  which was further subdivided in two blocks: ADFI<U+2009>+<U+2009>ADG<U+2009>+<U+2009>CW and BF<U+2009>+<U+2009>IMF; and Group 2 included LEAN and KO  which clustered together in spite of their negligible phenotypic correlation. Hierarchical tree cluster of the nine analysed phenotypes obtained from the standardized additive effects of 829 SNPs identified by the AWM procedure. RFI  residual feed intake; FCR  feed conversion ratio; ADFI  average daily feed intake; ADG  average daily gain; BF  back fat thickness; CW  carcass weight; KO%  killing out percentage; LEAN  lean percentage; IMF  intramuscular fat content The network derived from the co-association analysis obtained by PCIT gathered 829 nodes  which corresponded to the formerly mentioned 829 SNPs and that were connected by 57 718 significant edges that represented the significant interactions occurring between them. Sixty-eight SNPs mapped to genes classified as TF (indicated as TF in Additional file : Table S1) and were thus candidates as potential regulators of the network. As expected  TF genes were the most interacting genes in the network  i.e. the hub in the co-association network topology. Among these genes  - ()  - ()  and --- () accumulated the largest number of interactions within the network (more than 220 interactions  each). Other TF genes from the RUNX and FOX () families  jointly with the  ()   ()   () or  () genes  can also be included in the list of top TF based on their number of interactions  since they all showed a number of connections larger than average (139). The information lossless approach allowed the identification of the combinations of TF that spanned most of the network topology with minimum redundancy. These combinations (trios or quartets) of TF are in Table . The top trios of regulators spanned a network that gathered between 519 and 521 nodes (out of 829). When a combination of four TF was considered  the regulated network expanded from 603 to 613 nodes. Both types of combinations  trios and quartets  included at least one of the top TF mentioned above (     or ; and in quartets also  or )  combined with other TF that had a smaller number of but less redundant interactions  such as  ()   () or  ()  which was present in three out of six top combinations (Table ). The co-association network that spanned the maximum number of nodes (613) was linked to the combination of      and  TF. Other relevant TF included in the network (although not taking part in the top combinations or regulators)  that had a large number of interactions (><U+2009>100) and that displayed associations with FE were the  ()  - ()  and  ( genes. We evaluated the usefulness of the set of SNPs identified in the AWM procedure to predict RFI phenotype. Following a single-step animal model  the additive effects of the 829 SNPs yielded by the AWM procedure explained about 61% of the phenotypic variance of RFI (Table ); please note the low error estimated for this parameter. Noteworthy  when all available (31K) SNPs were used for variance component estimation  only 20% of the RFI variance was captured by the additive genetic effects of SNPs. Finally  the pedigree-based estimation yielded a heritability of 0.51 for RFI (Table ). Although their estimated errors are remarkably large  these latter figures allow us to define a baseline to assess the relevance of the proportion of RFI variance explained by the SNPs identified by AWM. The expected accuracy for predicting RFI using the SNP panel selected by AWM was assessed by cross-validation. The correlation between actual and predicted RFI using the effects of the 829 SNPs was 0.65 (Table ). This value is far from that obtained when RFI was predicted by considering all 31K SNP genotypes or when using only pedigree information in a best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) procedure (prediction accuracies of 0.12 and 0.20  respectively). Finally it is worth mentioning that the mean prediction accuracy obtained with the 620 (out of 829) SNPs that were directly associated to RFI was equal to 0.61  a value that was slightly but not significantly lower than that obtained when all 829 SNPs identified by AWM were considered (Table ). Two groups of animals selected for extreme RFI (HFE and LFE  10 individuals for each) were used in the DE analysis of muscle. After quality control  this analysis was performed with the expression levels of 7007 genes that were expressed in the GM muscle. A total of 991 were differentially expressed between the HFE and LFE groups (|FC|<U+2009>><U+2009>1.5; q-value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  of which 892 genes had higher expression in the LFE samples (Fig.  and Additional file : Table S2). The  () gene showed the largest differences in expression between the two groups of extreme FE (FC<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.94; q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.2*10). Regulator genes that are involved in energy metabolism and IMF  such as  were also upregulated in the LFE group  as well as the heat shock protein  gene  which drives the cellular response to heat stress. In contrast  nuclear receptor genes involved in myogenesis such as  () were upregulated in the more efficient group (HFE). In general  we observed that the genes that were upregulated in LFE pigs belonged to pathways related to protein ubiquitination  valine and isoleucine degradation  IL-6 and IL-8 signalling  glucocorticoid receptor  and estrogen receptor signalling. Volcano plot of differential gene expression between the two groups of animals with high and low feed efficiency (HFE and LFE  respectively) Regarding the multivariate analyses that were performed with sPLS-DA  the first principal component (PC1) combined the expression pattern of 200 genes  which explained 24% of the total variance in gene expression and allowed a clear discrimination between the two extreme feed efficiency groups (Fig. ). Supporting this accurate classification  a low balanced error rate ranging from 0.13 (PC1) to 0.08 (PC2) was observed (see Additional file : Figure S3). The list of 200 genes included in the PC1 and their corresponding contribution to PC1 is in Additional file : Table S3. Importantly  17 out of the 18 most discriminating genes (                                and  were also identified in the DE and/or in the rCCA analyses described below.  Representation of the samples belonging to animals with high (green) and low (red) feed efficiency according to the two first components of gene expression levels obtained with the discriminant analysis performed by sPLS-DA.  Clustering of samples obtained with the 200 genes included in the first component The rCCA procedure allowed us to explore the gene expression and phenotype joint (co)variation by using the whole expression dataset (104 individuals). This analysis yielded 350 genes (see Additional file : Table S4) that were included in the first canonical component (CC1)  which  in turn  displayed correlations higher than 0.29 with the FE traits. Among these genes  it is worth highlighting the  gene  which was previously shown to have the highest DE between groups of extreme FE. Other relevant genes identified within CC1 were                                 and  Genes included in the CC1 were also used to establish a correlation network between gene expression and phenotype variation for the four traits that were most associated with FE: RFI  FCR  ADG and ADFI. We found that most of the genes from CC1 were correlated with RFI  and that the muscle expression pattern for these genes allowed the clustering of RFI and FCR (Fig. )  as was the case when co-associated SNPs were used. Clustering of RFI  FCR  ADG and ADFI obtained with the 350 genes identified by rCCA In summary  57 common genes were reported by all three approaches  i.e. DE  sPLS-DA  and rCCA  and this number increased to 221 when genes detected by at least two approaches were considered (Fig. ). Among the genes for which expression was associated with FE indicator traits (RFI and FCR) and with the other production traits  several TF genes were identified as potential regulators of FE  including                       and . Finally  it is worth mentioning the concordance between the results obtained with different approaches in gene expression analyses. This way  a strong and positive correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.64) was found between the loadings of the 57 common genes in the first principal component (PC1) and the first canonical component (CC1) that were obtained with the sPLS-DA and rCCA procedures  respectively (Fig. ). Similarly  genes that were up-regulated in the LFE group showed negative loadings in PC1 and were positively correlated with RFI and FCR  whereas genes with a positive weight on PC1 were up-regulated in the HFE group and negatively correlated with RFI and FCR. Overlapping genes from the three approaches used for gene expression analysis Correlation between the loading factors for the gene expression of the common genes identified with the rCCA and sPLS-DA procedure Our results obtained in the structural and functional genomic analyses were combined to compile a list of candidate genes  which included the 879 genes that were present in the co-association network built by AWM and the 221 genes that were identified in at least two of the three approaches used for gene expression analyses. Functional annotation (Fig.  and Additional file : Table S5) showed that these genes belong to a wide variety of biological processes related to behaviour  immunity  nervous system signalling  and neurotransmitters. Biological pathways that are over-represented in the list of candidate genes for feed efficiency. The x-axis represents the -log(p-value) An eGWAS was performed to identify SNPs that were associated with expression (eSNPs) of candidate genes for FE. We hypothesized that SNPs that regulate the expression of genes that are associated with FE may contribute to improve the molecular-based prediction of RFI. Thus  the final goal was to evaluate the potential increase in predictive ability of RFI that was derived from adding these polymorphisms to the panel of selected SNPs identified by AWM. The eGWAS was performed on 497 genes selected from the aforementioned list of candidate genes by taking into account their mRNA levels in muscle (only 290 of the genes identified by AWM were expressed in GM). The eGWAS showed significant associations at the genome-wide level (q-value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) between 269 SNPs (eSNPs) and the expression of 16 of the 497 genes (Table  and Additional file : Table S6). These 269 eSNPs were distributed across 30 intervals (Table ) that were located on nine chromosomes (SSC for  chromosome  SSC1  SSC2  SSC6  SSC7  SSC8  SSC9  SSC12  SSC14  and SSC17). The largest number of associations was found for the ENSSSCG00000024596 and ENSSSCG00000032907 genes  which included 13.6% (39) and 11.1% (32) of the eSNPs  respectively. In addition  we found that 40.5% of these SNPs (117 eSNPs) regulated gene expression in cis- (i.e. the genome position of eSNP and the target gene map differed by<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 Mb) and the remaining 172 eSNPs were associated with the expression level of genes located either on a distant genome region (distance<U+2009>><U+2009>1 Mb) or on another chromosome. Finally  to verify whether the inclusion of these putative regulatory markers improves RFI prediction  the 269 eSNPs that affect genes associated to FE were added to the former SNP panel of 829 SNPs. The estimated proportion of RFI variance explained by these 1078 SNPs (Table ) did not increase significantly (0.66<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06) compared to the variance explained by the 829 SNPs (0.61<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06) identified by AWM. The results from the subsequent cross-validation analysis showed that the correlation between observed and predicted RFI was slightly lower when the 269 eSNPs were added (dropped from 0.65 to 0.60; Table )  which led us to conclude that there was no improvement in RFI prediction accuracy derived from including these putative regulatory markers in the predictive SNP panel. In this study  we used a systems-based approach that combines SNP co-association and muscle gene expression analyses to identify candidate genes  biological pathways  and potential regulators of FE in pigs. An additional goal of our work was to develop a panel of SNPs that could predict FE phenotypes. The results obtained from both sources of information allowed us to recapitulate the known biological processes that affect FE (i.e. supported by current literature) and to identify novel biological pathways and candidate genes associated with this phenotype. The AWM co-association network that was found to be associated with the nine evaluated phenotypes included 829 SNPs. The list of candidate loci that directly or indirectly affected FE included 879 genes  which are involved in a wide variety of biological processes. Among these  genes that displayed associations with a high proportion of the analysed traits were functionally related to either the nervous system function or development  as well as to the immune system. In agreement with this finding  and supporting their potential pleiotropic roles (since they were associated with several traits)  it is worth mentioning that several of these genes were previously reported to be associated with FE traits (     and ) [    ]  fatness (  ) [  ]  growth (  ) [  ]  or bone mineral density () []. More interestingly  the AWM procedure allowed us to identify a group of TF genes that acted as hubs in the topology of the network  which suggests that they have a cooperative role in mediating a highly inter-connected regulatory cascade that seems pivotal for FE in pigs. This group of TF genes included                and   which have already been reported to be associated with FE in pigs and other livestock species [           ]. The association between the skeletal muscle transcriptome and the traits that were most markedly correlated with FE was also explored  using different approaches. Results from DE between two groups of animals with extreme FE pointed out that less efficient animals have a higher protein turnover and increased energy expenditure compared to their highly efficient counterparts. Discriminant analysis showed that the gene expression profile of 200 genes (included in PC1) explained 24% of the global phenotypic variance in FE-related traits and allowed clear discrimination between animals with high and low RFI. This result allowed us to hypothesize that muscle gene expression data can have a predictive ability for classifying pigs into those having high or low FE  as observed by Piles et al. []  who analysed liver and gut gene expression data using machine-learning algorithms. Based on results from the different transcriptomic analyses  we identified other potential regulators of FE among the genes that were functionally associated with FE. This group of potential regulator genes included                       and   which were previously reported to be related to FE [             ]. Among these genes  it is worth mentioning that  showed the largest differences in expression between animals with divergent FE and was among the top most relevant genes to explain the global phenotypic variance in FE-related traits in the multivariate analysis. Combining the genes that were identified in both the genome and muscle transcriptome analyses resulted in an extensive list with more than 1000 candidate genes that were shown to have either a direct or an indirect effect on FE traits. According to their functional annotation  these genes are involved in a broad set of biological processes  indicating that the molecular mechanisms that control FE are highly interconnected and  in turn  are not only associated with energy metabolism  but also with immunity  behaviour  and the nervous system. Interestingly  the nervous system pathways included the melatonin signalling  glutamate receptor  and gustation pathways  which seem to play an important role in regulation of feed intake and FE [    ]. Other pathways that were enriched in the list of candidate genes have also been previously reported as associated with FE traits [    ]  including aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells  ephrin receptor signalling  relaxin signalling  glycogen degradation  protein kinase A signalling  axonal guidance signalling  semaphorin signalling in neurons  and RhoGDI signalling pathways. One of the main advantages of our methodological approach lies in the joint interpretation of results from both structural and functional genomic studies. Indeed  they corroborate the fundamental role of the nervous system in the regulation of FE and  specifically  of the pituitary gland jointly with the hypothalamus and thyroid axis. First  several genes that are functionally related to the function and development of the nervous system were included in the AWM network associated to FE traits  including       and . Moreover   ()  a TF gene involved in the control of the differentiation and development of the pituitary gland []  was included in the set of potential regulators detected in the co-association network. In addition  in the muscle transcriptome analyses other relevant regulator genes were part of the list of DE genes  such as   which is expressed in pituitary cells. -deficient mice display high metabolic rates and resistance to weight gain when fed a high-fat diet []  two features which may be explained by interference with the thyrotrope axis and/or from effects specific to skeletal muscle []. Other genes associated with regulation of FE through the hypothalamus and thyroid axis were also functionally associated with FE traits in our transcriptomic analyses  such as - () or  (). Another relevant observation from the joint interpretation of the genomic and transcriptomic analyses is the key role of estrogen signalling in the regulation of FE in pigs based on several findings that support this observation. On the one hand  the  () gene was among the AWM top regulators of the co-association network. On the other hand  the  gene  which encodes an estrogen-related receptor  showed a muscle expression pattern that was clearly associated with FE variance. These results are consistent with previous studies at the transcriptomic [  ] and proteomic [] levels that reported a link of the  and  genes with FE in pigs. Estrogens control many cellular processes and modulate growth and maintenance of the skeleton  as well as the cardiovascular and nervous systems [  ]. In addition  increased estrogen receptor (ERa and ERß) signalling suppresses energy intake and increases energy expenditure []. Several studies have shed light on the interaction between the estrogen signalling pathway and the nervous system  and provide elements to understand the regulatory role of estrogens on FE-related traits. At the level of the central nervous system  the hypothalamus is responsible for controlling feed intake (appetite)  energy metabolism  and body weight []  and it has been reported that estrogens display a nucleus-specific action within the hypothalamus to modulate energy balance []. Noteworthy  the nuclear estrogen receptor   which is expressed on the pro-opiomelanocortin neurons  acts by suppressing feed intake and increasing energy expenditure [] when it is activated by the estrogen hormone. Furthermore  cross-talk has been reported between estrogen and the regulation of thyroid hormone-releasing receptor [  ]. Finally  from a more practical perspective  our aim was to evaluate potential applications of our results in animal breeding. Improving FE is one of the most relevant objectives of the pig industry. Several investigations have proven the possibility of applying successful selection processes for FE [  ]  but selecting for FE is challenging because obtaining reliable measures of individual feed intake is difficult and costly. Thus  identifying accurate predictive markers of FE could be of capital relevance for genetic selection for FE. The 829 SNPs identified by the AWM approach explained a significant proportion (61%) of the RFI phenotypic variance  which suggests that they have a promising potential for obtaining a molecular-based prediction of FE records. This panel of SNPs offered the most favourable scenario regarding RFI prediction  based on a genomic prediction accuracy of about 0.65  which was higher than the prediction accuracies for FE reported in previous studies on pigs (0.40–0.53) [  ]  which used larger population sizes and a larger number of SNPs. The estimated proportion of variance explained by our panel of selected SNPs was also greater than the estimated RFI heritability. Previously  a simulation study suggested that selecting causal SNPs in the panel of predictor markers could increase the estimated prediction accuracy above what is expected for a given heritability []. However  we cannot rule out the possibility of an upward bias in the estimated genomic heritability due to the fact that the entire dataset was used to both selecting the SNPs and performing the validation processes. In any case  this bias would not invalidate the relevant increase in the explained variance and prediction accuracy when compared with those obtained with the whole SNP dataset (31K). These results support the relevance of preselecting SNPs to improve the prediction accuracy and that there is little benefit in simply increasing SNP density  in agreement with previous studies [  ]. It is also worth noting that prediction accuracy when the whole SNP panel was used was worse than that achieved with only pedigree information  revealing the uselessness of the whole SNP panel when the training data is of small size. Inclusion of eSNPs in the panel of markers did not improve the prediction accuracy of RFI  in spite of the slight increase in explained RFI variance. Among other reasons  this may be because of the modest size of the sample that was used for our mRNA expression analyses  i.e. 104 pigs  which limited the power of the study. In addition  most of the genes identified by the AWM procedure were related to nervous system functions  which may be poorly expressed in muscle. This agrees with the limited number of genes that were detected using the AWM approach and that were expressed in GM  i.e. 290 out of 879. The study of other relevant tissues  such as the pituitary gland and hypothalamus  may contribute to identifying candidate genes for FE and functional variants that are associated with their activity that could be useful to predict RFI phenotype. In any case  our results allow us to conclude that the molecular markers that were identified using the AWM approach present some predictive ability for FE  thus opening the possibility of applying more accurate selection processes to improve FE in pigs with a shorter generation interval  since predictions of FE could be obtained early in the life of the animal. An integrative approach that combines different sources of information has made it possible to identify candidate genes  pathways  and predictors that may be important in the determinism of FE in pigs. A list of genes that may have direct or indirect effects on FE was elaborated by combining outputs from genomic and muscle transcriptome analyses. These genes are involved in a broad set of biological processes that are mainly related to immunity  behaviour  and nervous system  along with energy metabolism. The set of TF genes that were identified either as regulators of the co-association network or as functionally related to FE traits are potentially responsible of the modulation of a highly inter-connected regulatory cascade that seems pivotal for FE in pigs. The list of these main regulator genes includes                                       and . Joint interpretation of results from both the structural and functional genomic studies indicated that the estrogen signalling pathway  the pituitary gland  the hypothalamus  and the thyroid axis play fundamental roles in the regulation of FE in pigs. The additive effects of a panel of 829 selected SNPs explained 61% of the phenotypic variance of RFI  whereas the prediction accuracy of RFI phenotype based on cross-validation was 0.65. These results offer a promising perspective about the usefulness of molecular approaches to predict FE and open the possibility of more accurate selection processes for improving FE in pigs with a shorter generation interval  since predictions of FE could be obtained early in the life of the animal. Microarray data belonging to selected samples were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository  and are accessible through GEO Series Accession Number GSE115484.

Taken together  our results suggest that whole genome-enabled selection models will be more effective than the conventional pedigree-based method for breeding value estimation or the marker-assisted selection approach for improving the genetic resistance of rainbow trout to IHNV in this population. Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is an economically important disease of salmonid fish that is caused by IHN virus (IHNV)  which is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA rhabdovirus []. IHNV is endemic to the Pacific Northwest in North America [] and has spread throughout continental Europe  China  and Japan [  ]. IHNV is infectious to Pacific salmon and trout  spp.)  as well as to Atlantic salmon () []. Under intensive conditions of aquaculture  IHNV can cause significant mortality and losses at nearly all stages of production [  ]. Currently  there is no proven and cost-effective method for IHNV prevention or treatment. Thus  the development of rainbow trout strains with genetic resistance to IHNV can aid in improving animal welfare and in decreasing the economic losses that are caused by this highly infectious disease to aquaculture production. The additive genetic basis for IHNV resistance is evident from the moderate estimates of heritability for IHNV survival status <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.55) and survival days <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.20) in a steelhead trout () population []. These results suggest that resistant rainbow trout strains can be developed using family-based selective breeding methods. However  to date  selecting and developing strains with improved resistance to IHNV in rainbow trout has not been successful. Phylogenetic and nucleotide sequence analyses of 84 IHNV isolates have revealed an unusually high genetic diversity of IHNV in trout aquaculture  making the process of selecting IHNV-resistant strains difficult []. Nonetheless  selective breeding of a rainbow trout strain for resistance to IHNV has been implemented at the Clear Springs Foods Inc. breeding program since the year 2000 []. Between 2000 and 2016  the selection differential for resistance to IHNV has been on average 10% for the last eight generations and the mortality rate in challenge trials has decreased on average by 3% per generation (Richard Towner  unpublished results). Few quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies have been conducted to identify genetic polymorphisms that are associated with IHNV resistance in rainbow trout. A number of moderate-large-effect QTL associated with IHNV resistance were found on 12 rainbow trout chromosomes using linkage analysis [    ] and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [] methods. However  these previous QTL mapping studies had several limitations. First  they performed only single-marker association (SMA) tests using single-regression or linear mixed models. A key concern with SMA compared to the multiple-marker association test model is that it ignores both the information that is contained in the joint distribution of all markers [  ] and the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring loci [  ]. Consequently  with the multi-marker model  a weak signal may be more apparent when other QTL are accounted for  and a false signal may be weakened by the inclusion of a stronger signal from a real QTL in the model [  ]. Second  most of the reported QTL for IHNV resistance were identified using linkage-based methods and GWAS was performed within individual segregating families  using relatively small samples and consequently with low QTL detection power. Third  the previous studies used low-density genotyping platforms and did not have a reference genome sequence for accurate prediction of the order and physical proximity of the tested markers. There is ambiguity on the best computational algorithm when using multiple-regression based models in GWAS and genomic selection (GS) studies because the genetic architecture of the trait and the population structure can have a major impact on power to detect marker effects and on the accuracy of genomic predictions. Therefore  it is important to compare the results from the best available computational methods when elucidating the genetic architecture of a complex disease trait for the first time in a population. This approach will ensure the effective discovery of QTL underlying the genetic basis of the disease under study  and better control of the type I error rate  which is often high in GWAS. In multiple-regression based GWAS models that fit all single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) with high quality genotypes  the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) method assumes that all SNPs have a non-zero contribution to the variance of the trait of interest  with equal variance for each SNP  and that the distribution of the SNP effects follows a normal distribution [  ]. In addition  the single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) method was developed  which combines the pedigree-based () and genomic relationship () matrices into the  relationship matrix [  ]. Conversely  the Bayesian variable selection model assumes that the genetic variance of the trait is explained by a relatively small number of loci  each with a small-moderate or large effect [      ]. Based on the underlying assumptions of these models  the GBLUP model is expected not to perform as well as the Bayesian variable selection model when the genetic architecture of the trait is not predominantly polygenic. For that reason  the GBLUP method was extended to the weighted ssGBLUP (wssGBLUP) method  which mimics the Bayesian variable selection model by fitting all SNPs in the multiple-regression model but assigning differential weights to the SNPs based on the individual variance of each SNP effect []. More recently  Bayesian variable selection models that use single-step methods have been developed [    ]  including the single-step Bayesian multiple regression (ssBMR) method [  ]. The development of these GWAS methods  along with the development of the rainbow trout 57 K SNP array []  a dense genetic linkage map with<U+2009>~<U+2009>48 K SNPs []  and the release of the chromosome-level rainbow trout reference genome (GenBank Assembly Accession GCA_002163495.1) [] have recently provided the essential tools to identify genomic regions that are associated with IHNV resistance and perform genome-enabled selection for resistance against IHNV in rainbow trout. The main objectives of this study  therefore  were to (1) identify QTL or genomic regions that are associated with IHNV resistance; (2) determine the genetic architecture of resistance to IHNV; (3) compare the QTL detected by the wssGBLUP and ssBMR methods; and (4) evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions for resistance to IHNV using cross-validation analysis. All analyses were conducted using data from a commercial rainbow trout breeding population. This study used rainbow trout fin clips that were collected after controlled exposure to IHNV  as part of a selective breeding program at the Clear Springs Foods Inc. research facility. As farm animals used in a commercial breeding program  these fish are exempted from regulation under the US Animal Welfare Act and were therefore not subject to oversight by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or other such ethics committee. This exemption is defined in US Code title 7  chapter 54  section 2132g. However  experimentation and handling were conducted in accordance with US government principles for the use and care of vertebrate animals used in testing  research  and training  which includes provisions to minimize animal suffering. Specific measures for amelioration of animal suffering during the fish pathogen testing (described in detail in the section “Fish rearing and IHNV challenge”) included minimization of handling  maintenance of optimal water temperature and oxygen saturation  and the fish were fed a standard fish meal diet to satiation daily. Fish near death with severe symptoms of infection during the observation period were removed and euthanized (by immersion in a lethal dose of MS222) before collection of fin tissue to minimize suffering. After the 3-week observation period  surviving fish were euthanized by immersion in a lethal dose of MS222 before sampling and disposal. Samples were collected from disease-naïve parents and their disease challenged offspring fish in brood years 2014 and 2016  respectively  by staff at the Clear Springs Foods Inc. research facility in Buhl  Idaho. Briefly  healthy fish from the previous generation were artificially spawned to produce<U+2009>~<U+2009>5000 fertilized eggs from 100 year-class (YC) 2016 families. Fin tissue samples from each parent fish were collected at the time of spawning. The offspring were grown to<U+2009>~<U+2009>1 g (62 days post-fertilization) and 50 fish per family were selected randomly for disease challenge and were infected with IHNV by immersion into a volume of water equivalent to 10× the total body weight of the fish in g containing 10 000 plaque-forming units of IHNV per mL for 1 h (IHNV isolate 220-90). After exposure  the fish were moved to 19-L tanks by family (50 fish/family/tank)  because young and small fish cannot be labeled individually  and monitored for a 21-day period  with mortality recorded daily. Fin tissue samples were collected from mortalities during the 21-day monitoring period and survivor samples were taken at the end of the challenge. Fin clips from all fish (mortalities and survivors) were individually kept in 95% ethanol until DNA was isolated using already described protocols []. The fish used in the GWAS included 100 pedigreed full-sib (FS) families from year-class (YC) 2016 of the commercial breeding company Clear Springs Foods  Inc. (CSF). These 100 FS families included 41 paternal half-sib (HS) families and four maternal HS families and were generated using 78 sires and 98 dams. Fifty-nine families were generated by mating each of 59 sires with a single dam. Among the families that were generated by mating a sire with multiple dams: 17 sires were mated with two dams  one sire was mated with three dams  and another sire was mated with four dams. These YC 2016 families represented a commercial nucleus breeding population that was undergoing intensive selection for growth and IHNV resistance for the past eight generations  since 2000. The fish were evaluated for IHNV survival in the laboratory challenge  with one tank per family with an initial stocking of 50 fish per tank. The 100 families were evaluated by groups of 7 to 10 families at 11 challenge dates. After the IHNV challenge  the dataset included IHNV resistance phenotype records on =<U+2009>4987 fish. The associated pedigree file included 6308 records. The discrete IHNV resistance phenotype survival days (DAYS)  i.e. the number of days post-challenge until the fish succumbed to the disease  was recorded for all mortalities  while survivors were assigned a value of 21. Each fish also had a binary survival status (STATUS) record. The resistance phenotype STATUS had two categories: 1 for fish that died during the 21 days post challenge evaluation period; and 2 for fish that survived for the duration of the challenge. The DAYS and STATUS records were analyzed separately using the univariate GWAS models described below. The fish sampled from the CSF population were genotyped using the Rainbow Trout Affymetrix 57K SNP array (Chip) following previously described procedures [] by a commercial service provider (AKESOgen  Norcross  GA) following the Axiom genotyping procedures described by the array manufacturer (Affymetrix). We randomly sampled five survivor offspring and five early dying offspring per family (in total N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000) for SNP genotyping. We also genotyped all the sires from which fin clips were available (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>53). The dams were not sampled. The quality control (QC) bioinformatics pipeline applied to the chip-SNP genotype data was previously described []. Briefly  the QC pipeline filtered out the SNPs that showed a significant distortion from the expected Mendelian segregation in each FS family (Bonferroni adjusted to <<U+2009>0.05) and removed offspring fish that did not have matching genotypes with the parents given in the pedigree (i.e. that did not pass the pedigree check). After this initial genotype data QC  42 045 SNPs were included in the raw chip genotype dataset. Before conducting GWAS analyses  the raw marker genotype dataset was further QC filtered using the algorithms that are implemented in the software BLUPF90 []. The QC retained SNPs with a genotype calling rate higher than 0.90  minor allele frequency higher than 0.05  and with departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium lower than 0.15  based on the difference between expected and observed frequency of heterozygotes. Parent-progeny pairs were tested for discrepant homozygous SNPs  and SNPs with a conflict rate higher than 1% were discarded from further analysis. Next  we determined the physical map position (GenBank Assembly Accession GCA_002163495.1) [] of each of the QC filtered SNPs and those that did not have a physical map location were removed. After this data QC  we were left with data on 35 397 genotyped SNPs and 1044 genotyped fish (992 offspring plus 52 sires) for GWAS (Table ). The phenotypes of DAYS and STATUS (<U+2009>=<U+2009>4987) were fit to an animal linear and a threshold model  respectively  to estimate genetic variance parameters for IHNV resistance phenotypes. The variance components analysis was performed using pedigree-based BLUP (PBLUP) and PBLUP with genomic data (ssGBLUP) under a Bayesian framework  using computer applications from the BLUPF90 family of programs []. The discrete data survival DAYS was analyzed using an animal linear model with the software GIBBS2F90; and the binary data survival STATUS was analyzed using an animal threshold model with the software THRGIBBS1F90. The Gibbs sampling scheme included one million iterations  of which the first 200 000 iterations were discarded; from the remaining 800 000 iterations one sample was saved from every 100 iterations  such that results from 8000 samples were used in the analysis. Proper mixing and convergence of the MCMC chains were assessed with the R package CODA []. Heritability for DAYS or STATUS was estimated as: ; where  is the estimated narrow-sense heritability;  is the estimated additive genetic variance;  is the estimated variance due to the nested effect of families within the challenge date; and  is the estimated residual error variance. The heritability for the binary survival STATUS estimated on the underlying scale of liability using a threshold model was transformed to the observed scale of disease survival STATUS using procedures already described []. We performed GWAS with the wssGBLUP method using 1-Mb sliding SNP windows [  ]. In the first step  effects were calculated for individual SNPs  as shown below. Afterwards  the effects of all SNPs within a 1-Mb distance were summed and compiled for each sliding window. Briefly  the 1-Mb window slides by one SNP at a time from the first SNP until the last SNP on each chromosome and the results for SNPs that are included in the window are jointly summarized; thus  the estimates for SNP effects is a moving average of  adjacent SNPs included in the 1-Mb window []. The choice of a 1-Mb window size was based on our recent estimate of strong LD (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25) spanning on average over 1 Mb in the rainbow trout genome []. The GWAS with wssGBLUP uses all available information on sampled fish  including pedigree  genotype  and phenotype records  including those offspring fish without genotype data  <U+2009>=<U+2009>3995 [  ]. The CSF sample used in GWAS included <U+2009>=<U+2009>4987 offspring fish from 100 YC 2016 families that had IHNV resistance records (Table ). From these phenotyped offspring fish  a subset of 992 offspring fish and 52 sires had genotype data for 35 397 effective SNPs. In GWAS with wssGBLUP  the weights for each SNP are 1 for the first iteration  which means that all SNPs have the same weight (i.e.  single-step GBLUP). For the next iterations (2nd  3rd  etc.)  the weights are SNP-specific variances that are calculated using the estimate of the SNP allele-substitution effect from the preceding iteration and the corresponding SNP allele frequencies []. Estimates of SNP effects were calculated using a weighted relationship matrix  using the following equation:   where  is the vector of the estimated SNP effects;  is a diagonal matrix of weights for variances of SNP effects;  is a matrix relating genotypes of each SNP to each individual; and  is the estimate of the additive genetic effect for genotyped animals. The individual variance of SNP effects  which corresponds to the diagonal elements of   was estimated as []:   where:  is the square of the effect at SNP   and  is the observed allele frequency for the second allele of SNP . In this study  we used results from the second iteration of wssGBLUP  because generally they provide the highest accuracy genomic predictions [] and marker effects [    ]. We fitted mixed linear and threshold models for DAYS and STATUS  respectively  using the following animal model:   where  is a vector of 1 s   is the overall mean of phenotypic records   is a vector of random individual animal effects   is a vector of random common environment effects   is a vector of residual effects  and  and  are incidence matrices relating records to random animal and common environment effects in  and   respectively. The variances of    and  are: where    and  are additive genetic  common environment and residual variances  respectively  and  is a matrix that combines pedigree () and genomic () relationship matrices  as in Aguilar et al. []  and its inverse as defined elsewhere [  ]. The full-sib fish progeny from each family were allocated to one tank for IHNV challenge evaluation  so the tank and family effects were confounded. The 100 tested families were evaluated in 11 challenge dates (date)  with 7 to 10 families per date. This nested random family/date effect was used to account for the common environment effect. The GWAS for DAYS and STATUS was also performed using Bayesian methods implemented in the BLUPF90 family of programs []. The GWAS for DAYS was performed with the software GIBBS2F90  and the GWAS for STATUS was performed with the software THRGIBBS1F90. The MCMC Gibbs sampling scheme and the assessment of correct mixing and convergence of the MCMC iterations were similar to those described in the section of estimation of genetic parameters. We performed GWAS for IHNV survival DAYS with a single-step Bayesian multiple regression (ssBMR) model using 1-Mb non-overlapping SNP windows [  ]. The ssBMR model uses the pedigree information and all animals that had phenotype and genotype records  as in the wssGBLUP method. In ssBMR  the genotypes for non-genotyped animals are imputed explicitly given the pedigree information  and corresponding imputation residuals are fitted in the model. Thus  the GWAS analysis with ssBMR model was performed using the same phenotype and genotype data records used for wssGBLUP (Table ). The 1-Mb window’s posterior probability of association (WPPA) with the analyzed phenotype was used to estimate the window’s proportion of false positive as . In GWAS for DAYS  we fitted this Bayesian linear mixed model: ; where  is an  matrix of observed or imputed genotype covariates for  total number of SNPs across the genome for both genotyped and non-genotyped  individuals;  is a vector of random regression coefficients of  additive SNP effects; and  is a vector of random polygenic effects. The GWAS for DAYS was performed with ssBMR using the Bayesian variable selection BayesB method (BayesB) [] implemented in the software JWAS []. The BayesB method fits a mixture model to estimate marker effects  which assumes that there are two types of SNPs: a fraction of SNPs with non-zero effects  that are drawn from distributions with a marker-specific variance   and another known fraction of SNPs  that a priori have zero effect on the quantitative trait []. In our study  the mixture parameter  was assumed to be known and defined to meet the condition ; where  is the number of fish with genotype records   is the effective number of SNPs  and  is the number of markers sampled as having a non-zero effect that are fitted simultaneously in the Bayesian multiple regression model []. In this study  we tested three values for  that met the condition  0.990  0.995  and 0.999. Then  we used <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.999 in the final GWAS because this  value yielded a GWAS that detected the largest number of genomic windows associated with IHNV resistance and with the largest additive genetic variance. Method BayesB uses MCMC Gibbs sampling in the GWAS analysis []. The Gibbs sampling scheme and diagnosis methods to assess the proper mixing and convergence of the MCMC iterations were like those used in GWAS with wssGBLUP. We did not perform GWAS using sliding SNP windows under a Bayesian framework analysis and GWAS with ssBMR for the binary STATUS because these methods have not been implemented in the software JWAS. The results from the analyses conducted with wssGBLUP and ssBMR were used to identify 1-Mb SNP windows that are associated with IHNV resistance. A two-step approach was used to identify QTL associated with IHNV resistance. First  the 1-Mb windows that explained additive genetic variance (EGV) higher than 2% of the total were defined as associated with IHNV resistance  and 1-Mb windows with 1%  EGV  2% were defined as windows with suggestive association. Second  to determine if neighboring or overlapping windows on the same chromosome belonged to the same QTL region  we used the following criteria: all 1-Mb windows associated with IHNV resistance that were located within a region smaller than 20 Mb and that were less than 10 Mb apart from another associated 1-Mb window were grouped into a single QTL region. We applied these fairly conservative criteria for QTL identification based on our previous experience with QTL mapping [  ] and GWAS [] in rainbow trout and with the aim of focusing on the QTL with the strongest signal and minimizing the type I error rate in this study. The accuracy and bias of breeding value predictions for DAYS and STATUS were estimated using five-fold cross-validation (CV) analysis. Briefly  the fish with phenotype and genotype records (<U+2009>=<U+2009>992 offspring fish) were randomly assigned to five groups (validation sets) of about 198 fish (20% of the complete dataset). The breeding value predictions for fish of the validation sets were determined one validation set at a time by using the remaining 80% of the complete dataset as the training set. In addition  the fish that had only phenotype and pedigree records (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3995) were included in the training set. The breeding values for fish in each validation set were estimated using the PBLUP  ssGBLUP  and wssGBLUP methods. The CV analyses were performed using the BLUPF90 family of programs [] and computer scripts that were written to automate the CV analysis (available from the authors). The DAYS and STATUS records were analyzed using the models and methods described in the section of GWAS with wssGBLUP. The Gibbs sampling scheme and diagnosis of proper mixing and convergence of the MCMC iterations were like those described in the GWAS section. We did not assess the accuracy or bias of breeding value predictions with the ssBMR method because the threshold model routine to analyze binary trait STATUS has not been implemented in the software JWAS. The accuracy of breeding value predictions was used to assess the performance of each prediction method for the validation set and was estimated as: ; where  is the correlation of the breeding value predictions (EBV or GEBV) of animals in the validation data based on a given model and training data with the observed phenotypes of those animals  and  is the square root of the narrow-sense heritability estimated with the ssGBLUP method [  ]. The bias of the breeding value predictions from each model was estimated as the regression coefficient of the resistance phenotype (DAYS or STATUS) on the breeding value predictions (EBV or GEBV) for each validation set. Before calculating the regression coefficients  the predicted EBV and GEBV for the binary trait STATUS  which were estimated on the underlying scale of liability using the threshold model  were transformed to the observed scale using procedures that were described elsewhere []. Finally  the accuracy and bias reported are the averages across the five-fold CV sets  with 10 replications of the CV analysis to minimize the stochastic variation in the CV analysis. Fish mortality rate in the IHNV challenge was equal to 0.36 in the YC 2016 families of this breeding population. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability were moderately high  with a range of values from 0.23 to 0.33 and from 0.25 to 0.28 for DAYS and STATUS  respectively (Table ). Overall  estimates of heritability using genomic data (ssGBLUP; 0.23 and 0.25) were lower than those estimated with the pedigree-based model (PBLUP; 0.28 and 0.33). However  the ssGBLUP estimates had lower standard errors (SE) than the PBLUP estimates. Fifty-one 1-Mb windows that explained more than 1% EGV were detected (see Additional file : Table S1). These windows were used to define 21 QTL regions  of which 10 were categorized as QTL associated with IHNV resistance (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>2%) (QTL2.2  4.1  4.2  6.1  16.1  17.1  21.1  25.1  26.1 and 28.1) and 11 as QTL with suggestive association (1%<U+2009>=<U+2009>EGV<U+2009><<U+2009>2%) (QTL 1.1  2.1  3.1  5.1  5.2  8.1  8.2  14.1  15.1  25.2 and 29.1). The IHNV resistance phenotypes of survival days and status are highly correlated. Hence  as expected  the QTL that were detected for STATUS were also detected for DAYS (see Additional file : Table S1). Manhattan plots from GWAS using wssGBLUP for DAYS (Fig. b) and STATUS (see Additional file : Figure S1b) show that the same QTL regions were detected for both traits (windows with EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>2%). Thus  for the sake of clarity  in the remainder of this paper  we present results from GWAS for survival days and treat them as good proxies for QTL for the IHNV resistance trait. Manhattan plot showing the association of 1-Mb sliding-windows with IHNV survival DAYS.  GWAS using single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP).  GWAS using weighted single-step GBLUP (wssGBLUP) Fifteen 1-Mb windows associated with IHNV resistance (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>2%) were detected using either the wssGBLUP or the ssBMR GWAS methods (Table ). Of these windows  seven were detected with wssGBLUP and eight were detected with ssBMR. These 15 SNP windows cover 10 QTL regions associated with IHNV resistance that jointly explained up to 42% of the additive genetic variance when accounting only for the largest effect SNP window for each QTL region. The QTL 4.2 (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.8%  Fig. b)  21.1 (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.2%  Fig. b) and 25.1 (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.7%  Fig. ) had explained the highest proportions of genetic variance for IHNV resistance. Manhattan plot showing the association of non-overlapping 1-Mb windows with IHNV survival DAYS based on single-step Bayesian multiple regression (ssBMR) with BayesB Three QTL associated with IHNV resistance (4.2  17.1  and 25.1) were detected by both GWAS methods (Table  and Fig. ). Interestingly  the QTL 17.1 and 25.1 had the lowest PFP  i.e. 0.14 and 0.09  respectively  when detected with ssBMR; thus  they were the most significant QTL detected with the ssBMR method. Three QTL (2.2  4.1 and 21.1) were detected only with wssGBLUP (Fig. )  and four QTL (6.1  16.1  26.1 and 28.1) were detected only with ssBMR. Co-localized 1-Mb QTL windows associated with IHNV survival DAYS (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>2%) detected with weighted single-step GBLUP (wssGBLUP) and single-step Bayesian multiple regression (ssBMR) with BayesB The physical map coordinates of the identified QTL regions for IHNV resistance (Table ) were queried against the rainbow trout reference genome sequence annotation (RefSeq Accession GCF_002163495.1) []. In total  774 predicted coding genes were identified within the QTL regions (see Additional file : Table S2). The 1-Mb windows that were detected with EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>1% for IHNV resistance using wssGBLUP and ssBMR are compared in Table S3 (see Additional file : Table S3). More windows were detected with ssBMR (21) than with wssGBLUP (17)  which also translated to more QTL regions detected with ssBMR (16) than with wssGBLUP (12). Of those QTL regions  seven were detected by both GWAS methods  five were detected only by wssGBLUP and nine were detected only by ssBMR. Overall  across the IHNV resistance phenotypes  the accuracy of breeding value predictions was higher for the genomic prediction models ssGBLUP (0.30–0.34) and wssGBLUP (0.33–0.39) than for the pedigree-based PBLUP model (0.13–0.24) (Table ). Across prediction methods  the accuracies of predicted breeding values for survival STATUS (0.24–0.39) were higher than those for survival DAYS (0.13–0.33). The relative increase in accuracy of genomic predictions methods over the pedigree-based PBLUP is shown in Fig. . The accuracy of predictions with the wssGBLUP and ssGBLUP models substantially outperformed the pedigree-based PBLUP model  by 63 to 154% and 42 to 131%  respectively. Relative increase in accuracy of genomic prediction for IHNV resistance (DAYS and STATUS) over pedigree-based BLUP (PBLUP). Genomic predictions were performed with single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) and weighted single-step GBLUP (wssGBLUP) The bias of breeding value predictions was lower (i.e. closer to 1.0) for DAYS (0.27–0.50) than for STATUS (0.11–0.14) (Table ). For survival DAYS  the genomic prediction methods ssGBLUP and wssGBLUP (0.37–0.50) had lower bias than pedigree-based PBLUP (0.27). For DAYS  ssGBLUP (0.50) had lower predictions bias than wssGBLUP (0.37). The predictions for STATUS had the highest bias and may not be valid because of the use of binary phenotype records when computing the regression coefficient in the CV analysis. In this genome-wide association study  we detected 10 QTL regions that were associated with IHNV resistance and that together explained up to 42% of the additive genetic variance for IHNV resistance in a commercial rainbow trout breeding population. Only two of these QTL (17.1 and 25.1) were reported in previous studies (see Additional file : Table S4) [    ] and the other eight QTL are novel (Table ). We also determined that resistance against IHNV in rainbow trout is controlled by the oligogenic inheritance of a few loci with moderate effects (EGV<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.0–8.8%) and a large-unknown number of loci each with small effects. In addition  for the first time for this important disease resistance trait  we show that  based on empirical data  genomic prediction is expected to substantially outperform the classical pedigree-based predictions (PBLUP) in terms of accuracy. These results highlight the potential utility of genome-enabled selection for genetic improvement of resistance against IHNV in this commercial rainbow trout breeding population. Estimates of heritability for IHNV resistance in our study were moderately (0.23–0.33) and somewhat lower than those reported previously using pedigree-based model in a different rainbow trout population []. Still  our estimates underline the potential for genetic improvement for IHNV resistance in this commercial rainbow trout population through selective breeding. Our heritability estimates based on genomic data (ssGBLUP) were consistently lower than those based on PBLUP. However  estimates from ssGBLUP had much lower standard errors than those estimated with PBLUP. Interestingly  our estimate of heritability for survival STATUS using genomic data (0.25) was also lower than the heritability estimate for IHNV mortality using a pedigree-based model by Brieuc et al. [] (0.38). With the pedigree-based PBLUP model  there is a confounding between the phenotype and the Mendelian sampling term  and we expect this confounding to be less of a problem when using genomic data with ssGBLUP  since the covariances between Mendelian sampling terms of relatives can be quantified based on the proportion of the genome that they share [  ]. In this study  we did not detect large-effect QTL for IHNV resistance  which suggests that marker-assisted selection is not likely to be an effective strategy for improving the genetic resistance of rainbow trout against IHNV in this specific commercial population. However  further fine-mapping of the detected IHNV-QTL regions and subsequent identification of putative candidate genes or causative mutations would be valuable for advancing the understanding of the mechanisms of genetic resistance to IHNV in rainbow trout and the underlying biology of host–pathogen interactions. This can be achieved by genotyping a large number of SNPs at positions within and near the major QTL regions  and by re-sequencing highly characterized IHNV resistant and susceptible fish  as was effectively done in the search for the IPNV resistance gene in Atlantic salmon []. We generated an initial preliminary list of positional candidate genes for the IHNV-QTL regions by cross-examining the rainbow trout reference genome sequence annotation (RefSeq Accession GCF_002163495.1) []. Overall  we identified 774 protein-encoding features located within the QTL identified for IHNV resistance (see Additional file : Table S2)  which are now available for future analyses and research efforts that are beyond the scope of this study. Previous QTL mapping studies have reported 36 QTL for IHNV resistance in rainbow and steelhead trout backcross populations (see Additional file : Table S4) [     ] but most of those QTL were not detected in our study. Only two out of the 10 QTL identified in our study were previously reported  i.e. QTL17.1 [  ] and 25.1 []  which interestingly had the lowest PFP in our study. Thus  we report eight novel unpublished QTL for IHNV resistance in rainbow trout. This poor overlap of the QTL detected in our study with those from previous reports is caused  in part  by differences in the genetic background and in population or sampling structures between the studies. It is worth noting that Campbell et al. [] detected 19 RAD SNPs associated with IHNV resistance in this same CSF commercial breeding population  although using data from two generations previous to the current data (see Additional file : Table S4). Surprisingly  none of their reported QTL overlap or were close to the 10 QTL regions detected here. These conflicting results in QTL mapping can be explained by several reasons including: (1) this population has not been closed and additional families were introduced to the breeding population in the past two generations; (2) QTL effects can be population- and/or family-specific  with unique extent/phase of linkage and extent of LD between QTL and marker alleles; and (3) the previously detected QTL may represent false positive results due to limitations and weaknesses on experimental design and methods used for data analyses. The use of correct statistical models and computer algorithms is crucial for uncovering the underlying genetic basis of resistance to diseases with multifactorial inheritance using GWAS. In this study  we scanned the genome for loci that were associated with IHNV resistance using two single-step multiple regression based GWAS methods that estimate the effect of all markers simultaneously  thus accounting for LD between neighboring loci [    ]. A unique feature of these multiple regression single-step GWAS methods is that  in the analysis  they employ all available pedigreed animals with genotype and/or phenotype records. Thus  they are expected to have higher power of QTL detection than GWAS methods that do not use a single-step approach and test for association using one-marker at a time without accounting for LD between linked loci and without using phenotypes on non-genotyped relatives. Of the 10 QTL regions identified for IHNV resistance  only three were detected by both GWAS methods  and seven were detected by only one method  which supports the utility of using different GWAS algorithms to uncover the QTL associated with a complex disease resistance trait. We also evaluated GWAS models that assume a purely polygenic inheritance for IHNV resistance and a normal distribution of the marker effects and found that ssGBLUP (Fig. a) and RR-BLUP [    ] did not result in enough power to detect QTL for IHNV resistance (results not shown). These results confirmed the superiority of GWAS methods such as ssBMR and wssGBLUP  which assume that the genetic variance of a trait is explained by a reduced number of QTL with moderate-to-large effects  instead of purely polygenic inheritance [    ]. Furthermore  these results support the importance of testing several GWAS methods when attempting  for the first time  to elucidate the underlying genetic basis of resistance to complex diseases such as IHNV in rainbow trout. The marginal difference in power of QTL detection between the two single-step based GWAS methods is due to differences in their assumptions. The Bayesian variable selection model BayesB that was performed with ssBMR was shown to be robust to population structure and to cryptic family relationships in GWAS and GS with admixed populations []  and also more powerful than standard mixed linear GBLUP-based models when the trait under study is controlled by few genes/loci with a moderate to large effect and many loci with a small effect  i.e. for an oligogenic inheritance trait [    ]. We also found that ssBMR detected a larger number of QTL (7) associated with DAYS (Fig. ) than the standard BayesB method (4) [  ] (see Additional file : Figure S2)  which uses only individuals that have both phenotype and genotype records (<U+2009>=<U+2009>992)  because ssBMR used all the animals (<U+2009>=<U+2009>4987) available in this study [  ]  including animals that had only phenotype records (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3995). Across the evaluated methods  the accuracy of breeding value predictions for STATUS were higher than those for DAYS (Table ). However  the predictions for DAYS were less biased than those for STATUS. The computed bias of predictions for STATUS when using the CV analysis is incorrect and  consequently  was the most biased due to extreme-phenotype problems in which all binary observations within class variables are identical  i.e. each animal has one binary survival phenotype record of either 0 or 1 []. The incorrect bias estimation for breeding value predictions when using binary data in CV analysis is known and it is an area of active research [  ]  which is outside the scope of this study. However  this problem can be circumvented by assessing the accuracy and bias of breeding value predictions using progeny performance data (i.e. offspring survival rate per evaluated family)  as we have shown elsewhere [  ]. We are in the process of generating those progeny performance records for a future report. The accuracy of pedigree-based EBV predictions for STATUS was 0.24 when performing CV analysis using IHNV records from the 2016 CSF families (Table ). Remarkably  this accuracy was quite close to the average historical accuracy of EBV predictions for IHNV resistance (0.25) (see Additional file : Table S5). This historical accuracy of EBV predictions was estimated by using progeny performance data from IHNV evaluations performed over five generations in the CSF breeding population  as the correlation of mid-parent EBV with the offspring survival rate from each evaluated family in each generation. Overall  accuracies of genomic predictions for DAYS and STATUS with wssGBLUP (0.33–0.39) and ssGBLUP (0.30–0.34) were higher than those from the pedigree-based PBLUP model used with both CV analysis (0.13–0.24) and historical progeny performance data (0.25). Therefore  these results show the high potential for effective genetic improvement of IHNV genetic resistance using genome-enabled selective breeding in this commercial rainbow trout population. Our comprehensive genome-wide scan for QTL for IHNV resistance revealed that genetic resistance to IHNV in this commercial rainbow trout breeding population is controlled by the oligogenic inheritance of up to 10 QTL with moderate effects and many loci with small effects. Taken together  our results suggest that whole-genome-enabled breeding value prediction models will be more effective than the conventional pedigree-based prediction method or the marker-assisted selection approach for improving genetic resistance of rainbow trout against IHNV in this economically important breeding population.

Muscle glycogen level at slaughter is closely associated with pHu and meat technological quality  but its genetic basis remains elusive. The aim of this study was to identify genes and/or causative mutations associated with muscle glycogen level and other meat quality traits by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and additional analyses in a population of 610 DLY pigs.ResultsOur initial GWAS identified a genome-wide significant (=<U+2009>2.54e-11) quantitative trait locus (QTL) on SSC15 (SSC for  chromosome) for the level of residual glycogen and glucose (RG) in the longissimus muscle at 45 min post-mortem. Then  we demonstrated that a low-frequency (minor allele frequency<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.014) R200Q missense mutation in the  () gene caused this major QTL effect on RG. Moreover  we showed that the 200Q () allele was introgressed from the Hampshire breed into more than one of the parental breeds of the DLY pigs. After conditioning on R200Q  re-association analysis revealed three additional QTL for RG on SSC3 and 4  and on an unmapped scaffold (AEMK02000452.1). The SSC3 QTL was most likely caused by a splice mutation (g.8283C>A) in the  gene that we had previously identified. Based on functional annotation  the genes  on SSC4 and  on the scaffold represent promising candidate genes for the other two QTL. There were significant interaction effects of the GWAS tag SNPs at those two loci with  R200Q on RG. In addition  a number of common variants with potentially smaller effects on RG (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) were uncovered by a second conditional GWAS after adjusting for the two causal SNPs  R200Q and g.8283C>A.ConclusionsWe found that the  allele segregates in the parental lines of our DLY population and strongly influences its meat quality.

We found that the  allele segregates in the parental lines of our DLY population and strongly influences its meat quality. Our findings also indicate that the genetic basis of RG in DLY can be mainly attributed to two major genes ( and )  along with many minor genes. Pork quality is an economically important trait in the pig industry and its improvement has been one of the major goals in modern pig breeding [   ]. However  it is difficult to improve pork quality by traditional breeding methods due to its complexity and low heritability []  and because it can be only observed after slaughter. Therefore  understanding the genetic mechanisms that underlie traits related to meat quality in pigs is very important. Following the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and larger-scale consortia meta-analyses of GWAS  about 9900 variants associated with pork quality traits have been identified ()  which provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of these traits. However  these GWAS are typically designed to provide a survey of common variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.05 and  thus  examine only a portion of the genomic landscape of complex traits. Until now  low-frequency (0.01<U+2009>=<U+2009>MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and rare (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) variations that affect pork quality have been more challenging to access. In addition  although GWAS can be used to discover significant association signals for a trait  uncovering the specific genetic variants and pathways that cause these associations is still a major challenge in the post-GWAS era. To date  only a limited number of studies have investigated the molecular mechanism of GWAS hits with fine-mapping []. For instance  nearly 8 years and the efforts of many researchers were necessary to unravel the molecular mechanism of the first GWAS-identified obesity gene   (-)  via integrative analyses of epigenomic data  allelic activity  motif conservation  gene regulator expression and gene co-expression patterns  and target genome editing verification []. Not surprisingly  to date  only a handful of causative genes for meat quality traits have been identified. A recent systems genetic analysis uncovered the role of a splice mutation in the  gene in the regulation of muscle glycogen level  pH  and drip loss in Duroc crosses []. After slaughter  muscle glycogen in pigs is converted into lactate by glycolysis and this accumulation of lactate results in a decline of pH during the conversion of muscle to meat. Monin and Sellier [] suggested that a higher initial muscle glycogen level confers an increased capacity for postmortem glycolysis  or high “glycolytic potential” (GP) that  in turn  enhances the pH decline. Because the rate and extent of postmortem pH decline influence pork quality substantially  measuring GP or postmortem glucose concentrations could be very useful to predict pork quality traits []. Furthermore  the level of glycogen is more affected by genetic than by environmental factors  and thus it is more accurate than the measurement of pH. To our knowledge   was the first identified causative gene that is involved in muscle glycogen level and meat quality traits []. This gene encodes the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) <U+03B3>3 subunit. AMPK is an important energy sensor protein kinase that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. In Hampshire pigs  several studies have shown that the  R200Q (p.Arg225Gln) missense mutation is responsible for excess glycogen and low ultimate pH in skeletal muscle  which results in “acid meat”  which has lower water holding capacity and poor processing yield [  ]. Three other missense mutations in the  gene  T30N (p.Thr30Asn)  G52S (p.Gly52Ser)  and I199V (p.Ile199Val)  were also suggested to affect meat quality traits in a wider range of commercial pig breeds  e.g. Large White  Duroc  and Landrace []. The I199V and neighbouring R200Q mutations are located in a highly conserved region of the cystathionine ß-synthase domain  but show opposite effects on meat quality []. Several GWAS have been performed on meat quality traits  such as pH and colour  but there have been relatively few studies on the genetic basis of muscle glycogen and lactate. Since the concentrations of these metabolites can be regarded as intermediate phenotypes that affect meat quality  identifying overlapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for muscle glycogen  pH  and other meat quality traits will facilitate the discovery of candidate genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In China  more than 70% of the pork produced originates from three-way crossbred Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>(Large White<U+2009>×<U+2009>Yorkshire) (DLY) pigs  but the high incidence rate of PSE (pale  soft and exudative)  DFD (dark  firm and dry)  and acid meat incurs consumer dissatisfaction and significant economic loss. Thus  it is important to investigate the genetic architecture of meat quality traits in DLY pigs. Previously  we reported the detection of genetic variants that are significantly associated with multiple meat quality traits but not for GP-related compounds traits []. Thus  our objective here was to identify genetic variants and putative causative genes that are associated with muscle glycogen level. This study involved two cohorts of DLY commercial pigs: (1) a discovery cohort that consisted of 306 males and 304 females raised on a farm of the Jiangxi Guohong Group Co. Ltd in Jiujiang city (Jiangxi Province)  where the DLY piglets were produced by crossing<U+2009>~<U+2009>20 adult Duroc boars with<U+2009>~<U+2009>800 L<U+2009>×<U+2009>Y sows; and (2) a replication cohort that comprised 150 DLY pigs  which came from a farm of the Guangdong Wen’s Food Group Co. Ltd in Guangzhou city (Guangdong Province). All experimental individuals were raised under a standardized environment and slaughtered at local commercial abattoirs when they reached a live weight of<U+2009>~<U+2009>110 kg. To constitute these cohorts  30 to 40 individuals were randomly sampled from groups of 150 or more finishing pigs that were sent for slaughter at the same time. Thus  the cohorts were completely unrelated and the kinship between animals in each cohort was very low. In addition  179 Duroc  192 Landrace  and 190 Yorkshire pigs from various farms in Yongchun country (Fujian Province) and Qingyuan city (Guangdong Province) were also included in the study. These individuals were genotyped for the  R200Q locus and had no direct relationship with the above-mentioned DLY cohorts. The levels of residual glycogen and glucose (RG) and of lactate in the longissimus muscle (LM) were determined for the two DLY cohorts. The standard equation to calculate the glycolytic potential (GP) of muscle is GP (µmol/g of wet muscle)<U+2009>=<U+2009>2<U+2009>×<U+2009>(glycogen<U+2009>+<U+2009>glucose<U+2009>+<U+2009>glucose-6-phosphate)<U+2009>+<U+2009>lactate. However  based on our observations that the level of glucose-6-phosphate is much lower than that of other components in the post-mortem muscle  we ignored it and used the reduced equation to: GP<U+2009>=<U+2009>2<U+2009>×<U+2009>RG<U+2009>+<U+2009>lactate. After slaughter  LM samples were collected between the tenth rib and the first lumbar vertebra from the left side of each carcass within 45 min post-mortem. We estimated the levels of RG and lactate in the LM with the muscle glycogen assay (Item No: A043) and the lactic acid assay (A019-2) kits  respectively  which were produced by the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute. In addition  pH  drip loss  and colour were measured on LM at 36 h post-mortem in the discovery cohort  as described previously []. Pig genomic DNA was isolated from ear tissue by standard phenol/chloroform extraction. To fulfil the requirements for genotyping  all extracted DNA samples were standardized to a final concentration of 50 ng/µl and quality controlled. In total  610 animals from the Guohong DLY cohort were genotyped for 61 565 SNPs using the IlluminaPorcineSNP60K Beadchip according to the standard manufacturer’s protocol. Quality control procedures were performed by PLINK v1.07 []. Briefly  SNPs with a call rate lower than 0.99  a MAF lower than 0.01  and SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P<U+2009><<U+2009>10) were removed  and individuals for which the call rate was lower than 0.90 and the Mendelian inheritance error rate was higher than 0.05 were also removed from the dataset. After quality control  39 369 SNPs and all individuals remained for subsequent statistical analyses. The chromosomal positions of SNPs were based on the Sscrofa11.1 pig genome assembly. Previously  we used this DLY cohort to detect QTL for many meat quality traits except GP-related traits by performing a GWAS that was based on the Sscrofa10.2 reference genome []. Recently  the porcine reference genome was updated to the Sscrofa11.1 version with better assembly quality  which improved the sequence alignment for the tested SNPs. Therefore  we also re-analyzed the other meat quality traits with the updated data for GWAS  to help identify potential common genetic loci between GP-related traits and other meat quality traits. Associations between each SNP and the studied phenotypic traits were obtained by using a general linear mixed model []. The genetic variability and heritability of the traits were estimated in the discovery DLY cohort. Heritability of a trait was estimated by using the  function of GenABEL v1.7 []. The model used for the GWAS included a random polygenic effect  with a variance–covariance matrix that was proportional to genome-wide identity-by-state: where  is the vector of phenotypes   is the overall mean   is the vector of fixed effects  including sex and slaughter batch (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>18) effects   is the vector of carcass weight  which was considered as a covariate   is the SNP substitution effect   is the vector of polygenic effects with   where  is the genomic relationship matrix  which was calculated based on the identity-by-state of the SNP on autosomes []  and  is the polygenetic additive variance;  is the regression coefficient for carcass weight  and  is the vector of residual errors with   where  is the identity matrix and  is the residual variance.  and  are the incidence matrices for  and   respectively;  is the incidence vector for . All GWAS for meat quality traits were performed with the GenABEL package in the R environment []. Conditional GWAS was conducted by adjusting phenotypes for the top SNP that was identified in the previous round of the scan. Genome-wide and suggestive significance thresholds were set at 0.05/N and 1/N  where N is the number of SNPs tested in the analyses  based on the Bonferroni correction method [  ]. The genome-wide and suggestive significance thresholds were 1.27e-6 (0.05/39 369) and 2.54e-5 (1/39 369)  respectively  for the DLY population. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the top SNPs was estimated by   where  and  are the residual variances of the models for association analysis with and without the SNP term  respectively. Population stratification can lead to false positive results in GWAS  thus it was assessed by examining the distribution of the test statistics that were generated from the thousands of association tests and their deviation from the null distribution in quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plots []  which were constructed using the R software. We analyzed the patterns of LD blocks for the chromosomal regions that contained multiple significant SNPs clustered around the top SNP. The LD block patterns were built by using the Haploview version 4.2 software with default settings []. The LD based on r was estimated for all pairs of SNPs within the QTL region by using PLINK v1.07 []. Because the most significant GWAS top SNP rs326377357 (at 117 255 752 bp) for RG was detected in a region on SSC15 (SSC for  chromosome)  which is close to the  gene (at 120.85–120.87 Mb) and overlapped coincidently with other significant loci for RG-related traits (from 114.8 to 121.4 Mb)  we attempted to identify the causative variant(s) in this gene. First  a comparative analysis of the complete  sequence including its promoter [for information on primers (see Additional file : Table S1)] was conducted by sequencing DNA from six DLY individuals that showed extreme RG and different genotypes at the GWAS tag SNP rs326377357. Then  the  R200Q () mutation was detected by the PCR–RFLP method  as described previously []. In addition  72 markers  i.e. 30 SNPs in  that were identified by sequencing and the 42 surrounding SNPs that were identified from swine genome databases  were genotyped for the whole DLY population using a Sequenom Massarray system at Shanghai Genesky Biotechnologies Inc. On SSC3  a splice mutation g.8283C>A in the  gene that may explain the effect of another identified locus affecting RG and meat quality traits was also genotyped  as described by Ma et al. []. For the  gene and the 30-Mb region around   the genetic relationships between haplotypes in five commercial breeds were assessed by maximum likelihood (ML) analyses. These analyses involved 52 pigs  including 17 DLY  five Duroc  10 Landrace  16 Yorkshire  and 4 Hampshire pigs  among which the 17 DLY and 3 of the Hampshire pigs were heterozygous for the  R200Q variant  whereas the remaining Hampshire pig was homozygous. Since only 60 K SNPs and the 73 additional markers that were located in the vicinity of 3 were genotyped for the DLY pigs  the same SNPs were extracted from publicly available or our own genome-sequence data for the 35 selected purebred pigs. At the target regions  haplotypes were phased using PHASEBOOK []. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for the haplotypes using 1000 bootstraps via MEGA v7 []. Association analyses were performed either for individual SNPs within the  gene (T30N  G52S  I199V  R200Q) or for haplotypes that contained linked markers (T30N  G52S  L53P  193A  194L  I199V and R200Q) in this gene. Associations of a SNP (or haplotype) with meat quality traits were examined using the least square means method of the GLM (general linear model) procedure in the R software (version 3.5.0)  with a model that included the fixed effects of sex  slaughter batch  and the effect of a SNP (or a haplotype)  along with a residual error as a random effect. The SNP–SNP (or QTL–QTL) interaction analysis for three GWAS tag SNPs ( R200Q  rs81347579 and rs319599168) was performed in R with a model that was identical to that used for SNP association analysis  except that interaction effects between SNPs were included. The significance values for interaction effects of pair-wise and of three SNPs on RG were calculated by two-way and three-way ANOVA  respectively. Plots for the main effects of the three SNPs and their two-way interactions were generated by using the  function of HH package in the R software. In pigs  glycogen level in the muscle at slaughter influences meat quality. Thus  our aim was to evaluate the impact of variants associated with muscle glycogen level on several meat quality traits. First  we found that RG level in muscle from DLY pigs at 45 min post-mortem was negatively associated with pH 36 h (see Additional file : Figure S1) and subjective color score  but was positively associated with drip loss and color * (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; Table ). Moreover  the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between RG and these meat quality traits were all higher than 0.4  which suggest that pigs with a higher RG level produce meat with lower ultimate pH  water holding capacity and color preference. The results were similar for the correlations of GP with these same meat quality traits  except that the correlation coefficients were somewhat lower than for RG level  likely because of the non-significant correlations of lactate level with other meat quality indexes  except with *. Descriptive statistics and heritability estimates for GP  and levels of RG and lactate are in Table . For all three traits  coefficients of variation (CV) were higher than 37%  which indicates that they show considerable variation in DLY crossbred pigs. Heritability estimates for GP and RG were moderately high (0.27 and 0.40  respectively)  but much lower for lactate (0.04). In a previous study  we reported moderately high heritabilities (ranging from 0.34 to 0.42) for several meat quality traits associated with RG level in this DLY population  such as pH 36 h  drip loss  and meat colour indicators []. For the GWAS  an average inflation factor (<U+03BB>) of 1.003 was found for GP  RG  lactate  and other meat quality traits in the DLY population  which indicates no evidence of population stratification. The Q–Q plots of the test statistics for each separate GWAS are in Additional file : Figure S2. Our initial GWAS on the DLY population demonstrated that 10 SNPs  representing three genomic loci  were significantly associated with RG (Table  and Fig. a). Unsurprisingly  for GP and lactate level  which had comparatively lower estimates of heritability (Table )  no significant SNPs were identified. On SSC3  the top SNP rs339643601 (at 123.07 Mb) for RG level was located in a gene desert region  344 kb from the nearest gene    which encodes the LRAT domain containing 1 protein. On SSC4  the top SNP rs319599168 (at 84.98 Mb) is an intronic variant in the - () gene. The most significant SNP (rs326377357 at 117.26 Mb; =<U+2009>2.54e-11) for RG level was on SSC15  rs326377357 (at 117.26 Mb; =<U+2009>2.54e-11)  which was surrounded by seven other significant SNPs. Intriguingly  the region between 114.8 and 121.4 Mb on SSC15 also contained many SNPs that were significantly associated with most other RG-related traits  e.g. pH 36 h  drip loss  color score  and three color parameters  *  * and * (Table ). Moreover  this region harbors the  gene (at 120.86 Mb)  which has been shown to impact these meat quality traits in Hampshire pigs. Thus   is the most likely causative gene for the SSC15 QTL based on its position and functional annotations. Pinpointing  R200Q as underlying a major QTL for residual glycogen level (RG) in muscle on SSC15.  A Manhattan plot of the initial GWAS for RG level with 60 K SNP data. The red and green dots represent the SNPs that reached genome-wide significance (<U+2009><<U+2009>1.27e-6) and chromosome-wide significance level (<U+2009><<U+2009>2.54e-5).  Regional association plot for RG level in the region between 114 and 124 Mb on SSC15 where 73 additional markers were incorporated. Two completely-linked and top SNPs were revealed:  R200Q and L53P (highlighted by red and orange dots  respectively)  which were far more significant than the original top SNP rs326377357. The levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the  R200Q and its surrounding SNPs are indicated by different colors.  Effects of nine haplotypes that include seven SNPs (T30N  G52S  L53P  193A  194L  I199V and R200Q) in  on RG level. Only the ninth haplotype that includes the 200Q and 53L alleles could cause a much higher RG level compared to the other eight haplotypes (<<U+2009>0.001) To search for putative causal variants in the  gene  we sequenced it using DNA samples from six DLY animals that comprised the three different genotypes at the top SNP rs326377357 (2 individuals per genotype)  among which the alternate homozygous individuals had high versus low RG levels. We detected 53 SNPs within the  gene (see Additional file : Table S2). Surprisingly  the R200Q substitution  at which the 200Q allele was previously detected in the Hampshire breed but not in other breeds [  ]  did segregate in our samples. It is known that the  R200Q mutation causes a ~<U+2009>70% increase in muscle glycogen level in  (/rn or /) Hampshire pigs []  thus we examined the effects of this mutation on meat quality traits in the DLY pigs  which included only two genotypes ( and ). In fact  highly significant differences were observed between these two genotypes for all tested traits  including RG level  GP  pH 36 h  drip loss  and three color parameters of meat (*  *  *) (Table ). Notably   carrier individuals had a nearly fivefold higher RG level (=<U+2009>5.75e-49) and a twofold greater drip loss (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.93e-12) than the wild-type  animals  which confirms that the dominant R200Q () mutation has a strong influence on meat quality of DLY pigs. Some studies have suggested that  in addition to the R200Q variant  other variants and/or genes in the region flanking  may have significant effects on meat quality in pigs [    ]. Therefore  to investigate the genomic architecture of this region in detail and to determine whether other variants in this region contributed to the QTL effect  we extended the analysis to other variants in  and neighboring genes. Based on the genotyping data for the six DLY pigs mentioned above  we identified nine haplotypes in the  region (see Additional file : Figure S3). Accordingly  we selected 31 SNPs out of the 53 identified SNPs in  (including all 8 missense mutations and discarding 22 intronic SNPs) for further analysis. In addition to the R200Q variant  we genotyped 72 SNPs that were located in 11 genes (see Additional file : Table S3) in the complete set of DLY pigs and re-ran the GWA analysis. Results showed that the  R200Q and L53P mutations  which were in complete LD with each other  showed many more (><U+2009>10) significant associations with the meat quality traits studied here than any other tested SNP (Fig. b) and (see Additional file : Figure S4). In addition  after fitting the R200Q substitution in the model (Fig. a) or removing all 17 heterozygous  individuals from the data (data not shown)  the association between the  locus and the meat quality traits was no longer significant  even at a significance level of 0.01. These results indicate that the R200Q substitution accounts for most  if not all  of the effects of the QTL on SSC15. Pinpointing g.8283C>A as underlying another major QTL for RG on SSC3.  Manhattans plot of the GWAS for RG level after fitting the  R200Q SNP in the model.  Difference in average of RG level and drip loss between the three genotypes of the g.8283C>A SNP Three additional missense mutations (T30N  G52S and I199V) in  that have been reported to influence muscle glycogen level []  also segregated in the DLY population with a MAF higher than 0.22. Our GWAS showed that these three mutations were significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) associated with several meat quality traits (Table )  but none reached the significance level of the original GWAS tag SNP rs326377357 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.54e-11) and R200Q (<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.23e-49). Moreover  we found that  in the DLY replication cohort  the R200Q and L53P mutations also had a stronger effect on RG level than the G52S and I199V mutations (see Additional file : Table S4). In addition  we discovered nine haplotypes that comprised seven closely linked markers in  including T30N  G52S  L53P  193A  194L  I199V and R200Q. Among these  only one haplotype “30T(C)-52G(G)-53L(T)-193A(C)-194L(C)-199V(G)-200Q(A)” (denoted as ) contained the 200Q alleles  and its effects on RG level  pH 36 h  and drip loss differed significantly from those of the other haplotypes (<<U+2009>0.001; Fig. c). Taken together  these results provide additional support for the  R200Q mutation as the major contributor to the GWAS signals identified in the region. Notably  the  haplotype detected in the DLY population is exactly the same as the  haplotype that was found exclusively in the Hampshire breed by Milan et al. []  which suggests that the  allele has probably been introgressed from Hampshire pigs into the parental lines of the DLY pigs. To validate this  we constructed two maximum likelihood (ML) trees for haplotypes for the  region (120.84–120.86 Mb) and for a more extensive region around  (105.83–135.83 Mb)  using the genotyping data for carriers of the  allele in DLY and Hampshire  and non-carriers of the  allele in Duroc  Landrace  and Yorkshire pigs. As expected  both ML trees showed that almost all 200Q-haplotypes from DLY pigs clustered with the  haplotype of the Hampshire breed (Fig. a  b). We then tried to determine in which of the parental lines of the DLY pigs the  allele was segregating. Since only the sires (Duroc boars) of the DLY discovery cohort were sampled for DNA  they were the only ones genotyped for the  mutation. We found that the 200R allele was fixed in these individuals  which suggests that the DLY pigs inherited this allele only from their mothers (L<U+2009>×<U+2009>Y sows). This is consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis that showed that the majority of the 200R (rn)-haplotypes for the 30-Mb region around  in the DLY pigs were more closely related to the Duroc’s haplotypes than to Landrace and Yorkshire haplotypes (Fig. b). Since the  allele was apparently introduced in the ancestors (Landrace or Yorkshire) of our DLY population several or many generations ago  we assumed that the DLY heterozygous individuals contained recombinant chromosomes that combined the classical  haplotype with haplotype fragments that originated from the Landrace or Yorkshire lines. This hypothesis was confirmed by the detection of a<U+2009>~<U+2009>2.38-Mb (between 117.70 and 120.08 Mb) haplotype fragment of Yorkshire origin that was located just upstream of the  haplotype in three of the heterozygous DLY individuals (see Additional file : Table S5)  suggesting that their  alleles originated from Yorkshire. In addition  the ML tree analysis showed that one DLY 200Q-haplotype (DLY0800-2-Q) clustered with Landrace haplotypes (in particular  with Landrace2612-1) (Fig. b)  and indeed these shared the same haplotype fragment upstream of  (see Additional file : Table S5)  which indicates that the  allele of this DLY pig likely derived from Landrace. Based on these results  we infer that the  allele may be segregating in both the Yorkshire and Landrace parental lines. The haplotypes that harbor the  200Q allele in DLY pigs may have been introgressed from the Hampshire breed.  Maximum-likelihood (ML) tree for haplotypes at the  gene.  ML tree for haplotypes at the 30-Mb region centered on . Two haplotypes from each individual are denoted by “1” or “2” at the end of its name. The letter “Q” after the haplotype number indicates the haplotypes that carry 200Q. The Q- and R-types of haplotypes in the 17 heterozygous DLY pigs are highlighted by red and blue  respectively To further verify the existence of the  allele in purebred Landrace  Yorkshire  and Duroc pigs  we genotyped it in about 190 individuals per breed from three farms  which were unrelated to the current DLY population. We did not detect the  allele in the Landrace and Yorkshire pigs  but unexpectedly we identified it in the Duroc boars from a farm in Qingyuan city at a frequency of 0.14. Taken together  these results indicate that the  allele was introgressed into the three commercial pig breeds from Hampshire pigs. Previously  we reported a causal relationship between the g.8283C>A variant and muscle glycogen level and meat quality traits in different Duroc crossbreds []  including 140 samples from the current discovery cohort because  at the time  60K genotype data and GP phenotype data were not available for all pigs. Interestingly  results of the GWAS when conditioning on  R200Q or by excluding the 17 heterozygous individuals at R200Q  showed that  on SSC3  the original top SNP rs339643601 (at 123.07 Mb) near  disappeared  while rs81244397 (at 15.95 Mb; <U+2009>=<U+2009>9.32e-5) became a prominent SNP (Fig. a)  which is located near the  gene (at 16.82 Mb). Thus  we included g.8283C>A in the conditional GWAS to evaluate its potential contribution to the QTL signal. As expected  this previously detected causal variant showed a highly significant association with RG level (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.85e-9) and drip loss (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.90e-3)  and its minor allele “A” (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.049) increased RG level and drip loss  with additive effects of 5.82 µmol/g and 0.67%  respectively (Fig. b). Furthermore  when SNP g.8283C>A was included in the model as a fixed effect  all the tested SNPs in this QTL region were no longer significant (Fig. a). Uncovering other potential loci for RG level and evaluating their effects.  Manhattans plot of the conditional GWAS when adjusting for two pinpointed causal variants ( R200Q and g.8283C>A) in the model. One top SNP rs81347579 that is currently assigned to “chromosome unknown” and another SNP rs319599168 on SSC4 that were identified in the earlier GWAS (Figs. a  a) are still significantly associated with RG level.  The main-effects of the three top SNPs ( R200Q  rs81347579 and rs319599168) and their two-way interaction effects on RG level In addition to the  locus  we also found a novel significant SNP rs81347579. This is located on an unassembled scaffold AEMK02000452.1 in the 11.1 assembly  but we were able to deduce that it is very likely residing on SSC7; see footnote of Table ). This analysis also identified another suggestive SNP rs319599168 on SSC4 (which was previously identified in the initial GWAS) by re-association analyses when adjusting for the  R200Q SNP in the model (Fig. a) or excluding all carriers of the 200Q-allele from the data. Furthermore  even when both  R200Q and g.8283C>A were included as fixed effects in the statistic model  rs81347579 and rs319599168 still had significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>1.83e-4) associations with RG level (Fig. a). Taken together  these results imply that these signals likely represent independent QTL  rather than false positive signals caused by the  and  variants. Both the rs81347579 and rs319599168 SNPs  had “” as minor allele in the DLY pigs  with frequencies of 13.5 and 5.7%  respectively  and increased RG level by 2.50<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.27 and 2.10<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.26 µmol/g  respectively  based on differences in average RG levels between heterozygotes and homozygotes for the major allele (Fig. b)  which subsequently caused a reduction in pH 36 h by 0.032 and 0.026  respectively. Intriguingly  the tag SNPs rs81347579 and rs319599168 had significance levels before and after adjusting for  R200Q that varied to a certain extent (Figs. a  a)  which suggests that they may interact with R200Q. Indeed  Fig. b shows a very significant interaction (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.34e-10) between SNP rs319599168 and  R200Q  because the difference in mean RG level between the  and  genotypes at rs319599168 (or R200Q) was much larger in heterozygous individuals at R200Q (or rs319599168) than in homozygous individuals at the same locus. The interaction between rs81347579 and R200Q was also significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02)  but the interaction between rs81347579 and rs319599168 was not (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20) (Fig. b). In addition  a three-way ANOVA also showed significance of the main effects of the three SNPs (<U+2009><<U+2009>2e-16  2.30e-5 and 4.17e-4 for R200Q  rs81347579 and rs319599168  respectively) and of the above-mentioned two-SNP interactions (<U+2009><<U+2009>1.97e-9 and 0.033 for R200Q-rs319599168 and R200Q-rs81347579  respectively)  as well as of the three-SNP interaction (<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.63e-6). In humans  GWAS that involved tens of thousands of individuals and millions of SNPs revealed significant and suggestive association signals for a complex phenotype at <5e-8 and <U+2009><<U+2009>1e-5  respectively []. In our study  we applied Bonferroni corrected  value thresholds (1.27e-6 and 2.54e-5) in the initial GWAS and the first conditional GWAS. However  for the second conditional GWAS  after controlling for the two causal variants ( R200Q and g.8283C>A)  we preferred to consider <U+2009><<U+2009>1e-4 as the suggestive threshold for the detection of additional QTL for RG level. Based on this  value  we identified seven chromosomal regions that harbored suggestive SNPs with a <U+2009><<U+2009>1e-4  including one previously identified SNP  rs81347579  close to the  gene. Notably  nearby the  gene on SSC3  the top SNP  rs81240897 (Table )  which was detected by the conditional GWAS  was found to be the second strongest signal identified in the initial GWAS that previously revealed rs339643601 as the most significant SNP (Table ). Although these two GWAS tag SNPs are only 133 kb apart  they were in low LD (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.17) and had markedly different MAF  which suggests that they may represent distinct QTL. Those suggestive SNPs detected by the conditional GWAS individually explained 0.91 to 2.84% of the phenotypic variance  and their MAF were in the range of 0.14 to 0.45 (Table ). Scheffler et al. [] reported that in “normal” pigs that do not carry the 200Q allele  GP is weakly associated with pH24 h (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.89). In contrast  we found a slightly stronger and significant association between GP and pH 36 h in all the DLY pigs (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.24  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) as well as in DLY pigs that do not carry the 200Q mutation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.21  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). This discrepancy may in part be due to the effect of other  mutations or other genes in our population. Importantly  our results showed that RG level at an early stage postmortem is more likely to impact meat quality than GP level  because its associations with pH 36 h  drip loss  and meat color parameters were all significant at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 and at a higher level than the associations of GP level with those same meat quality characteristics (Table ). Thus  genetic loci that have a greater effect on muscle glycogen level are more likely to affect related meat quality traits (e.g. pH and drip loss). Besides the known causative genes  and   two novel candidate genes   and  on SSC3 and SSC4  respectively  were identified by the initial GWAS (Table ). An earlier study indicated that up-regulation of  (previously called ) plays a critical role in the progression of colon cancer []  but its biological function is still not well known. The  gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein that forms a functional calcium-selective channel that prevents Ca stores from overfilling []. The top SNP detected by the GWAS  rs319599168 (g.84976996C>T)  is located in an intron of this gene. Interestingly  another calcium channel gene    which encodes a ryanodine receptor that is present in skeletal muscle and mediates the release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm  also contains mutations that cause porcine malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and pale  soft  and exudative meat []. This is in agreement with the assumption that causative genes for a trait are functionally closely related []. In addition  the most significant SNP identified by conditional GWAS  rs81347579  was mapped 57 kb downstream of the  gene (Table )  which encodes creatine kinase that reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate). Since the creatine kinase reaction influences ATP and ADP levels  which are critical to glycogen storage in live pigs and to the rate of anaerobic glycolysis and pH decline in postmortem muscle []  the  gene is a promising candidate for RG level. Nevertheless  the causality between these candidate genes and RG level needs to be verified by future functional experiments. It should be noted that screening and prioritizing positional candidate genes depend largely on the precision of QTL mapping and knowledge of their function. Precision of QTL mapping is mainly determined by the extent of LD between markers and a causal variant  which is  however  usually insufficient if the causal variant has a low MAF (<<U+2009>0.05). The frequency of the  200Q mutant allele in DLY pigs was only<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.4%. Retrospective analysis indicated that the top SNP for RG level identified by the initial GWAS  rs326377357 (located at 3.60 Mb from R200Q)  was indeed in stronger LD with R200Q (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.053) than other SNPs that passed quality control. However  when the number of typed SNPs within the candidate region increased  several new SNPs were identified  less than 1.4 kb away from R200Q  which were more tightly linked with R200Q and more significantly associated with RG level than rs326377357 (Fig. b). This result supports the precision of our QTL mapping and the hypothesis that increasing marker density is useful to refine QTL location and identify candidate genes  especially for low-frequency QTL. Our results demonstrated that the 200Q () allele increased RG level and GP by approximately fourfold and 87%  and markedly decreased pH 36 h and water-holding capacity (Table ). Although this marked effect of R200Q on these traits seems comparable in DLY and Hampshire pigs []  there is some discrepancy. In the Hampshire breed  animals with an RG level higher than 40 µmol/g or a GP value higher than 180 µmol/g can be classified as /rn or / with high accuracy (><U+2009>95%). However  this simple criterion to infer the genotype at R200Q may not be suitable for DLY pigs  because only 65% (11 out of 17) of the  carriers in the DLY population met these criteria  while the other seven DLY individuals that had such RG levels and GP values were homozygous for the wild-type genotype (rn/rn). This discrepancy may be due to distinct genetic backgrounds  genetic heterogeneity and/or interactions of R200Q with other loci. The Hampshire origin of the 200Q () allele has been confirmed  since it was shown to be present in a very high percentage of Hampshire pigs  but not in other breeds []. However  we demonstrated that not only the 200Q allele but also a specific haplotype that was exclusively found in  Hampshire pigs was present in DLY pigs. Based on the finding that all Duroc boars that contributed to the DLY population analyzed are normal (rn/rn genotype)  and based on results of the evolutionary tree analysis and the haplotype-sharing analysis of five commercial breeds  we deduced that the 200Q allele was introgressed from the Hampshire breed to the purebred parental lines  including both Landrace and Yorkshire. Surprisingly  we did not identify a Landrace or Yorkshire pig that carries  allele  probably because of its low frequency  but we did identify carriers of this allele in a Duroc line. Thus  our study provides evidence for the first time that the  allele may already be segregating in all parental breeds of DLY. How and when the  allele was introgressed from the Hampshire breed into the other commercial breeds is unclear. However  as far as we know  the ancestors used to reproduce Duroc  Landrace  or Yorkshire purebred pigs were usually imported from abroad  and none of the breeding programs involved crossbreeding with Hampshire pigs in China. Therefore  we cannot not rule out that some Duroc  Landrace  or Yorkshire pig lines were infused by Hampshire related animals before they were imported into China. Considering the negative effect of the  allele on meat quality  it is important to eliminate it from the populations in which it segregates. In addition to the R200Q mutation  other mutations in  may influence meat quality traits  such as the I199V substitution. Ciobanu et al. [] suggested that this mutation has opposite effects on RG level  GP  pH  and color scores  compared with 200Q. In agreement with that  our results confirmed that the 199I allele was associated with lower glycogen level  higher pH 36 h  and lower drip loss (Table ). Nevertheless  the effect of the I199V mutation  as well as that of G52S and T30  is not sufficient to account for the QTL effect that we observed in the DLY pigs  which  in contrast  was almost completely explained by the R200Q substitution. Our analyses identified interactions between the - (R200Q<U+2009>×<U+2009>rs319599168) and - (R200Q<U+2009>×<U+2009>rs81347579) genes to be significantly associated with RG level  which confers an increased risk for the RN phenotype. Indeed  we found that the additive effect of the minor allele () at rs319599168 explained only<U+2009>~<U+2009>3.0 µmol/g (Table )  while it could result in an approximate doubling (from 34.9 to 60.6 µmol/g) of the RG level in carriers of the 200Q allele (Fig. b). More importantly  the GG (rs319599168)<U+2009>×<U+2009>GG (R200Q) combination haplotype seems to be most favorable for pork quality. Further validation of the effects of these gene interactions in other pig populations and investigation of their functional relevance are necessary. In this study  we detected two major QTL ( R200Q and g.8283C>A) and at least eight minor QTL (including 7 in Tables    adjacent to  on SSC4) for RG level. The former two loci belong to low-frequency variants in the DLY population and together explained nearly 70% of the phenotypic variation in RG level in this population. By contrast  the effect of the minor and common QTL variants (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>5%) was only 3 to 10% of the effect of  R200Q on RG level and each of them explained 1 to 3% of the phenotypic variance. These results suggest that  in DLY pigs  muscle glycogen level and meat quality traits are regulated by a limited number of major genes and many other minor genes. We detected ten chromosomal regions that were significantly associated with RG level in DLY pigs. For the two large-effect QTL  the  R200Q and g.8283C>A variants were pinpointed to cause excess glycogen level and result in inferior meat quality traits in DLY pigs. Thus  it is important to eliminate the unfavorable alleles in the Duroc or other parental breeds of DLY  especially the 200Q allele. In addition  two promising candidate genes   and   which play a role in calcium homeostasis and energy homeostasis  respectively  were identified  but their functional validation needs to be investigated further. Interactions of three SNPs  R200Q in   rs319599168 in   and rs81347579 nearby   were significant. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of RG level  GP  and meat quality traits in commercial pig lines and suggest potential candidate loci for pork quality improvement.

Commonly  sire lines are bred for traits such as feed efficiency  growth and meat content  whereas maternal lines are also bred for reproduction and longevity traits  and the resulting three-way crossbred pigs are used for production of meat. The most important genetic basis for heterosis is dominance effects  e.g. removal of inbreeding depression. The aims of this study were to (1) present a modification of a previously developed model with additive  dominance and inbreeding depression genetic effects for analysis of data from a purebred sire line and three-way crossbred pigs; (2) based on this model  present equations for additive genetic variances  additive genetic covariance  and estimated breeding values (EBV) with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances; (3) use the model to analyse four production traits  i.e. ultra-sound recorded backfat thickness (BF)  conformation score (CONF)  average daily gain (ADG)  and feed conversion ratio (FCR)  recorded on Danbred Duroc and Danbred Duroc-Landrace–Yorkshire crossbred pigs reared in the same environment; and (4) obtain estimates of genetic parameters  additive genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performances  and EBV with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances for this data set.ResultsAdditive genetic correlations (with associated standard errors) between purebred and crossbred performances were equal to 0.96 (0.07)  0.83 (0.16)  0.75 (0.17)  and 0.87 (0.18) for BF  CONF  ADG  and FCR  respectively. For BF  ADG  and FCR  the additive genetic variance was smaller for purebred performance than for crossbred performance  but for CONF the reverse was observed. EBV on Duroc boars were more accurate for purebred performance than for crossbred performance for BF  CONF and FCR  but not for ADG.ConclusionsMethodological developments led to equations for genetic (co)variances and EBV with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances in a three-way crossbreeding system. As illustrated by the data analysis  these equations may be useful for implementation of genomic selection in this system."

Commonly  sire lines are bred for traits such as feed efficiency  growth and meat content  whereas maternal lines are also bred for reproduction and longevity traits  and the resulting three-way crossbred pigs are used for production of meat. The most important genetic basis for heterosis is dominance effects  e.g. removal of inbreeding depression. The aims of this study were to (1) present a modification of a previously developed model with additive  dominance and inbreeding depression genetic effects for analysis of data from a purebred sire line and three-way crossbred pigs; (2) based on this model  present equations for additive genetic variances  additive genetic covariance  and estimated breeding values (EBV) with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances; (3) use the model to analyse four production traits  i.e. ultra-sound recorded backfat thickness (BF)  conformation score (CONF)  average daily gain (ADG)  and feed conversion ratio (FCR)  recorded on Danbred Duroc and Danbred Duroc-Landrace–Yorkshire crossbred pigs reared in the same environment; and (4) obtain estimates of genetic parameters  additive genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performances  and EBV with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances for this data set. Additive genetic correlations (with associated standard errors) between purebred and crossbred performances were equal to 0.96 (0.07)  0.83 (0.16)  0.75 (0.17)  and 0.87 (0.18) for BF  CONF  ADG  and FCR  respectively. For BF  ADG  and FCR  the additive genetic variance was smaller for purebred performance than for crossbred performance  but for CONF the reverse was observed. EBV on Duroc boars were more accurate for purebred performance than for crossbred performance for BF  CONF and FCR  but not for ADG. Methodological developments led to equations for genetic (co)variances and EBV with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances in a three-way crossbreeding system. As illustrated by the data analysis  these equations may be useful for implementation of genomic selection in this system. Crossbreeding is widely used in pig production because of the benefits of heterosis effects and breed complementarity. Commonly  sire lines  for example Duroc or Pietrain lines  are bred for production traits such as feed efficiency  growth and meat content  whereas maternal lines  for example Landrace and Yorkshire lines  are also bred for reproduction and longevity traits. The production traits give value to farmers in the finishing units  whereas the reproduction and longevity traits give value to farmers in the sow units. To benefit from heterosis effects in all production units  a crossbreeding system that is often used is a terminal three line system where two maternal lines are mated to produce crossbred sows  which then are mated to a sire line to produce three-way crossbred pigs for the production of meat. For example  in the DanBred production system  the maternal lines Danbred Landrace (L) and Danbred Yorkshire (Y) are mated to produce two-way crossbred Landrace–Yorkshire (LY) sows  which are then mated to sire line Danbred Duroc (D) boars  resulting in three-way crossbred Duroc-Landrace–Yorkshire (DLY) pigs. Heterosis is caused by non-additive gene actions [] and is one reason for the difference between performances of purebreds and crossbreds. In addition  there may be systematic differences in the environments of  for example  nucleus herds and finisher herds. For these reasons  selecting animals for high purebred performance may not result in selecting those that lead to high-performance crossbred offspring in a specific crossbreeding scheme. An approach to handle this is to define two breeding values for purebred animals  the usual breeding value for purebred performance (mating within breed) and an alternative breeding value for crossbred performance (mating with the other breed)  as in Wei and van der Werf []  and then select based on an index of the two estimated breeding values (EBV) [  ]. These two breeding values are correlated  with the correlation depending on the size of non-additive genetic effects in combination with differences in allele frequencies between lines  and possibly in addition  on genotype by environment interactions. Non-additive genetic effects are usually not incorporated into models for genetic evaluation for at least two reasons. First  to accurately estimate dominance genetic variance and dominance genetic effects based on pedigree-based relationships  very large data sets with a high proportion of full-sibs are required []. Second  with pedigree-based relationships  specification and computation of non-additive genetic relationship matrices are difficult []. However  with genomic relationships instead of pedigree relationships  the story is different. Recently  pig breeding organisations have introduced genomic selection in their breeding schemes  and genetic evaluation is based on models that include genomic information. The focus has primarily been on additive genetic models and records on purebreds []  but there has been increasing scientific interest in models with dominance genetic effects  and in combining purebred and crossbred information [  ]. Genomic data provide more information for accurate estimation of dominance genetic effects and  in addition  including dominance effects into the models has become less difficult in practice  since computing the genomic dominance relationship matrix only requires knowledge about whether marker genotypes are heterozygous or not [  ]. For genomic evaluation in a crossbreeding system with two purebred lines and a crossbred F1 population  Vitezica et al. [] introduced a flexible model  which contains both additive and dominance genotypic effects that are allowed to differ in purebreds and crossbreds  with correlations between them. Xiang et al. [] extended the model to include genomic inbreeding depression effects that are viewed as resulting from directional dominance effects  and also presented equations for the genetic variances  genetic covariance and genetic correlation between purebred and crossbred performances as functions of the parameters in the model. Both papers used the model to analyse litter size in pigs  and provided estimates of correlations between genotypic effects in purebreds and crossbreds for both additive and dominance genotypic effects. In Xiang et al. []  predictive performance for total genotypic effects was also investigated and it was found that including both inbreeding depression effects and dominance effects improved predictive performance. However  estimation of breeding values was not considered in these two papers. Moreover  to date  such a model has only been used on maternal lines and reproduction traits  and the model would need to be modified for production traits from a three-way crossing terminal system. The aims of this study were to (1) present a modification of the model of Vitezica et al. [] and Xiang et al. [] for the case of a purebred sire line and three-way crossbred pigs; (2) based on this model  present equations for genetic variances  genetic covariance  and EBV for purebred and crossbred performance; (3) use the model to analyse four production traits  i.e. ultra-sound recorded backfat thickness  conformation score  average daily gain  and feed conversion ratio  recorded on Danbred Duroc and Danbred DLY pigs raised in the same environment; and (4) obtain estimates of genetic parameters  genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performances  and EBV with associated accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances for this data set. In this section we present successively (1) the model for genomic evaluation in the terminal crossbreeding system with purebred sire line and three-way crossbred animals; (2) an equivalent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects model and equations for genetic variances and covariance; (3) equations for EBV with associated accuracies; (4) the data used in this study; and (5) details of the data analysis. The bivariate model with phenotypes on the sire line and three-way crossbred pigs considered as two correlated traits is: where the first equation  with subscripts  for purebred  is the sire line part of the model  and the second equation  with subscripts  for crossbred  is the three-way crossbred part of the model. For the sire line part of the model  vector  contains phenotypes  vector  contains fixed effects  matrix  relates animals with phenotypes to fixed effects   is the inbreeding depression per unit of genomic inbreeding  vector  is the vector of genomic inbreeding coefficients  vector  contains random litter effects   with  being the identity matrix  matrix  relates animals to litters  vector  contains additive genotypic effects that are assumed random   with  defined below  vector  contains dominance genotypic effects that are also assumed random   with  defined below  and  is the random residual error vector  . For the three-way crossbred part of the model  notation and effects are defined as for the sire line part of the model. The model is a modification of the model in Vitezica et al. [] and Xiang et al. []  where genetic effects      and  are “biological effects”. Additive and dominance relationships are specified across the sire line and the three-way crossbred pigs. The additive genomic relationship matrix is: where  is the  allele content matrix with entries 1   for genotypes 11  12  22  respectively   is the total number of animals   is the number of SNPs  and superscript T refers to the transpose of a matrix. The dominance genomic relationship matrix is: where the  matrix  has entries 0  1  0 for genotypes 11  12  22  respectively. The genetic effects are correlated  i.e. with     and  being submatrices of matrix  in Eq. () for purebreds  between purebreds and crossbreds  and for crossbreds  respectively  and     and  being submatrices of matrix  in Eq. () for purebreds  between purebreds and crossbreds  and for crossbreds  respectively. The correlation between genotypic additive effects is  and the correlation between genotypic dominance effects is . The variance–covariance matrices of the genetic effects defined above are not immediately suitable for fitting the model using standard genetic evaluation software. However  the variance–covariance structure of the genetic effects in the model can equivalently be described as: where       and  are vectors of artificial random effects   is the Kronecker product  and  and  are  variance–covariance matrices: This formulation of the variance–covariance structure of the genetic effects using artificial random effects and Kronecker products makes it possible to fit the model using standard genetic evaluation software. The model is similar to the model in Vitezica et al. [] and Xiang et al. []  except that only phenotypes of the crossbreds and the paternal line are included here  that the maternal population consists of crossbreds  and that inbreeding depression effects were not included in Vitezica et al. []. We name this model the genotypic model. Inbreeding depression is incorporated in the model as a fixed effect  as in Xiang et al. []  where the inbreeding coefficient of an individual is the frequency of homozygous loci for that individual  i.e.  and   where  is a vector with all elements being 1. Note that for the three-way crossbred part of the model  additive and dominance effects for the three-way crossbred performance are assumed independent of the origin of the allele (sire line or crossbred sow population). An alternative would be a breed of origin effects model [  ]  but this would require an accurate determination of the breed of origin of alleles  and also has been found to only to be beneficial in cases where traits have a combination of low heritability and low correlation between purebred and crossbred performance  and breeds are distantly related []. Therefore  this was not studied here. For the derivation of equations for genetic variances and covariances  and for EBV with associated accuracies that are presented in the following subsection  it is more suitable to express the genotypic effects      and  in model () equivalently as functions of SNP effects          where  and  are vectors of additive SNP effects  and  and  are vectors of dominance SNP effects. Here  where  is the identity matrix. Note that          and . The inbreeding depression effects   and  in model () are caused by directional dominance effects []  which can be seen as follows. Consider the sire line part of the model  and the sum of the inbreeding depression effect and the genotypic dominance effect: then we see that  is the mean of the dominance SNP effects   i.e. dominance SNP effects are directional. Assuming selection aims at increasing the trait  then  would usually be negative  corresponding to inbreeding depression  and then the direction of the dominance SNP effects  would be positive. Similarly  for the three-way crossbred part   is the mean of the directional dominance SNP effects . The classical additive genetic variance is not the parameter   but according to Vitezica et al. [] it is obtained from the vector of allele substitution effects and parameters  and  in the SNP effects model. Here  because the inbreeding depression effects in the model are caused by directional dominance effects  the vector of allele substitution effects is: where  and  are vectors of frequencies of the first and second allele  respectively  and * denotes elementwise multiplication. Making the standard assumptions of linkage equilibrium and uncorrelated marker effects across loci (see e.g. [])  and letting superscript  denote theth element of vectors  the resulting expression for the additive genetic variance is: since . The expression in Eq. () differs from the corresponding equation in Xiang et al. []  because they overlooked the contribution from  to the equation. Following Xiang et al. []  here we name this the additive genetic variance for purebred performance (mating within sire line). The additive genetic variance for crossbred performance (mating sire line with sows from another population) is according to Xiang et al. [] obtained from the vector of allele substitution effects for sire line boars when mated to the specific population. However  compared to Xiang et al. []  one difference is that the population of crossbred sows cannot be assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium  and the usual equation for the allele substitution effect does not apply. Instead we use Eq. () in Falconer []  which says that the allele substitution effect equals   where  measures departure from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium  and equals  with  being the frequency of the heterozygous genotypes (with the definition that  when  or ). Using   the vector of allele substitution effects can therefore be expressed as: with where  and  are vectors of frequencies of the first and second allele in crossbred sows  respectively   is a vector of frequencies of heterozygous genotypes in crossbred sows  and * and fraction in Eq. () denote elementwise multiplication and division  respectively. Note that for elements with  or   the fraction in Eq. () is to be understood as  to avoid the problem of division by zero  and this convention also applies in Eqs. ()  ()  () and () below. The resulting expression for the additive genetic variance for crossbred performance of sire line boars (mating with crossbred sows) is: where  is the  element of the vector defined in Eq. (). The additive genetic covariance between purebred and crossbred performances is according to Xiang et al. [] obtained from covariances between allele substitution effects. Here  this becomes: The genetic correlation between purebred and crossbred performances then equals where     and  are defined in Eqs. ()  () and ()  respectively. Breeding values (BV) of sire line boars for purebred performance are obtained from the allele substitution effects shown in Eq. () as   where . EBV are obtained from estimated effects       in the SNP effects model  Alternatively  EBV can be obtained from the estimated effects        in the genotypic model by backsolving as described in the following. Based on the fact that estimated effects satisfy  and   which follows from combining Eqs.  and  in Stranden and Garrick []  we obtain: Accuracy of EBV    can be obtained from the prediction error variance (PEV) as   where   with  being a diagonal matrix with elements . Details on how to compute PEV for the SNP effects model are in Appendix. It is unclear how to compute this PEV for the genotypic model. Breeding values of sire line boars for three-way crossbred performance are obtained from the allele substitution effects of sire line boars for crossbred performance as shown in Eq. ()  and can therefore be expressed as   where  is defined in (). Thus  from the SNP effects model  EBV for three-way crossbred performance of sire line boars are equal to: and accuracies can be obtained from PEV as   where   with  being a diagonal matrix with elements   and with  computed as explained in Appendix. Alternatively  based on the fact that the estimated effects satisfy Eqs.  and   which again are based on Eqs.  and  of Stranden and Garrick[]  we obtain the following equation for EBV based on the genotypic model: The data set consisted of Danbred Duroc and Danbred DLY pigs reared in the same time period at the test station Bøgildgaard in Denmark  and measured for phenotypes on production traits. All pigs had known pedigree  and sires of both the Duroc and the DLY populations were active breeding boars in the DanBred Duroc population (139 and 140 sires for the Duroc and DLY populations  respectively  with 61 overlapping between the two populations)  which creates a genetic relationship between the Duroc and the DLY pigs used in this study. The Duroc pigs were part of the routine breeding program in which owners of nucleus herds select up to three male pigs from litters with a high index (average of indices for parents) for entering the test station. The DLY pigs were produced at a commercial sow herd  for which 698 litters of DLY pigs were produced with the intention of having four pigs (two males and two females) from each litter in the test. The Duroc pigs came from 13 nucleus herds  and the DLY pigs came from one sow herd  resulting in a low biosecurity level at the test station due to the mixing of pigs from many herds with different disease status. At the test station  feed was given ad libitum in feeders with individual recordings on feed intake and each pen was planned to contain 14 pigs. During the study  changes of feed composition at the test station were made twice  but in all cases the feed was optimised according to Danish nutrient recommendations []. The experiment was designed to have phenotypes and genotypes on all these animals  but for various reasons this was not completely achieved. Only animals which had both phenotypes and genotypes (after quality control described below) were analysed here  and the resulting data set contained 2595 Duroc and 2426 DLY pigs that entered the test station between 18 June 2014 and 17 August 2015  and that had their ultra-sound backfat thickness recorded between 5 August 2014 and 5 October 2015. In addition  most animals had their Duroc sire genotyped. In this study  all the Duroc pigs were males  whereas the DLY pigs consisted of approximately 50% males and 50% females. The pigs were genotyped with either the 8.5K GGP-Porcine LD Illumina Bead SNP array or the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) Porcine HD 70K SNP array (almost all DLY pigs and nearly two thirds of the Duroc pigs were genotyped with the 8.5K array). For simplicity  and to avoid issues with effects of imputation errors  only SNPs that overlapped between the two SNP arrays were used here. Animals with parentage error due to the Duroc sire (fraction of Mendelian mismatches between animal and sire higher than 2%) were removed  and otherwise genotypes with such mismatches were declared missing. The SNPs were quality controlled using the following criteria: SNPs with a call-rate lower than 90% or with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01 were excluded. After quality control  6316 SNPs were retained. The genotype of an animal was only retained if the call rate was higher than 90%. Following this quality control  1.2% of genotypes were missing  and these were imputed using Fimpute []. The following four traits were analysed: ultra-sound recorded backfat thickness (BF)  overall conformation score (CONF)  average daily gain (ADG)  and feed conversion ratio (FCR). BF was measured as the average of ultrasound measurements in mm at four positions of the back  recorded at the end of the test period  CONF was measured as a score ranging from 2 to 4 at the end of test period  ADG was total weight gain in kg during the test period divided by number of days of the test period  and FCR was total feed intake in kg divided by total weight gain in kg during the test period. One animal with an unusually low end weight of 43 kg was removed from the study  and for one animal that had an unusually large feed intake given the weight gain  this feed intake was changed to missing. A summary of the data is in Table . For the analysis of traits BF  CONF  ADG or FCR observed on the Duroc sire line and DLY crossbreds  as presented in the subsection on data  we used the bivariate model ()  where vectors  and  contained phenotypes (BF  CONF  ADG or FCR) on Duroc and DLY respectively  vectors  and  contained section-year-season effects  sex effects (only )  and a regression on weight at time of recording (for BF and CONF)  or on start weight (for ADG and FCR)  matrices  and  relate animals with phenotypes to section-year-season’s and sexes (only for ) and contain a column with weights at time of recording (for BF and CONF) or start weight (for ADG and FCR)  and the remaining notation is defined in the subsection entitled Combined purebred and crossbred model. The allele frequencies of sire line and crossbred sows and heterozygote genotype frequencies in crossbred sows all enter into Eqs. ()  () and () for genetic variances of and covariance between purebred and crossbred performances. For this study  we computed these allele frequencies as follows: the sire line allele frequencies were the observed allele frequencies of the purebred Duroc in this study  whereas the allele and genotype frequencies in LY were computed from observed allele frequencies on genotypes of 9021 Danbred Landrace and 8760 Danbred Yorkshire animals born in 2014  i.e.  and   where  and  were allele frequencies for Landrace and Yorkshire pigs  respectively  born in 2014. Parameter estimates (with associated standard errors) and estimated effects were obtained from the genotypic model  using restricted maximum likelihood and best linear unbiased estimation implemented in the DMUAI module in the software DMU []. For all traits  convergence of the AI-REML algorithm for parameter estimation was slow  which indicated possible problems of lack of convergence. To assess this  investigations with different starting values were made to confirm that the resulting parameter estimates did not depend on starting values for the algorithm. Genetic variances  covariances  correlations  and EBV were estimated using Eqs. ()  ()  ()  ()  () and ()  and heritabilities were estimated using  and   where     and  were averages of diagonal elements in matrices       and   respectively. Standard errors on estimates of parameters were computed using the delta-method implemented in the contributed R package car  version 2.1-5 []. Accuracies of EBV were computed based on PEV  which were computed as explained in Appendix based on the SNP effects model using a method in the DMU4 module of the software DMU release 5.4 [] that returns the coefficient matrix of the mixed models equations. Table  shows the best linear unbiased estimates of inbreeding depression parameters and estimates of variance and covariance parameters with associated standard errors (in brackets) for the four traits. Estimates of correlations between genotypic additive effects for purebred and crossbred performances in Table     (with associated standard errors) were equal to 0.98 (0.07)  0.84 (0.17)  0.88 (0.21)  0.99 (0.21) for BF  CONF  ADG  FCR  respectively  and estimates of correlations between genotypic dominance effects for purebred and crossbred performances    (with associated standard errors) were equal to 1.00 (2.34)  1.00 (15.91)  - 0.71 (1.01)  1.00 (3.01) for BF  CONF  ADG  FCR  respectively. Furthermore  the *log-likelihood ratio statistic for testing the model without dominance effects was 1.08  0.02  6.17  7.19 for BF  CONF  ADG  FCR  respectively  and these were evaluated against a -distribution  since three parameters (two variance parameters and one covariance parameter) were removed from the model. Since the  quantile of a -distribution is 7.81  the dominance effects were negligible for CONF  but not for the other three traits  although we cannot reject the hypothesis of no dominance effects for these traits. The results in Table  show that for purebred Duroc pigs  the estimated inbreeding depression per unit of inbreeding   was negative for ADG  and statistically significantly different from zero. A negative value of  means inbreeding depression for ADG. For DLY  there was also a negative inbreeding depression effect for ADG  although it was not statistically significantly different from zero. The estimated  and  for BF were both positive (corresponding to inbreeding depression since direction of selection is to reduce BF)  but neither was statistically significantly different from zero. For the other two traits  the estimates of  and  were both small when the standard error estimate was taken into account  and they also had conflicting signs between Duroc and DLY. Based on estimates of model parameters and allele frequencies  genetic parameters were computed using Eqs. ()  () and (). The resulting estimates of additive genetic variances  covariance and correlation (with associated standard errors) for purebred and crossbred performances for each trait are in Table . For BF  ADG  and FCR  the genetic variance was smaller for purebred performance than for crossbred performance  whereas the opposite was observed for CONF. The difference between estimates of additive genetic variances for purebred and crossbred performances was most pronounced for ADG  for which  was more than two times larger than . Estimates of additive genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performances ranged from 0.75 for ADG to 0.96 for BF. EBV of Duroc boars for purebred and crossbred performances are in Fig.   which shows that there was a strong positive association between EBV for purebred and crossbred performances when the additive genetic correlation  was large (e.g. trait BF)  and that the association was weaker when the additive genetic correlation was weaker (e.g. trait ADG). Figure  also shows that the variability of EBV for crossbred performance compared to variability for purebred performance was smaller for CONF  similar for FCR and BF  and larger for ADG. This pattern is consistent with the pattern of additive genetic variances seen in Table . Equations () and () for EBV both use allele frequencies for Duroc boars to center matrix  and  therefore  these EBV are relative to the population of Duroc boars. As a result  the EBV are centered around zero in Fig. . EBV for purebred and crossbred performances. EBV for purebred and crossbred performances on Duroc boars.  ultra-sound recorded backfat thickness   overall conformation score   average daily gain   feed conversion ratio Accuracies of EBV for purebred and crossbred performances of Duroc boars are in Fig.   which shows a positive relationship between accuracies for purebred and crossbred performances. For BF  CONF and FCR  accuracies were higher for purebred performance than for crossbred performances  whereas the opposite was observed for ADG. The amount of information on relatives is an important parameter for accuracies. For the data set investigated here  seven of the Duroc boars had Duroc offspring with records  but none had DLY offspring with records. In general  these seven boars with Duroc offspring had the highest accuracies of EBV for purebred performance (for BF  CONF  and AGD the top five boars in terms of accuracy for purebred performance all had Duroc offspring  for ADG four of the top five boars in terms of accuracy had Duroc offspring)  and also had high accuracies for crossbred performance (accuracy gained from the correlated purebred performance with high accuracy). Accuracies of EBV for purebred and crossbred performances. Accuracies of EBV for purebred and crossbred performances on Duroc boars.  ultra-sound recorded backfat thickness   overall conformation score   average daily gain   feed conversion ratio We present a model for genomic evaluation for a terminal three-way crossbreeding system when information is available on the purebred sire line and three-way crossbred pigs. This model is a modification of the models studied in Vitezica et al. [] and Xiang et al. []  accounts for both additive and dominance genotypic effects  and provides flexibility through genetic correlations for these effects between purebreds and crossbreds. We also present an equivalent SNP effects model  and equations were derived for additive genetic parameters as functions of parameters in the model and allele frequencies  for EBV for purebred and crossbred performances as functions of estimated effects in the model and allele frequencies  and for accuracies of EBV as functions of allele frequencies and submatrices of the inverse of the coefficient matrix of the mixed model equations. The methods were used to analyse a data set of BF  CONF  ADG and FCR measured on Duroc and DLY pigs. The model in this paper includes both additive and dominance genotypic effects  which are allowed to differ between purebred and crossbred animals  but correlated. The estimates of correlation between additive genotypic effects    were large for all traits  but in all cases lower than 1. In this study  the environments were the same for purebreds and crossbreds  and based on these results  it is possible to speculate whether the functional additive genetic effects are the same in purebreds and crossbreds. However  the markers included in the model are probably not the causal loci  and differences in linkage equilibrium between markers and causal loci between lines would result in a correlation lower than 1  even if the functional additive genetic effects at causal loci were the same. For BF  CONF and FCR  correlations between dominance genotypic effects    were about 1  whereas for ADG it was - 0.71. The negative correlation estimate for ADG is puzzling  although it has to be taken into account that the standard error on the estimate was large. For BF  FCR and ADG  the additive genetic variance was smaller for purebred performance than for crossbred performance. This may be related to a difference in how purebred and crossbred pigs were selected for entering the test station: crossbred pigs were selected randomly from litters (about 4 pigs from each litter) from sires with a low  medium or high index  whereas purebred pigs were selected among litter mates (1–2 pigs from a litter) from litters with a high index by the owners of the nucleus herds. The owners of the nucleus herds had clear economic interests in having the best performing boars at the test station. Therefore  the selection of purebred pigs entering the test station was not random  and very likely this selection was not independent of the phenotypic records observed in the study  which likely resulted in a reduced genetic variation  in particular for ADG. Guo et al. [] analysed BF and ADG in DanBred Duroc using a model with additive and dominance genetic effects  and obtained estimates of additive genetic variances equal to 0.342 mm for BF and 0.000828 kg for ADG. This estimate of the additive genetic variance for BF was about four times larger than the estimate reported in our paper  which is a substantial difference. However  the estimate of the residual variance in Guo et al. [] was about twice as large as that found here  and they used data over a longer time span  which were recorded both at the test station Bøgildgaard and at a number of nucleus herds. They also did not correct for weight at recording. All together  this results in a larger variability of their measures  and  therefore  the difference in genetic variance may make sense. Regarding the estimate of additive genetic variance parameter for ADG  the estimate in Guo et al. [] was substantially smaller than that reported here  which may make sense since their estimate of residual variance was also much smaller than ours and since the trait ADG in Guo et al. [] was standardised to the weight interval 30 to 100 kg. The estimated additive genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performances    in our study ranged from 0.75 for ADG to 0.96 for BF  which in general are larger than averages of estimates for similar traits reported in the literature (see Figure 3 in the review paper by Wientjes and Calus []). In our study  the crossbred and the purebred animals were located in the same production unit at the same time under the same conditions. Thus  one reason for the low correlations reported in other studies could be the difference in environments between purebred and crossbred animals. Another reason may be that the differences in allele frequencies between the studied populations were larger in the other studies than in ours. ADG was the only trait for which there was a statistically significant inbreeding depression effect  and only in the Duroc population. This is not surprising since inbreeding depression is particularly important for traits that have been under strong selection []. For the traits BF  CONF and FCR  accuracies of EBV for Duroc boars for purebred performance were higher than those for crossbred performance  while they were simlar for ADG. Several factors influence accuracy  such as information on relatives and heritability. As mentioned in the Results section  seven of these Duroc boars had Duroc offspring  which increases the accuracies of purebred performance for these boars. More generally  the Duroc boars all had own records on purebred performance  and not on crossbred performance  which increases the accuracies of EBV for purebred performances for all traits. In terms of heritability (see Table )  estimates for BF  CONF and FCR did not differ substantially between purebred performance and crossbred performance  but for ADG the estimate was higher for crossbred performance than for purebred performance. Since high heritability implies high accuracy  the pattern in heritability estimates combined with the fact that these boars had own records on purebred performance  results in the observed pattern of accuracies of EBV. Results on predictive performance based on splitting the data set into training data and validation data were reported by Xiang et al. []  and they showed that including inbreeding depression in the model improved predictive performance of total genotypic effects  whereas including dominance effects did not. For the data set in our paper  an investigation of predictive performance for models with or without inbreeding depression and dominance effects was also attempted  but only one of the differences between models was statistically significant  and the pattern of results was very inconsistent across traits and purebreds and crossbreds; see Additional file . We believe that the small size of the data set could be the cause of these inconsistent results. Although our model contains four genetic effects  it was feasible to fit the model within reasonable time and with reasonable use of computer memory because the data set analysed was relatively small  both in terms of number of animals and number of SNPs. For data sets with a large number of animals  both computing time and memory use may become a challenge for the genotypic model  due to the size and non-sparsity of the system of mixed model equations. For the SNP effects model  we computed accuracies of EBV by inverting the coefficient matrix of the mixed model equations  which was feasible for the data set investigated here  since the number of SNPs was small. For a data set with large number of SNPs  an approximative method  such as that in Tier and Meyer [] would need to be derived and implemented. In general  marker genotypes may not capture all the genetic effects  and it is therefore common practice to add a residual polygenic effect with pedigree-structure into the genomic model  see e.g. Mrode []. For the model considered here  four residual polygenic effects would need to be added to the model  i.e. additive and dominance effects for both the sire line and crossbreds  which would imply a larger computational burden of parameter estimation and prediction of effects. In addition  different types of SNP arrays are often used. In this study  only the SNPs that overlapped between two SNP arrays were used in the analysis  and thus marker genotypes could alternatively have been imputed to the largest SNP array. How the inclusion of a residual polygenic effect in a model interacts with genotype imputation when different SNP arrays are used  would be an interesting topic for future studies. In this paper  only phenotypes and genotypes on the sire line and the three-way crossbred pigs were considered. A more general approach would be to incorporate genotypes and phenotypes on the two maternal lines (in this paper Danbred Yorkshire and Danbred Landrace) and consider these as additional correlated traits  i.e. instead of a bivariate model as used here  a four-variate model would be used. Such a model would be an extension of the model in Christensen et al. [] and Sevillano et al. [] by including dominance and inbreeding depression genetic effects  and would contain a large number of parameters. It should be noted that in Sevillano et al. []  estimation of parameters was not feasible in the full model for computational reasons  and had to be done in two-trait submodels and then combined in an ad hoc manner. Thus an extension of that model by including dominance effects would likely be very computationally demanding in practice. In this paper  we present a model for genomic evaluation in a terminal three-way crossbreeding system when information on the purebred sire line and three-way crossbred pigs is available. This model is a modification of previously reported models  accounts for both additive and dominance genotypic effects  and provides flexibility through genetic correlations for these effects between purebreds and crossbreds. Equations were derived for additive genetic parameters as functions of parameters in the model  allele frequencies  and genotype frequencies  for EBV for purebred and crossbred performances as functions of estimated effects in the model  allele frequencies and genotype frequencies  and for accuracies of EBV as functions of allele frequencies  and genotype frequencies and submatrices of the inverse coefficient matrix in the mixed model equations. The methods presented in this paper will be useful for practical implementation of genomic selection for both purebred and crossbred performances in a three-way crossbreeding system.

Here  we describe how to compute the prediction error variance (PEV) of EBV. For simplicity  the description is focused on PEV of EBV for purebred performance  and the differences for PEV of EBV for crossbred performance are mentioned at the end of the section. The vector of breeding values for purebred performances is defined by . The prediction error variance–covariance matrix is   which can be obtained as a function of the prediction error variance–covariance matrix of SNP effects and inbreeding depression effects as follows. Let  be the inverse of the coefficient matrix in the mixed model equations for the SNP effects model  and extract columns and rows of this matrix corresponding to inbreeding depression effects  additive SNP effects and dominance SNP effects for purebred performance. Then  where the submatrices correspond to columns and rows of matrix  for inbreeding depression effects  additive SNP effects and dominance SNP effects for purebred performances  respectively  and superscript T refers to the transpose of a matrix. From the equation: we obtain where  is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to elements in . For crossbred performance  the prediction error variance–covariance matrix is similar  except that the submatrices of matrix  correspond to inbreeding depression effects  additive genotypic effects and dominance genotypic effects for three-way crossbreds instead of purebred sire line  and the diagonal elements of matrix  are equal to the elements of  as defined in Eq.

They provide high-quality  high-resolution genotypes in a time- and cost-efficient manner. The software is freely available at . Genotyping by next-generation sequencing has emerged as a rapid  high-throughput approach to obtain high-density genotypes in large populations [  ]. The downside of this approach is that confident assignment of individual genotypes requires costly deep sequencing  which restricts its application for large association panels. Cost-efficient approaches  such as reduced-representation sequencing (RRS; []) and genotype imputation from low-coverage sequencing data [   ]  have been developed to reduce the cost of genotyping large populations. While RRS reduces the cost by sequencing only a fraction of the genome without losing confidence in individual calls  the genotype imputation approach is designed for low-coverage sequence data and subsequent genotype imputation against a set of selected high-confidence haplotypes either from external reference individuals or from haplotypes reconstructed in the low-coverage sequenced individuals. Compared to RRS  genotype imputation can provide high-confidence genome-wide genotypes at a similar cost  which makes it a compelling approach for a wide range of applications [    ]. Several algorithms have been developed for genotype imputation based on low-coverage sequencing data. Some were developed for general pedigrees and data  while others were targeted for more specific applications  resulting in variation in their performances depending on how well underlying assumptions about the data are met. In populations with unrelated individuals  the individual genomes are often assumed to consist of short mosaics of ancestral haplotypes. Examples of software that have been developed for genotype imputation in such applications include Beagle []  MaCH []  and Shapeit2 [  ]. These software perform well for their intended applications but lose considerable performance when applied to data with ultra-low coverage (<<U+2009>1×) from experimental populations []. In such populations  relatedness of the individuals results in the segregation of longer haplotypes. By developing methods that account for these relationships  much lower sequence coverage (<<U+2009>0.1×) is required to resolve  for example  the founder genome mosaics that are inherited by the offspring from the mating of two inbred parents [    ]. Multiple methods and software exist for analyses of such ultra-low coverage sequencing data in intercrosses between pairs of inbred founders  including FSFHap []  LB-impute []  and TIGER []. This principle has also been successfully extended to populations that are founded by multiple inbred parents  with implementations in software such as Mpimpute [] and Reconstruct []. There is a dearth of alternatives for analysing data from populations that were bred by mating two or more outbred (heterozygous) founders. For such populations  both genotype imputation and inference of founder mosaics in the offspring are more challenging due to the unobserved phases in the pedigree founders. A software useful for genotype imputation in such data is STITCH []  which can perform this task by using ultra-low coverage data in both unrelated and pedigreed populations. To reconstruct founder mosaics for linkage and QTL mapping  even fewer options exist because the methods developed for inbred populations described above [       ] are not immediately applicable for such populations. Recently  a method was reported to perform such reconstruction while allowing for heterozygosity of parents and offspring in both bi- and multiparental populations []. However  the accompanying software that implements the algorithm (magicImpute) requires a commercial platform. A recent article [] describes an algorithm for calling  phasing  and imputation of genotypes from low-coverage sequence data in pedigreed populations using single-locus peeling  multi-locus peeling  and hybrid peeling  but the performance of the accompanying software  AlphaPeel was not evaluated here since it was published after this paper was completed. Here  we report an approach and its associated software that facilitates cost- and time-efficient inference of founder mosaic genotypes in experimental crosses from outbred (heterozygous) founders using very low coverage (<<U+2009>0.5×) sequencing data. Although our approach has several similarities to earlier methods that were developed for inbred populations from bi-parental crosses  and uses one of these in part of the implemented pipeline  it provides extensions that are essential for the efficient estimation of founder mosaics in outbred crosses with multiple segregating founders. The properties of our method were illustrated by re-genotyping an F intercross [  ] between the Virginia lines of broiler chickens that were divergently selected for body weight [  ]. Our results demonstrate that this method provides high-quality genome-wide founder mosaic genotypes with crossover events that were estimated with greater resolution and at a lower cost than that of reduced representation approaches based on a few hundred selected and individually genotyped genetic markers. When an F intercross population is founded by intercrossing multiple outbred founders from two parental lines  the population can be divided into nuclear families with one F offspring and four F parents. The genomes of the offspring in each of these nuclear full-sib families will be mosaics of the eight haplotypes of the four F founders  as illustrated in Fig. . The linkage phases in the F genomes are  however  unknown  which means that the line origin of the alleles in the F offspring cannot be inferred with confidence in regions of the genome where the F founders are heterozygous (Fig. ). Using whole-genome sequencing  markers can be detected where the divergent founders are fixed for alternative alleles (Fig. ). Using these markers only  the founder mosaic genotypes in the entire F intercross generation can be imputed efficiently  one F full-sib nuclear family at a time. In the following sections  we describe in detail the approach that is outlined in Fig. . It is implemented in a freely available software pipeline that can be downloaded at . Reconstruction of the founder mosaic genotypes in an F individual from a multi-parent F–F family with outbred (heterozygous) founders  using low-coverage sequence data. Informative markers (blue/yellow large font) are identified based on their fixation for alternative alleles in the pairs of deep-coverage sequenced F founders from the divergent lines (HWS1 and HWS2 vs. LWS1 and LWS2) in the family. Blue and yellow bars represent chromosomes that originate from the high (yellow) and low (blue) founder lines  respectively. Uninformative markers that segregate in at least one founder (black small font) are discarded from further analyses. The F1 individuals used as parents for the intercross (F2) offspring do not need to be sequenced  as they are heterozygous for all selected informative markers. The F individuals are sequenced to low-coverage and the reads are mapped to the selected informative markers. Then the founder mosaic genotypes (illustrated for one autosome by the blue and yellow bars) are inferred across the genome using the read mappings to the within-family informative markers using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) developed for this task for inbred line crosses [] A more detailed  step-by-step description of the approach to estimate the founder mosaic genotypes outlined in Fig.  is provided below. Individual-based sequencing libraries were prepared for the F and F individuals. Founder individuals were sequenced to high coverage for SNP calling (15–30×<U+2009>recommended) and intercross individuals to low-coverage (~<U+2009>0.5×<U+2009>recommended). Using the high-coverage sequence data on the F individuals  markers fixed for alternative alleles in the divergent founders of each full-sib family (within-family informative markers) were identified across the genome. These markers are highlighted as large capital letters in yellow (HWS informative) and blue (LWS informative) in Fig.   and contrasted with the larger number of non-informative markers (small  black letters). A computationally-efficient pipeline was implemented for read calling at the within-family informative markers in the offspring from the low-coverage sequence data (Fig. ). First  each individual fastq file was mapped to the reference genome using “bwa mem” with default parameters. Second  the bam file was indexed and filtered using “samtools view –bh –q30 –f 0x02” to include only reads for which both pairs are uniquely mapped to the reference genome. Third  bcftools was used to obtain the number of reference and alternative allele calls using “mpileup -Oz”. Finally  a custom python script was used to reformat the obtained output to VCF format and merge the data from all individuals into a single file. This procedure was implemented in a Python snake make pipeline that is publicly available with our software release (). The founder mosaic genotypes were identified independently for each nuclear full-sib family  including four F  two F and one F individuals  using the polymorphism data obtained by mapping the low-coverage reads from the F (Step 3) to the set of founder-line informative SNPs that were identified for the family (Step 2). Because all of these markers were fixed for alternative alleles in the founder lines  the dataset resembles that of an inbred population. Therefore  the founder-line mosaic genotypes of the intercross individuals in the family can be estimated using existing software developed for such populations (Fig. ). Our pipeline uses an adapted version of the TIGER software [] for this task. Full details regarding the model parameters and estimation procedures in TIGER are in Rowan et al. []  which describes the algorithm and software. In short  the algorithm consists of the following steps: (i) translate the ratio of reads of the alternative alleles at each scored marker into one of six possible genotype states (HH  HU  HL  LL  LU  UU  where H represents one parental line  U represents unknown and L represents another line); (ii) estimate the ratio of reads to the two founders lines by averaging the read scores across 200 (for large chromosomes) or 50 (for small chromosomes) consecutive markers to calculate transmission and emission probabilities; and (iii) run the HMM to impute the genotypes at the markers along the chromosomes and reconstruct the founder mosaic genotypes. Here  we used chromosome-specific HMM  which differed from the original TIGER [] algorithm in which the same HMM was used for all chromosomes of an individual. This modification was implemented to account for uneven lengths of the chromosomes in chickens and for uneven marker densities in the outbred population. The complete analysis pipeline outlined in Steps 2 to 4 was implemented in a user-friendly pipeline manager Snakemake []. A detailed tutorial with instructions on installation  configuration  and launching of the analysis on demo data is available in the Github repository (). In addition  an R package was developed and released that: (i) facilitates reformatting the founder mosaic structure into a recombination mosaic matrix  where every recombination in the offspring is tagged; (ii) performs initial quality control (QC) of the data and removal of double crossover events; and (iii) exports the genotype data across bins of the desired physical length and into R/qtl format for further quality control and downstream linkage and/or QTL mapping analyses (). Data from a reciprocal F intercross between chickens from two divergently selected lines  obtained by bidirectional selection for body weight at 56 days of age (here referred to as the high weight selected “HWS” and low weight selected “LWS” lines) [    ]  were used to illustrate the properties of the proposed method. The base population for the lines was founded by crossing seven partially inbred lines of White Plymouth Rock chickens. The F population of the intercross was generated by mating 10 males and 17 females from the HWS to 8 males and 21 females from the LWS line. These F founders were from HWS and LWS generation 40. To generate the F  8 males and 72 females from the F were mated [  ]. Our analysis included 837 pedigreed F individuals with DNA available for sequence library preparation  and the 56 F founders (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>27 and n<U+2009>=<U+2009>29) that contributed to these F individuals. Libraries for high-coverage sequencing of the 56 F founders contributing to the F offspring in the pedigree were prepared using Illumina TrueSeq and sequences obtained by paired-end sequencing (2<U+2009>×<U+2009>150 bp) on an Illumina HiSeq X (performed by the SciLifeLab SNP&SEQ Technology platform; Uppsala  Sweden). Mapping  SNP calling  and quality control followed the Broad best practices. Reads were mapped to the chicken reference genome (galgal5; []) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA–MEM v. 0.7.13 []). Aligned reads were sorted and duplicate reads marked with picard (v. 2.0.1; ). Base quality score recalibration (GATK 3.7) was carried out before SNP calling with HaplotypeCaller (GATK 3.7). Variants were filtered using the following criteria  a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.043  and AC and QUAL values greater than 5 and 30  respectively  which resulted in a high-quality set of SNPs for further analyses. A -based protocol [] for low-cost and high-throughput preparation of individual sequencing libraries (~<U+2009>1€/library) was optimized for large-scale genotyping of the F intercross individuals in the pedigree. Genomic DNA was fragmented using tagmentation by  transposase from AddGene (; ID60240) []. Dual indexes were attached during PCR amplification and subsequent size selection was performed using AMPure XP beads (Beckman: A63881). The detailed procedure for library preparation  pooling and quality control is described in Zan and Carlborg []. Sequencing of intercross individuals was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 4000. First  the two largest F full-sib families (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>32) were sequenced to<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.8×<U+2009>coverage to test the quality of the prepared libraries and the implemented pooling strategy (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Genomics Core). The remaining F individuals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>805) were then sequenced to<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.4×<U+2009>coverage by pooling<U+2009>~<U+2009>200 multiplexed individuals per lane (Texas A&M Genomics and Bioinformatics Service). Demultiplexing of the dual indexed reads into individual fastq files and trimming of the adapters were done using  v2.17.1.14 (Illumina  Inc). The low-coverage sequence data from the F individuals were mapped to the  V5.0 reference genome [] using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner []. Only reads for which both pairs were uniquely mapped (mapping quality<U+2009>=<U+2009>30) were retained. Mpileup in Samtools 1.8 [] was used to extract the raw information at each polymorphic site (depth and SNP read). A custom Python script was used to reformat the output such that it contained only information about the location of the polymorphism (chromosome and position)  the genotype (reference and alternative allele call)  and the read depth (). This procedure for calling genotypes reduced the time for computation to less than 1/10 of that of the GATK UnifiedGenotyper. First  individuals with few called SNPs (genome wide average<U+2009><<U+2009>5 SNPs/Mb) were removed from the dataset. This was necessary because accurate genome-wide haplotype mosaic reconstruction requires a reasonably high marker density. Nearby double recombination events are biologically unlikely due to crossover interference. Cytological evidence suggests crossover interference to be absolute in regions shorter than 5 Mb on the largest chicken chromosomes []. The raw TIGER [] reconstructed haplotype mosaics were filtered to remove double recombination events that were closer than 3 Mb since these are biologically most unlikely. Sample mix-ups  DNA contaminations  and pedigree errors in the data can lead to inaccurate haplotype mosaic reconstruction and increase the number of inferred genome-wide crossover events in affected individuals. To filter out such individuals  we deleted samples for which the genome-wide genotype call rate decreased to less than 90% after removing short (<<U+2009>3 Mb) double recombination events. An alternative approach would be to remove individuals that were outliers in the distribution of genome-wide recombination events that were inferred using TIGER []. This would lead to a very similar final set of individuals (see Additional file : Figure S1). Quality of the reconstructed line origin haplotype mosaics from the low-coverage whole-genome sequence data across chromosomes 1 to 24 was evaluated by comparing them to the individual genotypes of SNPs reported previously []. In total  728 of the individuals that passed our quality control filtering had genotypes at 279 of the SNPs that were reported in Wahlberg et al. [] and that were successfully mapped from the galGal3 to the galGal5 genome assembly. The markers that were fully informative for founder-line origin were identified in each F family  ranged in number from 101 to 140 between families  and were used in this evaluation. For our approach  the genotypes—high weight homozygous (HH)  heterozygous (HL)  low weight homozygous (LL)—were extracted from the inferred founder mosaics at a 1-Mb resolution. Bins with TIGER imputed recombination events were excluded from the comparisons. The proportions of genotypes in agreement between the two methods per marker across individuals and across all markers per individual were used as measures of genotyping accuracy (). Properties of the reported approach to infer founder mosaic genotypes in intercross data from outbred (heterozygous) founders were illustrated by generating and analysing data for an F population that was bred from the Virginia chicken lines divergently selected for high (HWS) and low (LWS) body weight. High coverage (~<U+2009>30×) individual sequence data detected 7 608 483 SNPs among the HWS and LWS founders (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>27 and n<U+2009>=<U+2009>29) that contributed to the F individuals. There were 213 946 SNPs that were fixed for alternative alleles in the sequenced individuals from the two founder lines and these were unevenly distributed across the genome (see Additional file : Figure S2). The numbers of SNPs that were informative within families  i.e. that were fixed for alternative alleles between the HWS and LWS founders of the individual nuclear F to F full-sib families were considerably larger  i.e. on average 840 160 SNPs per family  and were relatively evenly distributed across the genome. Thus  the average density of informative SNPs in the genome was 791 SNPs/Mb with  on average  92% of the genomes being covered by more than 10 such SNPs per Mb in the evaluated families (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Figure S2).

The black and red lines represent the total number of markers that segregate in the pedigree and the average number of informative markers in the 73 families in the Virginia lines F pedigree  respectively.  Distribution of the average number of markers that are informative for founder line per Mb in the 73 families (x-axis; log transformed) Sequence libraries were prepared for 837 F individuals from the intercross of the Virginia chicken lines [  ]. Individuals that failed in the library preparation (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>34)  or that had a low SNP coverage (<<U+2009>5 SNPs/Mb; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>14)  were removed. The average sequence coverage for the remaining 789 individuals was 0.33×  which resulted in an average of 22.4% of the within-family informative SNPs (188 520  on average) having at least one mapped read within the F to F families. Whole-genome genotypes were imputed for the 789 F individuals by analysing each F to F family  in turn  with the software pipeline that we described above. Overall  the founder mosaic genotypes that were estimated with our method were in good agreement with the available SNP genotypes. After quality control  including removal of individuals with (i) biologically unlikely numbers of recombination events  and (ii) genotypes resulting from inferred recombination events at locations that were physically too close  the agreement between imputed genotypes using our pipeline and the previously assayed SNP genotypes in Wahlberg et al. [] was strong. On average it reached 0.95 across the genome/individual and 0.96 per genotyped SNP across the population (Fig. a  b). Distribution of agreements between genotypes estimated by individual SNP genotyping [] and the founder mosaic genotypes obtained from the approach reported here across  all markers by individual and  all individuals by marker Figure  shows the comparison of the founder mosaic genotypes that were estimated from the low-coverage sequencing data with the method described here  with the Haley-Knott genotype probabilities [] from Wahlberg et al. [] for one F individual across chromosome 1. At 95.7% of the marker locations  the estimated founder mosaic genotype agreed well with the estimated genotype probabilities in Wahlberg et al. []. In addition  the sequence-based imputation provided much denser genome coverage (Fig. a vs. b). As a result  estimates of the locations of recombination breakpoints were better resolved  with 50% of them being identified on segments shorter than 10 kb (one example in Fig. c). The higher marker density also allowed imputation of genotypes in regions that were not covered by the set of microsatellite markers selected by Wahlberg et al. []. This  for example  makes it possible to resolve heterozygous regions that are flanked by homozygous regions that are agreed upon by both methods (blue in Fig. b). It also suggests longer putative double recombinant regions in the genome that were missed by the sparser marker set (yellow in Fig. b). Similarity between the founder mosaic genotypes inferred from low-coverage sequence data and genotype probabilities estimated from sparse individual genotypes across chromosome 1 for one F2 chicken [].  Genotype probabilities estimated by Wahlberg et al. [] using the algorithm described by Haley et al. [] provided at the locations of the 74 SNPs and microsatellite markers genotyped in this pedigree.

Genotype probabilities inferred from SNP and microsatellite data and our pipeline are illustrated as coloured bars  where red/purple indicate homozygous/heterozygous for the HWS allele  respectively In this paper  we describe an approach and software for estimating founder mosaic genotypes in experimental crosses between outbred (heterozygous) founders from very low-coverage sequencing data. Its properties are illustrated by generating and analysing data from an F population that was produced by crossing chicken lines that were divergently selected for body weight from a common founder population. We compared our approach with another genotype imputation software  STITCH []. The imputed genotypes from STITCH [] (run with n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and K<U+2009>=<U+2009>10)  were relatively consistent with the available individual SNP genotypes (0.88/0.90 agreement for markers/individuals) and similar to those obtained with our approach before removing individuals with biologically unrealistic numbers of double-recombination events (0.90/0.89 agreement for markers/individuals). In addition to imputation accuracy  we evaluated the quality of the reconstructed founder haplotypes. As STITCH was not developed for direct estimation of founder mosaic haplotypes for QTL mapping and linkage analyses  the haplotype mosaic reconstruction was performed using custom scripts  using the single marker genotypes imputed by STITCH. Results showed that mosaics estimated from the STITCH data included an excess of recombination events [for an example (see Additional file : Figure S3)]. Thus  although both softwares deliver similar quality of imputed genotypes when pedigree and genotypes of founders are disregarded  when such information is available  our pipeline makes use of it to further improve genotyping quality and to estimate accurate founder mosaic genotypes in the intercross individuals. However  our software does not account for more complex crossbreeding structures that use more than two founder populations (such as MAGIC)  thus making STITCH currently the best option for such datasets. Accounting for available pedigree information allows additional quality control to be performed based on the inferred number of recombination events after the founder mosaic genotypes have been estimated. First  the number of estimated crossover events across the genome should agree with its expectation given the length of the chicken linkage map [  ]. Second  the distances between inferred recombination events should be compatible with expectations regarding crossover interference [] (Fig. ). Before conducting this quality control  there was good agreement (~<U+2009>0.90) between the genotypes inferred by our approach and by STITCH using the low-coverage sequence data  and the individual SNP genotypes of Wahlberg et al. []. Applying filters based on these two expectations increased the level of agreement for our approach from 0.90 to 0.95 at the individual level. In addition  this allowed us to identify individuals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>61 or equivalent to 7%) with extremely high estimated recombination frequencies that are likely due to errors in either the recorded pedigree or mix-ups during sample preparation. Our proposed strategy to reconstruct the founder mosaic haplotype structure using low-coverage sequencing data provides more genotyping information than classical approaches at a considerably lower cost. The founders of the pedigree were sequenced to a high coverage by using standard approaches  while F individuals were processed by a low-cost whole-genome sequencing protocol to facilitate low-coverage sequencing of hundreds of intercross individuals (<<U+2009>10 €/individual  including library preparation and sequencing). This cost is lower than that of existing strategies for genotyping individuals for a few hundred SNPs  even when accounting for the cost of high-coverage sequencing of the large (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>56) number of founder birds in our pedigree. In addition to the lower cost  there was a considerable increase in marker density  from a few hundred to several hundred thousands of imputed segregating sites across the genome. Using pedigree information  founder mosaic genotypes can be efficiently constructed by applying approaches that were previously developed for recombinant inbred populations [  ]. Compared to methods that were developed for estimating founder mosaics from sparsely genotyped SNPs  such as the Haley and Knott approach []  here  the high-density marker facilitated more precise estimation of recombination breakpoints  resulting in 50% of the recombination breakpoints being estimated to fall within 10-kb windows. Performance of the TIGER software for estimating recombination breakpoints has been thoroughly evaluated for inbred populations in []  using simulations and experimental validation. Rowan et al. [] reported that the individual recombination breakpoints were  in more than 90% of the cases  resolved down to 2 kb at an even lower sequence coverage than that used in our study (0.1×). Here  we found a lower resolution of the estimated breakpoints because our founders were from an outbred population  which resulted in a lower density of informative markers that were unevenly distributed across the genome. If required  it is possible to increase the resolution of recombination events by (i) also analytically tracing the makers that are fixed in two of the four F founders from one line but segregating in the two F founders from the other line (which here would increase the number of informative markers by<U+2009>~<U+2009>20%)  or (ii) deeper sequencing  to obtain reads at a larger proportion of the markers that are informative between the two founder lines (Fig. a) and (see Additional file : Figure S2a). However  in practice the proposed genotyping strategy is for linkage and QTL mapping of experimental crosses between outbred (heterozygous) founders. In this case  the resolution of the QTL mapping and linkage map construction is mainly limited by the actual number of recombination events in the population rather than the precision with which they are estimated  which makes marker coverage less of a concern. However  deeper sequence coverage and analytical strategies that use all types of segregating markers should be useful for future developments in which estimation of recombination events with high precision is important such as  for example  in analyses of deep intercross pedigrees  which include many more recombination events. There was no obvious increase in the accuracy of the reconstructed founder mosaic genotypes after sequence coverage reached 0.05× (see Additional file : Figure S4). This suggests that sequencing to a lower depth than used here (0.4<U+2009>×) would have been sufficient to reach an acceptable accuracy for this population. Thus  costs could be reduced even more  without significant loss in accuracy  by lowering the sequencing coverage. On high yield sequencing platforms this would  for many species  require more unique index combinations than the 398 that are currently available for the Illumina sequencers. Genetic divergence of the outbred founders is an important factor to be considered for determining sequencing depth. Here  the founders of the F population were from the same base population and  therefore  due to the expected low genomic divergence between these lines (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Figure S2)  we opted for a high (~<U+2009>30×) coverage to identify most of the SNPs segregating in the populations. We found that 0.03% of all identified SNPs were completely fixed for alternative alleles in the two founder lines and that pairs of F individuals that were mated to generate each nuclear F  F and F family were alternate homozygotes for 10.0 to 13.7% of SNPs. In populations for which the divergence between the founder populations is larger  for example in crosses between wild and domesticated populations  more divergently fixed markers are expected. Obtaining high sequence coverage for the founders is recommended  since it will benefit both the accuracy of the founder mosaics and resolution of the recombination breakpoints by revealing more of the available informative markers. In crosses in which the founder populations are highly divergent  an alternative strategy for genotyping can be considered to reduce sequencing costs. Rather than sequencing individual founders to high coverage  libraries from the founders of each line could be pooled. The two pools  each representing one founder population  can then be sequenced to high coverage (~<U+2009>30×) to identify markers that are fixed (or nearly so) for alternate alleles in the two lines. In our F population  applying this strategy would have reduced the number of informative SNPs for genotype imputation from 840 160 to 213 946. This number of genome-wide SNPs was sufficient for reconstruction of high-quality founder mosaic genotypes. However  the uneven distribution of the informative markers along the genome would likely result in gaps for poorly covered regions (see Additional file : Figure S1). In this regard  our population likely represents an extreme case  because the two selected lines (Fs) were from a common base population founded by crossing seven partially inbred lines of White Polymouth Rock. It is worthwhile noting that while the pooled founder sequencing approach is more efficient for populations with more divergent founders  even in populations with founders from closely-related lines  it is likely still sufficient for the purpose of building high-quality linkage maps and performing genome-wide QTL analyses. In this paper  we propose and evaluate a new method for reconstruction of founder mosaic genotypes from low-coverage genome sequencing in outbred intercrosses. We applied this method to an outbred chicken F cross to illustrate how it provides high-quality  high-resolution genotypes in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Our objective was to implement a random regression model for the evaluation of dairy production traits in French goats.ResultsThe data consisted of milk TD records from 30 186 and 32 256 first lactations of Saanen and Alpine goats. Milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content and protein content were considered. Splines were used to model the environmental factors. The genetic and permanent environmental effects were modeled by the same Legendre polynomials. The goodness-of-fit and the genetic parameters derived from functions of the polynomials of orders 0 to 4 were tested. Results were also compared to those from a lactation model with total milk yield calculated over 250 days and to those of a multiple-trait model that considers performance in six periods throughout lactation as different traits. Genetic parameters were consistent between models. Models with fourth-order Legendre polynomials led to the best fit of the data.

Our objective was to implement a random regression model for the evaluation of dairy production traits in French goats. The data consisted of milk TD records from 30 186 and 32 256 first lactations of Saanen and Alpine goats. Milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content and protein content were considered. Splines were used to model the environmental factors. The genetic and permanent environmental effects were modeled by the same Legendre polynomials. The goodness-of-fit and the genetic parameters derived from functions of the polynomials of orders 0 to 4 were tested. Results were also compared to those from a lactation model with total milk yield calculated over 250 days and to those of a multiple-trait model that considers performance in six periods throughout lactation as different traits. Genetic parameters were consistent between models. Models with fourth-order Legendre polynomials led to the best fit of the data. In order to reduce complexity  computing time  and interpretation  a rank reduction of the variance covariance matrix was performed using eigenvalue decomposition. With a reduction to rank 2  the first two principal components correctly summarized the genetic variability of milk yield level and persistency  with a correlation close to 0 between them. A random regression model was implemented in France to evaluate and select goats for yield traits and persistency  which are independent i.e. no genetic correlation between them  in first lactation. Random regression test-day (TD) models (RRM) are widely used in genetic evaluations of TD milk production in dairy cows but also in other species such as dairy goats [     ]. RRM increase the accuracy of breeding value predictions and fit the variability of environmental effects throughout lactation more accurately []. Besides describing the variability of genetic parameters along the lactation curve  RRM serve to predict estimated breeding values (EBV) for lactation persistency  based on the variation of EBV throughout lactation. A persistent animal is defined as producing on average less milk at the beginning but more at the end of the lactation period than animals with a similar overall production []. Lactation persistency is of interest for dairy producers because the shape of the lactation curve can affect an animal’s nutritional needs  and consequently its health  as well as the distribution of the farm’s milk output during the year [  ]. In a previous study  Arnal et al. [] demonstrated the phenotypic variability of the shape of the dairy goat lactation curves in France  and showed that the main environmental factors influencing curve shapes are breed  kidding month  age at kidding  gestation stage  and length of the dry period. Various functions have been used to model fixed  genetic and permanent environment effects on TD records  including the Wilmink function []  Legendre polynomials [  ]  and splines [  ]. Given that RRM are computationally expensive  Legendre polynomial functions have the computational advantage of reducing the correlations between estimated regression coefficients  which impact the convergence [] of the iterative algorithms used for variance component estimation and genetic evaluation. They are also sufficiently flexible to fit differently shaped curves. With eigen decomposition  it becomes possible to reduce the rank of the resulting variance–covariance matrix by ignoring the contribution of the smallest eigenvalues and eigenvectors [  ]. This decreases computing time by reducing the number of genetic and permanent environment regression coefficients that are estimated. To date  the implementation of RRM in dairy goats has not been studied in France. In this paper  we estimate genetic parameters for milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content  and protein content using RRM with Legendre polynomial functions of different orders  with or without rank reductions  to obtain TD EBV for French dairy goats in first lactation. The data consisted of 193 226 milk TD records from 30 186 first-lactation Saanen goats (234 herds) and 205 841 milk TD records from 32 256 first-lactation Alpine goats (198 herds) from northwestern France  collected between 1995 and 2015. The pedigree consisted of 66 716 and 67 159 Saanen and Alpine goats  respectively. Each lactation included at least four TD between the 7th and 270th day in milk (DIM). Lactation had to last between 180 and 350 days. Goats were milked twice a day and their records were summed to obtain their daily production. More than four animals per herd<U+2009>×<U+2009>test date combination were required. The sires of these goats were artificial-insemination bucks with at least 20 progeny in the dataset  with 379 and 324 sires from the Alpine and Saanen goat breeds  respectively. The dams of the goats had to be known. The traits analyzed were milk  fat and protein yields and fat and protein contents. Five RRM were tested separately for each breed and for all five traits and all had the form: where  is the observation for trait  (milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content  protein content) on day in milk (DIM)  (from 7 to 270 day) of goat  that was pregnant for the past  days ( if not pregnant)  was in production year  (from 1995 to 2015)  belonged to kidding age class  (7 classes [in months]: 9–11  12  13  14  15  16  17 or more)  to kidding period class  (8 classes: January  February  March  April–May–June  July–August–September  October  November  December)  and to herd<U+2009>×<U+2009>test-date class ;  is a herd-test-date fixed effect;  is the fixed effect of year-age at kidding;  is the fixed effect of year-kidding period;  and  are the fixed regression coefficients for age at kidding  kidding period and gestation stage  respectively;  is covariate  at time  of a cubic natural spline function with six knots at ;  is covariate  at time  of a cubic natural spline function with four knots at <U+2009>=<U+2009>31  53 76  and 100 (at  between 0 and 30 day  the coefficients were assumed to be equal to 0  implying that there was no effect of gestation on production; due to scarcity of records  the effect of gestation was considered to be constant after ).  is the set of random additive genetic regression coefficients that follow a normal distribution  for the th term of a Legendre polynomial of order    is the set of random permanent environmental regression coefficients that follow a normal distribution  for the th term of a Legendre polynomial of order    is the value of the th term of the Legendre polynomial at time  and  is the normally-distributed residual term. The model assumed a heterogeneous residual variance along lactation that was considered to be constant within nine classes of DIM (7–36  37–66  67–96  97–126  127–156  157–186  187–216  217–246  247–270)  without between-class correlations. Legendre polynomials of order 0 to 4 ( to ) were tested assuming the same order for both the random genetic and environmental effects. The EBV of a goat for a complete lactation milk yield was obtained by summing the EBV for each DIM (called ) []. Given that the RRM can give an estimation of the shape of the lactation curve for each goat  EBV for persistency (denoted ) was computed as the cumulative deviation in genetic contribution to yield from the DIM 40 to DIM 240 relative to an average animal having the same yield at DIM 40 []. The next step was to test various rank reductions of the genetic variance–covariance matrices based on an eigen decomposition of these matrices. To keep a consistent definition of persistency  the second eigenvector was set  by multiplying by -<U+2009>1  to be systematically negative at the beginning of lactation  and then positive. For a reduction to rank   the first  eigenvectors obtained with the complete model were multiplied by the terms of Legendre polynomial as in Druet et al. [] to obtain the  first eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions were used to model the genetic and permanent environment effects. The Legendre polynomial function of order  with a covariance matrix reduced (RRM*) to rank  is written . The reduced models were of the form: where  is the random additive genetic regression coefficient that follows a normal distribution  for the th eigenfunction of the genetic (co)variances matrix obtained with a th-order Legendre polynomial model reduced to rank    is the random permanent environmental regression coefficient that follows a normal distribution  for the th eigenfunction of the genetic (co)variances matrix obtained with a th-order Legendre polynomial model reduced to rank    is the value of the th eigenfunction of the genetic (co)variances matrix obtained with a th-order Legendre polynomial model reduced to rank  () at DIM . The corresponding EBV for whole lactation performance of goat  from the RRM was obtained by summing its EBV throughout the DIM period (from DIM 7 to DIM 270) (). The evolution of the estimated heritabilities throughout the DIM period and the genetic correlations between DIM that were obtained with RRM were compared to those obtained with a MT model  in which lactation was subdivided into six periods (1<U+2009>=<U+2009>[7  45]  2<U+2009>=<U+2009>[46  90]  3<U+2009>=<U+2009>[91  135]  4<U+2009>=<U+2009>[136  180]  5<U+2009>=<U+2009>[181  225]  6<U+2009>=<U+2009>[226  270]). TD yields and contents for each period  (=<U+2009>1 to 6) were considered as different traits. The frequency of TD recording (on average every 28 or 35 days) implied that only one TD record was performed normally per period but if two TD were carried out  the measures were averaged. The MT model was: where  is the observation for trait  (milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content  protein content) of goat  for period  (<U+2009>=1 to 6)  in subclass  for   the age at kidding effect  subclass  for   the month at kidding effect  subclass  for   the gestation stage effect at DIM 270 (the last DIM studied)  and class  for the herd-year (HY) effect. The fixed effects classes are the same as in the previous RRM.  is the additive genetic breeding value of animal  for period  and followed a normal distribution . We implemented a lactation (LACT) model that was close to that routinely used for official genetic evaluations in France. The total milk  fat and protein yields throughout lactation were calculated as in routine genetic evaluations using the Fleischmann method []. Fat and protein contents were derived from the total lactation yields. The genetic evaluation model based on these phenotypes was: where  was the lactation observation for trait  (milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content  protein content) of goat   in subclass  for   the age at kidding effect  subclass  for   the month at kidding effect  subclass  for   the gestation stage effect at DIM 270 (the last DIM studied)  and class  for herd-year effect (). Fixed effects were defined as in the previous RRM.  was the additive genetic breeding value of animal  and followed a normal distribution (mean:   variance is ). All the genetic parameters were estimated using the WOMBAT software []. For each trait  the heritability of the th regression coefficients () was calculated as in Schaeffer []  by dividing the genetic variance of the th regression coefficient by the sum of the genetic variance of the th regression coefficient  the permanent environment variance of the th regression coefficient  and the mean square error. For each trait  the genetic variance–covariance matrix between all DIM was obtained following Druet et al. [] as   where  is a 264-by-264 genetic variance–covariance matrix   is a 264-by- matrix with the (daily) values of the  terms of the Legendre polynomial  and  is the -by- genetic variance–covariance matrix. The same approach was used to obtain the permanent environmental variance–covariance matrix . The phenotypic variance–covariance matrix between all DIM    was obtained by summing    and the residual variance for the relevant DIM. Heritabilities for each test day were obtained by dividing the diagonal elements of  by the corresponding diagonal elements of . The genetic correlations between DIM  and the other DIM were derived from . Genetic variances for each trait throughout the whole lactation ( were obtained following Hammami et al. [] as   where  is a summation vector (vector of 1 s) of length 264. The same approach was used to obtain the permanent environmental ( and phenotypic variances for the whole lactation . The heritability of each trait on the lactation scale () was obtained by dividing  by . The goodness-of-fit of the models for each trait was assessed by comparing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Pearson correlation coefficients () between observed and predicted phenotypes for each model. Pearson correlation coefficients were also used to compare the EBV of the bucks obtained from different models. In the Eigen decomposition of the genetic matrix from the  model  the first two principal components (PC) represented on average more than 97% of the total genetic variance (88 and 9%  respectively)  and Additional file : Table S1 shows the percentage of variance represented by each PC for the five traits and the two breeds. The proportion of variance accounted for by the first eigenvalue was higher for yield traits and fat content in Saanen than in Alpine goats (from +<U+2009>2% for fat content to +<U+2009>4.5% for fat yield). In contrast  the proportion of variance accounted for by the third eigenvalue was higher in Alpine than in Saanen goats  although for all the traits it represented a very small fraction of the total variance (less than 4.2%). The first eigenfunction was almost constant throughout the DIM period  which suggests that the first PC can be regarded as linked with the average production level throughout lactation  whereas the second PC varied almost linearly  which indicates extreme production levels at the beginning and end of lactation independently of the average production level  and thus it is associated with persistency. The correlations between these measures of average production level throughout lactation and persistency are equal to 0 by construction. The third eigenfunction showed contrasted production characteristics between those measured in the middle of lactation and those measured at the beginning and end of lactation. We found no significant between-trait differences in the shapes of eigenfunctions  see Additional file : Figure S1 that shows the eigenfunctions of each PC for the five traits in the Saanen breed. Table  shows the BIC values for each trait and both breeds with the five complete models ( to ) and the five reduced models ( with  and ). Regardless of trait and breed  BIC decreased rapidly as the order of the Legendre polynomials increased from 0 to 2. The decay was smaller between orders 2 and 4 although 18 additional parameters had to be estimated. However  the differences between all models were significant (difference in BIC<U+2009>><U+2009>10)  which indicates that  for all traits and both breeds  the fit to the data improved as the order of the Legendre polynomial used increased. As rank decreased  BIC decreased when the first three PC were kept instead of just the first two  without significant differences between  and . Regardless of the order of the Legendre polynomial  the BIC obtained by using two eigenfunctions of the genetic (co)variances matrix with model  were close and often better (i.e. smaller) than with model   with the same number of estimated parameters. The BIC obtained by using three eigenfunctions () was similar and better than that with   again with the same number of estimated parameters. Pearson correlation coefficients (<U+03C1>) between observed data and predicted values were calculated to compare adjustment to data between traits and breeds and between RRM and MT models; Additional file : Table S2 presents the evolution of these correlations under the different models  for each trait in both breeds. For RRM  the conclusions drawn were similar to those for BIC. For the fourth-order Legendre polynomial   were high for most traits (~<U+2009>0.96)  but slightly lower for fat content in both breeds (0.93)  which highlights a less satisfactory modeling of this trait than for the others. The MT model was the worst model for all traits  with  values ranging from 0.80 to 0.90  which can be explained by the genetic effect and certain fixed effects being constant throughout each period. With random regression models other than   these effects gradually chance with DIM. The evolution of the residual variance with DIM is another criterion for characterizing the effect of this variation on the quality of the adjustments throughout lactation. In the French dairy goat breeding program  the most important trait for cheese production is protein yield  which can also be expressed as protein content with respect to the level of milk yield. The residual variances for milk yield and protein content for different lactation periods are shown in Fig.  and Additional file : Figure S2  respectively. To keep the figures easy to interpret  the results for the  and  models are not presented  but these were very close to those of the  model. The between-model differences in residual variance are larger at the beginning and end of lactation. As for BIC and   the higher is the order of the polynomial  the better is the adjustment  as indicated by the smaller residual variances. Figure  and Additional file : Figure S2 illustrate the better adjustment obtained with  compared to the other models  at both ends of lactation.  resulted in smaller residual variances than   particularly at the beginning (DIM 7–45) and end of lactation (DIM 225–270) (results not shown). For clarity  the residuals of the reduced models derived from  and  were not included in the figures but were close to those from . Overall  the RRM* adjustments were systematically much better than for the model that assumes a constant genetic value throughout lactation (). For model fit  similar results were found for the other traits in both breeds. Evolution of residual variances with DIM for milk yield in Alpine goats Model  was chosen as the reference model for RRM because it resulted in a better fit to the data  but it is also the most complicated model in terms of number of genetic parameters to estimate. However   and  appear too simplistic. In order to choose a robust model that is sufficiently manageable for large-scale routine evaluations (after extension to all lactations)  we chose the  model as an attractive compromise  since it derived from the best RRM and its interpretation was straightforward  i.e. it summarized two important lactation characteristics (average level and persistency). The third PC was considered less relevant because it accounted for much less variance. These different RRM (     and ) were compared to a lactation model (LACT) and a MT model for the estimation of genetic parameters. Heritabilities for each trait on the whole lactation () scale were estimated as in Hammami et al. [] with the LACT and different RRM models and were close to 0.3 for milk yield in both breeds and for fat and protein yields in Alpine goats  and slightly higher i.e. 0.34 for protein yield and 0.37 for fat yield in Saanen goats (see Additional file : Table S3). Heritability estimates reached 0.68 for fat content and 0.65 for protein content in Saanen  and 0.75 for fat content and 0.70 for protein content in Alpine goats. We observed no differences in heritability between the RRM for any of the traits. Furthermore  heritabilities estimated with the RRM* were close to those estimated with RRM. For all the traits  heritabilities estimated with the RRM were slightly higher  especially for fat content  than those estimated with the LACT model (0.65 for LACT and 0.75 with  for fat content in the Alpine breed). The heritabilities for the regression coefficients () estimated with the  model as in Schaeffer [] are in Table . These can be interpreted as heritability of average yield (PC1) and persistency of yield (PC2)  respectively. The heritabilities for persistency (PC2) were close to 0.18 for protein content and ~<U+2009>0.10 for the other traits. Figure  shows the evolution of the estimated heritabilities of test day yield throughout the lactation period obtained with the MT model and different RRM models for milk yield in the Saanen breed  i.e.  and   which were the models without and with reduction    which was a model that had the same number of parameters as   and finally . Models  and  yielded the highest heritabilities. The discontinuous curve of the estimated heritability throughout the DIM period is due to the residual variance that was different for each of six 30-day periods in the different RRM. The heritability estimated with the MT model first increased up to a peak in mid-lactation (0.26) and then decreased. However   yielded a lower heritability after DIM 150 for milk yield (due to a larger residual variance)  whereas  resulted in a different pattern with low heritabilities at the beginning but high heritabilities at the end of lactation. Additional file : Figure S3 shows the evolution of the estimated heritabilities throughout the DIM period for protein content in Saanen goats. The comparison between models resulted in similar results for milk yield and protein content  except with  for protein content  which showed a profile closer to that of . Similar results were also observed for the Alpine breed and the other traits. Estimated heritabilities obtained with RRM* were close to those calculated with MT and  models  because their eigenfunctions are neither constant nor linear throughout lactation  unlike those of the  and  models. Estimated daily heritabilities for milk yield in Saanen goats Figure  for the Saanen breed and Additional file : Figure S4 for the Alpine breed present the heritabilities estimates for test days with the  model throughout the lactation period for all five traits and show the same within-breed patterns for the three yield traits. The highest heritability estimated for milk yield was 0.26 in both breeds  and was reached on ~<U+2009>DIM 175 and ~<U+2009>DIM 125 for the Saanen and Alpine breeds  respectively. For component yield traits in the Alpine breed  the highest heritability of 0.23 was reached on ~<U+2009>DIM 125  similar to that for milk yield. For component yield traits in the Saanen breed  the estimated heritabilities were highest  i.e. 0.27 on ~<U+2009>DIM 157 for fat yield and ~<U+2009>DIM 211 for protein yield. For protein and fat contents  the evolution of the heritabilities throughout the DIM period followed the same pattern in both breeds but values were higher in the Alpine breed i.e. 0.45 and 0.57  respectively for fat and protein content on ~<U+2009>DIM 150 versus 0.38 for fat content on ~<U+2009>DIM 106 and 0.51 for protein content on ~<U+2009>DIM 150 in the Saanen breed. Evolution of heritabilities with DIM in Saanen goats with the  model In order to compare the genetic correlations between periods obtained with the MT model and the genetic correlations between DIM obtained with the different RRM models  we selected the median day for each period of the MT model. Figure  and Additional file : Figure S5 show the genetic correlations of milk yield and protein content  respectively  at DIM 111 (i.e. the middle of the third period) with those at other DIM in the Saanen breed with the same models as those used for Fig. . The results are similar for both breeds. With model   which assumes a constant genetic effect throughout lactation  the genetic correlation is equal to 1 between all DIM. This is also implicitly the case for the LACT model  which gives a global EBV for the whole lactation assuming a correlation of 1 between all DIM. The most similar genetic correlations are those estimated with the  and MT models. As observed earlier with BIC   was the best model among all RRM. For all traits  the genetic correlations between any two periods estimated with the MT and RRM models were positive. The lowest correlation i.e. 0.44 was found with the MT model for milk yield in the Alpine breed between periods 1 and 6. The genetic correlations between DIM from the RRM* were fairly aligned to the pattern from the best full-rank model () for all traits and both breeds. Genetic correlations of milk yields between DIM 111 and other DIM in Saanen goats Additional file : Figure S6 and Additional file : Figure S7 show the genetic correlations  estimated with the leg4 model  for all production traits between TD at DIM 40  which corresponds to the DIM at lactation peak  and at the other DIM  in both the Saanen and Alpine breeds. Genetic correlations for milk yield between the peak and the end of lactation were positive  i.e. ~<U+2009>0.5 in the Saanen and ~<U+2009>0.4 in the Alpine breed. In the Alpine breed  daily genetic correlations for fat and protein contents were higher (e.g. a correlation of ~<U+2009>0.7 for protein content between DIM 40 and at the end of lactation) than those for yield traits (e.g. a correlation of ~<U+2009>0.4 for milk yield between DIM 40 and at the end of lactation). For each trait  the genetic correlations between DIM were higher in the Saanen than the Alpine breed (e.g. correlations of ~<U+2009>0.4 (Alpine) and ~<U+2009>0.5 (Saanen) for milk yield between DIM 40 and end of lactation). Table  presents the correlations between EBV for milk yield of bucks that were sires of the phenotyped goats (379 in Alpine and 324 in Saanen) in Saanen under the    and  models. We were able to evaluate the level of milk produced throughout lactation using the  model  or by considering the  and  values  or the first coefficient of RRM () or RRM* (). Correlations between these values reached a value of at least 0.99 for milk yield (Table ) and all other traits  confirming that they characterize the same trait. For the study of persistency  the  and  models were unsuitable because the resulting EBV were not DIM-dependent. Persistency could be evaluated by considering the  value  or the second coefficient of RRM () and RRM* (). A correlation close to 1 was found between the  coefficient of  and  for milk yield in the Saanen breed. The correlation between  and  was 0.98 for milk yield and 0.88 for protein yield. The correlation between  and  was low for milk yield (i.e. 0.15  see Table ) in Saanen and close to 0 in Alpine  but higher for protein content in both breeds (0.45 in Saanen and 0.58 in Alpine) (results not shown). The correlations between  and  from  and  were equal to 0.44  whereas those between  and  were equal to 0.01. The aim is to have a low genetic correlation between the level and the persistency because it allows selection of animals with a desired persistency throughout the lactation without changing the net-total lactation output. Table  reports the correlations between EBV of  (i.e. milk production level) and  (i.e. persistency) for milk yield and of  and  for the other traits for Saanen and Alpine bucks. For levels of production  the correlations between  for milk yield and  for the other traits averaged 0.75 for fat yield  0.89 for protein yield  -<U+2009>0.25 for fat content and around -<U+2009>0.4 for protein content. The correlations between  for milk yield and persistencies of the other traits were moderate (all<U+2009><<U+2009>0.36 in absolute value). The correlations between milk yield persistency and  for the other traits were close to 0 (between -<U+2009>0.14 and 0.18) for both breeds. The correlations between milk persistency and the other persistencies were very high (><U+2009>0.85) for protein and fat yields but very low for fat content (-<U+2009>0.13  on average). However  the correlation with persistency of protein content was negative and relatively high (-<U+2009>0.45 in Saanen and -<U+2009>0.58 in Alpine). These quite high correlations indicate that a higher milk persistency is positively correlated with a higher-than-average protein content at the beginning of lactation. Because the correlation between fat content persistency and milk yield persistency was low (-<U+2009>0.10 in Saanen and -<U+2009>0.17 in Alpine) and because protein content at the beginning of lactation was higher than average  persistency is correlated with a reduced fat:protein ratio at the beginning of lactation. As expected  the correlations of EBV between  and  for milk yield and  and  for the other traits (not shown) were very close to those obtained in Table . This result confirms that  is a measure of lactation production and  is a measure of persistency. Figure  and Additional file : Figure S8 show the relative contribution to lactation production of a change of one standard deviation in the  (level) and  (slope) coefficients for milk yield and protein content  respectively  with . An increase of one genetic standard deviation for  leads to an increased production level throughout lactation  with a higher increase at the end of lactation for Saanen compared to Alpine goats. This study on the one-standard-deviation increase of  and  allows to analyze the potential result of a selection on these two traits. As a consequence of the one-standard-deviation increase of   the sum of the added daily milk productions represents 76 kg of milk for Saanen and 71.1 kg for Alpine goats  which is relatively consistent with the  model (genetic standard deviation equal to 92 kg in Saanen and 85 kg in Alpine goats). At the beginning of lactation  increasing the persistency () by one standard deviation reduces production by 12.9 kg until DIM 129 and then increases it by 10.5 kg at the end of the lactation for Saanen. For protein content  a gain of one standard deviation of  increases average production more in Alpine than in Saanen goats. A loss of one standard deviation in protein content persistency leads to an increase of 1 g/kg at the beginning of lactation and a loss of 1 g/kg at the end of lactation. Contribution to daily milk yield of one genetic standard deviation for PC1 and PC2 As an illustration  Fig.  displays the genetic daily EBV added to the average standard production curve  for two extreme-value goats for global production level and two extreme-value goats for milk yield persistency. Additional file : Figure S9 shows the same results but for protein yield. Genetic value of extreme Alpine goats for milk yield added to the mean production curve ( expressed in standard deviation;  expressed in standard deviation) We estimated various genetic parameters in a large population of goats that had been regularly measured for five major dairy traits throughout lactation since 1995. This estimation was done by using a random regression model for the first time in France for the two main goat breeds Alpine and Saanen  which represent 97% of the goats recorded in France. Connectedness between the large number of herds was ensured by using phenotypes from daughters of sires from artificial insemination (379 and 324 in the Alpine and Saanen breed  respectively). The fixed effects  i.e. age at kidding  month of kidding  dry-period length and gestation stage  were modeled with splines in the RRM model. In a previous study []  we showed that these factors had an impact on the shape of the lactation curve  and that there was no interaction between these effects and year of lactation. These results were consistent with other studies in dairy cows [  ]. Unlike other studies in dairy goats [  ]  we did not use an effect on litter size since this information was not available in our dataset  but Mucha et al. [] found no impact of this effect on EBV. We applied a principal component analysis of the variance–covariance matrix of the most complex model  which showed that it was possible to associate biological significance with each PC. As in our study  van der Werf et al. []  Olori et al. []  Druet et al. [] and Togashi and Lin [] highlighted that the first eigenfunction was linked with the average production level throughout lactation  the second eigenfunction was associated with persistency  and the third eigenfunction opposed production around the middle of lactation against production at the beginning and end of lactation. The high percentages of variances explained by the first three PC (and even the two first PC)  and the desire to reduce the overall dimension of the model in routine evaluations  pointed at the need to test a rank reduction of the variance–covariance matrix. Implementing a RRM for genetic evaluation requires cumbersome testing of the best tradeoffs between model fit and complexity. Pool et al. [] compared the residual variances of different RRM on cow data and found  as we did here  that the most suitable model for TD milk production traits was . The use of other criteria (BIC and Pearson correlation coefficients) also confirmed that  was the most suitable model for TD milk production traits. The  reductions (for ) had a better fit to the data than  although  reductions led to a better adjustment to the data compared to other more concise models such as  and   especially for milk yield. This rank reduction facilitates the extension of the model to subsequent lactations 2 and 3 in order to construct a genetic evaluation. Indeed  this model extension has to take into account how genetic correlations between first and following parities will probably differ from 1 (around 0.7 for milk yield) as found by several studies in dairy goats [  ]. For all traits  heritability estimates from the  model and for the regression coefficients from RRM and RRM* were close to those reported by Rupp et al. [] for the same five traits in French Alpine and Saanen goats in first lactation. The evolution of the heritability throughout lactation for each trait was similar between RRM and RRM*. In Norwegian goats  Andonov et al. [] showed that the heritability of milk yield estimated with the MT model increased up to a maximum at mid-lactation (0.26) and then decreased  which agrees with our observations. The evolution of the heritability throughout the DIM period found here for milk yield differed from that reported in other studies using RRM in goats. Menéndez-Buxadera et al. [] found a maximum heritability of 0.24 at the beginning of lactation  then a decrease with DIM in Murciano-Granadina goats whereas Zumbach et al. [] found a maximum heritability of 0.4 and then a decrease with DIM in six German breeds. Andonov et al. [] found a maximum heritability of 0.33 at ~<U+2009>DIM 155  in a Norwegian goat breed and Mucha et al. [] found a maximum heritability of 0.45 at ~<U+2009>DIM 220  in a crossbred population including three goat breeds: Alpine  Saanen  and Toggenburg. The mean heritability estimates for protein yield found here (~<U+2009>0.2) was in agreement with that reported by Muños-Mejias et al. [] for goats of the Florida breed. This was not the case for fat yield  for which we found a higher heritability (~<U+2009>0.2) than that for the Florida breed (~<U+2009>0.15). Moreover  Muños-Mejias et al. [] showed that the estimated heritabilities for fat and protein yield for Florida goats were higher at the end of lactation  which was not the case in our study. For protein and fat contents  the estimated heritabilities reported in Muños-Mejías et al. [] and Andonov et al. [] were lower than those found here  and followed a different shape  i.e. they increased with DIM. The RRM* made it possible to calculate the heritability of persistency for each trait []. The heritabilities of persistency for milk yield calculated from RRM* were close to those reported by Cole and VanRaden [] in cattle  who also calculated milk yield persistency ensuring that it was not correlated with milk yield level. Menéndez-Buxadera et al. [] reported a heritability of milk yield persistency 0.208  but the correlation with lactation yield level is unknown. As in our study  Mucha et al. [] found that all the genetic correlations for milk yield between two periods in the trajectory fitted in the RRM models were always positive. This indicates that selection of animals based on any daily EBV will yield positive responses for all the other days in the lactation curve. Also in agreement with our results  Muñoz-Mejías et al. []  Andonov et al. [] and Menéndez-Buxadera et al. [] found that genetic correlations between days were higher for fat and protein contents than for yield traits. The moderate genetic correlations for milk yield between the peak and end of lactation indicated genetic variability in the level of milk production between the peak and end of lactation  and therefore a genetic variability for milk persistency. For all traits  the between-day genetic correlations were similar with RRM or RRM*. We showed that correlations between EBV from RRM and RRM* were close to 1 for both average and persistency of yield as reported in Leclerc et al. [] who compared EBV from a complete and a reduced model. The advantages of the reduced model are the smaller size of the variance–covariance matrices and the zero correlation between EBV for lactation yield () and persistency () by construction. This allows selection of animals with a desired persistency throughout the lactation without changing the net-total lactation output. Model  does not have this advantage as the correlation between mean level and persistency is high in that model. The large difference in lactation trajectory between extreme animals suggests that it can be valuable to consider persistency in selection. The form of the first eigenfunction (Fig. ) is interesting because it represents the pattern of how a goat produces milk throughout lactation from its genetic makeup. The eigenfunction coordinates were higher at the end of the lactation period for the Saanen breed than for Alpine breed  confirming the observations of Arnal et al. [] who showed a better persistency for Saanen goats than Alpine goats. This is also evidenced by the higher correlation between SUM_leg4 and  for the Saanen compared to Alpine goats (0.15 in Saanen vs. 0 in Alpine) as well as the higher genetic correlations between DIM in Saanen compared to Alpine goats. The correlations of the production level for milk yield with the production level for the other traits were very close to those reported by Bélichon et al. [] on total lactation traits (0.90 for protein yield and 0.76 for fat yield). For protein content and fat content  Bélichon et al. [] found slightly lower correlations  i.e. -<U+2009>0.28 for protein content and -<U+2009>0.13 for fat content while we found 0.39 and -<U+2009>0.27  respectively  in our study. The correlations between milk yield persistency and the production level for the other traits were weak or close to 0 for both breeds  indicating that milk yield persistency can be selected for with no impact on content-related traits. Furthermore  the difference in the correlations observed here between milk persistency and protein content persistency on the one hand  and between milk persistency and fat content persistency on the other hand  indicates that a goat with a high milk persistency will tend to have a lower fat:protein ratio in early lactation. Several studies in dairy cattle [    ] showed that a high fat:protein ratio was associated with a negative energy balance  subclinical mastitis  and poor fertility. These results point out to the potential value of lactation persistency in breeding schemes. Finally  the development of a test-day model for milk production opens up new perspectives. For example  the study of the genetic relationship between persistency and other traits such as longevity or fertility could help to explain the negative correlation between high production and fitness. The estimated fixed effects of such test-day models  especially the herd-test-day effect  also offer producers important clues on the impact of herd management on these traits. For example  herd test-day estimates can be compared between farms under similar systems in terms of mean and variability throughout the year []. In this paper  we show that the genetic parameters obtained with a test-day model using a fourth-order Legendre polynomial () for the genetic and permanent environmental components and a multi-trait model are consistent. However  this kind of model is complex and computationally demanding. Given that the aim was to develop TD genetic evaluations for traits in selection schemes (milk production traits and somatic cell score) over several parities and possibly including genomic information  a simpler model is necessary. We found that reducing the genetic and permanent environment (co)variance matrices of  to its first two PC () was a satisfactory compromise  which accurately approximates genetic parameters and EBV under the complete model. This reduced model can give EBV for total lactation milk yield and persistency that are nearly independent (correlation close to 0). This negligible correlation is appealing because it allows to select animals with a desired lactation shape independently from selection for total lactation production. Therefore  for the extension of the TD models to several lactations  we consider that  is more appropriate for implementation than the complete model .

Rainbow trout () is an economically important aquaculture commodity. However  diseases have become one of the main constraints to sustainable aquaculture production and trade []. Parasites and infectious diseases cause significant losses in aquaculture worldwide  accounting for 90% of the total loss of all trout intended for sale in the United States during 2016 (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service). Columnaris disease (CD) is an emerging problem for rainbow trout aquaculture in the US  which is caused by the gram-negative bacterium . CD is distributed around the world and infects cultured and wild freshwater fish species  such as rainbow trout  tilapia and channel catfish. It can infect fish of all ages  but it is more frequent in young fish  and it can cause major losses [  ]. Transmission occurs often horizontally and indirectly through the water column without fish-to-fish contact  and generally the severity and occurrence are greater at warmer water temperatures []. Currently there are no licensed vaccines against  for use in rainbow trout and regulations on the use of antibiotics in aquaculture are very restrictive. Hence  genetic improvement of resistance to the disease through selective breeding offers a sustainable and long-term alternative approach for this problem. Recently  we have reported that resistance to CD is heritable and positively correlated with resistance to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD)  which is caused by  []. Two aquaculture-relevant rainbow trout breeding populations were used in this study: the odd-year line of the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (NCCCWA; heritability<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23 and genetic correlation<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.40)  and the Troutlodge  Inc.  May odd-year (TLUM) nucleus breeding population (heritability<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.34 and genetic correlation<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.39) []. Therefore  there is a great potential to genetically improve resistance to CD in rainbow trout using selective breeding. In addition  recently we showed that genomic selection for resistance to BCWD holds great potential for rapid improvement in the same TLUM population []. However  a better understanding of the genetic architecture of this trait is needed to guide decisions on whether to apply genomic tools in selective breeding strategies  and to determine which genomic-assisted breeding approach is likely to be the most successful for this trait in both populations. The genomic-assisted breeding approaches can consider information from all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a chip (i.e.  genome-wide selection) or only from the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that explain a high proportion of the variance (i.e.  genome-targeted selection) []. In the current study  we added genotype data to a subset of the population (year-class 2015) from the previous study  which included only pedigree and phenotype data []. The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify common genomic regions that explain a large proportion of the additive genetic variance for resistance to CD in a single generation of the NCCCWA and TLUM rainbow trout nucleus breeding populations; and (2) to estimate the gains in accuracy of prediction when genomic information is used to evaluate the genetic potential of surviving to columnaris infection in each population. Two important aquaculture populations were investigated: the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (NCCCWA; Leetown  WV) odd-year line (ARS-Fp-R)  which has been under family-based selective breeding for improved resistance to BCWD for five generations [  ]  and the Troutlodge  Inc.  May-spawning odd-year (TLUM) nucleus breeding population  which has been subjected to at least six generations of selective breeding for growth-related traits  but is considered unselected for traits related to disease resistance. The TLUM odd-year line is one of eight domestic rainbow trout nucleus populations that are maintained by Troutlodge  Inc. (Sumner  WA)  a major rainbow trout breeding company globally. Both populations have been closed to outside germplasm and are scheduled to produce approximately 100 nucleus families at each generation. The sampling structure for each population is illustrated in Fig. . The numbers of fish in the pedigree records were 54 350 and 36 265  for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively  with 8453 and 3986 fish recorded for resistance to CD  respectively. Genotype records with the 57 k SNP array (Affymetrix Axiom) [] were available for 1185 (197 parents and 988 phenotyped offspring) and 1137 (147 parents and 990 phenotyped offspring) fish from the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively. The sampling scheme for genotyping aimed at including five mortalities and five survivors per family  although fewer survivors or mortalities were available for sampling for some families. After SNP quality control  35 900 and 33 980 high-quality and informative SNPs were used in the analysis  respectively for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations. A Venn diagram for the number of fish included in the pedigree  phenotype and genotype datasets for each population.  National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture   Troutlodge  Inc. USA May spawning nucleus population All post-hatch rearing practices and disease challenges were conducted at the USDA  ARS  NCCCWA  as previously described []. The NCCCWA fish were spawned in February 2015 and the TLUM in May 2015. Nucleus TLUM families were shipped to the NCCCWA as eyed eggs and reared as separate families following standard NCCCWA culture practices until the time of disease challenge. Each family was challenged in two tank replicates and the challenge counted for 40 and 20 fry per tank  respectively for NCCCWA and TLUM. Pathogen-naïve fry were challenged with CD by immersion during 1 h in a static bath of a virulent strain (CSF298-10) of . To ensure an equal dose of bacteria in all tanks  each tank was inoculated with 40 mL of liquid culture (using a graduated pipette) that had a final OD540 of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.7. Twelve individual tanks were sampled during the bath challenge and plated to quantify colony forming unit (CFU)/mL. No significant differences were found between tanks. The disease survival challenge for the NCCCWA and TLUM fish started at 66 days post-hatch (BW<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.3 g) and 78 days post-hatch (BW<U+2009>~<U+2009>2.8 g)  respectively. The target for the immersion challenge dose was 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 CFU per mL of water  and the actual dose was 1.97<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 2.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 CFU for the NCCCWA and TLUM fish  respectively. Fry were reared in heated flow-through spring water (16 °C) for the duration of the 21-day CD challenge period and dead fish were removed and recorded daily for each tank. Fry was categorized as 2 if it survived for the 21-day post challenge period or 1 otherwise. Inspections were conducted to confirm the presence of the target pathogen in dead fish that were collected during the disease survival trial. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (USDA-ARS  Leetown  WV) reviewed and approved all the protocols used for disease challenge. The status of resistance to CD was considered categorical and modelled using a threshold approach []. The model for the underlying liability of resistance to CD was:  where  is the vector of the underlying distribution of resistance to CD;  is the vector of systematic effects (system and row);  is the vector of additive direct genetic effects;  is a vector of random family/tank effects;  is the vector of random residuals;     and  are the incidence matrices for the effects contained in     and   respectively. It was assumed that the additive direct genetic  family/tank  and residual effects were normally distributed with a mean equal to 0 and variances given by     and   respectively  where  is   the pedigree relationship matrix  in the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) and   the realized relationship matrix  in single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP);  is an identity matrix;     and  are the additive direct genetic  family/tank  and residual variances  respectively. The CD resistance status (y) was modelled with the following distribution: where  is the number of records   the threshold that defines the two survival categories and  is an indicator function that takes value 1 if the fish died during the disease challenge  and 2 if it survived. The procedure is a nonlinear transformation of best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) and BLUP. Variance components were obtained using the Gibbs sampler applied to threshold models as implemented in THRGIBBSF90 []. For the association analyses  we used the weighted single-step genomic BLUP approach for genome-wide association (wssGBLUP) []. This method is based on ssGBLUP []  which has been widely adopted for genomic selection in livestock and aquaculture. Single-step GBLUP combines pedigree and genomic relationships in a single realized relationship matrix (i.e.  )  and the inverse of  replaces the inverse of the pedigree-based relationship matrix () in the BLUP mixed model equations. SNP effects and variances were calculated using wssGBLUP  in an iterative process consisting of seven steps []: Set ; Construct the genomic relationship matrix  as ; Calculate genomic EBV (GEBV); Calculate the SNP effect:   where  is the ratio of SNP variance to additive genetic variances   is a diagonal matrix of SNP weights   is a matrix that relates animals to genotypes at each locus  and  is the GEBV for genotyped animals; Calculate the weight of each SNP:   where  is the minor allele frequency of the th SNP; Normalize  to keep a constant additive genetic variance; Update ; Iterate from step 2. Only three iterations were used in this study  and the GWAS results from iteration 2  which had the best predictive ability  are presented. As suggested by Wang et al. []  the iteration with the best predictive ability or greatest accuracy would be the best one to use for GWAS. Results were summarized using 1-Mb sliding SNP windows. Selection of SNP windows was guided by mapping the genome sequences flanking the SNPs [] to the new annotated rainbow trout reference genome assembly [] (GenBank assembly Accession GCA_002163495). The percentage of genetic variance explained by the th window was calculated as described by Wang et al. []: where  is the additive genetic effect for the th window. Genomic regions that explained more than 1% of the additive genetic variance were considered to be associated with resistance to CD. The software THRGIBBS1F90 via the Gibbs sampler [] was used to estimate GEBV  whereas POSTGSF90 [] was used to estimate SNP effects and variances. The ability to predict future performance (predictive ability) was calculated using a fivefold cross-validation scheme with five replicates to minimize errors due to single-fold sampling. Predictive ability was calculated for all three iterations of WssGBLUP  providing GEBV1  GEBV2  and GEBV3 for iterations 1  2  and 3  respectively. Usually when WssGBLUP is used  predictive ability is reported for all iterations. If SNP weighting is beneficial  predictive ability is expected to increase over iterations []. For the NCCCWA population  988 genotyped fish with phenotypes for resistance to CD were available  therefore  fold sampling considered only those fish. For the three- and two-fold sampling  phenotypes were randomly removed for 198 and 197 fish  respectively. For the TLUM population  990 genotyped fish for resistance to CD were available  and each one of the five folds had phenotypes randomly removed for 198 fish. When phenotypes were removed for one fold (i.e.  the validation group)  the resulting EBV or GEBV were termed as partial. In each cross-validation fold and replication  posterior means and standard deviation were calculated based on 10 000 Gibbs samples (e.g.  no burn-in and all samples were used). The main interest in salmonid fish breeding is to predict more accurately future performance of young animals; therefore  validation is usually performed on young animals (i.e.  forward prediction). However  in our study  most of the genotyped animals were from the same generation  precluding the use of forward prediction. The benchmarks for investigating the ability to predict fish performance were either the phenotypes adjusted for all fixed effects in the model () or breeding values using complete data (i.e.  using data from all five folds). Although the k-fold cross-validation may provide optimistic results because sibs coexist in training and validation populations  this coexistence reflects what happens in real trout breeding programs. When the benchmark was phenotype adjusted for fixed effects ()  the predictive ability () was calculated as the correlation between:  and   where  is partial EBV or GEBV. Some authors have already shown predictive ability for binary traits (e.g.  disease resistance) as the correlation between adjusted phenotypes and EBV or GEBV [  ]; however  in such cases the phenotypes are on the observed binary scale and the EBV and GEBV are on the liability scale  making comparisons difficult and results nonsensical. To avoid such problems  we used an alternative method to evaluate the predictive ability of genomic models  which was described by Legarra and Reverter [] as the LR method. This method compares complete EBV (EBVc) or GEBV (GEBVc)  when all data are available  with partial EBV (EBVp) or GEBV (GEBVp)  when phenotypes for selection candidates are removed for each fold. This LR method is suitable for models with binary or categorical traits  maternal models  and traits with a low heritability []. If the comparison is EBVc with EBVp and GEBVc with GEBVp  we can see how much the breeding values change in the traditional and genomic evaluations when data are added for the validation animals. If the correlation between the partial and complete estimates is higher  the change in breeding value is smaller and the partial data predicts the complete data better. Therefore  the correlation between complete and partial data is a function of the accuracy of prediction. It gives the relative increase in accuracy from one evaluation to the next (i.e.  consistency between subsequent evaluations). Legarra and Reverter [] proved that  is a direct estimator of the increase in accuracy from adding data because its expectation is: where  is prediction error variance or a measure of variance of the estimated minus true breeding value   is the prediction error covariance   is the reduction in variance in a selected population due to relationships  is the genetic variance at equilibrium in a population under selection   is the average inbreeding  and  is the average relationship between animals. The term  is similar to the formula presented by Henderson [] and later by Van Vleck [] to compute the accuracy of an EBV: where  is the inbreeding coefficient of the individual and  is the additive genetic variance. Therefore  this shows that  and  are functions of accuracies of EBV. The regression coefficient () of complete on partial breeding values (i.e.   was used as a measure of inflation. In the same way  when adjusted phenotypes were used as benchmark  the regression coefficient of adjusted phenotype on partial breeding value (i.e.  ) was used to investigate inflation. A value of  close to 1 means EBV or GEBV are not inflated/over-dispersed []  because a change of one unit in (G)EBV corresponds to a similar change in adjusted phenotypes. The estimated heritabilities for resistance to CD were 0.32 and 0.51 for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively  which indicate a moderate to high additive genetic component for the trait. These estimates are higher than our previously reported heritabilities of 0.23 and 0.34 in the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively []. Those estimates were based on data combined from the 2013 and 2015 year-classes of each population  while the current heritability estimates were calculated using only data from the 2015 year-class and with a simpler model that did not include the year-class effect. Descriptive statistics of the family-survival phenotypes and the number of genotyped SNPs that were located in each 1-Mb sliding windows are in Table . The mean survival (±<U+2009>SD) was 74.9% (±<U+2009>13.7%) and 38.6% (±<U+2009>24.1%)  in the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively  which clearly indicate a substantially higher survival rate in the NCCCWA CD challenge. The average number of SNPs per window (±<U+2009>SD) was 27.9 (±<U+2009>6.2) and 22.2 (±<U+2009>8.9) for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively  which means that the genome coverage was better for the NCCCWA population. However  given our recent estimate of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25) that spans on average over 1 Mb across the rainbow trout genome []  this difference in genome coverage was likely not sufficient to substantially impact the LD between genotyped SNPs and neighbouring QTL in the sliding 1-Mb windows. There were 14 windows associated with resistance to CD across six chromosomes in the NCCCWA population  and 26 windows across 13 chromosomes in the TLUM population (Table ). The percentage of additive genetic variance explained by the SNP windows for each chromosome in each of the two populations is shown in Fig. . Only one major QTL (><U+2009>10%) was detected in the NCCCWA population  which was revealed by two windows that were located respectively at 59–60 Mb and 61–62 Mb on chromosome Omy 17 (Omy for )  and explained 12.5 and 11.2% of the genetic variance for resistance to CD  respectively. No major QTL was detected in the TLUM population  but three moderate-effect QTL (=<U+2009>5%) were identified on chromosomes Omy 1  4  and 8. The genomic distribution and location of windows that were associated with resistance to CD in each population are plotted in Fig. . Four QTL regions with co-localized or overlapping windows from both populations were detected on chromosomes Omy 8  14  17  and 21 when we used a QTL significance threshold of 1% of the additive genetic variance. Three additional regions of possibly co-localized QTL on Omy 9  10 and 12 were identified when we used a suggestive threshold of 0.5% of the additive genetic variance (see Additional file : Figure S1). Additive genetic variance for resistance to columnaris disease in two rainbow trout breeding populations explained by 1-Mb sliding SNP windows. The results shown are from iteration 2 of the weighted single-step genome-wide association study (wssGWAS). The year-class 2015 populations are from the USDA-ARS national center for cool and cold water aquaculture (NCCCWA) and from the Troutlodge  Inc. USA May spawning nucleus population (TLUM) SNP windows that explained more than 1% of the additive genetic variance for resistance to CD in the year-class 2015 populations of TLUM and NCCCWA. Co-localized QTL are marked by a red rectangle Predictive abilities and inflation for the validation using adjusted phenotypes as benchmarks  and relative increases in accuracy and inflation using (G)EBV as benchmarks are in Figs.  and  for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively. For the NCCCWA population  the predictive ability was negative (-<U+2009>0.02) for EBV  but addition of genomic information increased the predictive ability by up to 0.11 when using the second iteration of weights (GEBV2). Although there was an increase in predictive ability  the predictive abilities were lower than expected for a trait with a heritability between 0.18 and 0.35. For the TLUM population  the predictive ability for EBV and GEBV2 was 0.06 and 0.22  respectively. Both EBV and GEBV were over-dispersed since  was much lower than 1; the largest values were 0.34 and 0.45 for GEBV1 in the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively. Predictive ability and inflation for validation using adjusted phenotypes ()  and relative increase in accuracy and inflation for validation using the LR method () for the NCCCWA population. EBV is from the traditional evaluation; GEBV1  GEBV2  and GEBV3 are genomic EBV from iterations 1 to 3 of wssGBLUP Predictive ability and inflation for validation using adjusted phenotypes ()  and relative increase in accuracy and inflation for validation using the LR method () for the TLUM population. EBV is from the traditional evaluation; GEBV1  GEBV2  and GEBV3 are genomic EBV from iterations 1 to 3 of wssGBLUP When the LR validation method was applied  i.e. the complete (G)EBV was used as the benchmark for (G)EBV in each iteration  the relative increase in accuracy from adding phenotypes for selection candidates was greater than 0.5 for EBV and greater than 0.78 for GEBV1 in both populations. Although these values seem to be overestimated  they were close to the accuracy based on PEV  averaged over fold and replication  which were 0.72 and 0.77 for the NCCCWA  and 0.74 and 0.81 for the TLUM populations  for BLUP and ssGBLUP  respectively. Predictive ability and the relative increase in accuracy decreased along the iterations of wssGBLUP  whereas inflation increased. Similar trends have been described by Lourenco et al. [] as resulting from an excessive shrinkage of SNP weights over iterations  i.e. SNPs that contribute some accuracy are disregarded because they receive a near-zero weight. Less inflated (G)EBV were observed when the benchmark was complete (G)EBV  compared to adjusted phenotypes; values for  was 0.74 and 0.65 for EBV  and was 0.87 and 0.82 for GEBV1 for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively. The overall gain in accuracy by using genomic information to predict breeding values  based on the LR validation  was 37 and 46% for the NCCCWA and TLUM populations  respectively. Based on adjusted phenotypes  the gains in accuracy were larger than 100%; but the magnitude of the predictive ability was very small and EBV were inflated. The observed higher survival rate in the CD challenge of families from the NCCCWA  compared to the TLUM population might be the result of the intensive genetic selection for resistance to BCWD applied during the last five generations in the NCCCWA breeding population. The variance components estimated in our recent study [] indicated that resistance to CD is moderately heritable in both populations (heritability estimates of 0.23 in NCCCWA and 0.34 in TLUM)  and that both populations also have a moderate positive genetic correlation between resistance to CD and resistance to BCWD (0.39–0.40). This suggests that both traits might have been genetically improved simultaneously when the NCCCWA population was selected for resistance to BCWD. Conversely  the TLUM population has been under selective breeding pressure for growth  which is likely not genetically correlated with bacterial disease resistance in these aquaculture rainbow trout breeding populations [  ]. However  variation in survival rate exists between consecutive challenges even when fish from the same genetic background are evaluated. The higher  immersion dose (2.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 CFU for TLUM versus 1.97<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 CFU for NCCCWA) might have also contributed to the lower survival rate in the TLUM challenge. However  environmental factors that were expected to improve the survival rate of TLUM fish included age (older by 12 days) and size (bigger) at the start of the disease challenge  and they were also reared at a lower density per tank throughout the challenge. The fact that each population has been under selective pressure for different purposes might have contributed to the detection of different QTL regions for resistance to CD in the two populations. Comparison of the genomic distribution and location of SNP windows associated with resistance to BCWD in the TLUM 2013 year-class from our previous study [] with the current windows that we identified for resistance to CD in the TLUM 2015 year-class (see Additional file : Figure S2)  allowed us to identify co-localized QTL on Omy 8  which includes a major QTL for resistance to BCWD and a moderate QTL window for resistance to CD. This supports the notion that selection pressure on one trait might also impact the co-localized QTL for the other trait  and hence selection pressure for resistance to BCWD in previous generations of the NCCCWA population might have affected the allelic distribution of some of the QTL for resistance to CD in that population. A similar comparison of the genome locations of the QTL for resistance to BCWD that were detected among some of the families of the founding generation of the NCCCWA population [] with those of the QTL for resistance to CD detected in this study after five generations of selective breeding for BCWD resistance is shown in Additional file : Figure S3. The two studies share one QTL with a small effect on Omy 10  and also two co-localized or neighbouring QTL on Omy 8. Interestingly  the two QTL on Omy 8 are located near the overlapping QTL for resistance to BCWD and CD in the TLUM population. However  all the other QTL detected for resistance to the two diseases are not shared or co-localized  including the major QTL for resistance to BCWD on Omy 25 and to CD on Omy 17. Considering that the two bacterial species that cause BCWD and CD are both from the  genus  it is likely that a certain proportion of common host genes with pleiotropic effects act on the resistance to either pathogen  which might explain the co-localized QTL and the genetic correlation between resistance to these two diseases. However  it is also possible that the genetic correlation is caused in part by physical linkage of QTL that affect each trait separately  as was previously found for resistance to BCWD and spleen size in rainbow trout [  ]. Fragomeni et al. [] showed that the proportion of genetic variance explained by windows and the location of the windows with the largest effect were not consistent across different generations of the same population of a selected commercial broiler line. The fact that the top windows are dynamic in populations under selection and that the variance explained by the windows is not large  suggest that using whole-genome selection instead of region-specific selection would be advantageous in those populations. When windows that explain a certain proportion of variance are identified  a genome-wide selection method that prioritizes or assigns different weights for such windows can help to improve genomic predictions []  especially in populations with a relatively small number of genotyped animals []. It is not surprising that different genome regions are found to affect resistance to CD in the two populations in this study  because bacterial disease resistance is typically a multi-factor trait that is controlled by a complex inheritance system with multiple genes and alternative immunological and physiological pathways  although we cannot exclude the possibility that with better sample size we would have detected more overlapping QTL between the two populations. Of particular interest in this study  are the moderate-major QTL identified on Omy 17 for resistance to CD in the NCCCWA population and the co-localized QTL for resistance to CD and BCWD identified on Omy 8 in the TLUM population. We investigated the annotated protein coding genes in RefSeq (NCBI genome annotation of predicted protein coding genes; Accession GCA_002163495.1) for the QTL region with the largest effect on resistance to CD in the NCCCWA population on Omy 17 (59 030 557 bp–59 975 343 bp; Table ). Overall  10 coding genes and one pseudogene were identified in this region (see Additional file : Table S1)  among which only -- (regulator of T cell precursor migration and of inflammatory response) might be directly implicated in immune response [  ]. However  some of the other proteins may be involved in other important metabolic processes  cell signalling and localisation  maintenance of water homeostasis  or protein synthesis; and hence cannot be overlooked as potentially involved in disease resistance or susceptibility without further investigation. Overall  little is known about the actual function of those proteins in rainbow trout. In addition  we cannot rule out the possibility that other neighbouring genes or sequences that are important for gene expression regulation and in strong LD with the SNPs in that window are the actual causative factor for the strong QTL signal in this region of Omy 17. Clearly  further investigation that is beyond the scope of this report is needed to identify candidate genes for resistance to CD from this QTL region. In our study  the results obtained for predictive ability and  from the validation using adjusted phenotypes showed that this is not an appropriate benchmark for binary traits under a threshold model. When this model is applied  the breeding values are estimated on a linear normalized scale  which means that phenotypes or adjusted phenotypes are not on the same scale and do not follow the same distribution as breeding values  reducing the prediction efficiency and increasing bias (i.e.   much lower than 1). In some other studies []  the correlation with phenotypes was also divided by the square root of heritability () to bring it to the accuracy scale. This can produce values that are outside the parameter space (i.e.  from 0 to 1). According to Legarra and Reverter []  even after adjusting phenotypes for fixed effects  a covariance structure across  can remain  especially when fixed effects are not well estimated  resulting in overestimated accuracy after predictive ability is divided by . In addition  when correlations are divided by  to obtain accuracy  this accuracy is prone to errors if heritability is not well estimated. Although Yoshida et al. [] reported reasonable values for predictive ability for disease resistance against  in rainbow trout under ssGBLUP   was equal to 0.27  which is close to what we found and is not acceptable under the BLUP assumptions. One way to circumvent this issue of inappropriate benchmark for binary traits could be to compare family mid-parent (G)EBV on a probability scale with within-family survival probability when progeny of validation fish or selection candidates are challenged with CD pathogens. However  such progeny performance data were not available for the current study. Another way would be to use complete EBV as benchmark for both partial EBV and partial GEBV []. However  when the amount of information added from partial to complete data is small  as in our study  complete EBV will be correlated more to partial EBV than to partial GEBV. A third way is to use days to death as a continuous trait instead of a binary mortality trait  which would make comparisons between adjusted phenotypes and (G)EBV more reasonable []. Another way to deal with the different scales between phenotypes and (G)EBV is to use an alternative method to assess accuracy and bias/inflation of predictions. We found that the LR method [] is a promising approach  for binary traits. In the LR approach  both dependent and independent variables are on the same scale because both are (G)EBV that are estimated by the same method using phenotypes. On average  the increase in accuracy from adding phenotypes for validation animals were 0.58  0.80  0.73  and 0.70 for EBV  GEBV1  GEBV2  and GEBV3  respectively. The fact that this increase was greater for GEBV than for EBV  means that the partial data predicted the complete data better when genomic information was used. As one of the objectives in animal breeding and genetics is to find models that better predict breeding values and minimize possible changes when phenotypes for selection candidates are included  the LR method may be a reasonable option because it can measure the adequacy of the models. Legarra and Reverter [] showed that the correlation between complete and partial (G)EBV is a function of accuracies of predictions and reflects the relative increase in accuracy when more phenotypic information is added. Lourenco et al. [] reported a small gain of 0.08% in predictive ability by including genomic information in the evaluation for calving ease  a binary trait  in American Angus. This small gain may be due to the result of the small proportion of the genotyped animals having difficult calving (failure) and of the predictive ability being computed as the correlation between a binary phenotype and a normalized estimated breeding value. In a study on heat stress in pigs using reaction norm models  Fragomeni et al. [] reported a higher accuracy when the benchmark for partial GEBV was the complete GEBV. We observed that inflation and gain in accuracy of predictions from pedigree-based to genomic evaluations can be better assessed when a method is used that allows the comparison of dependent and independent variables on the same scale. This gain in accuracy of predictions was on average 42% in our study  which gives genome-wide selection a great advantage over traditional pedigree-based selection and encourages the application of genomic selection for resistance to CD in rainbow trout breeding populations. In addition to the LR validation applied in this study  other methods are available to test model fit when using binary data  especially on disease. One method is the odds-ratio (OR) of case–control status and the other is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) []. However  the interpretation of results differs among studies. Lee et al. [] showed in a simulation study that AUC can be used as a measure of model accuracy in case–control studies. Using pregnancy status in a real beef cattle data  Toghiani et al. [] also applied AUC to evaluate predictive ability of different genomic models. The authors pointed that although high values of AUC indicate better modelling  this measure is not directly comparable to correlations between adjusted phenotypes and GEBV. The use of common or individual QTL for genome-targeted selection in the two populations investigated in this study may not be a promising approach compared to the potential of genome-wide selection. We identified only one moderate-major effect QTL region on chromosome Omy 17 that explains more than 10% of the additive genetic variation in the NCCCWA population and multiple windows with small effects (between 1 and 5%) in both populations. Among those  only four regions that explain more than 1% of the additive genetic variance were common to both populations  which means that a limited amount of the genetic variation can be explained by SNPs associated with QTL that might be useful for genome-target selection. Further validation of the QTL for resistance to CD in more generations from each population is under way  and additional genomic investigation (e.g. genome re-sequencing to discover more SNPs in the QTL regions) could be attempted in the future to help identify potential CD causative variants for resistance to CD and reduce the list of candidate causative genes in the respective QTL regions. Columnaris disease in rainbow trout has a complex polygenic inheritance architecture  since it is controlled by several genomic regions that explain a considerable amount of the genetic variance (><U+2009>1%). The SNP windows that we found to be associated with resistance to CD do not explain a sufficiently high proportion of genetic variance for choosing genome-targeted instead of genome-wide selection (GS). In addition  because of the small number of overlapping QTL regions between populations  QTL information cannot be used for selection decisions across populations. Genome-wide selection has a greater ability to predict future performance compared to pedigree-based selection. Our analyses also show that correct evaluation of the potential of genomic selection for binary traits requires a proper validation method that accounts for differences in scale when threshold models are used.

The breakeven value of genotyping depended on the number of loci modeled  the LOF allele frequencies  and the mating/selection strategies used. Genotyping was most valuable when it was used to avoid otherwise high levels of embryonic mortalities. As the number of essential loci with LOF alleles increased  especially when some were present at relatively high minor allele frequencies  embryonic losses increased  and profit was maximized by genotyping 10 to 20% of a herd and using that information to reduce these losses. Genotyping 100% of the herd was never the most profitable outcome in any scenario; however  genotyping some proportion of the herd  together with segregation analysis to cover ungenotyped animals  maximized overall profit in scenarios with large numbers of loci with LOF alleles. As more LOF alleles are identified  such a mate selection software will likely be required to optimally select and allocate matings to balance the rate of genetic gain  embryonic losses  and inbreeding. For commercial beef cow-calf operators  fertility is the most important economic trait among the breeding objectives and outweighs even growth and carcass traits [  ]. Beef cattle fertilization rates to a single artificial insemination (AI) service of about 90 to 100% have been observed  and yet the subsequent calving rates reach about 55%  which suggests that at least 35% of pregnancies are lost between fertilization and calving []. The low frequencies of recessive loss-of-function (LOF) alleles of genes that are essential for life may be associated with part of this early embryonic mortality. Genomic tools have enabled the identification of early embryonic mortality LOF mutations in dairy cattle that are evidenced by decreased fertility scores in genetic evaluations []. Recent studies have revealed additional lethal LOF alleles in beef and dairy cattle populations  and at least 17 haplotypes have been identified []  with carrier frequencies ranging from 2.2 to 23.4%  and recessive haplotype frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 15.2% [   ] (Table ). Genotyping provides an opportunity to evaluate the LOF allele status for individual animals  and this information could be used to avoid matings that result in early embryonic losses due to the occurrence of homozygous LOF offspring. However  as research identifies an ever-increasing number of essential loci that potentially harbor LOF alleles  computerized decision support programs will likely be needed to make optimal mating decisions given the computational complexities associated with the incorporation of LOF information from multiple essential gene loci into genetic improvement programs []. Mate allocation  which is the process of selecting mating pairs from a population of females and some portfolio of males  can be used to help avoid pairing animals that carry LOF alleles at the same locus. A constrained mate selection algorithm  MateSel  was developed to optimize mate selection decisions—to simultaneously optimize both mate selection and mate allocation decisions []. For example  the program can maximize the rate of genetic gain towards a given breeding objective under the constraint of holding the inbreeding rate to a user-defined level  plus other logistical constraints required by breeders. It allows breeders to simulate mate selection decisions and interactively constrain different variables to observe the impact of such constraints on the rate of genetic progress and other predicted outcomes. Thus  MateSel offers the opportunity to compare and contrast different approaches to the management of recessive conditions. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of both mate selection for reducing the detrimental impact of LOF loci on herd fertility  and segregation analysis for reducing the genotyping costs involved. Three scenarios with different numbers of essential loci and LOF allele frequencies were set up to compare two breeding strategies for selecting against recessive lethal alleles. The first strategy was (1) selection against LOF carriers as parents  and the second was (2) simultaneous mating and selection against the occurrence of homozygous offspring (i.e.  matings between carriers at the same locus). This was carried out within a given population using a set of constraints  selection indices  and different proportions of whole herd genotyping (0–100%). The weighting that maximized profit per mating ($P) from each mating strategy given perfect knowledge of genotypes was determined as described in Upperman et al. []  and then the effect of genotyping varying percentages  from 0 to 100%  of the herd was examined. The percentage of herd genotyped that optimized net profit for a fixed cost of genotyping ($30/test) was determined  as well as the breakeven genotyping cost at which the expenses associated with genotyping different percentages of the herd equaled the value derived from using that genotyping information to avoid embryonic losses for the three scenarios. PopSNP (version 1.6)  a software program that populates single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into a given pedigree dataset according to Mendelian segregation laws []  was used to create three scenarios that included varying numbers of essential loci and LOF allele frequencies. Scenario (A) included seven loci with LOF alleles at high frequencies (mean frequency 0.0847 ranging from 0.0527 to 0.1001)  scenario (B) included 76 loci with LOF alleles at low frequencies (mean frequency 0.0112 ranging from 0.0004 to 0.0695)  and scenario (C) included 50 loci with LOF alleles with random high and low frequencies (mean frequency 0.0488 ranging from 0.0044 to 0.1436) (Table ). For scenario (B)  83 loci with LOF allele frequencies higher than 0 were simulated using PopSNP. Setting the cut-off value for allele frequency at 0.07 and higher eliminated seven alleles  leaving a total of 76 “low” frequency variants in scenario (B). The simulated LOF SNPs were populated into an Angus pedigree dataset provided by Mike Kasten with 85 male candidates  169 female candidates  and 546 ancestors following a burn-in of 1000 generations to create a resource for populating foundation animals with initial genotypes. A genome size of 3 Gb across 29 chromosomes was modeled based on the size and chromosome complement of the bovine genome []. The Kosambi mapping function was used to calculate recombination fractions. A mutation rate of 2.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 was used to calculate generation and population size parameters []. Any candidates or ancestors that would have had a homozygous recessive lethal genotype () were assumed dead and not allowed in the population. The dataset included American Angus Association’s expected progeny differences (EPD) and economic selection index values for each candidate. If EPD values were not reported for an animal  average values of the breed database were used. Ochsner et al. [  ] outlined procedures on how to develop a maternal economic selection index ($M) given EPD information. These procedures were followed based on selection objective weightings described by MacNeil []. These included heifer pregnancy  calving ease direct  calving ease maternal  weaning weight direct  weaning weight maternal (milk)  and stayability. Selection criteria included heifer pregnancy  calving ease direct  calving ease maternal  weaning weight direct  weaning weight maternal (milk)  and back fat thickness. Due to incomplete parameter estimations for the simulated dataset  estimates of heritability  genotypic variance  phenotypic variance  and genetic correlation were based on estimates in the literature that originated mainly from reference Angus or British breed populations [     ] (Table ). An additional metric was developed to represent the number of recessive LOF alleles carried by each sire  referred to as the genetic load score (GLS). For each sire  the square of the minor allele frequency (q) at each LOF locus that was heterozygous were summed. The resulting values were divided by the number of matings (100) within each run and weighted based on the number of matings allocated to each sire. This approach was chosen to reflect the long-term impact of the current selection of sires on expression of LOF mortality. MateSel (FortranDLL version 9.4) is a software program for tactical implementation of breeding programs based on an evolutionary algorithm []. It optimizes mate selection and allocation among a given group of females and males to maximize the rate of genetic gain towards a selection objective  while constraining parental coancestry for controlling long-term inbreeding to maintain genetic variation for future improvement. The resulting mating list accommodates optimal contributions of parents to future generations  together with other factors such as progeny inbreeding  practical constraints  and management of the allele/genotype frequencies for nominated markers. Two strategies can be applied to select against multiple recessive lethal alleles. The first strategy is selection against LOF carriers as parents  and the second is simultaneous mating and selection against the occurrence of homozygous offspring (i.e.  matings between carriers at the same locus). To compare these strategies  for selecting against recessive LOF alleles or LOF genotypes  two parameters LethalA and LethalG (see page 20 of []) were added to MateSel []. LethalA is the probability of mortality in  due to LOF loci  given random mating of progeny and using current candidate frequencies for the LOF loci. Selecting against LethalA discriminates against the assignment of matings to animals that carry lethal recessive alleles  irrespective of the mates allocated  and essentially targets long-term reduction in mortality. LethalG is the probability of mortality in  due to LOF loci. Mate selection against LethalG effectively selects against the occurrence of lethal homozygous genotypes () resulting from carrier matings  and essentially targets short-term reduction in mortality. This allows for the use of carrier sires provided that they are not mated to females that are LOF carriers at the same essential loci []. These definitions of LethalA and LethalG differ from those of Van Eenennaam and Kinghorn []  which related to numbers of LOF alleles and genotypes  rather than probabilities of mortality. The current definitions were used because of their more direct link to utility and simpler evaluation of outcomes in relation to other component objectives. Optimum mate selections were allocated for 100 matings  with progeny index ($M) as the key objective. No sire could be mated more than 50 times. A target compromise between genetic gain (as measured by the progeny index for $M) and inbreeding (as measured by parental coancestry) was set to 25 degrees in MateSel (see [] for explanation). This target compromise is shown with the green line on Fig. .  Reproduced from [] with permission An example frontier response surface involving progeny index and parental coancestry. This graph shows the balance between Progeny Index (Y axis)  and Parental Coancestry (X axis). The black curved frontier shows the range of possible outcomes of optimal contributions (number of matings allocated to each candidate). The blue circle illustrates a solution for which a set of matings has been identified and which achieve the maximum rate of genetic change in progeny index given the constraint on parental coancestry set by the target compromise of 25 degrees (green line)  where 0 degree corresponds to the maximum progeny index response and 90 degrees to minimum parental coancestry. The red trail shows the pathway that the evolutionary algorithm has made during convergence. Increasing the rate of genetic gain further would require to decrease the target compromise  thereby allowing selection of fewer and/or more related animals  thus accelerating the short-term genetic progress at the expense of long-term genetic variation. Then  mate selection runs were performed with increasing weightings (0  0.001  0.01  0.1  1  10  and 100) to both LethalA and LethalG mating strategies separately to decrease the predicted mortality in the long-term and short-term  respectively. In other words  we are saying how little (e.g. 0.001) or how much (e.g. 100) emphasis is placed on avoiding the use of carriers or recessive homozygous “dead” calves that show up within our calf crop. A cost of $200 was assigned to the occurrence of a homozygous  lethal “” genotype (embryonic mortality) [  ]. Profit per mating ($P) was calculated as $M (Index)—(LethalG<U+2009>×<U+2009>$200). In addition  the average sire index value ($MB) was calculated at each weighting. This value shows changes in the use of sires for the 100 matings  as well as the average sire GLS for each weighting. To model different percentages of herd genotyped  various values (0<U+2009>=<U+2009>not genotyped and 1<U+2009>=<U+2009>genotyped) were added to the dataset that started with a random assortment of 10% of the population (both sires and dams)  which was initially denoted as genotyped. Those individuals then remained genotyped as the percentage of the herd genotyped increased  adding a random selection of the individuals (both sires and dams) that were genotyped for each 10% increase of the herd being genotyped. In all cases  ungenotyped animals had genotyped probabilities calculated by using Geneprob (version 3.3) []  and these probabilities were used to help make mate selection decisions. A value of $30 was selected as the cost of genetic testing based on the current costs of beef cattle genetic tests ($29–$40) in the US market [  ]. Mate selections were then performed using the optimal weightings that maximized $P  under prevailing constraints  for each mating strategy in each of the three scenarios that had different numbers of loci and LOF allele frequencies (Table ). Each scenario was replicated 100 times  each replicate with a different random sampling of true genotypes  for each percentage of the herd genotyped. Figure  shows the average progeny index ($M) values versus the occurrence of affected calves per mating for the three scenarios with decreasing weightings (100  10  1  0.1  0.01  0.001  0) against LethalA or LethalG  and the profit maximizing weighting for each scenario and breeding strategy. Breeding strategy 1 (selection against carrier parents) to avoid embryonic lethality had little impact on average progeny index values and on the occurrence of homozygous affected calves when seven essential loci with LOF alleles were simulated since very few calves were lost in this scenario. However  in scenarios with 50 or more simulated loci  the occurrence of homozygous affected calves increased  and high weightings of LethalA in scenarios B and C resulted in a very large drop in average progeny index values. It should be noted that appropriate weightings under strategy 2 (selection against the occurrence of homozygous affected calves) can result in a considerable reduction of the occurrence of affected calves with very little compromise in average genetic gain. Average progeny index versus occurrence of affected calves per mating for three scenarios given two breeding strategies. Scenario A (7 loci with high-frequency LOF alleles)  scenario B (76 loci with low-frequency LOF alleles)  and scenario C (50 with high- and low-frequency loci). Strategy 1: Selection against carrier parents with decreased weightings (L-<U+2009>><U+2009>R: 100  10  1  0.1  0.01  0.001  0) against LethalA; Strategy 2: Selection and mate allocation to avoid homozygous offspring with decreased weightings (L-<U+2009>><U+2009>R: 100  10  1  0.1  0.01  0.001  0) against LethalG. Filled triangle<U+2009>=<U+2009>profit maximizing weighting for a given scenario and breeding strategy First  we used MateSel to optimally select and allocate pairs for 100 matings without consideration of LOF alleles within the population for one generation. This is referenced as the “0% genotyping”  or base  run. The $P at 0% genotyping was $113.17  $89.67  and $84.14 for scenarios A  B  and C  respectively (Table ). At this base run  there was a loss of 0.7  12.45  and 15.22 calves per 100 matings (Table )  which equated to total herd losses of $140  $2490.43  and $3043.75 for scenarios A  B  and C  respectively  assuming an opportunity cost of $200 per embryo mortality. These base prices show the impact that LOF alleles have on total profit for producers in the absence of herd genotyping in the three different scenarios. Per mating  this represents a loss of $1.40  $24.90  and $30.44 in $P for A  B  and C scenarios  respectively  relative to the theoretical maximum $P of $114.57  if there were no LOF alleles. Furthermore  $MB was $141.03 prior to consideration of lethal conditions  and the average GLS of the selected sires at this base level was 0.049  0.287  and 0.333 for A  B and C scenarios  respectively (Table ). The impact of embryonic lethality on total profit was minor when only seven essential loci with LOF alleles were simulated. Therefore  there was little impact of the alternative mating strategies on this scenario as the loss per mating was only $1.40 in the absence of any selection or genotyping information. Breeding strategy 1 had a small impact on genetic gain in this scenario. A weighting of 1 on LethalA gave the highest $P  i.e. $113.87  as it maximized genetic progress while reducing the number of affected calves. The group of selected sires had a slightly lower $MB value of $140.61 than the base run  and a GLS of 0.005  as sires with fewer lethal alleles were selected compared to those in the base run (Table ). No improvement from genotyping part of the herd was seen for breeding strategy 1 until at least 70% of the herd was genotyped  and the resulting improvement was only an increase of $P by $0.70/mating (Table ). Any percentage of herd genotyped at $30/test decreased net profit (Fig. )  and the breakeven genotyping cost never rose above $1/test for breeding strategy 1 in this scenario (Fig. ). Net profit for different herd genotyping percentages ($30/test) for three scenarios given two breeding strategies. Per 100 matings. Scenario A (7 loci with high-frequency LOF alleles)  scenario B (76 loci with low-frequency LOF alleles)  and scenario C (50 with high- and low-frequency loci). Strategy 1: selection against carrier parents (); strategy 2: mate selection to avoid homozygous offspring (). ()  numbers in parentheses indicate negative values Breakeven ($/test) value of different herd genotyping percentages for three scenarios when using two breeding strategies. Scenario A (7 loci with high-frequency LOF alleles)  scenario B (76 loci with low-frequency LOF alleles)  and scenario C (50 with high- and low-frequency loci). Strategy 1: Selection against carrier parents (); strategy 2: Mate selection to avoid homozygous offspring () With breeding strategy 2  the goal of maximizing $M and having no affected calves was achieved at the 0.001 weighting on LethalG (Fig. )  which also maximized $P at the theoretical maximum $114.57 (Table ). The group of selected sires at this weighting did not change relative to that of the base run; rather  mate allocation was used to avoid the occurrence of homozygous affected calves. Overall  breeding strategy 2 had a slight profit advantage ($114.57) compared to breeding strategy 1 ($113.87). Only 10% of the herd needed to be genotyped when using breeding strategy 2 to avoid all affected calves (Table )  and the resulting improvement was a $140 savings (Table ). The value returned from testing never approached $30/test  so genotyping any percentage of the herd at this cost resulted in decreased net profit (Fig. ). The breakeven value of genotyping 10% of the herd was $14. As the percentage of the herd genotyped increased  the value of genotyping decreased from $14 down to $1.40/test in the case of 100% of the herd genotyped. Collectively  these data suggest that if there are few embryonic losses occurring in the herd  as observed in scenario A  the value of genotyping to manage lethal recessive conditions is correspondingly very low  ranging from $0 to $14 (Fig. ). This scenario modeled 76 essential loci with LOF alleles at low frequencies. In this case  the base scenario resulted in 12.45 lethal genotypes per 100 matings  which decreased $P by an average of $24.90 per mating in the absence of any selection or genotyping information (Table ). A 0.1 weighting on LethalA for breeding strategy 1 maximized $P at $107.35 (Table )  showing the best balance of maximizing $M while reducing the occurrence of affected calves. At this weighting  the $MB value of the group of selected sires was $140.75 and the average sire GLS was 0.265 (Table ). Higher LethalA weightings reduced the GLS to 0 but were accompanied by a dramatic decrease in $MB of the selected sires  and an accompanying decrease in the average progeny index (Fig. ). Using this optimal LethalA weighting  low percentages of herd genotyped (10 to 30%) increased $P by $6.69 to $12.73 (Table )  because a reduction in homozygous offspring was achieved (Table )  resulting in savings of $669.18–$1273.56 before genotyping costs (Table ). Using a $30/test value  net profit was optimized at 20% of the herd genotyped (Fig. ). Beyond that  the marginal benefit of the test information was outweighed by the additional cost of genotyping and dropped below $30 when 50% of the herd was genotyped. Breakeven genotyping costs decreased as more of the herd was genotyped  i.e. it ranged from $66.92 at 10% down to $17.68 at 100% of the herd genotyped (Table   Fig. ). Profit per mating ($P) for breeding strategy 2 was again maximized ($108.79) when the lowest weighting (0.001) was placed on LethalG  but it was still $5.78 below the theoretical maximum since some embryonic mortality still occurred. At this weighting  $MB value of the group of selected sires was unchanged from that of the base run  but the average sire GLS decreased slightly to 0.284 (Table ). The net savings in reduced embryonic lethality (Table )  combined with the costs associated with genotyping 10% of the herd  resulted in the highest net profit (Fig. ). Net profit for this breeding strategy was actually slightly lower than that for breeding strategy 1 for percentages of the herd genotyped ranging from 20 to 70% (Table   Fig. ). Breakeven genotyping costs for breeding strategy 2 in this scenario ranged from $85.71 (10%) to $19.13 (100%) (Table   Fig. ). This scenario modeled 50 essential loci with a random assortment of low and high LOF allele frequencies. In this case  the base run resulted in 15.22 lethal genotypes per 100 matings i.e. the highest value  which decreased $P by an average of $30.43 per mating. As such  the total opportunity cost of embryonic mortality per 100 matings was $3043.75. For breeding strategy 1  a weighting of 1 on LethalA maximized profit value ($99.48). The group of selected sires at this weighting had average $MB and GLS values of $133.75 and 0.167  as compared to $141.03 and 0.333 at the base run  respectively (Table ). The profit impact of genotyping was greatest for this scenario (Fig. ). Low percentages of the herd genotyped  i.e. 10 to 30%  increased $P by $3.77 at 10% and $13.40 at 30% of the herd genotyped (Table ). With a reduction in the number of embryonic mortalities from 12.42 to 6.05 (Table )  dollar savings before genotyping costs for low percentages of the herd genotyped (10–30%) ranged from $560.00 to $1833.80 (Table ). Net profit was maximized at 20% of the herd genotyped with a value of $1231.25 (Table ). Breakeven costs for genetic testing ranged from $91.56 at 20% to $21.94 at 100% of the herd genotyped (Table   Fig. ). A slight weighting of 0.1 on LethalG in breeding strategy 2 maximized $P at $110.31  which is $10.83 better than the $P resulting from breeding strategy 1 (Table ). The group of selected sires had $MB and GLS values of $138.81 and 0.257  respectively (Table ). The net savings in reduced embryonic lethality combined with the costs associated with genotyping 10% of the herd resulted in the highest net profit from genotyping (Table ). When 40% of the herd was genotyped at $30/test  net profit for breeding strategy 2 was less than that associated with breeding strategy 1. For all other percentages of herd genotyped  selection to avoid homozygous offspring was more profitable than selection against carrier parents (Fig. ). Breakeven genotyping costs were highest for breeding strategy 2 and scenario C  ranging from $168.95 (10%) to $26.77 (100% of the herd genotyped) (Table   Fig. ). In this scenario  genotyping using a cost of $30/test was generally profitable at low to intermediate percentages of herd genotyped due to the relatively high number of embryonic losses that occurred in the absence of genotypic information. Traditionally  calculations of a selection index do not incorporate the effect of specific alleles that result in embryonic or fetal mortality  since most selection indices assume additive relationships between genotypes  and trait values have a linear relationship with profitability []. The management of recessive lethal conditions became an important factor in cattle breeding in the 1950s because of dwarfism occurring in some breeds []  and more recently because of several additional genetic defects that have occurred in popular beef seedstock pedigrees []. For many of these defects  DNA tests have been developed to identify individuals that carry the causal recessive lethal allele []. Almost a decade ago  Charlier et al. [] suggested that using high-density SNP panels to accelerate the identification of certain mutations that cause defects within livestock populations would allow for immediate management within breeding practices. One of the important considerations in managing recessive alleles is the frequency of the recessive allele in the population. A number of different alleles that affect fertility have been identified in both beef and dairy cattle. Cole et al. [] and Georges et al. [] reviewed the recent studies on recessive haplotypes and recessive variants identified by whole-genome sequencing (reverse genetic screening) in cattle (Table ). In dairy cattle  four loci associated with embryo mortality  and three strong candidate causal mutations  were identified in Holstein  Montbéliarde  and Normande breeds []. A study of 337 Holstein–Friesian cows found three possible recessive lethal alleles in  genes that are required for embryo implantation and placental development []. However  more than 400 candidate LOF alleles were identified by whole-genome sequencing in a study of 6300 Belgian beef and 35 000 New Zealand dairy cattle. Testing 200 candidate offspring from carrier sire by carrier dam matings identified nine mutations that resulted in significant depletion of homozygotes  providing evidence that these alleles were true LOF variants []. Hoff et al. [] identified seven loci with haplotypes that were not found in the homozygous state in Angus beef cattle  which suggests that these loci are possible candidates for LOF alleles. Recently  Jenko et al. [] reported three haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal alleles in Aberdeen Angus  Charolais  and Simmental at population frequencies of 15.2  14.4  and 8.8%  respectively. These studies suggest that LOF alleles  which impact fertility  are present in many cattle populations and are likely to be identified on an ongoing basis. As the number of identified mutations increases  animals not carrying LOF alleles will become increasingly rare []. In the absence of an estimate of the actual number of loci that are currently affected by LOF alleles  the value and optimum number of animals to genotype within a herd is difficult to predict. In this study  two breeding strategies were evaluated using scenarios in which the number of essential loci ranged from 7 to 76  and the mean LOF minor allele frequencies ranged from 0.0112 to 0.0847 (Table )  which are representative of the values found in the literature (Table ). With a full knowledge of the carrier status of each individual  the most profitable short-term breeding strategy was always strategy 2  i.e. simultaneous selection and mate allocation to avoid homozygous affected calves () (which avoids carrier matings) compared to breeding strategy 1  i.e. indiscriminate selection against carrier parents () within a population. Mate allocation allowed for the matching of genetically superior carrier individuals  provided they had LOF alleles at different essential loci  and optimized the use of those individuals. Strategy 2 generally requires ongoing efforts to maintain benefits in subsequent generations  whereas the long-term benefits of strategy 1 will be cumulative over time and thus were not clearly reflected in this single generation simulation. Other authors have explored how to manage recessive LOF alleles. Cole [] modeled constraining inbreeding based on genomics [] and added in the model an economic penalty for Mendelian disorders  which ranged from $20 to $200 for hypothetical recessive loci. This approach reduced LOF allele frequencies and was especially useful for low-frequency LOF with small economic value. This simulation did not allow for the management of parental coancestry as was modeled in our study using MateSel. The need for MateSel to access pedigree and index information on all candidates complicates the ease-of-implementation and as posited by Cole  “sometimes it is better to have an imperfect mate allocation tool  than no tool at all”. Currently  most beef producers are culling carriers and this is likely to become infeasible as more LOF mutations are discovered. As more genomic information becomes available due to increased rates of genotyping  it is likely that software to maximize the use of this information for optimal mate selection and allocation will become increasingly valuable for breed associations  and their members. In this study  we modeled just a single round of mating in order to reflect the real-life situation of tactical decision-making. However  we managed long-term inbreeding/diversity by setting a limit on parental coancestry as is commonly done in practice. Moreover  our LethalA metric is essentially an additive criterion that aims at generations beyond the progeny generation. Further studies using multiple generations would be useful to uncover the long-term impact on genetic gain and embryonic losses of the mate selection and allocation strategies that were examined in this study over many generations. Genotyping information enabled the management of LOF alleles. However  the breakeven value derived from genotyping depended highly on the scenario and mating strategy modeled. In scenario A  with only seven LOF alleles  the breakeven value of genotyping was never more than $1 with breeding strategy 1 and $2 with breeding strategy 2. In contrast  in scenario C  with 50 LOF alleles of variable frequencies  it could reach a breakeven value as high as $168.95/test when using simultaneous mating and selection to avoid homozygous affected calves () and genotyping only 10% of the herd. Clearly  the breakeven value of genotyping information increases in proportion to the number of embryonic losses that are anticipated in the absence of genotyping information. In the future  it is likely that the identification of recessive conditions will be part of routine genotyping  and so there will be no separate genotyping costs for LOF alleles. The availability of genome-wide data for genomic selection may allow for the imputation of LOF alleles at essentially no additional cost  but with an accuracy lower than 100%. The use of genotyping for multiple purposes  including the tantalizing prospect of genomic mate selection to concentrate the most favorable complementary alleles into offspring []  will likely make it cost-effective for considering and managing all known LOF alleles  irrespective of frequency  in mate selection and allocation decisions. Genotyping a larger percentage of the herd provided more information to decrease embryonic mortalities compared to genotyping smaller percentages of the herd  although this depended on the number of loci and allele frequencies. Within each scenario and breeding strategy  $P was maximized when 70 to 100% of the herd was genotyped; however  there was little additional value generated by increased levels of genotyping to offset the additional costs. Breakeven genotyping costs typically decreased as the percentage of the herd genotyped increased in the different scenarios. The exception to this was for scenario C for which the marginal value of genotyping increased as the percentage of the herd genotyped increased from 10 to 20% when using breeding strategy 1 due to the added value derived from that additional information to avoid the use of carrier parents (Fig. ). In all other cases  the marginal value of additional dollars saved by increasing the proportion of the herd genotyped decreased; therefore  the breakeven genotyping costs decreased as the percentage of herd genotyped increased. If scenario A approximates the true frequencies  as was suggested by studies reporting seven to nine lethal LOF mutations [  ]  then the actual value of genotypic information to manage recessive lethal conditions may be low  at least in the short term. However  with just seven LOF loci  there may be some prospect to eliminate the LOF alleles  and therefore some benefit to long-term management. In the other two simulations with more than 50 loci with LOF alleles  genotyping a small percentage of the herd improved net profit. Figure  that illustrates the breakeven costs of genetic testing is perhaps the most illustrative of the complexities of the value of a genetic test  since it shows the impact that the percentage of herd genotyped  breeding strategy  and different numbers of essential loci and LOF frequencies can have on the value of genotyping information. These values reveal the importance of the underlying scenario in developing estimates of the economic value of genotyping information for managing recessive lethal conditions. Kinghorn [] described genotyping strategies that used genotyping probabilities from segregation analysis to help choose which individuals and loci to genotype. It has been reported that genotyping sires  then dams  and then non-parents  added performance to a population with a low allele frequency. Undoubtedly  these are more strategic approaches than those modeled in our study  and additional tools  such as Geneprob []  can be used to estimate the probability that an animal is a carrier  as was done in our study. The choice of which individuals to genotype should likely be based on the influence of each individual in the breeding program (e.g.  bulls<U+2009>><U+2009>cows)  and/or its estimated breeding value. Selection of influential individuals for genotyping should be done in such a way that it contributes useful information to the whole population  e.g. by determining the carrier status of key influential sires []. In the Australian Angus population  DNA test results and pedigree information were used to calculate the probability that a non-tested animal was a carrier of the arthrogryposis multiplex (AM) syndrome with the software program Geneprob [  ]. These results were analyzed and are publicly available on the Australian Angus Association’s website. Along with this program  the association designed educational programs to help members understand how to identify and manage recessive lethal alleles. By implementing these practices  producers decreased their use of AM sires  thus decreasing the carrier individuals within the Australian Angus population []. This was similar to our breeding strategy 1 of selecting against carrier parents. Although genotyping animals decreased the use of carrier sires  it may not have been an optimum approach given the results of the current study. Managing genetic defects is ultimately a trade-off between avoiding affected individuals in the short-term and eliminating LOF alleles in the long run []. Although this example shows that the reduction of recessive lethal alleles is possible  complete elimination of these alleles may be difficult []; thus  continued long-term management is necessary. Allen et al. [] modeled the impact of a sire that carries a recessive lethal genetic condition. Random mating herds that use an occasional carrier sire had a low occurrence of homozygous affected calves (less than 1%). However  within a self-replacing herd  where carrier females may stay in the herd for around 20 years  consistent management is required to avoid recessive lethal conditions []. In our study  a value of $200 was used as the cost of a homozygous lethal progeny  and the economic factors influencing this value will vary. Factors such as the number of animals within the herd  whether the herd is self-replacing  and the degree of risk that producers are willing to accept should also be taken into consideration []. A limit of our study is that only a single herd and a single generation were modeled  thus it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the long-term dynamics of LOF in larger populations more generally. Interestingly  in a simple simulation study that assigned a small ($20–$40) or large ($200–$400) economic value to a locus with a recessive LOF allele had little impact on decreasing the frequency of the deleterious allele over time []. In that example  increasing the economic cost of recessive LOF alleles only was not sufficient to accelerate the rate at which undesirable alleles were eliminated from the population. Mate selection to avoid affected progeny may help LOF alleles to survive in the population  if their frequency is sufficiently high such that random mating would otherwise have resulted in significant selection against them. At lower LOF allele frequencies  mate selection to avoid affected progeny may reduce the frequency of LOF alleles across many loci in the population  since individuals that carry no LOF alleles  few LOF alleles  and/or LOF alleles that are at a lower frequency in the population  will be easier to match with mates to lower the probability of progeny mortality. However  it seems prudent  in practice  to include some weighting to avoid the selection of carriers  as well as weighting to reduce the prevalence of affected progeny. The appropriate balance between short- and long-term management will also depend on the period under consideration  since it will take a long time to eliminate LOF alleles from the population if carriers are allowed to qualify as parents because they will continue to generate heterozygous carrier offspring. As sequencing projects identify more essential loci and LOF alleles  breed associations will need to develop policies on the management of lethal recessive alleles. When considering the amount of emphasis to place on lethal recessive genetic conditions  decisions on the appropriate balance of short- or long-term management of LOF alleles should be made first. If short-term management is prioritized  essentially by decreasing the occurrence of affected calves ()  the optimal solutions from the scenarios presented here suggest that a slight emphasis is sufficient for improved mate allocation to avoid LOF carrier matings at the same locus. However  if long-term management of LOF alleles is also considered as important  there would be value in decreasing the number of carrier animals within the population  and some value would need to be assigned to avoiding carrier parents to achieve this objective. While short-term profit might be maximized by strategy 2  some weighting should be given to long-term elimination of defects from the population using some weighting on strategy 1. Future research will likely elucidate a more accurate representation of the approximate number of loci affected by LOF mutations and the frequencies at which they occur within cattle populations. Once this becomes clearer  optimal mating and genotyping strategies to maximize overall producer profit can be modeled  although it will be necessary to consider the appropriate balance between avoidance of carrier matings (i.e.  short-term producer benefit) and eliminating defects (i.e.  long-term industry benefit)  which will likely vary depending on the stakeholder. It is likely that the management of a suite of recessive lethal conditions will require the use of mate allocation programs such as MateSel to incorporate LOF information into mate selection decisions. The most profitable short-term breeding strategy given a perfect knowledge on LOF genotypes was simultaneous selection and mate allocation to avoid the potential for producing homozygous affected offspring compared to indiscriminate selection against carrier parents in the simulations modeled in our study. Before accounting for genotyping costs  $P increased within each simulation and breeding strategy as the percentage of the herd genotyped increased. However  genotyping 100% of the herd did not result in the maximum net profit when accounting for genotyping costs. Genotyping some percentage of the herd tended to show the greatest net profit increase in scenarios where a large number (=<U+2009>50) of loci were associated with LOF alleles. Genotyping information does enable better management of lethal recessive alleles; however  the value of that information must be weighed carefully against the associated genotyping costs. As more LOF alleles are identified  it is likely that some genotyping information combined with mate selection software will be required to correctly manage this information and optimize mate selection and allocation to simultaneously increase genetic gain  control inbreeding  minimize recessive lethal matings  and maximize net profit from breeding decisions.

To achieve this goal  we used 10 male and 10 female phenotypes  which were measured in a population of 2111 Australian Brahman cattle genotyped at high-density.ResultsHeritability estimates ranged from very low (0.03<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 for cows’ days to calving at first calving opportunity  DC1)  to moderate (0.33<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 for cows’ adult body weight  AWTc)  and to high (0.95<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 for cows’ hip height  HHc). Genetic correlation (r) estimates between male and female homologous traits were favorable and ranged from moderate to high values  which indicate that selection for any of the traits in one sex would lead to a correlated response with the equivalent phenotype in the other sex. However  the estimated direct response was greater than the indirect response. Moreover  Pearson correlations between estimated breeding values obtained from each sex separately and from female and male homologous traits combined into a single trait in univariate analysis ranged from 0.74 to 0.99  which indicate that small ranking variation might appear if male and female traits are included as single or separate phenotypes. Genetic correlations between male growth and female reproductive traits were not significant  ranging from -<U+2009>0.07<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.13 to 0.45<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.65. However  selection to improve HHc and AWTc in cows may reduce the percentage of normal sperm at 24 months of age (PNS24)  possibly due to correlated effects in the same traits in males  which are related to late maturing animals.ConclusionsHip height in cows and PNS24  as well as blood insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) concentration in bulls at 6 months of age are efficient selection criteria to improve male growth and female reproductive traits  simultaneously. In the presence of genotype-by-sex interactions  selection for traits in each sex results in high rates of genetic improvement  however  for the identification of animals with the highest breeding value  data for males and females may be considered a single trait."

However  selection to improve HHc and AWTc in cows may reduce the percentage of normal sperm at 24 months of age (PNS24)  possibly due to correlated effects in the same traits in males  which are related to late maturing animals. Hip height in cows and PNS24  as well as blood insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) concentration in bulls at 6 months of age are efficient selection criteria to improve male growth and female reproductive traits  simultaneously. In the presence of genotype-by-sex interactions  selection for traits in each sex results in high rates of genetic improvement  however  for the identification of animals with the highest breeding value  data for males and females may be considered a single trait. Genetic improvement using breeding techniques such as best linear unbiased prediction of breeding values relies on recording phenotypes. Growth and reproductive traits are two of the most important production traits for cattle breeding systems. On the one hand  growth traits are directly associated to meat  the main sales product of beef cattle [] and  on the other hand  reproductive traits are a relevant component of economic performance in beef cattle industry [  ]. In some cases  these traits are difficult to record or cannot be recorded on the selection candidate  for example  when they are expressed late in life or only in one sex (sex-limited). Furthermore  traits with a low heritability () are expected to have small rates of genetic improvement. In this situation  indirect selection offers an efficient means of increasing response to selection. For instance  scrotal circumference at a young age  semen quality  and some male hormone levels have been suggested as selection criteria to improve female reproduction traits [  ]. Phenotypic means of many traits differ between sexes  and this pattern  which is termed sexual dimorphism  is generally believed to be adaptive []. Within-sex variability may have implications for population dynamics  for example  if selection promotes the fixation (or loss) of mutations having sex-limited beneficial (or detrimental) effects []. Therefore  if the expression of homologous traits in both sexes is determined to a large extent by different genes  female and male expressions should be treated as separate traits []. In scenarios with extreme sexual dimorphism  this could require the implementation of specific selection breeding programs for females and males. Thus  having knowledge about the associations between male and female traits allows us to choose the most efficient selection methods and criteria for better selection decisions. Thus  the aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of male and female growth and reproductive traits to guide the identification of selection criteria in multiple-trait genetic evaluation to increase the rate of genetic improvement in both sexes and  for sex-influenced traits  to evaluate the impact of sex-by-genotype interactions on growth and reproductive traits. Animal Care and Use Committee approval was not obtained for this study because historical data was used and no animals were handled as part of the study. Analyses were performed on phenotypic data and DNA samples that had been collected previously as part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Beef Genetic Technologies (Beef CRC; ). The animals  phenotypes and genotypes that were used in this study were a subset of those controlled by the Cooperative Research Centre for Beef Genetic Technologies northern breeding project. The animals were reared under a range of extensive environments at four research stations in Queensland; details of routine management  health treatments and supplementary feeding regimes are reported in Johnston et al. []  Burns et al. []  Wolcott et al. [] and Porto-Neto et al. []. In brief  we used data on 2111 Brahman cows and bulls that were genotyped by using either the BovineSNP50 [] or the BovineHD (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA)  which includes more than 770 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Animals that were genotyped with a lower density array had their genotypes imputed to higher density as described by Bolormaa et al. []. For the present study  we used 651 253 SNPs mapped to autosomal chromosomes and with a minor allele frequency higher than 5% in the entire population of cows and bulls. In total  995 Brahman females and 1116 Brahman males were available for this study. They were measured for a range of reproductive and growth traits including: age at detection of the first corpus luteum (ACL  days); age at an estimated scrotal circumference of 26 cm (AGE26  days); days-to-calve at first calving opportunity  defined by days from start of specified mating season to subsequent calving (DC1  days); days-to-calve averaged for 5 breeding opportunities (DC5  days); blood concentration of IGF1 at 6 (males) and 18 (females) months of age (IGF1  ng/mL); blood concentration of inhibin at 4 months of age in males (IN4  ng/mL); eye muscle area at mature adult age in females and post yearling in males (EMA  cm2); hip height at mature adult age in females and post yearling in males (HH  cm); body weight at mature adult age in females and post yearling in males (AWT  kg); percentage of normal sperm at 24 months of age (PNS24   %); post-partum anoestrus interval (PPAI  days); scrotal circumference at 12 months of age (SC12  cm); body condition score at yearling (BCS  points 1–10); and body weight at yearling (YWT  kg). Description of all traits  and their means and standard deviations are in Table . The dataset included 110 known sires  with an average of 18.8 progeny and a number of progeny ranging from 1 to 57  and 1433 known dams  with an average of 1.4 progeny and a number of progeny ranging from 1 to 7. All analyses were carried out using the AIRemlf90 software program []. Estimates of variance components for each pair of male and female traits were obtained using the genomic best linear unbiased prediction method in a series of 100 bivariate analyses (i.e. from 10 traits in males and 10 traits in females). In all cases  the same genomic relationship matrix () was used and computed following Method 1 of VanRaden []. The distribution of the genomic relationship coefficients both within and across sexes is shown in Fig. . Frequency distribution for genomic relationship coefficients among females (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>995  left panels)  males (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1116  middle panels) and all animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2111  right panels)  among 2111 animals (top panels) and among animals with a relationship coefficient higher than 0.1 (bottom panels) The following general mixed model [] was used to estimate variance and covariance components for each pair of traits: where  and  represent the phenotypic observations for males () and females ()  respectively   is the incidence matrix relating fixed effects in  with observations in  and    is the incidence matrix that allocates records to breeding values in  for every individual in the relationship matrix (both males and females)  and  and  are the random residual effects for males and females  respectively. The fixed effects included in the model were specific for each evaluated trait and are described in Table . The fixed effects of contemporary group (72 levels for females and 60 levels for male)  laboratory assay batch (52 levels)  age of dam and age of the animal at the time of recording (linear covariable) were considered and included in the model when significant. The efficiency of the correlated response (ECR) to selection was obtained by: where  is the expected correlated response per generation relative to a given female trait by selecting for the male trait   is the expected direct response per generation relative to a given female trait   represents the genetic correlation of a trait measured in females and males obtained in bivariate analysis   and  represent the square root of the heritability  for females and males  respectively. The efficiency of predictive power of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for the same trait measured in both sexes was determined by the ratio of correlations between the adjusted phenotype for a given sex and GEBV in the same sex or the opposite sex. In other words  for any given trait  two GEBV were obtained  i.e. the female and male GEBV  both of the same dimension and equal to the total number of animals (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2111) including 995 females and 1116 males. The correlation between the within-sex GEBV and the adjusted phenotype was computed separately for the animals of each sex. In addition to the analyses previously described  six single-trait analyses were performed  in which female and male homologous traits were combined into a single trait. These analyses  which included sex and all the other fixed effects cited above  were performed to estimate the genetic parameters and GEBV  and to compare the results from the analyses that treat traits either separately for each sex or combined for both sexes. Table  shows the additive and residual variances  heritability estimates and corresponding standard errors (SE) for all evaluated traits. Values are available for bivariate models in which traits were included for each sex separately  and for univariate analyses in which traits for both sexes are combined into a single trait. For bivariate models  the values presented are the average of 10 estimates obtained for each trait. When estimated separately  male and female genetic parameters were usually different  whereas those obtained for the sex-combined trait had intermediate values. For instance  estimates of additive genetic variance<U+2009>±<U+2009>SE for BCS were equal to 0.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02 and 0.42<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 for males and females  respectively  and 0.20<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02 for the sex-combined trait (Table ). In spite of differences in the estimates of variance components  the estimates of the heritability  for male and female traits were similar  except for the HH trait  for which  was higher in females (0.95<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07) than in males (0.62<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07). In general   estimates ranged from moderate to high values  which indicates that the means for the traits evaluated can be modified through selection. For growth traits (YWT  AWT  and HH)   estimates ranged from 0.33<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 to 0.95<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07. For EMA  they were moderate in both females (0.35<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09) and males (0.38<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08). Higher  estimates were obtained for hormone levels  i.e. 0.41<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 for insulin-like growth factor 1 in cows (IGF1c)  0.51<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 for IGF1 in bulls (IGF1b) and 0.71<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 for IN4 levels. Some female reproductive traits including ACL and PPAI had high  of 0.58<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 and 0.42<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.10  respectively  and could be used as selection criteria to improve such traits in females (Table ). However  for DC1 and DC5   estimates were much lower at 0.03<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05 and 0.29<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09  respectively. In addition  the genetic variability of these traits is limited in Brahman cattle  thus they will respond slowly to selection  especially DC1. For some male reproductive traits (AGE26  SC12 and IN4 levels)   estimates were high with values higher than 0.56<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07  whereas for PNS24   was low  i.e. 0.13<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 (Table ). Estimated genetic correlations between homologous male and female traits were favorable and ranged from moderate to high values (0.55<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 to 0.83<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06; Fig. )  this indicates that selection for any of these would lead to a correlated response in the other sex. Heat map of the genomic correlations estimated between ten male and ten female growth and reproductive traits (as described in Table ) in Brahman cattle The lowest genetic correlations were estimated between AWT in cows and bulls (0.55<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09)  and between EMA in cows and bulls (0.57<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.16) (Fig. )  which indicate the presence of genotype-by-sex interactions for these traits. The efficiency of the correlated responses between male and female homologous traits was favorable but lower than 1  indicating the superiority of direct over indirect selection [see Additional file : Figure S1]  except for HH for which selection in cows was estimated to result in 127% of the response obtained by direct selection of HH in bulls. Similarly  selection for HH in cows could be an effective selection criterion for improving additional male growth traits since it was estimated to be associated with 108% and 119% of the response obtained by direct selection of YWT and AWT in bulls  respectively. Furthermore  Pearson correlations of 0.94  0.87  0.74  0.95  0.92  and 0.77 were obtained between GEBV of the six male and female homologous IGF1  YWT  AWT  HH  BCS  and EMA phenotypes in the bivariate analyses  respectively [see Additional file : Figure S2]  and similarly Pearson correlations between GEBV from the analyses for sex-combined traits and for traits separately for each sex ranged from 0.88 to 0.99 [see Additional file : Figure S1]. Therefore  in spite of differences between direct and indirect selection responses  small variations in ranking would be expected regardless of whether the GEBV was obtained from the same sex phenotype or the opposite-sex phenotype when both male and female phenotypes are available. In addition  the six homologous traits allowed us to explore the relative weight of each (male or female) source of information in the resulting GEBV when this GEBV is used to predict the opposite sex. We based these calculations on the correlation of the GEBV of a given trait and sex with the adjusted phenotype for the same or opposite sex. Thus  when exploring the efficiency with which GEBV predict the six homologous traits across sexes  GEBV for one sex was explored against (correlated with) the adjusted phenotype separately for each sex. The ratio between these two correlations reflects the efficiency of predictive power of a GEBV when used to predict the opposite sex. We found that the GEBV benefits for the opposite sex phenotype were around 10% smaller than those obtained from the same sex phenotype (Table ). For instance  the correlation between the GEBV for IGF1 blood concentration measured in females and the adjusted phenotype for females is 0.48  whereas the correlation between the GEBV for IGF1 blood concentration measured in females and the adjusted phenotype for males is 0.42  i.e. equivalent to 88% of 0.48. Similarly  the correlation between the GEBV for IGF1 blood concentration measured in males and the adjusted phenotype for females is 0.35  which is 95% of the 0.37 correlation observed between the GEBV for IGF1 blood concentration measured in males and the adjusted phenotype for males. The values for efficiency of predictive power reflect the within-sex heritability estimates and the across-sex genetic correlations. Estimated genetic correlations for the same trait in the two sexes were moderately to strongly positive and ranged from 0.55<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 for AWT to 0.83<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06 for HH (Fig.  and Additional file : Table S1). However  genetic correlations were negative between BCS in one sex and either YWT  AWT or HH in the other sex. The reproductive traits in males (PNS24  SC12  and AGE26) were favorably associated to ACL (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.54<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 for ACL and PNS24; -<U+2009>0.30<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 for ACL and SC12 and 0.25<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 for ACL and AGE26). The genetic correlation between PNS24 and PPAI was also strong (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.66<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05; Fig. ). However  selection for reproductive traits in males is associated with only 29% and 20% of the improvement obtained by direct selection of ACL and PPAI  respectively. These results may be partially explained by the  estimates for female being higher than for male reproductive traits. The standard errors of the genetic correlations between EMA in one sex and growth and reproductive traits in the other sex were high  which indicate that there was no significant association between EMA and the other evaluated traits. The genetic correlation between IGF1c and male reproductive traits (PNS24  SC12  and AGE26) were favorable and of moderate magnitude (Fig.  Additional file : Table S1). The genetic correlation and estimated efficiency of the correlated response (ECR) in parenthesis were equal to 0.26<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 (0.88) for IGF1c and PNS24; 0.41<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.13 (0.32) for IGF1c and SC12  and -<U+2009>0.37<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08 (-<U+2009>0.25) for IGF1c and AGE26. The genetic correlation between IGF1b and female reproductive traits (ACL and PPAI) were favorable  with ECR of -<U+2009>0.47 and -<U+2009>0.35 for ACL and PPAI  respectively. Furthermore  IGF1b was associated to growth traits in females with estimated genetic correlations of -<U+2009>0.31<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 between IGF1b and HH in cows (HHc); -<U+2009>0.60<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 between IGF1b and YWT in cows (YWTc); and 0.35<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 between IGF1b and AWT. Estimated genetic correlations of IGF1c or IGF1b with growth traits were either negative or non-significant and ranged from -<U+2009>0.55<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 between IGF1b and YWT in cows  to 0.10<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.13 between IGF1c and AWT in bulls  with an ECR ranging from -<U+2009>0.64 to 0.09. The standard errors associated with the estimated genetic correlations between IN4 in bulls and all other traits in cows were high  which indicate that there was no significant genetic correlation between IN4 and the other traits. High standard errors were associated with the estimated genetic correlations between male growth traits and female reproductive traits  which means that the estimated genetic correlations did not significantly differ from zero. However  selection for increased AWTc and HHc was expected to result in lower PNS24 (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.49<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05 and -<U+2009>0.40<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04  respectively). Although males and females share close genetic architectures  sexual differences are widespread []. In our study  we found differences in the additive and residual variances of homologous traits in males and females  which could be partially explained by a distinct expression of alleles or genes through sexual antagonism []  distinct mutational effects between males and females [  ]  presence of sex-specific dominance effects []  and/or differences in environmental treatments (such as differences in age at measurement of EMA in this study). Rowe and Houle [] suggested that females are expected to experience stabilizing natural selection on most traits  leading to a reduction in additive variance  while males are expected to experience directional selection on mating-related traits  which could reduce or increase additive variance. In breeding systems  differences in the intensity of selection between sexes could change the additive genetic variance in each sex. Except for DC1  we found moderate to high  estimates for the evaluated phenotypes  which indicate that these traits can be used in genetic selection programs. For DC1  the  estimates was close to zero  which indicates a greater influence of environmental factors. Moreover  since the dataset included only fertile females and no non-calving females  trait variability and genetic differences between animals may be masked []  which could partially explain  this low . Similarly to our results  Meyer et al. []  Johnston and Bunter []  Mercadante et al. [] and Mucari et al. [] reported  estimates for days to calve lower than 0.1. Exploring the correlated response could be more efficient to achieve the highest rates of genetic progress than direct selection for low  traits. The across-sex genetic correlations  whether positive or negative  mean that sex-specific homologous traits are not free to evolve independently. It is possible to explore the correlated response when selection is applied in only one sex. However  this correlated response depends on the genetic correlation between the pair of traits and the  estimates for each sex. For instance  if a directional selection is applied for homologous traits in the two sexes  the ability of each sex to reach its optimum will be maximally constrained at r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and not constrained at r<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 []. In our study  the presence of genotype-by-sex interactions for EMA and AWT was established based on the heterogeneity of the additive and residual variances and on the r estimates between homologous traits being lower than the threshold of 0.70 proposed by Mulder et al. []. Based on the values of variances  accuracies  genetic correlations and efficiency of correlated response between these homologous traits  we should recommend a sex-specific genetic evaluation  because a given trait measured in each sex cannot be considered as the same trait. However  the strong Pearson correlations between GEBV obtained from same-sex phenotype information and opposite-sex phenotype information as well as the strong Pearson correlations between GEBV from analyses of traits treated separately for each sex and of combined-sex traits indicate that data collection of homologous traits in one sex contributes to estimate GEBV in the other sex. When both male and female phenotypes are included in the analyses  considering male and female phenotypes as a single trait may have no practical impact on selection and ranking of animals. Most breeding companies assume a genetic correlation of 1 between male and female traits because combined-sex analyses require a simpler model and less computational demand []. Similar results are found in the literature i.e. Van Vleck and Cundiff [] reported an r between homologous growth traits in males and females higher than 0.85  van der Heide et al. [] found an r between male and female post-weaning productive traits that ranged from 0.68 to 0.84  while Raidan et al. [] obtained an r of 0.96 for final weight and 0.74 for average daily gain in male and female Nellore cattle raised on pasture. A genetic correlation lower than 1 between male and female traits could be due to limitations of the experimental design and size  or to differences in the performance testing environments between females and males (for instance  differences at age of measurement of EMA in this study)  or differences in the genetic bases and/or selection objectives  and means and standard deviations in each sex []. A further explanation is the existence of differences between the sex chromosomes which  although not used in the present study  might still harbour differing genetic variation for productive traits in males and females []. We observed high and favorable genetic associations between male and female growth traits  thus  if the purpose is to increase growth traits  those with the higher  estimates could be used as selection criteria because faster genetic changes can be reached by selecting such traits. In this study  the highest  estimate was obtained for HHc  and thus it could be used as a selection criterion for growth traits. Similarly  Regatieri et al. [] showed positive and moderate genetic correlations estimates of AWT with HH (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01) and concluded that selection for HH may be advantageous in extensive rearing systems since this type of selection is a reliable alternative to control frame size and  consequently  AWT in beef cattle. The monitoring of animal size allows the selection of biotypes that are compatible with the production system since animals with a larger mature size are associated with higher maintenance costs. Previous studies have shown a positive genetic correlation  higher than 0.5  between frame scores and growth traits in beef cattle [   ]. However  our results showed negative genetic correlations between BCS and YWT and between AWT and HH  which suggest the existence of pleotropic or linked genes that allow growth improvement while maintaining smaller-frame size. In beef cattle breeding programs  scrotal circumference (SC) is frequently used as a selection criterion to improve male and female reproductive traits [  ]. However  it is worth noting that the age at which the traits are recorded has a strong impact on the across-sex correlated response. In taurine breeds  SC recorded at an early age (~<U+2009>300 days of age) better reflects female precocity than a later record []  whereas in tropical breeds that  in general  mature later than taurine cattle  SC12 is a modest genetic predictor of heifer age at puberty []. In agreement with Johnston et al. []  our results showed that the genetic correlations between PNS24  AGE26 and female reproductive traits were stronger than those between SC12 and female reproductive traits  which suggest that PNS24 and AGE26 are better selection criteria for reproduction traits. This can be partly explained by the fact that PNS24 and AGE26 are more strongly associated with puberty in tropical cattle than SC12. In spite of their higher  estimates  male and female traits such as PNS24  hormone levels  PPAI and ACL  have been less exploited in breeding schemes [  ]. Therefore  measurements in bulls for traits such as PNS24  IGF1  and AGE26  are potentially useful as indirect selection criteria for improving female reproduction in tropical breeds. IGF1c level was a satisfactory selection criterion for male reproductive traits  especially PNS24  while IGF1b level showed a favorable association with ACL  YWTc and HHc  and a negative genetic correlation with AWTc. Yilmaz et al. [] reported that IGF1 level measured in pre-pubertal  bulls is genetically correlated with adult scrotal circumference  sperm motility  age at first calving and calving rate. These authors confirmed that IGF1 plays an important role in follicular development and ovulation in cattle because IGF1 receptors and estrogen receptors interact to regulate female reproduction and behavior. IGF1 is synthesized in almost all the tissues and has a positive effect on cell proliferation  transformation  and differentiation. The maternal plasma IGF1 concentration plays an important role in energy balance  average daily gain and nutritional regulation of post-partum reproductive performance in cattle []. Miah et al. [] reported that with the addition of IGF1 in vitro  some spermatozoa characteristics such as progressive motility  induction of capacitation and acrosome reaction have increased  which may partially explain the moderately positive genetic correlation between PNS24 and IGF1c obtained in our study. Furthermore  endocrine IGF1 level acting as a monitoring signal that allows reproductive events to occur when nutritional conditions for successful reproduction are reached []. Similarly  IGF1 levels have been shown to be an important regulator of energy metabolism  which may explain the favorable genetic correlation between IGF1b and female growth traits []. In males  inhibin is produced mainly by the Sertoli cells and acts in an endocrine manner to negatively regulate the synthesis and release of follicle-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary gland []  which explains the genetic correlation between male reproductive traits and IN4 []. Moreover  Corbet et al. [] showed a moderate genetic correlation of 0.36<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 between IGF1 and IN4 measured in males  and Fortes et al. [] showed that the gene  is associated with both  IN4 and IGF1b. Cai et al. [] also observed that  when inhibin A was silenced in Sertoli cells  the expression of IGF1 decreased  which suggests a correlation between these traits. However  we did not find a significant association between IGF1c and IN4. We confirmed the lack of relevant associations between male growth and female reproductive traits previously reported by Meyer et al. []  Johnston and Bunter []; Mercadante et al. [] and Monteiro et al. []. Mercadante et al. [] reported that a genetic correlation of almost 0 was found between yearling weight in performance-tested young bulls in feedlots (378 days of age) and days to calving of the first mating in Nellore cattle. Later  Monteiro et al. [] showed that selection for increased yearling weight had no effect on either the development of the ovaries and the endometrium or the onset of puberty at 24 months of age in heifers. To our knowledge  genetic correlations between female growth traits and male reproductive traits have not been reported in the literature; however  our results support the use of AWTc and HHc as selection criteria to improve PNS24. Hip height in females is an efficient selection criterion to improve male growth  whereas selection for percentage of normal sperm at 24 months of age and IGF1 blood concentration in bulls at 6 months of age results in only a modest improvement of female reproductive traits. In the presence of genotype-by-sex interactions  within-sex selection is expected to result in high rates of genetic improvement; however  the results of our analyses for traits treated separately for each sex and combined for both sexes showed no practical differences for the identification of animals with extreme breeding values.

Genotyping  and therefore genomic selection (GS)  concern only a subpopulation of the breeding programme’s wider dairy population. These features of a breeding programme contribute in different ways to the rate of genetic gain for the wider industry.MethodsA deterministic recursive gene flow model across subpopulations of animals in a dairy industry was created to predict the commercial performance of replacement heifers and future artificial insemination bulls. Various breeding strategies were assessed by varying the reliability of breeding values  the genetic contributions from subpopulations  and the genetic trend and merit of the foreign subpopulation.ResultsA higher response in the true breeding goal measured in standard deviations (SD) of true merit () after 20 years of selection can be achieved when genetic contributions shift towards higher merit alternatives compared to keeping them fixed. A foreign annual genetic trend of 0.08 SD of the breeding goal  while the domestic genetic trend is 0.10 SD  results in the overall net present value of genetic gain increasing by 1.2  2.3  and 3.4% after 20 years as the reliability of GS in the domestic population increased from 0.3 to 0.45  0.60 and 0.75. With a foreign genetic trend of 0.10 SD  these increases are more modest; 0.9  1.7  and 2.4%. Increasing the foreign genetic trend so that it is higher than the domestic trend erodes the benefits of increasing the reliability of domestic GS further.ConclusionsHaving a foreign source of genetic material with a high rate of genetic progress contributes substantially to the benefits of domestic genetic progress while at the same time reducing the expected returns from investments to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction in the home country."

Various breeding strategies were assessed by varying the reliability of breeding values  the genetic contributions from subpopulations  and the genetic trend and merit of the foreign subpopulation. A higher response in the true breeding goal measured in standard deviations (SD) of true merit () after 20 years of selection can be achieved when genetic contributions shift towards higher merit alternatives compared to keeping them fixed. A foreign annual genetic trend of 0.08 SD of the breeding goal  while the domestic genetic trend is 0.10 SD  results in the overall net present value of genetic gain increasing by 1.2  2.3  and 3.4% after 20 years as the reliability of GS in the domestic population increased from 0.3 to 0.45  0.60 and 0.75. With a foreign genetic trend of 0.10 SD  these increases are more modest; 0.9  1.7  and 2.4%. Increasing the foreign genetic trend so that it is higher than the domestic trend erodes the benefits of increasing the reliability of domestic GS further. Having a foreign source of genetic material with a high rate of genetic progress contributes substantially to the benefits of domestic genetic progress while at the same time reducing the expected returns from investments to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction in the home country. Subpopulations of dairy cattle exist within every country’s dairy industry. Herd owners within these subpopulations tend to place emphasis on different aspects of their farming enterprises and therefore make different breeding decisions []. In addition  subpopulations are made up of cows that differ in average genetic merit. All breeding decisions made in these subpopulations contribute to the aggregate industry rate of genetic gain. Genetic improvement in production traits of dairy cattle will contribute obvious economic benefits and benefits to the environment [   ]. In 2001  Meuwissen et al. [] proposed the use of genomic selection (GS) to increase the rate of genetic gain in animals. In dairy cattle  GS leads to higher accuracies of predicted genetic merit for young animals  which in turn typically lead to shorter generation intervals through higher contributions from young genetically superior bulls and heifers  and to increased selection intensity since GS can be used to test larger groups of potentially elite animals than traditional progeny testing structures. These factors have been estimated to double the rate of genetic progress for economically important dairy traits [  ]. In American dairy cattle  GS has been demonstrated to increase genetic gain by<U+2009>~<U+2009>50 to 100% for yield traits and from threefold to fourfold for lowly heritable traits []. Thus  GS has radically changed many dairy breeding programmes. In a domestic dairy cattle industry  it is common that certain subpopulations of herds drive most of the genetic gain because  compared to other subpopulations  they place more emphasis on elite bulls that are identified through GS. For these subpopulations  more animals are genotyped  and more phenotypic data are collected  thus they can contain superior dams compared to the national average. These features often result in strong relationships with artificial insemination (AI) companies  which place a significant emphasis on breeding a new generation of high merit sires using calves generated within these herds. In contrast  the majority of herds within a dairy industry will be more commercially driven. Although genetic gain will affect the commercial performance of the herd  breeding decisions may be based more on management and/or short-term considerations of costs. For example  a commercially-driven farmer may not see the advantage in genotyping calves because of genotyping costs. They may make their selection decisions for replacement heifers on the basis of management factors such as date of birth  bodyweight at selection  etc.  or they may only use daughter proven (DP) sires to breed replacements because of their higher reliabilities. Therefore  overall  these commercially-driven farmers make breeding decisions with less emphasis on genetic merit. Small-sized nucleus dairy cattle breeding programmes have been shown to be effective in developing countries where larger  national breeding programmes are more difficult to implement []. To date  how higher rates of genetic gain in smaller subpopulations affect the wider industry in developed countries has not been investigated. Gene flow models are an effective methodology to determine the outcomes of breeding strategies. Santos et al. [] investigated the genetic and economic benefits of performance recording and genotyping in different subpopulations of sheep in Australia using gene flow methodology based on the principles of multi-tiered breeding structures that were introduced many decades ago by Bichard []. Likewise  Hely et al. [] used a similar gene flow model in an Irish scenario to predict the benefits of a maternally-focused breeding programme for the Irish beef industry. A significant advantage of using gene flow prediction models over the simpler four-pathway selection approach [] is that they capture the time delays that are associated with the transition from one breeding programme state to another  rather than assuming an instantaneous shift in the rate of genetic gain achieved. This is particularly important when short generation interval breeding strategies such as GS are compared with long generation interval breeding strategies such as progeny testing  and when intermediate subpopulations exist between the main source of genetic gain and a large commercial population. While stochastic simulation modelling approaches can also model transitions  they can be cumbersome because of the long computing time required to evaluate each scenario. In this work  we investigated a number of different options for selection within  and genetic contributions from  subpopulations within a generalised dairy industry to determine their impacts on the overall rate of industry genetic progress. A deterministic recursive model with multiple flows of predicted genetic merit across subpopulations of animals was created using Microsoft Excel  to predict the genetic merit of both breeding bulls and commercial cows in a country’s dairy industry. The unit used for genetic trend  and for levels of genetic merit and of selection differentials was standard deviations of the true breeding goal (). The subpopulations created for this model are described in Table  and named active ()  passive () corresponding to the domestic cow population  and foreign () where only sires are relevant. Initially  the model was parameterised with mean values of  for sires and dams  age distributions and sire usage statistics within subpopulations. Flows of genetic merit from the  and  subpopulations to the  subpopulation via sires sourced from each one were built into the predictive model. Starting mean values and selection differentials for each sire type were set in each subpopulation such that a rate of genetic gain of 0.10  was achieved by the base model scenario. This rate of genetic gain was chosen based on the observation that annual genetic trends in dairy industries represent typically 10 to 15% of the genetic standard deviation of the aggregate merit. The impacts of various changes in breeding strategy were assessed by how much these changes contribute to the total benefits within the entire domestic dairy industry after 20 years. Then  future industry selection strategies were evaluated by manipulating three features of the model: (1) change in the reliability of breeding values due to improved genomic prediction; (2) change in the flow of genetic contributions such that sires from subpopulations with higher genetic merit have a larger genetic impact on the industry; and (3) increase or decrease in the genetic trend and genetic merit of the  subpopulation at the start of any change in breeding policy. Cows from the  subpopulation had a starting mean value of 0 . All other starting mean values were set relative to the  cows and are in Table . To calculate the industry average merit and the benefits associated with this  the  subpopulation comprised 10% of the total industry population. The remaining 90% corresponded to the  subpopulation. The  subpopulation was not included as a proportion of the total industry cow population since it contributes only through sire matings. The starting mean value for  sires was calculated as a deviation from the mean value for  cows (zero in the equation below) due to a time-lag difference in genetic trend and to the selection differential achieved in cows  as follows: where  is the mean age of a group of animals of a specific sex (sires or cows) within a subpopulation   is the source of sires (GS or DP in this case)   is the current rate of genetic gain across the entire domestic cow population and which is the same within  and  subpopulations   is the selection differential for cows in the  subpopulation (see below) and  is the proportion of cows in the  subpopulation that are of age . In the base scenario  the starting mean value for  sires was made equal to domestic DP sires. The genetic merit of AI calves born in the  subpopulation in year 0 was calculated as:  In this way  the  calves born in year 0 are superior over the genetic merit of cows born in the same year according to the current genetic trend occurring in the population. The selection differential from the cows    is removed as  at this stage  these are all calves born into the  subpopulation and not just those selected to become replacement heifers. The genetic merit of selected AI calves born in the  subpopulation in year 0 was calculated as: where  is the proportion of  calves that were sired by an AI sire originating from three different sire sources denoted . Sources of sires were  genomically selected (GS)   daughter proven (DP)  and .  is the selection differential for calves specific to each sire source of which only one half is transferred to calves. Methods used to calculate selection differentials are outlined below. The starting genetic merit of  AI and stockbull (SB) sired calves was calculated using the same algorithm as for future predicted merit values and is explained below. Mean genetic values for years prior to implementation of new model scenarios at year <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 were computed assuming that the merit of all subpopulations was evolving at a genetic trend of 0.10  per year. Values of genetic merit of  cows and SB sires in year 0 were set through trial and error such that a rate of genetic gain of 0.10  was achieved by the base model scenario. Resulting values are in Table  and the age profiles of the different animal types in the subpopulations are in Table . The mean reliabilities for dams at different ages in the subpopulations are in Table . In order to account for the lag between selection decisions and the flow of genetic contributions on the benefits from using bulls of each type  the proportion of calves by sires at different ages in each subpopulation was modelled. Each scenario was investigated by using fixed sire contributions (FSC) and responsive sire contributions (RSC). Fixed sire contributions remained unchanged throughout the timeframe of the model and were equal to 0.33  0.34  and 0.33 for  GS   DP and  sires in the base scenario  respectively. Responsive sire contributions for  sires were calculated as: where  is the proportion of total sire contributions from a sire type  and  is the genetic merit of a particular group of animals (explained in detail below). All computations of  were constrained to a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. Initially  identical sire contributions for  GS and DP sires were assumed and calculated as: for sires from source . When RSC is used  the selection differentials for GS and DP sires are updated as the contributions of sires change  which is represented by the proportion of calves selected to become sires: The reason for this is that  as the contributions from a sire type drops  the proportion of calves selected to become sires also drops  which leads to an increase in selection intensity. Selection proportions remain the same throughout the timeframe of the model for  calves and all sire types in the FSC scenarios. Future genetic trends in  and  subpopulations are estimated recursively from the genetic merit  of the future dams. Table  describes the steps necessary to calculate predictions. Benefits per cow calving are then multiplied by the industry-wide numbers of cow calvings that are impacted  i.e. 1 million. Results from the model can be easily scaled according to cow population size by multiplying by the number of millions of cows of interest. The model accounts for the delays and lags for genetic selection decisions that occur at a high level in the breeding structure to cascade down to cows over time. Cumulative discounted benefits were calculated by considering the benefits after 10 and 20 years of selection. Because of the permanent and cumulative nature of genetic improvement  these benefits were augmented in each case by assuming that the genetic merit achieved at the end of the investment period (i.e. after 10 or 20 years) would be sustained for a further 5 years. The cumulative benefits were then converted into an annualised equivalent by calculating the annual flow of discounted benefits that would provide the equivalent return as the breeding programme over a 10- or 20-year period. Cumulative benefit (expressed in ) from the national herd at the end of the investment period year ‘’ for each scenario of breeding scheme was calculated as: where  is the discount rate  taken as equal to 0.07  and  is the annual farm benefits (see Eq.  below) from the genetic improvement in year  that follows the start of the new breeding strategy  which is a function of the weighted (by cow type) average genetic merit in the national index in the base year () and after  years of selection ()  i.e.: A multiplication factor of 2 is included in Eq.  under the assumption that the breeding goal units are expressed as progeny differences  which reflect half of the total benefits when animals express the predicted genetic merit themselves. Genetic response values of calves (measured in units of ) are computed recursively by modelling flows of genetic superiority within and among subpopulations of the industry dairy population. The weighted (by cow type) average industry genetic merit for  is calculated by assuming that cows are made up of a proportion from the  herds and the balance from the  herds such that: where  and  are the modelled predicted genetic merit for cows from  herds in year  making up the proportion  of the industry  and for  herds  respectively. The genetic merit for the breeding herd of cows in any subpopulation  is calculated from the genetic merit of calves that were historically born in that subpopulation  either to SB or AI sires  as: where  is the proportion of calves of subpopulation   which are destined to become replacement cows that are sired by SB as opposed to being sired by AI   is the proportion of the cows in a herd that are of age  and  is the selection differential for cows that are selected to become replacements relative to the average merit of calves born in the same year as those selected to become replacements. The genetic merit of calves born in the  subpopulation  sired by SB and born in year  is calculated as: where the genetic merit of SB sires   (Eq. )  is in turn calculated from the weighted average genetic merit of calves weighted according to the age distribution for SB sires as: where  is the proportion of the SB sires used in a herd that are of age . While the previous two equations have interdependencies  the recursive and time lagged nature of the equations make the calculation tractable from a fixed historical trajectory of levels of genetic merit. The genetic merit of AI calves in year  depends on which other populations have contributed sires to the pool that is used to mate cows in subpopulation  and is calculated as: where  is the proportion of calves in subpopulation  that were sired by an AI sire originating from sire source . Sources of sires were considered to be  GS   DP  and . The genetic merit of sires from the  subpopulation is calculated as: where  is the proportion of sires that originate from the  subpopulation at each age  when their calves are born ( differs between  GS and  DP sires) and  (Eq. ) is calculated as: The genetic merit of sires that are sourced from foreign populations denoted  is calculated as: where  is the annual rate of improvement of  of foreign sourced bulls. Selection differentials for a class of selection candidates    were calculated as: where  is the intensity of selection   is the accuracy of selection  and  is an adjustment for the reduction in standard deviation due to highly selected parents. Accuracies were obtained by taking the square root of reliabilities modelled for the respective categories of selection candidates (listed in Table ) while the adjustment to the selection differential to account for selection of parents was: We investigated several scenarios that reflected various combinations of changes in breeding value reliability  sire usage proportions or improvements in foreign genetic trend and/or starting  sire genetic merit. Sire contribution methods (RSC and FSC) were compared to each other by adjusting two key variables. First  the impact of improvement in GS reliability was evaluated using reliability values for total economic merit of 0.3  0.45  0.6  and 0.75. Second  the impact of foreign genetic trend was evaluated using annual trend values of 0.08  0.1  0.12  and 0.14. For these scenarios  it was assumed that all domestic sire contributions were split evenly between GS and DP sires  since factors such as confidence  risk  and past habits drive farmer preferences between GS and DP sires  rather than the levels of genetic merit within the two groups of sires. The impacts of increasing GS relative to DP sire contributions were evaluated for a subset of scenarios in which the foreign genetic trend was set to be equal to the domestic trend of 0.10. The range of GS reliability values (0.3  0.45  0.6  and 0.75) were tested at three proportional splits of domestic GS and DP sire contributions. The modelled breakdown between GS and DP sires considered were: 0.5 each; 0.5 increasing to 0.9 by 0.08 per year for GS at the expense of DP; and 0.8 GS sires and 0.2 DP sires from year 1. A further set of scenarios was created to consider a closed dairy industry that was subsequently opened to imported foreign semen and/or sires  for the first time. For these scenarios  foreign genetic trends of 0.08  0.1  and 0.12 were tested with the starting genetic merit of the  subpopulation being either higher than that of domestic sires at 0.5 or lower than that of domestic sires  but equal to that of  dams at 0. The mean genetic merit of commercial cows () from years 12 to 25 of the new selection strategy for scenarios with a high (0.14) or low (0.08) foreign genetic trend  responsive or fixed sire contributions  and a high (0.75) or low (0.30) genomic selection reliability are presented in Fig. . Years 0 to 11 are not represented in Fig.  since differences in cow genetic merit up to year 12 were minimal. This slow impact of the new selection strategies is caused by gene flow lags with benefits due to a change in the breeding program taking several years to reach a large proportion of the commercial cow population. As shown in Fig.   the foreign genetic trend has a larger impact on the mean industry genetic merit than GS reliability. The effect of responsive sire contributions depends on the interaction between GS reliability and foreign genetic trend. At a low foreign genetic trend  RSC allows the use of more GS sires as GS reliability improves. At a high foreign genetic trend  RSC allows the use of more foreign sires in the situation of low GS reliability. Mean industry genetic merit from years 12 to 25 of the new selection strategy for scenarios with high (blue  0.14) or low (green  0.08) foreign genetic trend  responsive (solid) or fixed (dashed) sire contributions  and high (dark  0.75) or low (light  0.30) genomic selection reliability The cumulative net present values after 20 years of modelling for each new scenario comparing RSC and FSC are in Fig. . In all scenarios  except one scenario for which results are equal  RSC delivers a higher genetic response (measured in standard deviations of the breeding goal) at 20 years compared to FSC when scenarios have the same GS reliability and foreign genetic trend. For example  using a foreign genetic trend of 0.08 with the domestic genetic trend being equal to 0.10  the NPV of genetic gain after 20 years of selection is increased by 1.2  2.3 and 3.4% when the GS reliability is increased from 0.3 in steps of 0.15 to 0.45  0.6 and 0.75  respectively  when sire contributions are calculated by RSC (Fig. ). For the same scenarios  but using FSC  the increases were 0.95  1.6  and 2.2% after 20 years with the same increases in GS reliability. With a higher foreign genetic trend of 0.1  the impacts on the cumulative NPV of genetic gain at year 20 of increasing GS reliability are more modest (0.9  1.7  and 2.4% with RSC  and 0.8  1.6  and 2.2% with FSC). At a foreign genetic trend of 0.12  the scenarios return results of 0.6  1.2  and 1.7% increase per cow for RSC after 20 years. Finally  scenarios using a foreign genetic trend that is substantially larger than the domestic trend  0.14 for foreign versus 0.10 for domestic  have NPV percentage increases of 0.4  0.8  and 1.1% per cow after 20 years for RSC. Increasing the foreign genetic trend so that it is higher than the domestic trend erodes the benefits of increasing domestic GS reliability further  and consequently the magnitude of the difference between RSC and FSC is also reduced (Fig. ). Predicted cumulative net present value at 20 years in units of standard deviation of the breeding goal expressed per cow at different foreign genetic trends  GS reliabilities and sire contribution types. R for responsive sire contributions; F for fixed sire contributions; FOR for foreign genetic trend. The levels of foreign sire contributions after 20 years are annotated onto the corresponding data point For a situation that modelled  sires as having no contribution and instead all contributions being split equally between domestic GS and domestic DP sires  the NPV of genetic gains increased by 1.9  3.5  and 4.9% with increasing GS accuracy. Increasing GS reliability has the largest impact on cumulative NPV when the foreign sire contributions are fixed at zero. Figure  also shows the effect of increasing GS reliability for different foreign genetic trends  and how the foreign sire contributions at 20 years changed under the RSC scenarios. At a high foreign genetic trend  higher GS reliability reduces moderately the relative impacts of foreign sires. At a low foreign genetic trend  high GS reliability reduces the foreign sire contributions after 20 years to a greater extent. The time trajectory of foreign sire contributions for the different scenarios are shown in Fig. . The foreign genetic trend has a bigger impact on these trajectories than does the GS reliability  which is partly due to the delay before the higher GS reliability increases the merit of candidate bulls of breeding age. Foreign sire contributions over time for different scenarios using responsive sire contributions. Foreign genetic trends used in included scenarios are equal to 0.14 (gold)  0.12 (grey)  0.10 (orange)  and 0.08 (blue). Genomic selection reliability used in included scenarios are 0.3 (solid)  0.45 (round dot)  0.6 (short dash)  and 0.75 (dash dot) Table  shows the impacts of increasing GS sire contributions  at the expense of DP sire contributions  on the benefits that arise from improving GS reliability. The trend is similar for all scenarios  with NPV increasing as the modelled GS reliability increased but NPV increasing at a steeper rate when GS sires have higher contributions. The percentage differences per cow relative to the scenario with the lowest modelled GS reliability were 0.9  1.7  and 2.4% for domestic sire contributions of 0.5 each for GS and DP sires; 1.5  2.9  and 4.2% for sire domestic contributions of 0.5 increasing to 0.9 for GS sires at the expense of DP sires; and 1.5  2.9  and 4.3% for sire domestic contributions of 0.8 for GS versus 0.2 for DP sires. The results of the scenario for an industry that imports foreign genetics for the first time are in Table . Scenarios using a high starting genetic merit for  sires and a low foreign trend have an increased cumulative NPV after 20 years compared to a base scenario that has no  sire contributions. The increased NPV relative to a base scenario with no  sire contributions increased further  as the modelled foreign trend increased to levels that were similar to that of the domestic trend (0.1) or higher (0.12)  while starting foreign sire merit was high. When starting foreign sire merit and the foreign genetic trend are both low  cumulative NPV is reduced compared to a base scenario that has no  sires. However  with a low starting  sire merit  cumulative NPV increases when the modelled foreign genetic trend is the same as  or higher  than the domestic trend. This is somewhat surprising  especially in the scenario in which the foreign genetic trend is equal to that of the domestic sires but the foreign sire starting merit is low. However  here the low starting merit of foreign sires is still higher than that of domestic DP sires and therefore gains can be achieved by using these sires. In 2006  Schaeffer showed that genomic selection can double the rate of genetic gain at significantly reduced costs compared to a traditional progeny testing strategy []. Since then  GS has become a widely used tool in dairy cattle breeding programmes worldwide. However  in many cases  genotyping  and therefore GS  concern only a subpopulation of the breeding programme’s wider dairy population. This is due to the costs involved in genotyping  herd management factors  or perhaps farmer preference or knowledge of GS. Therefore  we have developed a model to investigate the effects on genetic gain of focusing GS on a subpopulation of dairy cattle within a breeding programme that is strongly influenced by the importation of sires and/or semen from other countries. The standard approach of modelling genetic gain in cattle populations  which was introduced by Rendel and Robertson []  is steady state  and therefore does not account for the long time lags before changes in selection strategy flow through the population. These delays are exacerbated when subpopulations exist within a larger population because of the additional time lags for benefits to flow from bull breeding herds to the larger commercial population (the  and  subpopulations here). In the scenarios that we investigated  the levels of genetic merit in the  subpopulation typically lag the  subpopulation by 7 years (results not shown). These modelling issues could also be addressed by using stochastic simulation [  ]  but these can be complex to build and computationally intensive  especially if subpopulations are considered. Our model can be parameterised from industry data and used to test efficiently a large range of scenarios. There is further potential to expand the model by subdividing a country’s dairy industry into an even larger number of smaller subpopulations such as research herds  contract mating herds  etc.  to investigate how the breeding decisions made in these subpopulations result in greater industry genetic gain. The model presented here includes foreign sire contributions by taking the foreign genetic trend into account. Although other informative deterministic models have been created to look at GS strategies for dairy cattle populations []  to our knowledge  none of these considers foreign sire contributions. Our results show the importance of accounting for the impact of these foreign sires in simulation studies  with our results showing substantial reductions in return on investments to increase GS reliability. This  along with the time delay for genetic gains to flow through to the  cow population  closely mimics real world scenarios  i.e. in nearly all modern dairy breeding programmes  where very high contributions from foreign sires are present. Likewise  in our model  responsive sire contributions attempt to mimic real world scenarios. Sire contributions are a product of farmer breeding decisions and therefore are difficult to control at an industry level. Thus  our RSC approach is an attempt to quantify what might occur in practice as the domestic population shifts in merit relative to the foreign population. Another approach would have been to model truncation selection across the domestic and foreign sires available according to simulated overlapping distributions with means based on respective levels of genetic merit. This could be considered in a future study. The value of increasing GS reliability when considered as cumulative NPV is surprisingly modest (0.9 to 3.4% depending on the parameters) when the magnitude of the increase (0.3–0.75) in reliability is considered. While the lags modelled are partly driving this surprisingly low return  the impact of foreign semen was found to be a major driver. The financial commitment to bring about an increase in GS reliability is substantial. Return on investment may not be realised if foreign genetic trend is high relative to the domestic trend and foreign semen is readily available. Having a foreign source of genetic material with a high rate of genetic progress contributes substantially to the domestic rate of genetic progress. Our results show that investments to improve GS reliability will yield greater returns when the foreign genetic trend is lower than the domestic trend  which is most likely due to GxE interactions. GxE interactions can occur at the trait level with the best examples being studies that compared North American and New Zealand genetics under different feeding systems in New Zealand [  ] and Ireland [    ]. Trait level GxE interactions among other countries are relatively modest []. The other main driver of GxE interactions is the differences in breeding goal  which can come through differences in economic values [] and scale effects []. Accounting for subpopulation substructure within a dairy industry is known to be important when evaluating opportunities to accelerate genetic progress. There is opportunity to increase economic benefits to dairy farmers by increasing domestic GS reliability when foreign genetic trends are lower than domestic genetic trends  for example  when large between-country G × E interactions exist. Conversely  if a foreign source of genetic material with a high rate of genetic progress is available  it will contribute substantially to the benefits of domestic genetic progress and the benefits of investments to improve the accuracy of GS locally will be substantially reduced.

The three breeding schemes differed in number of matings and litter size. Selection was for a single trait with a heritability of 0.2. The trait was controlled by 7702 biallelic quantitative-trait loci (QTL) that were distributed across a 30-M genome. The genome contained 54 218 biallelic markers that were used in GOCS and GBLUP. A total of 6012 identity-by-descent loci were placed across the genome in base populations. Unique alleles at these loci were used to calculate rates of true inbreeding. Breeding schemes were run for 10 discrete generations. Selection candidates were genotyped and phenotyped before selection.ResultsPOCS realised more true genetic gain than GOCS at a 0.01 rate of true inbreeding in all combinations of breeding scheme and prediction method. POCS realised 14 to 33% more true genetic gain than GOCS with PBLUP in the three breeding schemes. It realised 1.5 to 5.7% more true genetic gain than GOCS with GBLUP.ConclusionsPOCS realised more true genetic gain than GOCS because it managed expected genetic drift without restricting selection at QTL. By contrast  GOCS penalised changes in allele frequencies at markers that were generated by genetic drift and selection. Because these marker alleles were in linkage disequilibrium with QTL alleles  GOCS restricted changes in allele frequencies at QTL. This provides little incentive to use GOCS and highlights that we have more to learn before we can control inbreeding using genomic relationships in selective-breeding schemes.

We used stochastic simulation to estimate rates of true genetic gain realised by POCS and GOCS at a 0.01 rate of true inbreeding in three breeding schemes with best linear unbiased predictions of breeding values based on pedigree (PBLUP) and genomic (GBLUP) information. The three breeding schemes differed in number of matings and litter size. Selection was for a single trait with a heritability of 0.2. The trait was controlled by 7702 biallelic quantitative-trait loci (QTL) that were distributed across a 30-M genome. The genome contained 54 218 biallelic markers that were used in GOCS and GBLUP. A total of 6012 identity-by-descent loci were placed across the genome in base populations. Unique alleles at these loci were used to calculate rates of true inbreeding. Breeding schemes were run for 10 discrete generations. Selection candidates were genotyped and phenotyped before selection. POCS realised more true genetic gain than GOCS at a 0.01 rate of true inbreeding in all combinations of breeding scheme and prediction method. POCS realised 14 to 33% more true genetic gain than GOCS with PBLUP in the three breeding schemes. It realised 1.5 to 5.7% more true genetic gain than GOCS with GBLUP. POCS realised more true genetic gain than GOCS because it managed expected genetic drift without restricting selection at QTL. By contrast  GOCS penalised changes in allele frequencies at markers that were generated by genetic drift and selection. Because these marker alleles were in linkage disequilibrium with QTL alleles  GOCS restricted changes in allele frequencies at QTL. This provides little incentive to use GOCS and highlights that we have more to learn before we can control inbreeding using genomic relationships in selective-breeding schemes. Until we can do so  POCS remains a worthy method of optimum-contribution selection because it realises more true genetic gain than GOCS at the same rate of true inbreeding. The aim of most animal-breeding schemes is to maximise rates of true genetic gain () at acceptable rates of true inbreeding ().  is calculated as the increase in true breeding value (TBV) averaged across animals in a breeding population.  is calculated from the average true inbreeding coefficient of the animals  where the true inbreeding coefficient of an individual is the proportion of loci in its genome with alleles that are identical-by-descent (IBD). Both  and  are unobservable in practice. They need to be predicted. The best selection method to use these predictions and fulfil the aim of most animal-breeding schemes is optimum-contribution selection (OCS). OCS maximises rates of predicted genetic gain while controlling inbreeding at given rates of predicted inbreeding [  ]. It does this by optimising the genetic contribution of each selection candidate to the next generation. One of the benefits of OCS is that it can optimise genetic contributions when different sources of information are used to predict  and control  [].  is  more often than not  predicted using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of breeding values based on pedigree or genomic information  hereafter referred to as PBLUP and GBLUP.  is predicted and controlled using pedigree or genomic relationships  hereafter referred to as OCS with pedigree (POCS) or genomic relationships (GOCS). GOCS became the method-of-choice for OCS with GBLUP when Sonesson et al. [] used stochastic simulation to recommend that the information used to predict  should also be used to predict and control . Their reasoning was that GOCS predicted and controlled  more accurately when it was used with GBLUP  while POCS predicted and controlled  more accurately with PBLUP. However  this reasoning did not consider . When we plotted  realised by Sonesson et al. [] against   we saw that POCS realised more  than GOCS  even at similar  (Fig. ). We are generally supported by Clark et al. []  who found that  with few exceptions  POCS realised just as much  as GOCS with both PBLUP and GBLUP  despite being compared at the same rates of genomic inbreeding. Comparing POCS and GOCS at the same rates of genomic inbreeding  rather than   would have favoured GOCS  given that GOCS maximises rates of predicted genetic gain while controlling rates of genomic inbreeding. Our interpretation of these studies led us to believe that POCS realises at least as much  as GOCS at the same . We tested this premise by stochastic simulation. We compared  realised by POCS and GOCS at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01  in three breeding schemes with PBLUP and GBLUP. We also simulated OCS with IBD relationships (IOCS) and replaced predictions of breeding values with TBV as points of reference. Results that highlight the mechanisms underlying POCS and GOCS are presented. Adapted from Table 2 in Sonesson et al. [] Rate of true genetic gain realised by POCS and GOCS plotted against  in simulated breeding schemes with two prediction methods (PBLUP and GBLUP). We used stochastic simulation to estimate  realised by POCS and GOCS at  in three breeding schemes with PBLUP and GBLUP. Put simply  we calibrated POCS and GOCS to realise  and compared their . We also simulated IOCS—OCS with IBD relationships—and replaced predictions of breeding values with TBV as points of reference. Selection was for a single trait that had a heritability of 0.2 and was controlled by 7702 biallelic quantitative-trait loci (QTL). The QTL were randomly distributed across a 30-M genome that consisted of 18 pairs of autosomal chromosomes. Each chromosome was 167 cM long. The genome contained 54 218 biallelic markers that were used in GOCS and GBLUP. These markers were randomly distributed across the genome and in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the QTL. A total of 6012 IBD loci were placed evenly across the genomes of animals in base populations. Unique alleles at these loci were used to calculate  and carry out IOCS. The number of chromosomes and LD between alleles at the markers were simulated to resemble those in three commercial breeds of Danish pigs []. Breeding schemes were run for 10 discrete generations (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 … 10). Animals in the base populations were randomly selected in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>1. In generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 … 10  selection candidates were allocated matings by OCS. All animals were genotyped before selection; all candidates in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 … 10 were phenotyped for the trait under selection. Each combination of OCS method  breeding scheme  and prediction method was replicated 200 times. We present  realised at  in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10 and results that highlight the mechanisms underlying POCS and GOCS. The three breeding schemes differed in number of matings and litter size. Twenty-five matings were allocated to 125 selection candidates by OCS in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 … 10. There was no upper limit for the number of matings that were allocated to each male; males were allocated 0  1  2 … or 25 matings. Twenty-five females were allocated a single mating. The 25 sire and dam matings were paired randomly. Each pair (dam) produced five offspring  resulting in 25 full-sib families and 125 offspring. Offspring were assigned as males or females with a probability of 0.5. This scheme is as for breeding scheme M25L5 with two exceptions. First  25 matings were allocated to 500 candidates. Second  each dam produced 20 offspring  resulting in 25 full-sib families and 500 offspring. This scheme is as for breeding scheme M25L5 with two exceptions. First  100 matings were allocated to 500 candidates. Males were allocated 0  1  2 … or 100 matings and 100 females were allocated a single mating. Second  each dam produced five offspring  resulting in 100 full-sib families and 500 offspring. LD between the 54 218 markers and 7702 QTL was established in a founder population using a Fisher-Wright inheritance model [  ]. The founder population was simulated for 1000 discrete generations (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1000 … -<U+2009>1) with 25 males and 25 females  and an effective-population size of 50  in each generation. In generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1  the founder population was in recombination-drift-mutation-selection equilibrium. We considered the founder population to be in equilibrium when the numbers of segregating markers and QTL  the level of heterozygosity averaged over all segregating markers and QTL  and the average LD between segregating markers that were 0.25  0.5  1  2  5  and 10 cM apart became constant across generations. The founder population was initiated with 25 males and 25 females in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1000. Their 30-M genomes consisted of 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 monomorphic loci with wild-type alleles that were placed evenly across the genome at 10 loci per cM. Every eighth locus harboured a QTL that controlled the trait under selection. The remaining loci were markers. The males and females in subsequent generations were simulated by randomly sampling a sire and dam with replacement from the 25 males and 25 females in the previous generation. Bi-allelic polymorphism at each locus was generated with a mutation rate of 4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 per locus using an infinite-sites mutation model []. An additive-genetic effect for the mutant allele at each QTL was sampled from an exponential distribution. The sign of each additive-genetic effect was negative with a probability of 0.9. The additive-genetic effects of the wild-type alleles were zero. Selection was introduced by sampling 25 males and 25 females that were above a 5% percentile for TBV. The TBV of the th animal in the founder population    was calculated as   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>3.75<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 is the number of QTL across the genome   is the number of copies of the mutant allele that animal  inherited at the th QTL (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1  2)  and  is the additive-genetic effect of the mutant allele at the th QTL. We introduced selection because animal populations are always under selection  which influences LD between alleles. The 54 218 markers and 7702 QTL in our three breeding schemes were all segregating in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1 of the founder population. The additive-genetic effects of the mutant alleles at the 7702 segregating QTL were standardised so that the total additive-genetic variance for the trait under selection was equal to 1.0. No new mutations were generated after the founder population was simulated. Chromosomes from the 50 animals in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1 of the founder population were pooled: 18 pools of 100 chromosomes. Each pool consisted of 50 chromosome pairs of the th chromosome (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 … 18) from 50 founder animals. The breeding schemes were initiated by sampling base populations from these chromosome pools. Each replicate combination of OCS method  breeding scheme  and prediction method was initiated by sampling a unique base population. Twenty-six males and 25 females were sampled in breeding schemes M25L5 and M25L20. Eleven males and 100 females were sampled in breeding scheme M100L5. The genotype of each base animal was sampled from the 18 pools of chromosomes in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1 of the founder population. For chromosome  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 … 18)  two chromosomes were randomly sampled without replacement from the th pool of 100 chromosomes. The sampled chromosomes were replaced before the next base animal was sampled. Base animals were assumed to be unrelated and non-inbred based on pedigree and IBD alleles. They were genotyped  but not phenotyped for the trait under selection. Animals in the base populations were selected in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 by randomly culling a single male. In breeding schemes M25L5 and M25L20  25 sires and 25 dams were selected. Each sire was mated with one dam. Each dam produced five offspring in breeding scheme M25L5 and 20 offspring in breeding scheme M25L20. In breeding scheme M100L5  10 sires and 100 dams were selected. Each sire was mated with 10 dams and each dam produced five offspring. Randomly culling a single male enabled us to construct genomic-relationship matrices that were positive-definite. This is explained in more detail in section ‘Genomic and IBD-relationship matrices’. Animals were selected and allocated matings by OCS in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 … 10. The phenotype of animal     was calculated as   where  is the animal’s TBV and  is its residual value. The TBV of animal  was calculated as described for the founder population using the standardised additive-genetic effects of the mutant alleles at the 7702 QTL. Its residual value    was sampled from . The 6012 IBD loci used to calculate  and carry out IOCS were placed evenly across the genome of animals in the base populations at two IBD loci per cM (334 loci per chromosome). Each base animal was assigned two unique alleles at each IBD locus. IBD alleles could be traced back from each descendant to the base animal from which it was derived. A descendant was IBD at an IBD locus when it inherited two copies of a unique allele (i.e.  both alleles at the IBD locus descended from the same unique allele in the base population). IBD loci were not involved in prediction. POCS allocated matings to selection candidates in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 … 10 conditional on predicted breeding values and pedigree relationships. It did this by maximising a quadratic function    with respect to : where  is an  vector of genetic contributions to the next generation and the number of matings allocated to each candidate is a linear function of these contributions   is the number of animals in the population traced back from the candidates in generation  to the base population   is an  vector of PBLUP  GBLUP  or TBV   is a penalty applied to the expected average relationship of the next generation  and  is an  pedigree-relationship matrix. Elements of  were constrained to  () with  for animals that were not candidates for selection in generation . Using these definitions   is the expected breeding value and  is the expected average relationship of the next generation. The penalty    was constant across generations. It was calibrated to realise . We calibrated it by simulating 200 replicates of POCS in each combination of breeding scheme and prediction method with an initial  and calculating the mean  across the replicates. This process was repeated using different  until the mean  deviated from 0.01 by less than 0.0001. GOCS was carried out by replacing  with an  genomic-relationship matrix  . IOCS was carried out by replacing  with an  IBD-relationship matrix  . The method of POCS is described in full by Henryon et al. []. PBLUP for the trait under selection were estimated in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 … 10 by fitting an animal model to the phenotypes observed in generations 2 to . The model was: where  is an  vector of phenotypes   is an  vector of fixed generation effects   is the number of generations with phenotypes   is an  vector of random animal effects   is an  vector of residual errors  and  and  are incidence matrices. The (co)variance structure was: where  is an identity matrix   is the additive-genetic variance in generation <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1 of the founder population  and  is the residual variance that was used to sample phenotypes. GBLUP were estimated by replacing  with the genomic-relationship matrix  . Genomic-relationship matrices used in GOCS and GBLUP were constructed as   where  is an  matrix of genomic relationships     is an  matrix of counts of the mutant allele for the  animals at the <U+2009>=<U+2009>54 218 markers with element  0  1  or 2 for animal  at marker  (   )   is an  vector of ones   is an  vector with  the frequency of the mutant allele at marker  in the base populations  and  transforms  towards the same scale as a pedigree-relationship matrix (adapted from VanRaden []). We carried out two additional steps to ensure that  was positive-definite. First  the allele frequencies in  were calculated using all animals in the base populations  including the single male that was culled in generation  of each breeding scheme. Second  all base animals and selection candidates  except for the culled male  were included in . These steps generated linear independence in  because allele frequencies in  were calculated using an animal that was not included in . The IBD-relationship matrix    used in IOCS was an  matrix constructed as   where element  is the IBD relationship between animals  and  (  )  <U+2009>=<U+2009>6012 is the number of IBD loci  and  is the allele-sharing status.  was equal to 1 if allele  of animal  was identical to allele  of animal  at IBD locus   and 0 otherwise. We present  realised by POCS  GOCS  and IOCS at  in each combination of breeding scheme and prediction method.  and  are presented as means (±<U+2009>SD) of the 200 replicates. We also scaled  by setting  realised by POCS to 100 in each combination of breeding scheme and prediction method.  in each replicate was calculated as a linear regression of  on   where  is the average TBV of animals born in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10.  was presented as a linear regression because  was linear over .  in each replicate was calculated as   where  is a linear regression of  on   and  is the average coefficient of true inbreeding for animals born in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10 [  ]. These transformations were made because   not   was linear over .  was calculated as   where  is the number of animals born in generation   <U+2009>=<U+2009>6012 is the number of IBD loci  and  is the IBD status of animal   at IBD locus  .  was equal to 1 if animal  was homozygous at IBD locus   and 0 otherwise. We present rates of pedigree inbreeding realised by POCS and rates of genomic inbreeding realised by GOCS at  in each combination of breeding scheme and prediction method. Rates of pedigree and genomic inbreeding were calculated as for  with  replaced by average coefficients of pedigree and genomic inbreeding for animals born in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10. The coefficient of genomic inbreeding for animal  was calculated as   where  is the th diagonal element of  used in GOCS. We present results that highlight the mechanisms underlying POCS and GOCS. These results are only presented for POCS and GOCS with PBLUP and GBLUP in breeding scheme M25L5; results from breeding schemes M100L5 and M25L20 were similar to those from breeding scheme M25L5. Two of the results—response frontiers and minimum —involved additional simulations. All of these results are presented as means (±<U+2009>SD) of 200 replicates. We present the average absolute changes in allele frequencies at markers and QTL at  and the average increase in the frequencies of favourable alleles at the QTL. Changes in allele frequencies were calculated from generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 to <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 using animals born in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>10. The frequency changes in each replicate were averaged over the 54 218 markers and 7702 QTL. We present the variance in rate of IBD between the 6012 IBD loci at . Rate of IBD at each locus in each replicate was calculated as   where  is a linear regression of  on   and  is the proportion of animals born in generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10 that were IBD at locus  . We present the number of male candidates that were allocated matings at  and the numbers of half and full-sib families with male or female candidates that were allocated matings. The numbers in each replicate were averaged over generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10. The number of female candidates that were allocated matings was not presented because 25 females were always allocated a single mating in breeding scheme M25L5. We present the average ranks and average-rank deviations of males and females that were allocated matings within full-sib families at  when males and females within each full-sib family were ranked by predicted breeding value. The average rank of males that were allocated matings in each full-sib family was calculated when males were ranked from 1 …   where  is the number of males in the th full-sib family. The average-rank deviation of males in each full-sib family was calculated as the difference between their average rank and their average-minimum rank  where average-minimum rank is the average rank had those males that were allocated matings been the highest-ranked males in their full-sib families. The average ranks and average-rank deviations in each generation were averaged across full-sib families with males that were allocated matings. The generation averages in each replicate were averaged over generations <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 … 10. The average rank and average-rank deviation of females were calculated as for males. We present response frontiers for POCS and GOCS with PBLUP and GBLUP:  plotted against . Different  were realised by applying different penalties    in Eq. (). Response frontiers tell us if the relative  realised by POCS and GOCS at  is also realised across a range of . We present the minimum  realised by POCS and GOCS when we relaxed selection for predicted breeding value. POCS was carried out as described previously with the exception that Eq. () was reduced to  for POCS. With GOCS   was replaced by . Minimum  provides insight into the effectiveness of POCS and GOCS to control . The simulations were run using the program ADAM []. PBLUP and GBLUP were predicted using DMU version 6 []. OCS was carried out by EVA []. POCS realised more  than GOCS at  in all combinations of breeding scheme and prediction method. POCS realised 14 to 33% more  than GOCS with PBLUP in our three breeding schemes (Table ). It realised 1.5 to 5.7% more  than GOCS with GBLUP and 0.3 to 1.4% more  than GOCS with our reference prediction  TBV. POCS also realised more  than IOCS at  with PBLUP. With PBLUP  POCS realised 3.7 to 6.5% more  than IOCS in our three breeding schemes (Table ). In turn  IOCS realised 10 to 27% more  than GOCS. While POCS realised more  than IOCS with PBLUP at   IOCS realised a little more  than POCS with GBLUP and TBV. With GBLUP and TBV  IOCS realised 1.8 to 2.8% and 1.1 to 1.3% more  than POCS. IOCS realised 3.4 to 8.3% and 1.6 to 2.6% more  than GOCS with GBLUP and TBV. Pedigree relationships used by POCS underestimated  in all combinations of breeding scheme and prediction method. POCS underestimated  by 2 to 6% with PBLUP in our three breeding schemes (Table ). With GBLUP and TBV  it underestimated  by 10 to 26%. By contrast  genomic relationships used by GOCS underestimated  by 20 to 39% with PBLUP  but overestimated  by as much as 31% with GBLUP and TBV. The following sections present results that highlight the mechanisms underlying POCS and GOCS. The results are presented for breeding scheme M25L5 with PBLUP and GBLUP. POCS generated larger changes in allele frequencies at markers and QTL than GOCS at . In breeding scheme M25L5 with PBLUP and GBLUP  the average absolute changes in allele frequencies generated by POCS at markers and QTL were about 4% larger than the changes generated by GOCS (Table ). By contrast  POCS increased the average frequency of favourable alleles at QTL by 20% more than GOCS with PBLUP and by 4.8% more than GOCS with GBLUP. POCS and GOCS generated similar variances in rate of IBD between the 6012 IBD loci at . This was highlighted by breeding scheme M25L5 with PBLUP and GBLUP (Table ). POCS allocated matings to more male candidates than GOCS at . In breeding scheme M25L5 with PBLUP  POCS allocated matings to 10.1% more male candidates than GOCS (Table ). With GBLUP  POCS allocated matings to 5.9% more male candidates. Selection candidates that were allocated matings by POCS were from more half and full-sib families than GOCS at . In breeding scheme M25L5 with PBLUP  POCS allocated matings to candidates from 10.6% more half-sib and 2.3% more full-sib families than GOCS (Table ). With GBLUP  POCS allocated matings to candidates from 10.5 and 5.0% more half and full-sib families. POCS allocated matings to higher-ranked candidates within full-sib families than GOCS at . In breeding scheme M25L5 with PBLUP and GBLUP  the average ranks of males and females that were allocated matings by POCS were 8.5 to 10.8% lower than those allocated matings by GOCS (Table ). Not only did POCS allocate matings to higher-ranked candidates within full-sib families  candidates that were allocated matings by POCS were always the highest-ranked males and females in their full-sib families. The average ranks of the males and females that were allocated matings by POCS did not deviate from their average-minimum ranks—their average-rank deviations were zero. With GOCS  the average ranks of the males and females deviated from their average-minimum ranks by about 10%. There were two main features of our response frontiers. First  POCS continued to realise more  than GOCS across a range of . Second  both POCS and GOCS realised less  as  decreased  but  realised by POCS decreased at a slower rate than GOCS. These two features are illustrated by the response frontiers for POCS and GOCS with PBLUP and GBLUP in breeding scheme M25L5 (Fig. ). With PBLUP  POCS realised about 6% more  than GOCS at   20% more  at   and 40% more  at . With GBLUP  POCS and GOCS realised similar  at  higher than about 0.015. POCS realised 2% more  than GOCS at  and almost 10% more  at about . Rate of true genetic gain realised by POCS and GOCS plotted against  in breeding scheme M25L5 with two prediction methods (PBLUP and GBLUP) POCS realised higher minimum  than GOCS when we relaxed selection for predicted breeding value. In breeding scheme M25L5  the minimum  realised by POCS was 6.1% higher than the minimum  realised by GOCS (mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>SD of 200 replicates: 0.0050<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.00147  0.0047<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.00144). Our findings supported our premise that POCS realises at least as much  as GOCS at the same . When we calibrated POCS and GOCS to   we found that POCS always realised more  than GOCS  regardless of the breeding scheme that we simulated or the information used to predict breeding values. This makes POCS an attractive method of OCS to use in breeding schemes  including schemes that use GBLUP. It also highlights that the potential for GOCS to trace changes in allele frequencies at markers does not guarantee more . Our findings are supported by the results of Sonesson et al. [] and Clark et al. []  but not the recommendation by Sonesson et al. []  who reasoned that the same information used to predict  should also be used to predict and control . It would be worthwhile reassessing the recommendation by Sonesson et al. []  given that their reasoning did not consider  and their study made GOCS the method-of-choice for OCS with GBLUP. While we predicted that POCS would realise at least as much  as GOCS  we were surprised to find that our reference OCS  IOCS  realised only marginally more  than POCS with GBLUP and TBV. This result provides little incentive to use GOCS and highlights that we have more to learn before we can control inbreeding using genomic relationships in selective-breeding schemes. Until we can do so  POCS remains a worthy method of OCS because it realises more  than GOCS at the same . POCS realised more  than GOCS because it managed expected genetic drift without restricting selection at QTL. It did this by applying a penalty to .  can be rewritten as   where  is a normed lower-triangular matrix that describes the expected genetic contribution that an ancestor makes to its descendants  and  is a vector of expected genetic contributions from candidates and ancestors to the next generation [  ]. Penalising  penalised increases in expected genetic contributions quadratically  where the sum of squares of expected contributions is a function of expected genetic drift []. Managing expected genetic drift managed the variance in changes in allele frequencies at hypothetical neutral loci. These neutral loci are assumed to be unlinked to QTL alleles []. Because they were unlinked  POCS allowed the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL to be increased by selection. By contrast  GOCS penalised changes in allele frequencies at markers that were generated by genetic drift and selection. It applied a penalty to   where  is a vector of changes in allele frequency at each marker [] and these changes were measured as deviations from allele frequencies in the base populations. Penalising  penalised changes in allele frequencies at markers quadratically; markers with the largest frequency changes were penalised hardest. Because these marker alleles were in LD with QTL alleles  GOCS restricted changes in allele frequencies at QTL. This explanation highlights the problem with GOCS in its current form: it penalises changes in allele frequencies at all markers when  in fact  we need to change allele frequencies at some markers to increase the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL. So  by managing expected genetic drift  POCS realises more  than GOCS at the same  because it allows selection to increase the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL more than GOCS. Deductive reasoning tells us that POCS also generated different IBD profiles across the genome than GOCS at . POCS must have generated more IBD than GOCS in regions of the genome that harboured QTL and less IBD in regions that lacked QTL  given that (1) POCS realised more  than GOCS  (2) POCS generated larger increases in the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL  (3) QTL alleles were in LD with IBD alleles  (4) areas under IBD profiles increase at the same rate at the same   and (5) POCS and GOCS generated similar variances in rate of IBD between IBD loci. While the IBD generated by POCS was associated with QTL location  the IBD generated by GOCS must have been associated with both QTL location and marker density because the markers used by GOCS to predict and control  were randomly distributed across the genome. GOCS presumably generated most IBD in regions of the genome that harboured QTL with low marker densities  least IBD in regions that lacked QTL with high marker densities  and intermediate IBD in other regions of the genome. We did not present IBD profiles for POCS and GOCS because we simulated many QTL  each with a small change in allele frequency. This resulted in differences in IBD between POC and GOCS at each IBD locus that were small and difficult to detect visually. It would be worthwhile carrying out simulations to test unequivocally that POCS generates more IBD than GOCS in regions of the genome that harbour QTL. Increasing the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL while restricting most of the IBD to regions of the genome that harbour these QTL is  after all  how we want to realise  at acceptable  in animal breeding. Therefore  not only does POCS allow selection to increase the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL more than GOCS at the same   it is probably also more aligned with the objectives of animal breeding by restricting most IBD to regions of the genome that harbour QTL. A direct consequence of managing expected genetic drift was that POCS allocated matings to different selection candidates than GOCS. There were two major differences. First  POCS allocated matings to more candidates from more half and full-sib families than GOCS to realise . POCS did this because it could neither differentiate between pairwise relationships within full-sib families—they had the same expected relationships—nor could it trace increases in allele frequencies at IBD loci that were in regions of the genome under the influence of genetic drift and selection. These regions were prone to higher  than predicted by pedigree relationships. Candidates that were allocated matings by POCS tended to share more QTL alleles  more genomic regions flanking the QTL  and more IBD alleles than predicted. POCS compensated for this by allocating matings at rates of pedigree inbreeding that were lower than . It used variation in expected relationships between families to allocate matings to more candidates from more families. By contrast  GOCS allocated matings to fewer candidates from fewer families than POCS because it could differentiate between pairwise relationships and exploit some of the variation in IBD relationships within full-sib families. Realising the same  with fewer breeding animals made GOCS a more effective control of  than POCS and shows that GOCS does provide valuable information for inbreeding control—it was just not as effective at realising . Further evidence that GOCS controlled  more effectively was that it realised lower minimum  than POCS when we relaxed selection for predicted breeding value. With no selection for predicted breeding value  the objective was to restrict increases in the frequencies of IBD alleles  which GOCS did more effectively than POCS. But despite GOCS being a more effective control of   POCS still realised a minimum  of 0.005 with only 25 matings per generation in breeding scheme M25L5. This was well within the 0.005–0.01 range of  that is considered acceptable for breeding schemes []. Therefore  POCS should still be able to realise  that is considered acceptable in most breeding schemes by allocating matings to more candidates from more full and half-sib families. The second difference was that POCS allocated matings to higher-ranked candidates within full-sib families than GOCS at . Candidates that were allocated matings by POCS were always the highest-ranked males and females in their full-sib families. Allocating matings to the highest-ranked candidates generated the extra  realised by POCS as these candidates tended to share favourable alleles at QTL. POCS allowed matings to be allocated to these candidates because all full-sibs have the same pairwise relationships based on pedigree relationships; candidates from the same full-sib family incurred the same penalty regardless of rank. On the other hand  GOCS could not always allocate matings to the highest-ranked candidates. Just as these candidates tended to share QTL alleles  they also shared marker alleles. Allocating matings to them was penalised by GOCS because it generated larger changes in allele frequencies at markers. So  POCS more than compensated for allocating matings to more candidates from more half and full-sib families to realise the same  as GOCS. It allocated these matings to higher-ranked candidates within full-sib families  which increased the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL and realised more . Not only did POCS realise more  than GOCS at   it also realised more  across a range of . At  higher than   POCS and GOCS realised similar . Most selection emphasis was on   and both POCS and GOCS tended to allocate matings to the same highly-ranked candidates that would have been allocated matings by truncation selection. At lower   the mechanisms that differentiate POCS from GOCS became more pronounced and POCS realised relatively more  than GOCS. POCS allocated matings to even more candidates from more full and half-sib families to reduce . Candidates that were allocated matings by POCS continued to be the highest-ranked males and females in their full-sib families and the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL continued to increase  albeit at slower rates. On the other hand  GOCS penalised changes in allele frequencies at markers even harder at lower . Candidates that were allocated matings by GOCS differed more for predicted IBD relationships and they were less likely to be the highest-ranked males and females in their full-sib families. This further restricted changes in allele frequencies at QTL. That is  penalising changes in allele frequencies at markers imposes increasingly larger restrictions on changes in allele frequencies at QTL at lower  than penalising increases in expected genetic contributions. Therefore  the mechanisms that underlie POCS and GOCS apply across a range of  with POCS realising relatively more  than GOCS at lower  because it allows relatively larger changes in the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL. Pedigree and genomic relationships used by POCS and GOCS were only predictors of . Pedigree relationships used by POCS always underestimated  when we selected for predicted breeding value because they could not trace increases in allele frequencies at IBD loci that were in regions of the genome under the influence of selection. Genomic relationships used by GOCS did not predict  more accurately than pedigree relationships  even though GOCS controlled  more effectively than POCS. GOCS underestimated  with PBLUP  but overestimated  with GBLUP and TBV. There are two reasons why GOCS did not predict  more accurately than POCS. First  the marker alleles used to predict  were not in complete LD with IBD alleles. Second  the markers were randomly distributed across the genome. Random distribution implies uneven control of IBD across the genome because GOCS could only control inbreeding using marker alleles. GOCS had to increase inbreeding control in regions of the genome with high marker densities to compensate for reduced inbreeding control in regions with low marker densities. Observable and accurate predictors of  are central to breeding schemes for two reasons. First  they provide a measure of risk; the risk of breeding schemes being adversely impacted by inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation []. Second  they enable OCS to increase selection differentials by allocating matings to selection candidates that realise predicted rates of inbreeding that are close to desired . With no obvious relationship between  and rates of pedigree and genomic inbreeding  we are unable to calibrate POCS and GOCS to realise the desired . This makes inbreeding control using POCS or GOCS challenging. Clearly  observable and accurate predictors of  are needed to better manage risk and increase selection differentials in animal breeding. Even with accurate predictors of   GOCS in its current form is still unlikely to realise more  than POCS at the same . In other words  accurate prediction of  is not enough to maximise  at the same . The reason is that prediction of  and inbreeding control are different concepts when maximising  at the same . This was highlighted by our reference OCS  IOCS. IOCS realised more  than GOCS at  because it had perfect knowledge of . It controlled  with the same IBD alleles that were used to calculate . This suggests that GOCS will realise more  if genomic relationships could be used to predict  more accurately. However  the amount of extra  is unlikely to result in GOCS realising more  than POCS  given that IOCS  at best  only realised marginally more  than POCS at . IOCS realised only marginally more  than POCS because it penalised increases in allele frequencies at IBD loci in the same way that GOCS penalised changes in allele frequencies at markers. It applied a penalty to   where  is a matrix of counts of each unique allele at each IBD locus that was inherited by each animal  and  is a vector of the numbers of each allele at each IBD locus that were expected to be passed on to the next generation. Penalising  penalised increases in the expected numbers of IBD alleles quadratically. This presumably generated flat IBD profiles across the genome and restricted changes in allele frequencies at QTL. Like GOCS  IOCS needed to increase the frequencies of some IBD alleles to increase the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL. So  GOCS in its current form  where changes in allele frequencies at all markers are penalised  is unlikely to ever realise more  than POCS at the same . If GOCS is to realise more  than POCS at the same   we will need to change the way that genomic relationships are used to control . Rather than penalise changes in allele frequencies at all markers  we should probably allow changes in allele frequencies at some markers by varying the level of inbreeding control and rate of IBD across the genome while controlling  at acceptable levels. This will involve relaxing inbreeding control in regions of the genome that harbour QTL  allowing selection to increase the frequencies of favourable alleles at QTL. At the same time  we will need to increase inbreeding control to reduce genetic drift in regions of the genome that lack QTL. Varying the level of inbreeding control across the genome could be carried out in GOCS by constructing genomic-relationship matrices that weight markers in regions of the genome that harbour QTL lower than markers in regions that lack QTL. Weighted genomic-relationship matrices have been used in genomic prediction [  ]. An alternative approach is to construct genomic-relationship matrices by fixing the frequencies of mutant alleles at markers    to desired frequencies rather than frequencies in base populations. This approach would cause GOCS to penalise deviations from the desired allele frequencies. While these approaches are simple in theory  implementing them in practice requires that we overcome a major hurdle: we do not know where many  if any  of the QTL are located on the genome. We do not know what we want to change and in what direction  nor do we know which regions of the genome can tolerate being IBD. Overcoming this hurdle will require biological information about the QTL that control traits under selection  traits that might be under selection in future  and unobserved fitness traits. Unfortunately  this information is unlikely to become available soon. Without it  there is no guarantee that GOCS will realise more  or that it will control IBD in regions of the genome that are susceptible to IBD. Therefore  GOCS should realise more <U+0394>G than POCS at the same <U+0394>F when we relax inbreeding control in regions of the genome that harbour QTL  but implementing this in practice will require biological information about QTL.

Selection response may be suboptimal if only purebred (PB) performance is used to compute genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) because the genetic correlation between PB and CB performance () is often lower than 1. Thus  it may be beneficial to use information on both PB and CB performance. In addition  the accuracy of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance may improve when the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) is considered in the genomic relationship matrix (GRM). Thus  our aim was to compare scenarios where GEBV are computed and validated by using (1) either CB offspring averages or individual CB records for validation  (2) either a PB or CB reference population  and (3) a GRM that either accounts for or ignores BOA in the CB individuals. For this purpose  we used data on body weight measured at around 7 (BW7) or 35 (BW35) days in PB and CB broiler chickens and evaluated the accuracy of GEBV based on the correlation GEBV with phenotypes in the validation population (validation correlation).ResultsWith validation on CB offspring averages  the validation correlation of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance was lower with a CB reference population than with a PB reference population for BW35 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.96)  and about equal for BW7 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.80) when BOA was ignored. However  with validation on individual CB records  the validation correlation was higher with a CB reference population for both traits. The use of a GRM that took BOA into account increased the validation correlation for BW7 but reduced it for BW35.ConclusionsWe argue that the benefit of using a CB reference population for genomic prediction of PB animals for CB performance should be assessed either by validation on CB offspring averages  or by validation on individual CB records while using a GRM that accounts for BOA in the CB individuals. With this recommendation in mind  our results show that the accuracy of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance was equal to or higher with a CB reference population than with a PB reference population for a trait with an  of 0.8  but lower for a trait with an  of 0.96. In addition  taking BOA into account was beneficial for a trait with an  of 0.8 but not for a trait with an  of 0.96."

Selection response may be suboptimal if only purebred (PB) performance is used to compute genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) because the genetic correlation between PB and CB performance () is often lower than 1. Thus  it may be beneficial to use information on both PB and CB performance. In addition  the accuracy of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance may improve when the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) is considered in the genomic relationship matrix (GRM). Thus  our aim was to compare scenarios where GEBV are computed and validated by using (1) either CB offspring averages or individual CB records for validation  (2) either a PB or CB reference population  and (3) a GRM that either accounts for or ignores BOA in the CB individuals. For this purpose  we used data on body weight measured at around 7 (BW7) or 35 (BW35) days in PB and CB broiler chickens and evaluated the accuracy of GEBV based on the correlation GEBV with phenotypes in the validation population (validation correlation). With validation on CB offspring averages  the validation correlation of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance was lower with a CB reference population than with a PB reference population for BW35 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.96)  and about equal for BW7 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.80) when BOA was ignored. However  with validation on individual CB records  the validation correlation was higher with a CB reference population for both traits. The use of a GRM that took BOA into account increased the validation correlation for BW7 but reduced it for BW35. We argue that the benefit of using a CB reference population for genomic prediction of PB animals for CB performance should be assessed either by validation on CB offspring averages  or by validation on individual CB records while using a GRM that accounts for BOA in the CB individuals. With this recommendation in mind  our results show that the accuracy of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance was equal to or higher with a CB reference population than with a PB reference population for a trait with an  of 0.8  but lower for a trait with an  of 0.96. In addition  taking BOA into account was beneficial for a trait with an  of 0.8 but not for a trait with an  of 0.96. In pig and poultry breeding programs  purebred (PB) animals from different lines or breeds are mated to produce crossbred (CB) production animals. Although the aim of such breeding programs is to improve CB performance  typically  breeding values of PB selection candidates are estimated using only information on PB performance. As a result  response to selection in CB performance may be suboptimal because the genetic correlation between PB and CB performance () is often lower than 1 [  ]. A low  may be due to genotype-by-environment interactions [  ]  genotype-by-genotype interactions (i.e.  dominance and epistasis) in combination with differences in allele frequencies between the purebred parental lines []  and/or differences in the definition of PB and CB performance traits [  ]. When the  is lower than 1  it may be beneficial to use information on both PB and CB performance to estimate breeding values of PB selection candidates. For this strategy  breeders need to be able to connect observations on CB performance to the PB selection candidates. This connection can be established with a pedigree-based relationship matrix. However  in a CB breeding scheme  breeders do not always routinely record pedigree information. In such cases  the pedigree-based relationship matrix can be replaced by a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) that is based on observed marker genotypes []. This GRM enables breeders to use a reference population that consists of animals with phenotypes and genotypes to estimate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of selection candidates that only have records on genotypes []. When pedigree information is available  replacing the pedigree-based relationship matrix by a GRM may increase the accuracy of estimated breeding values []. As such  this method  called genomic prediction  allows breeders to use a CB reference population to compute GEBV for CB performance of PB selection candidates []. Simulation studies have suggested that a CB reference population may yield more accurate GEBV for CB performance than a PB reference population when the  is lower than 0.8 [    ]. This result was shown for situations for which the CB reference population had at least the same size as the alternative PB reference population and the selection candidates had similar relationships to the CB and the PB reference populations. In agreement with these simulation studies  Hidalgo et al. []  using real data in pigs  found that for a trait with a high  (~<U+2009>0.90)  the accuracy of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance was lower with a reference population of CB compared to PB pigs. These results were not only due to a high   but also to the smaller number of CB pigs compared to PB pigs in the reference population  and weaker relationships of the PB selection candidates with the CB reference population than with the PB reference population []. In summary  the expected benefit of using a CB reference population instead of a PB reference population increases with (1) lower   (2) stronger relationships of the CB reference population with PB selection candidates  and (3) larger sizes of the CB reference population. When a CB reference population is used to estimate GEBV of PB selection candidates  relationships in the GRM (i.e. ) are often constructed while ignoring the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) of the CB animals. Thus  one assumes that the apparent effects of markers are the same for alleles that originate from the sire breed and the dam breed. Thus  apparent effects of markers are assumed to be equal across breeds  which may not be valid because of differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  and/or in allele frequencies between the parental breeds [    ]. In addition  actual effects at causal loci may differ between breeds due to genotype-by-environment interactions [  ] and/or the presence of non-additive effects in combination with differences in allele frequencies [  ]. Thus  considering BOA when constructing the GRM may lead to more accurate GEBV. Recently  a method has been developed that allows the BOA in CB animals to be determined based on phased genotypes  while taking advantage of the known crossbreeding structure []. This allows the construction of a partial genomic relationship matrix () [  ]  in which relationships that involve CB animals are based only on alleles that originate from the line of selection candidates for which GEBV are estimated. Simulation studies suggested that genomic prediction models that take BOA into account may outperform models that ignore it [  ]. However  this benefit of considering BOA was only observed when the CB reference population was large (4000)  the number of markers was small (500)  and the parental lines of CB animals were distantly related. Moreover  empirical studies on pigs suggested that taking BOA into account may increase the accuracy of GEBV only when  and heritability are low [  ]. In summary  the use of CB information instead of PB information and taking BOA into account may be beneficial for genomic evaluation of PB animals for CB performance. Such benefits are expected when  is low but  to date  this hypothesis has not been tested in broiler breeding programs. Furthermore  it is not yet clear how such benefits should be evaluated  i.e. how GEBV from such models should be validated. Thus  the aim of our study was to compare scenarios in which GEBV of PB animals for CB performance are computed and validated by using (1) either CB offspring averages or individual CB records for validation  (2) either a PB or CB reference population  and (3) a GRM that either accounts for or ignores BOA in the CB individuals. Scenarios were compared based on the correlation of GEBV with validation records (hereafter called the validation correlation) and based on the regression coefficient of validation records on GEBV (i.e. bias). For this purpose  we used data on body weight measured at around 7 (BW7) or 35 days (BW35) of age in PB and CB broilers. Previously  in Duenk et al. []  we estimated genetic parameters for BW7 and BW35 with data from PB and CB animals that were housed in the same environment and that originated from a common group of sires. The estimated heritability of BW7 was 0.09 for PB performance and 0.18 for CB performance  and that of BW35 was 0.22 for PB performance and 0.23 for CB performance. The estimates of  for BW7 and BW35 were 0.80 and 0.96  respectively. Furthermore  for the CB animals in this dataset  BOA were derived by Calus et al. []  which allowed us to consider BOA for genomic prediction. In the current study  we will use the same data as from the previous study to estimate GEBV of PB animals for CB performance  with a reference population of either PB or CB animals  and validate those GEBV with either CB offspring averages or individual CB records. We used phenotype data on body weight from male and female offspring from a PB sire line (A)  and from a three-way crossbred population (A(BC)). The three-way crossbred offspring resulted from mating sires of line A with F1 dams that were a cross between dam lines B and C (BC). All PB and CB offspring came from the same generation and were generated using the same PB line A sires in order to create sufficient links between the PB and CB offspring to enable accurate estimation of . The dam lines used (B and C) have been selected on egg production traits  whereas the sire line A has been selected on male fertility traits  along with growth  yield  and feed efficiency. The three parent lines (A  B  C) were genetically distant  as shown by the principal component analysis in Duenk et al. []. Our aim was to investigate the effect of the validation records used (CB offspring averages or CB individual records) on the validation correlation and bias based on linear regression of validation records on GEBV. Our first strategy was to validate PB sire GEBV for CB performance with CB offspring averages (scenarios –A  Table ). However  because the number of sires was small (161)  we expected a relatively large standard error of the resulting validation correlation. Thus  our second strategy was to validate GEBV for CB performance with individual CB records (scenarios –I  Table )  following Xiang et al. []. For both these validation methods  we compared the validation correlation and bias for GEBV obtained using either a PB reference population (scenarios PB-A and PB-I  Table ) or a CB reference population (scenarios CB-A and CB-I  Table ). With a CB reference population  we also investigated the benefit of considering the BOA (CB-A-BOA and CB-I-BOA  Table ). Note that  in this study  we did not use own performance records of the purebred selection candidates  because we wanted to compare the predictive value of a CB reference population with that of PB reference population  both consisting of animals that are not closely related to the selection candidates. For recording phenotype data  a single generation of offspring were weighed at around 7 (BW7) and 35 (BW35) days of age in five consecutive batches of similar size  with both PB and CB offspring in every batch. The five batches followed each other directly  and together spanned less than five months. Birds from the first batch hatched in June 2014  and those from the last batch hatched in November 2014. Animals that belonged to the offspring generation in one of the batches were not parents of birds in any of the other batches. Within each batch  the PB and CB offspring were housed in three to five pens. For 16 out of 20 pen-batch combinations  at least 90% of the animals in the pen were from the same genetic group (i.e. PB or CB animals)  while for the remaining pens  between 53 and 77% of the animals in the pen were from the same genetic group. Each pen had a near equal number of males and females. Each sire had most of its offspring housed in the same pen  and each pen had offspring of multiple sires. Outlier analysis was done separately per day of recording  and separately for PB and CB animals. Observations that deviated more than 3.5 standard deviations from the mean were removed. After removing the outliers  4687 PB and 10 585 CB records remained for BW7  and 4471 PB and 10 272 CB records remained for BW35. The number of animals with observations was smaller for BW35 than for BW7  because some animals did not survive until 35 days. Genotypes were collected from all PB and CB offspring with phenotypes  as well as from their potential parents and from most of their potential grandparents. Marker positions were determined based on the  4.0 (galGal4) reference assembly. Genotype markers were removed if they were located on sex chromosomes or on the mitochondrial genome  had unknown locations  or a call rate lower than 90%. Animals were removed from the genotype data if they had a call rate lower than 90%. The remaining genotypes were used to reconstruct the pedigree  so that pedigree information was available up to the generation of the grandparents. Genotypes of the grandparents were only used to assign BOA for the animals with phenotypes. In total  there were 161 unique PB sires from line A  of which 135 sires had both PB and CB offspring  five sires had only PB offspring  and 21 sires had only CB offspring (Table ). The PB offspring had 628 unique dams  whereas the CB offspring had 1028 unique dams. We used the reconstructed pedigree to check the genotypes of each marker for Mendelian inheritance inconsistencies between all parent–offspring pairs. Markers with more than 1% inconsistent genotypes between parent–offspring pairs were removed  and for the remaining identified inconsistencies  the genotypes of parent and offspring were set to missing. No animal had more than 1% of inconsistencies across markers. All missing genotypes were imputed with FImpute []. After assigning BOA  we removed markers if they had a minor allele frequency lower than 0.005 in either the genotype file or the BOA file. After these edits  50 960 markers remained for analysis. For all markers  the BOA in the CB offspring were derived with the BOA approach [  ]. In short  the BOA approach consists of (1) simultaneously phasing genotypes of PB and CB animals with AlphaPhase 1.1 using pedigree information []  (2) collecting a library of haplotypes for each line using these phased haplotypes  and (3) assigning the BOA in the CB animals. Steps 2 and 3 were performed using in-house software. This approach resulted in 49.5% of the alleles being assigned to sire line A  which is close to the expected 50%. The full procedure and results of assigning BOA in these data are described in Calus et al. []. The available number of CB animals with phenotypes and genotypes was more than twice as large as the number of PB animals (Table ). However  our aim was to compare the use of a PB reference population to that of a CB reference population of similar size. Thus  we randomly selected a set of ~<U+2009>4500 CB animals to be used in the analyses  while aiming for a comparable family structure in the PB data and the selected set of CB animals. To this end  we counted the number of PB full-sib families of size  (ranging from 1 to 11) and we randomly selected the same number of CB full-sib families of size . If the available number of CB families of size  was smaller than the number of PB families of size   all CB families of this size were selected (Table ). As a result  the number of CB offspring in the selected set was 4655 for BW7 and 4445 for BW35. These numbers were only slightly smaller than the corresponding numbers of PB offspring (4687 for BW7 and 4471 for BW35). An initial analysis revealed that the validation correlation from using a CB reference population differed substantially between randomly selected sets of CB animals. To reduce the impact of this variability on the outcome of the study  we independently sampled 100 different sets of CB animals using the procedure described above. The average fraction of CB animals that two sets had in common for each family size is in Table ; the overall average fraction was 0.47. We ran all scenarios for each of the 100 sets of ~<U+2009>4500 CB animals separately  resulting in 100 replicates for each scenario. For every replicate  we used the selected set of CB animals or all PB animals with phenotypes to create the reference and validation population following the cross-validation strategy explained in the next paragraph. For scenarios denoted by CB-A and CB-A-BOA  the selected CB set was used to create reference populations  and CB offspring averages of sires were used for validation; for scenarios CB-I and CB-I-BOA  the selected CB set was used to create both the reference and validation populations; for scenario PB-I  the selected CB set was used to create the validation populations  and all PB offspring were used to create the reference populations; for scenario PB-A  all PB offspring were used to create the reference populations and CB offspring averages of sires were used for validation. For each replicate  our aim was to minimise relationships between animals in the reference and animals in the validation population by creating five cross-validation (CV) groups. The CV groups were created so that animals in the validation population did not have offspring or paternal-half sibs in the reference population. Thus  we randomly assigned the 156 PB sires that had CB offspring to these CV groups  such that four groups had 32 sires and one group had 33 sires. All offspring were then assigned to the same CV group as their sire. For each CV group  either the sires (for validation on CB offspring averages) or the CB animals (for validation on individual CB records) in this group were used as the validation population  while either the PB or CB offspring in the remaining CV groups were used as the reference population (Table ). The PB offspring of sires without CB offspring were always included in the PB reference population. GEBV were predicted separately for BW7 and BW35 with the following univariate model: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is a vector of fixed effects (batch  pen  sex  age at measurement) with design matrix    is a vector of permanent environmental (maternal) effects with incidence matrix    is a vector of additive genetic effects with incidence matrix   and  is a vector of random residuals. The distribution of permanent environmental (maternal) effects was assumed   where  is the permanent environmental variance and  is an identity matrix. The distribution of additive genetic effects was assumed   where  is the additive genetic variance and  is a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix that either ignores or considers BOA (). The distribution of residuals was assumed    where  is the residual variance and  is an identity matrix. For scenarios CB-A and PB-I  matrix  was constructed following Wientjes et al. []: where  and  are a centred marker genotype matrix of CB animals and PB animals  respectively  by subtracting  (for ) or  (for ) from all genotypes of marker   where  and  are the allele frequency of marker  in the CB and PB animals  respectively. For scenarios PB-A and CB-I  either PB or CB animals were involved  so the  matrix in Eq. () reduced to the genomic relationship matrix for a single breed:  []. When BOA was considered and validation was based on offspring averages (CB-A-BOA)  the genomic relationships in  were constructed by using only the alleles that came from sire line A as: where  is the centred marker allele matrix for CB animals  with a value of  if the counted allele was inherited from the PB sire line  and a value of  if the other allele was inherited []  where  denotes the frequency of the counted allele at marker . The latter was calculated as the total number of counted alleles in the PB sires and in the CB offspring that were inherited from these sires  divided by the total number of PB alleles in these animals. Note that the  is similar to the marker-based partial relationship matrix from Christensen et al. []  with a scaling factor of . As a result  the expected value of the diagonal elements for CB animals in  is 0.5. For scenario CB-I-BOA  only CB animals were involved  so  from Eq. () reduced to a genomic relationship matrix between CB animals where only alleles from sire line A were considered  i.e. . Phenotypic records corrected for systematic environmental effects were used for validation and were obtained from the following model  separately for BW7 and BW35: where  is a vector of all available CB phenotypes   is a vector of random sire effects with incidence matrix   and all other terms are the same as in Eq. (). The distribution of sire effects was assumed   where  is the sire variance and  is an identity matrix. From the solutions of this model  corrected phenotypes were computed as . The validation correlation and bias were evaluated for each replicate separately  using the GEBV and validation records of validation animals from all CV groups. For validation on individual CB records  the validation correlation was calculated as the correlation between GEBV and corrected individual CB records () and the bias was calculated by regressing  on GEBV. For validation on CB offspring averages  the validation correlation was calculated as the weighted correlation between the sire GEBV and the average of corrected phenotypes of their CB offspring () and bias was calculated by weighted regression of  on sire GEBV  with the weighted regression coefficient multiplied by two because the offspring average represents half the breeding value of the sire. The weights used in these analyses were the reliabilities of   which were computed as  []  where  is the estimated heritability of CB performance and  is the number of CB offspring. Note that the resulting validation correlations are not equal to but are proportional to the accuracies of the GEBV for a given validation population  defined as the correlation between GEBV and true breeding values in validation. The validation correlations therefore allow for a comparison between scenarios  which was the aim of our study. For BW7 and with validation on offspring averages  the PB and CB reference populations yielded a similar mean validation correlation (both equal to 0.16; Table ). With validation on individual CB records  however  the CB reference population yielded a higher mean validation correlation than the PB reference population (0.13 vs. 0.05; Table ). For BW35 and with validation on CB offspring averages  the CB reference population yielded a lower mean validation correlation than the PB reference population (0.26 vs. 0.36; Table ). With validation on individual CB records  the CB reference population yielded a higher mean validation correlation than the PB reference population (0.16 vs. 0.13; Table ). The differences between mean validation correlations were not always larger than their standard errors and  thus  we examined if these observed differences were consistent for individual validation correlations of replicates. For BW7 and with validation on CB offspring averages  there was no clear difference between a PB and a CB reference population (Fig.   top-left); in 51% of the replicates  the validation correlation was higher for the CB reference population. However  with validation on individual CB records  the validation correlation was higher with a CB reference population for all replicates (Fig.   bottom-left). For BW35 and with validation on CB offspring averages  the PB reference population yielded a higher validation correlation than a CB reference population for 93% of the replicates (Fig.   top-right). However  with validation on individual CB records the CB reference population mostly yielded a higher validation correlation (86% of the replicates; Fig.   bottom-right).

Dots represent individual validation correlations of 100 replicates and straight lines indicate x<U+2009>=<U+2009>y There were no clear differences in bias of GEBV between using a PB or CB reference population  except for BW35 and with validation on individual offspring records. For that scenario  GEBV from the PB reference population were less biased in 87% of the replicates (Fig.   bottom-right)  with a mean regression coefficient of 0.77 for the PB reference population and 0.67 for the CB reference population (Table ).

Dots represent individual regression coefficients of 100 replicates  and straight lines indicate x<U+2009>=<U+2009>y With validation on offspring averages  considering BOA increased the mean validation correlation for BW7 (0.20 vs. 0.16; Table )  but decreased the mean validation correlation for BW35 (0.22 vs. 0.26; Table ). With validation on individual CB records  considering BOA decreased the mean validation correlation for both BW7 (0.08 vs. 0.13; Table ) and BW35 (0.09 vs. 0.16; Table ). Again  we examined whether the observed differences in mean validation correlations were consistent for individual replicates. With validation on CB offspring averages  taking BOA into account almost always increased the validation correlation for BW7 (93% of the replicates; Fig.   top-left)  whereas for BW35  it almost never increased it (3% of the replicates; Fig.   top-right). With validation on individual CB records  taking BOA into account never increased the validation correlation for either BW7 or BW35 (Fig.   bottom).

For BW7 and with validation on offspring averages  GEBV from models that considered BOA were less biased (0.55; Table ) than those from models that ignored BOA (0.36; Table ) in 99% of the replicates (Fig.   top-left). For BW7 and with validation on individual CB records  GEBV from models that considered BOA were less biased (0.67; Table ) than those from models that ignored BOA (0.55; Table ) in 77% of the replicates (Fig.   bottom-left).

Dots represent individual validation correlations of 100 replicates  and straight lines indicate x<U+2009>=<U+2009>y We compared the validation correlation and bias of GEBV of PB animals for CB performance using either CB offspring averages or individual CB records as validation records. Our aim was to investigate the effect of using either a PB or CB reference population  and the effect of either ignoring or considering BOA. It should be noted that the PB and CB animals in this study were housed in the same environment  whereas in practice  PB animals are housed in a nucleus facility and CB animals are housed in a commercial environment. As such  the estimates of  obtained here provide an upper bound for  in practical situations  where genotype-by-environment interactions may be present []. Consequently  the benefit of using CB information may be larger in practical situations than found here. Thus  our results on differences in validation correlations between scenarios should not be associated with the body weight traits per se  but with the value of the . We investigated bias of GEBV by computing weighted regression coefficients of validation records on GEBV. The average coefficients across replicates were substantially lower than 1 for all scenarios  which indicates a strong bias (over-dispersion of GEBV). This bias may be due to family structure in the data and imprecision of GEBV  which may lead to a theoretical expectation of the true regression coefficient being smaller than 1 []. Regardless  our results show that for BW7  taking BOA into account reduced bias in almost all the replicates. For all other comparisons  differences in regression coefficients were not statistically significant because of large standard deviations of estimates across replicates To date  no other studies have evaluated the impact of considering BOA on the bias of GEBV  and therefore  it remains unclear whether considering BOA generally reduces bias or not. As expected  our results suggest that with validation on CB offspring averages  the difference in validation correlation between using a PB and a CB reference population partly depends on the . With an  of 0.96 (BW35)  the validation correlation was lower with a CB reference population than with a PB reference population  while validation correlations were similar for the CB and PB reference populations with an  of 0.80 (BW7). These results are in line with studies based on simulated [  ] and real data []  thus confirming that the benefit of a CB reference population is larger for smaller values of . However  with validation on individual CB records  the validation correlation was higher with a CB reference population  regardless of the  (i.e.  for both traits)  which agrees with Lopes et al. []  who analysed traits with an  of about 0.9 and also validated on CB offspring records. In addition  two other studies have shown that genotyping CB animals improves the accuracy of CB offspring GEBV using single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) [  ]. In the following sections  we will discuss the two validation strategies and give reasons that explain why they can result in different conclusions about the benefit of using CB information for genomic prediction. With validation on CB offspring averages  differences in validation correlations between using a PB (PB-A) versus a CB (CB-A) reference population can result from two mechanisms: (1) with an  less than 1  a CB reference population has an advantage over a PB reference population; (2) in the CB reference population  only half of the alleles originate from the sire line [  ]  whereas all alleles originate from the sire line in the PB reference population. When the sire and dam lines are unrelated  the maternal alleles in the CB reference population introduce noise in the estimation of the sire-line genetic component because the sire-line alleles in the CB reference population explain only half of the genetic variance  whereas sire-line alleles in the PB reference population explain the full genetic variance. This results in a disadvantage for a CB reference population compared to a PB reference population. However  when the sire and dam lines are somewhat related  the dam-line allelic effects in the CB reference population may have some predictive value for the sire-line allelic effects. This would increase the accuracy of sire-line GEBV  and thus reduce the disadvantage for the CB reference population compared to the PB reference population when using a model that ignores BOA. Observed differences in validation correlations between PB-A and CB-A depend on the balance between the aforementioned two mechanisms. To quantify the predictive value of dam-line allelic effects for sire offspring averages  we estimated sire GEBV by using only the alleles in the CB reference population that originated from the dam line. For BW7  the mean validation correlation from this model was equal to 0.03  with a standard deviation of 0.07 across replicates  whereas for BW35  the mean validation correlation was equal to 0.14 with a standard deviation of 0.07. These results indicate that the dam alleles in the CB animals may have some predictive value for sire offspring averages  which is supported by the observation that considering BOA (i.e. removing the dam alleles) decreased the validation correlation for BW35 (as discussed in later sections). For BW7  the effects of the two mechanisms resulted in similar validation correlations for PB-A and CB-A. For BW35  for which  was closer to 1  the effects of the two mechanisms resulted in a lower validation correlation with CB-A than with PB-A. With validation on individual offspring records  differences in validation correlations between a PB reference population (PB-I) and a CB reference population (CB-I) observed in this study may be due to the same two mechanisms described above. However  the predictive value of the dam alleles is higher with validation on individual crossbred records than with validation on crossbred offspring averages of sires  for two reasons: (1) the prediction of individual CB records is partly (i.e.  half) based on the dam-line alleles of those CB individuals  and (2) an individual record may have a residual genetic dam component. Thus  the CB-I validation correlations are prone to overestimate GEBV accuracies due to the contribution of dam alleles to the prediction of individual records  which contain a residual genetic dam component. For both traits (BW7 and BW35)  the effects of these two mechanisms resulted in higher validation correlations with CB-I than with PB-I  but this difference was smaller for BW35 than for BW7  which was probably due to the higher  of BW35. As discussed in the previous sections  the difference in validation correlations of genomic predictions between using a CB and a PB reference population depend not only on the value of  but also on the choice of validation records (CB offspring averages or individual CB records). We even observed that the ranking of validation correlations with a PB versus a CB reference population changed when a different validation record was used  which raises the question of which validation record is most relevant. In practice  breeders usually aim at identifying PB selection candidates that  on average  produce the best CB offspring. Thus  the relevant validation correlation is the correlation of the GEBV of sires and their CB offspring averages. Validation on offspring averages may not be possible when the number of genotyped PB sires with phenotyped CB offspring is too small. In those cases  validation of GEBV from CB animals on their individual records may provide an alternative. However  with validation on individual records  the apparent superiority of a CB over a PB reference population will likely be inflated because  as discussed above  validation correlations from models that use a CB reference population and ignore BOA are contaminated with the predictive value of dam alleles for the residual genetic dam component in the validation records. Indeed  this inflation was reflected in a higher validation correlation with validation on individual records (0.29 for BW7 and 0.33 for BW35  [see Additional file : Table S1]) instead of on offspring averages (0.18 for BW7 and 0.30 for BW35  [see Additional file : Table S1])  when the validation correlations were compared on the same scale (i.e. scaled by the square root of the heritability and of the mean reliability  respectively). This mechanism may explain why  for traits with similar   Lopes et al. [] found that the validation correlation was higher with a CB reference population (with validation on individual CB records)  but Hidalgo et al. [] found that the validation correlation was higher with a PB reference population (with validation on CB offspring averages). Thus  when genomic predictions using a PB versus a CB reference population are compared  validation of sire GEBV on CB offspring averages is preferred. In the previous paragraph  we argued that  with validation on individual offspring records and when BOA is ignored  validation correlations may be inflated due to the predictive value of dam alleles. However  when BOA is considered  the dam alleles of CB animals are removed from the explanatory variables of the model and the validation correlation is not expected to be inflated. So  when validating on individual records  the benefit of using a CB reference population is better evaluated by comparing a model that uses PB information with a model that uses CB information while considering BOA. This comparison for our data showed that the CB reference population yielded a higher validation correlation than the PB reference population for BW7 (0.08 vs. 0.05) but not for BW35 (0.09 vs. 0.13). Furthermore  for this comparison  GEBV were less biased with a CB reference population than with a PB reference population for BW7 but not for BW35  although differences in regression coefficients were not statistically significant. We compared the validation correlation of models that ignored (CB-A and CB-I) or considered BOA (CB-A-BOA and CB-I-BOA). With validation on offspring averages  the difference in validation correlations between considering and ignoring BOA depended on the predictive value of dam alleles in the CB animals for sire offspring averages. As shown before  this predictive value was close to zero for BW7 but larger than zero for BW35. In other words  the dam alleles introduced noise in the estimation of the genetic sire component for BW7 but this noise was less for BW35  resulting in a higher validation correlation when BOA was considered for BW7 but lower for BW35. These results suggest that taking BOA into account was beneficial for a trait with an  of 0.8 but not for a trait with an  of 0.96  which agrees with results of Sevillano et al. [] and Lopes et al. []  who also found that the benefit of considering BOA decreased with increasing  and heritability. It has been argued that considering BOA may improve the validation correlation when the estimated  from a model that takes BOA into account is different from a model that ignores it []. Our study neither confirmed nor contradicted this hypothesis because  although we observed a benefit of considering BOA for BW7  the estimate  from models that ignored or considered BOA were the same in this dataset []. To our knowledge  information on BOA is currently not used in commercial crossbred evaluations. One reason may be that the algorithm to derive BOA is computationally demanding for large datasets. However  phasing algorithms are continuously being improved in terms of computational requirements [] and computation power keeps increasing []. In the long term  we expect that implementation of BOA-models will depend mainly on their benefit for genomic prediction  because computing costs will be relatively small compared to other costs of a breeding program. The results of this study and those of others [  ] suggest that considering BOA can improve the accuracy of genomic predictions for traits with a low  and low heritability. Furthermore  as discussed above  the value of CB information for genomic prediction accuracy may be over-predicted when validation is on individual offspring records and BOA is ignored. In this study  we investigated whether GEBV of PB animals for CB performance should be computed based on PB or CB performance measured on animals that have comparable relationships with the selection candidates. Thus  own performance records of selection candidates were ignored. In practice  however  selection candidates may have an own performance record for PB performance. For those cases  it may be more useful to compare scenarios that use only PB records with those that combine PB and CB records in a single reference population. However  some traits cannot be measured on selection candidates (e.g. carcass traits) and  as a result  GEBV can only be computed based on information from relatives. For those cases  our results provide valuable insight into the benefit of CB over PB information. Our findings show that the difference in validation correlations between using a PB or CB reference population not only depends on the  of the trait evaluated but also on the choice of the validation record. With a CB reference population  the validation correlation from validation on individual CB records can be inflated because CB offspring records contain a substantial residual genetic dam component that can be predicted by the dam alleles of CB animals. Thus  we argue that  whenever possible  validation correlations for GEBV of PB animals for CB performance should be obtained from validation on CB offspring averages  because the interest usually lies in the identification of PB animals that  on average  produce the best CB offspring. When validation on offspring averages is not possible and validation is on individual CB records  the actual benefit of using a CB reference population should be assessed by comparing the use of a PB reference population with the use of a CB reference population with BOA considered. For this comparison  our results show that the validation correlation with a CB reference population was equal to or higher than with a PB reference population for a trait with an  of 0.8 but lower for a trait with an  of 0.96. In addition  in our population  taking BOA into account was beneficial for a trait with an  of 0.8 but not for a trait with an  of 0.96.

Our results support the hypothesis that parasite resistance is a complex trait and is determined by a large number of genes with small effects  rather than by a few major genes with large effects. Gastrointestinal nematode infections (GNI) are one of the most important health problems that affect sheep and other grazing ruminants in Australia and worldwide. The annual cost associated with nematode infections in the Australian sheep industry has been estimated at $436 million for lost production and treatment costs []. The effects of parasitism on the health and productivity of grazing ruminants are well documented and include loss of weight  diarrhoea  anorexia  scours  anaemia  and death []. During the past few decades  the sheep industry has become increasingly dependent on anthelmintic treatments as a method of parasite control. However  anthelmintic treatments are expensive and often not very effective. The frequent use of these treatments has also resulted in a rapid increase in anthelmintic resistance in sheep worldwide [  ]. Breeding sheep for enhanced resistance has been suggested as a viable method of parasite control. The majority of breeding programs for parasite control are based on indicator traits  in particular worm egg count (WEC) in faeces. However  recording WEC is time-consuming  costly  and unattractive. Therefore  it would be useful to select directly for parasite resistance without the need for nematode challenge. The identification of genes or genomic regions that are responsible for parasite resistance could greatly improve the accuracy of genomic prediction and therefore result in genetic improvement for this trait [  ]. Genomic improvement for parasite resistance would benefit from greater knowledge about how sheep are able to mount effective immune responses against parasite infection and the genetic architecture behind the trait. Initial quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies for parasite resistance in sheep were performed using microsatellite markers  e.g. [   ]. In the last decade  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have been used to identify QTL for most of the economically important traits in livestock species. To date  several GWAS have been reported for parasite resistance in different sheep breeds  e.g. [   ]. Minimal consistency has emerged from these studies  probably due to the physiological complexity of the trait  and the fact that these studies are very diverse in terms of methodologies  statistical approaches  sheep breeds and parasite species. Genome-wide significant SNPs identified from GWAS for complex traits in sheep  and other species such as humans  have generally failed to explain most of the genetic variation  e.g. [  ]. Such studies typically test the association with a phenotype of each SNP individually. In GWAS  the association between each SNP and the trait depends on the existence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the observed SNP and the causal loci that underlie the trait. Because of the large number of statistical tests performed in GWAS  very stringent thresholds are applied to avoid spurious associations. These stringent thresholds minimize false positive associations but also lead to many false negatives since variants with small effects or incomplete LD with the SNPs will fail to pass the stringent statistical threshold and remain undetected. Attempts to increase the power of GWAS have focused on increasing the number of observations for each experiment and the density of SNP arrays. Optimizing power in GWAS is both crucial and challenging. Without increasing the number of observations  power could be gained by testing a cumulative effect of multiple variants in a given region of a genome rather than testing each variant individually. Regional heritability mapping (RHM) has been suggested as a better approach to capture more of the genetic variation []. RHM facilitates the capture of genetic variation for a given region in the genome by integrating the effects of common and rare variants. Thus  the RHM has the ability to capture some of the genetic variation that is not detected by conventional GWAS methods. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions with effects on parasite resistance in a large population of sheep naturally challenged with mixed strongyle nematode species (   and ) using both GWAS and RHM approaches. Parasite resistance  as measured by worm egg counts (WEC)  was investigated in lambs from a large multi-breed sheep population from the information nucleus (IN) flock of the Australian Sheep Cooperative Research Centre (CRC). Details on the IN flock  design and trait measurements are described in Van der Werf et al. []. Lambs were not drenched with anthelmintic until after sampling. When  after weaning  a random faecal sample within a management group exceeded a threshold of 1000 eggs per gram (epg) in sites predominated by   or 500 epg in sites predominated by other species  faecal samples were collected from all individual animals. Worm eggs were then counted using a modified McMaster counting technique []. Worm eggs for three strongyle species were identified  i.e.    and . The analysis included 7539 animals with both phenotype and genotype data. The distribution of the frequency of WEC records across different ages (days) is shown in Fig. . Number of records across ages (per day) Various breeds were represented in the population but with a significant proportion of Merino genes (70.0%)  and only this breed had a substantial proportion of purebred animals (45.2%). The remaining breeds were represented mainly by crossbred offspring of their sires in crosses with Merino or Border Leicester<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino ewes. Breed group size ranged from 3493 sheep for purebred Merino to 97 for a Poll Dorset/Suffolk/White Suffolk/White Dorper/Border Leicester/Merino cross. The breed content of the population is in Table . Animals were genotyped with the Illumina 50 K SNP panel (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA). Several quality measures were applied to the 50 k SNP data. SNPs were removed if they had a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01  a call rate lower than 90%  an Illumina Gentrain score (GC) lower than 0.6  a  value testing Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium less than 10  if the heterozygosity rate deviated by more than 3 standard deviations from the population mean and if they were located on the X and Y chromosomes. Furthermore  an individual was removed if the correlation of the genotypes with another sample (animal) was equal or higher than 0.99. After applying the quality control measures  48 599 SNPs were retained for the analyses. All animals with WEC phenotypes were then imputed from 50 K genotypes to the 600kOvine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip panel (International Sheep Genomic Consortium and FarmIQ Project NZ). The high-density (HD) genotypes were imputed using a reference set of 1881 animals with real HD genotypes. This reference set of HD genotyped animals represented four main breeds (Merino  Poll Dorset  Border Leicester  and White Suffolk): 1042 represented various crosses of these breeds  while purebreds included 677 Merino  47 White Suffolk  44 Poll Dorset  32 Border Leicester  and 39 from 10 other breeds. After applying the same quality measures as above  510 065 SNPs were retained  and these 1881 HD animals were then used as a reference set to impute the 50 K genotypes to HD using Minimac3 []. Prior to imputation  phasing was performed on both the 50 K-genotyped and HD-genotyped animals separately using Eagle2 []. The accuracy of imputation to HD  which was tested within subsets of animals with observed HD genotypes  was on average high (0.98) across the whole genome. In order to reduce computation time  a two-step association analysis was performed. First  phenotypes were pre-adjusted for fixed effects using the following model: where  is a vector of cube-root transformed WEC records;  is the overall mean;  is a design matrix of fixed effects;  is a vector of fixed effects and  is a vector of residuals assumed to be distributed as   where  is the identity matrix and  is the residual variance. The fixed effects included in the models to determine the corrected phenotypes were age of animals at WEC recording  age of dam  gender  rearing type  birth type  contemporary groups (combination of flock  birth year and management group effects) and breed composition  which were fitted as covariates  one for each contributing breed. Second  residuals obtained from Model 1 were treated as corrected phenotypes for a single-SNP regression where each SNP was fitted separately  and a pedigree relationship matrix was fitted to account for population and pedigree structure. A linear mixed model was performed using the GEMMA program [] as follows: where  is a vector of adjusted phenotypes (residuals) obtained from Eq.    is the overall mean   is a vector of genotypes for  (coded as 0  1  or 2 for the genotypes 00  01/10  or 11  respectively)   is the effect size of the th SNP (allele substitution effect)   is a design matrix of random additive genetic effects   is a vector of random additive genetic effects assumed to be distributed as   where  is the numerator relationship matrix calculated from available pedigree using the pedigree package in R []  and  is the vector of residuals. The false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to adjust for multiple SNP testing. Significant SNPs were determined by using the genome-wise FDR of 5%. RHM analyses were carried out on the whole genome using the MTG2 software []. Each chromosome was divided into regions that contained a predefined number of SNPs  and the additive genetic variance attributable to the joint SNP effects within each window was estimated. Window sizes of 1000 SNPs (~<U+2009>5 Mbp)  500 SNPs (~<U+2009>2.5 Mbp) and 200 SNPs (~<U+2009>1 Mbp) were used to build the genomic relationship matrices (GRM) for the specific regions and the windows were then shifted along the genome in steps of 500  250 and 100 SNPs  respectively. To test the significance of each window  a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was applied to compare the full model  which includes the regional effect (Eq. ) with the reduced model with no regional variance in that window (Eq. ): where the terms are as defined in Eqs.  and   except   which is the additive genetic effect of the window genotype estimated from SNPs within region  and assumed to be distributed as   where  is the regional genomic relationship matrix constructed from SNPs within region   and  is the genomic variance explained by the SNPs in region . Phenotypic variance was given by  and therefore the regional genomic heritability was estimated as . For the RHM approach  LRT was assumed to follow a mixture of  and  distributions []. In total  980  2005 and 5025 windows were tested across the genome using RHM with window sizes of 1000  500 and 200 SNPs  respectively. Due to the large number of windows tested across the genome  FDR was applied to correct for multiple testing. Significant windows were selected by using the genome-wise FDR of 5%. Conditional GWAS and RHM analyses were carried out to determine if significant SNPs and regions were independent. First  GWAS analyses were performed on the regions of  (OAR) chromosomes 2 and 6 by including the most significant SNP as a fixed covariate in the model and testing all SNPs in the region that were not in strong LD with the conditional SNP (). Second  RHM analyses were performed by adding the most significant regions to the model in a stepwise manner. To obtain a more conservative and probably better heritability estimate for a given region  both  from the significant regions  and its complementary GRM ()  which is based on all the remaining SNPs in the 600 K SNP panel  were fitted jointly in one model. Significant regions were added to the model sequentially where  each time  a new  was built from all regions combined and a new  was also built from all the SNPs on the 600 K panel  excluding the unique fitted SNPs in . Third  RHM analyses were performed conditionally on the top SNP from each region  which were then added to the model sequentially as fixed covariates  and the proportion of variance explained by all regions combined was estimated. Haplotypes were constructed for SNPs located within the statistically significant windows using the Fimpute algorithm []. Once the haplotypes were constructed  LD between SNPs was calculated as the D' statistics using the Haploview software []  with haplotype blocks defined based on the criteria of Gabriel et al. []. Haplotype analysis was then carried out using the following model: where  is the adjusted phenotypic (residual) value for the th animal;  is the overall mean;  is the effect of the th haplotype;  is the haplotype score (0  1  or 2) of the  haplotype for the  animal   is the number of haplotypes segregating in the population for that haplotype block;  is the vector of random additive genetic effects of individual  and  is the vector of random residual effects. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the genomic relationship matrix using MTG2. The first two principal components (PC) of the genotyped animals were plotted and samples were coloured according to their breed compositions  as known from pedigree information. Candidate genes in the significant regions were obtained from Ensembl () and UCSC Genome Bioinformatics (). Because the sheep genome is not completely annotated compared to the human genome  human orthologous genes were used to explore their molecular functions. Biological pathways associated with these identified genes were obtained using the BioSystem Tools ()  which contains pathways from the main databases including: KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)  Pathway Interaction Database (PID)  WikiPathways and Reactome. A Manhattan plot of GWAS results for parasite resistance in sheep is in Fig. . Three SNPs (rs421630816  rs424521894  and rs413835864) were statistically significant at a genome-wise FDR of 5% (Table ). The quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot shows that  for these three significant SNPs  the deviation from their expected values is larger  which indicates a strong association between these SNPs and parasite resistance (Fig. ). SNP rs421630816 is located within the  gene at 110.8 Mbp on OAR2  and the rs424521894 and rs413835864 SNPs are located within the  gene at 107.3 and 107.4 Mbp on OAR2  respectively.

Q–Q plots of observed versus expected -values of RHM analyses are in Fig. . RHM analysis using 1000-SNP windows identified three overlapping windows between 106.4 and 118.7 Mbp on OAR2  and another three overlapping windows between 32.7 and 42.3 Mbp on OAR6 that were significantly associated with parasite resistance at the genome-wide level. RHM analysis with 200-SNP windows identified three regions on OAR2: two overlapping windows between 106.9 and 108.4 Mbp  three overlapping windows between 110.1 and 113.3 Mbp  and one window between 117.01 and 118.13 Mbp. The two overlapping windows between 106.9 and 108.4 Mbp on OAR2 contains the second and third most significant SNPs (rs413835864 and rs424521894) identified by the GWAS  whereas the window between 110.59 and 112.38 Mbp contains the top significant SNP (rs421630816). Fine-mapping analysis also identified a significant region between 34.7 and 39.2 Mbp on OAR6  which included the sixth top ranked SNP (rs416517011; <U+2009>=<U+2009>7.87<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) based on GWAS. In addition  RHM using 200-SNP windows identified a region that contains two overlapping windows between 17.6 and 18.9 Mbp on OAR18  and a region on OAR24 between 40.4 and 41.9 Mbp.

Significant windows (FDR of 5%) are highlighted by red dots Figure  shows a comparison of the RHM results among the three window sizes used (1000-SNP  500-SNP and 200-SNP) for the target regions on OAR2 and OAR6. The 200-SNP window RHM analysis improved the mapping resolution of the identified regions (regions became narrower). However  the overall power was not higher compared to the larger window sizes since the LRT values did not increase when window sizes were shifted from 1000 to 200 SNPs.

The solid lines show the RHM results using three window sizes (1000 SNPs<U+2009>=<U+2009>green; 500 SNPs<U+2009>=<U+2009>blue; 200 SNPs<U+2009>=<U+2009>red)  where each window is positioned at the window midpoint. Grey dots show the GWAS results within each region The significant regions identified by RHM were re-analysed using 200-SNP windows for Merino sheep only to validate whether the same target regions persisted within the Merino sheep population. The results show that the significance of the peaks for the target regions on OAR2  18  and 24 decreased  whereas the peak in the OAR6 region was maintained (Fig. ). These results are likely due to the reduced sample size  with half the animals being Merino sheep  which resulted in the statistical power being inadequate to confirm the association in these target regions.

The red lines represent the RHM results for the entire sheep population and blue lines represent the RHM results for Merino sheep population Results of conditional GWAS analyses for the significant regions on OAR2 and 6 are shown in Figs.  and   respectively. GWAS analysis conditioned on the first top significant SNP (rs421630816) removed the peaks in the region between 110 and 112 Mbp on OAR2. The -values of the fourth and fifth top ranked SNPs (rs403231265 SNP; <U+2009>=<U+2009>4.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and rs405353352 SNP; <U+2009>=<U+2009>6.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) at 111 Mbp on OAR2 became 0.38  whereas the -values for the second and third significant SNPs (rs424521894 and rs413835864) at 107 Mbp remained lower than 10. When GWAS was conditioned on rs424521894 SNP  the -value for rs413835864 became 0.9  whereas -values for rs421630816 remained lower than 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. GWAS analysis conditioned on rs425769499 SNP  which is the top ranked SNP in the region between 117 and 118 Mbp  was also performed and the -values for all significant SNPs on OAR2 remained lower than 10. LD between rs424521894  rs421630816  and rs425769499  i.e. the top SNP in each of the three regions between 107 and 108  110 and 112  and 117 and 118 Mbp  was zero for all pairwise comparisons. However  LD between rs424521894 and rs413835864 SNPs of the same region was moderate ()  whereas LD between rs421630816 SNP and either of the rs403231265 and rs405353352 SNPs of the same region was moderate () and strong ()  respectively.

The left plot shows GWAS results with no conditioning. Right plot shows GWAS results conditioned on rs416517011  the sixth top ranked SNP based on GWAS The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the significant regions gradually increased with each additional region fitted in the model (Table )  ranging from 0.004 (s.e.<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002) by fitting only the region between 107 and 108 Mbp on OAR2 to 0.030 (s.e.<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.008) by fitting all five significant regions combined in one GRM. The model fit  as measured by LRT  gradually improved with each additional region fitted in the model. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all combined regions gradually decreased from 0.030 to 0.028 when RHM was conditioned only on the rs421630816 SNP  and from 0.030 to 0.019 when RHM was conditioned on the top six SNPs (Table ). The model fit also improved with each additional SNP fitted as a fixed covariate except when the rs425769499 SNP was included. Haplotype analysis was performed for the region between 106.4 and 118.7 Mbp on OAR2 and the region between 32 and 36 Mbp on OAR6. Using the criteria described by Gabriel et al. []  SNPs that showed high LD within each region were grouped together in haplotype blocks. Twenty-six and 10 haplotype blocks were identified in the regions on OAR2 and 6  respectively. Haplotype block sizes ranged from 2 to 141 kb. Using Eq.   only block 6 (Fig. ) located between 107.33 and 107.38 Mbp on OAR2 had a significant effect on parasite resistance (-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003). Six distinct haplotypes were identified in this haplotype block (Table ). Haplotypes TTTG and CTTA had positive significant effects on parasite resistance  while haplotype CTTG had a marginally negative effect.

Only Purebred Merino and other breeds that make up 50% and more of the animals breed composition were annotated. Clustering of animals based on the plot of principal components (PC1 and PC2). Animals were coloured based on their breed composition of purebred Merino and composition of other breeds  with the breed that makes up more than 50% of the breed proportion.

The grey colour represents animals of different crosses but with less than 50% of a particular breed composition Pathway analysis was performed to link genes within the significant regions on OAR2  6  18 and 24 to their biological pathways using the BioSystem Tools from NCBI. The analysis linked 84 genes (Table ) to 271 unique pathways (see Additional file : Table S1). The number of genes in the pathways ranged from 1 to 10 genes  with a median size of 1. Pathways with the largest sizes were ‘Metabolism’ (10 genes)  ‘Immune system’ (8 genes)  ‘Signal transduction’ (8 genes)  ‘Antigen processing: Ubiquitination and proteasome degradation’ (6 genes)  ‘Class I MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation’ (6 genes)  ‘Adaptive immune system’ (6 genes)  ‘Transmembrane transport of small molecules’ (5 genes) and ‘Gene expression’ (5 genes). Genes involved in major immune pathways were extracted and are listed in Table   which shows that 13 genes are linked to 16 pathways with major roles in the innate and acquired immunity as well as cytokine signalling in the immune system. Our study aimed at detecting genomic regions with effects on parasite resistance in a large population of sheep naturally challenged in the field with mixed parasite species. Both RHM and GWAS identified the region on OAR2 as being significant (FDR of 5%). However  RHM identified additional significant regions at the FDR of 5%  i.e. the regions on OAR6  18 and 24  which were not detected by GWAS. Both methods use genomic information in different ways  and their power to detect genomic regions depends on the genetic architecture behind the trait. According to Nagamine et al. []  when trait variation is due to a few causal variants  and those variants are in complete LD with the SNP  then GWAS should be the most powerful approach. However  most complex traits are polygenic with trait variation being explained by variants in many loci  each with a small effect. For such polygenic traits  RHM may be more efficient than the conventional GWAS approach. In principle  RHM facilitates the capture of genetic variance for each region in the genome by integrating the effects of both rare and common variants in a joint analysis. Thus  the RHM approach is potentially capable of identifying loci that cannot be detected by a conventional GWAS analysis. Furthermore  RHM captures the effect of the region  which may also include -interaction effects between causal genes in that given region. Our results show that some candidate genes within a given region share similar mechanisms related to the immune system  which suggests that some possible interaction effects take place between those genes for protecting the host against parasite infections. Genomic regions that were identified by RHM as significant explained only a small proportion of the trait variation   for each region ranged from 0.003 (1.5% of the trait heritability) to 0.01 (5% of the trait heritability)  and for all regions combined  was equal to 0.030 (15% of the trait heritability). The small proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the significant regions suggests that parasite resistance is a polygenic trait with a large number of variants involved in the mechanism of resistance. This result is in agreement with Kemper et al. []  Riggio et al. []  Riggio et al. []  and Lee et al. [] who reported that parasite resistance is a complex trait influenced by a large number of genes each with a relatively small effect. The phenotype as measured in this study was subject to a strict measuring protocol  however  worm egg counts were recorded at different ages and from different parasite species. This likely affects the power and accuracy of the detection of causal variants. However  previous studies have shown that there are high genetic correlations between parasite challenges from different parasite species []  as well as between WEC measurements at different ages []. Regions with a higher impact on parasite resistance were found on OAR2 and OAR6. RHM using 1000-SNP windows identified two regions between 106.4 and 121.1 Mbp on OAR2 and between 30.1 and 42.3 Mbp on OAR6 that were significantly associated with parasite resistance at the genome-wide significance level. Fine-mapping of the region on OAR6 with 200-SNP windows revealed a large region between 35.27 and 38.76 Mbp that passed the genome-wide significance level (FDR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05). Fine-mapping of the region on OAR2 with 200-SNP windows revealed three adjacent regions between 106.9 and 108.4 Mbp  110.1 and 113.3 Mbp  and 117.0 and 118.1 Mbp that were significant at the genome-wide significance level. Stepwise conditional analyses showed that the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by significant regions gradually increased from 0.4% when regional heritability was based on SNPs from the region between 106.9 and 108.4 Mbp to 0.8% when regional heritability was based on SNPs from all three significant regions on OAR2. These results suggest that several causal mutations are likely responsible for the genetic variation in the OAR2 region. A comparison with previous studies showed that the region on OAR2 fell within the QTL region (61.7–137.9 Mbp) reported by Crawford et al. [] for resistance to   which was identified in an outcross of Romney and Coopworth sheep  and which partially overlapped with the QTL region (117.9–133.9 Mbp) reported by Davies et al. [] for resistance to  in Scottish blackface sheep. Furthermore  the region on OAR6 has been reported by Riggio et al. [] for resistance to  in Scottish Blackface sheep. The authors identified a genome-wide significant SNP for  fecal egg count (FEC) in this region on OAR6 using GWAS  and confirmed a QTL region between 33 and 39 Mbp by RHM analysis. The identified region on OAR6 also corresponds to the QTL (25.1-62.6 Mbp) region reported by Silva et al. [] for resistance to  and  in a backcross population of Red Maasai and Dorper sheep. Interestingly  both regions on OAR2 and OAR6 have also been reported as being under selection in a large number of sheep breeds from the Sheep HapMap dataset [  ]. RHM analysis also identified a significant region on OAR18 (17.64-18.95 Mbp) and two novel regions between 36.96 and 37.84 Mbp and between 40.47 and 41.99 on OAR24. The identified region on OAR18 partially overlapped with a QTL region identified by Marshal  et al. [].  (--) was the only gene annotated in the region between 106.9 and 108.4 Mbp on OAR2.  harbours the second and third most significant SNPs detected by GWAS analysis and contains haplotype block 6 (107.33–107.38 Mbp)  the only haplotype block identified as having a significant effect on parasite resistance.  is a member of a highly conserved family of proteins that are responsible for the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans. Several genes from this family  such as    and   have also been reported as being of importance for sheep resistance to gastrointestinal parasite infections [    ]. Abomasum mucus  with mucin as its main component  is considered to be the first line of host defence against invading gastrointestinal parasites [  ]. Mucus production during parasite infections is under the immune control of type-2 cytokines []  with interleukin-4 (IL-4)  IL-13  and IL-22 altogether playing the major role in host protection [  ]. Furthermore  Newlands et al. [] found that sheep immunized by daily oral challenge with  had unchanged gastric mucin profiles two days after infection  which demonstrates that animals are able to control mucin levels based on their immunological status. In vitro studies showed that parasite feeding and motility are restricted when larvae were co-cultured with sheep intestinal mucus []. The region between 110.1 and 113.3 Mbp on OAR2 harbours four genes that are directly involved in immune pathways:  (); - ();  (); and - ().  and  are involved in the MHC class I mediated antigen processing and presentation pathway. This pathway activates type-1 T lymphocytes (Th1)  which is characterized by the production of the cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma among other cytokines  providing effective cellular response and protection against chronic parasite infection [].  encodes a protein involved in the Fcgamma receptor (FCGR) dependent phagocytosis pathway  a crucial event in the immune system that permits effector cells such as macrophages to uptake and eliminate infectious pathogens. This event is mediated by immunoglobulin (IgG) binding to Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma R) on the effector cells [].  is involved in the B cell receptor signalling pathway  which is essential for the expression of other genes involved with B cell differentiation  proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production. Other potential genes of interest in this region include:  ()  and - ().  contains the top significant SNPs identified by GWAS analysis. The role of  is poorly understood  although it has been found to play an essential role in organizing the skeletal muscle [].  is important for the production of inflammatory cytokines such as type 1 interferon []. In humans  an increased expression of  has been detected following viral infections [  ]  which suggests that  is essential to initiate the innate antiviral mechanism. The region between 117.0 and 118.1 Mbp on OAR2 overlaps with two important genes involved in immune pathways:  ()  which encodes a protein being involved in Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis pathway  and - ()  which is involved in the IL-1 signalling pathway.  plays an important role in the I<U+03BA>B kinase (IKK) activation  which is essential for NF-<U+03BA>B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signalling []. NF-<U+03BA>B regulates the expression of many genes associated with immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract. For instance  NF-<U+03BA>B plays an essential role in the transcriptional regulation of many cytokine genes  including -  -  -  -  and -  in epithelial cells  lymphocytes and monocytes []. The <U+039A> light-chains of NF-<U+03BA>B are also critical components of immunoglobulins  making NF-<U+03BA>B a key regulator of humoral immune responses []. The region between 35.27 and 38.76 Mbp on OAR6 overlaps with three genes from the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases (   and ) that are associated to four biological pathways (Table ) including: ‘Immune system’; ‘Antigen processing: Ubiquitination and proteasome degradation’; ‘Class I MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation’; and ‘Adaptive immune system’ pathways. The OAR6 region also contains two immune genes:  () and  ().  encodes a protein involved in toll-like receptors (TLR) signalling. TLR are innate immune receptors that detect pathogen invasion in the intestinal mucosa and are essential for mounting a type-2 immune response [  ]. This gene also plays an important role in wound healing [  ].  is involved in the interleukin-11 (IL-11) signalling pathway. IL-11 accelerates platelet recovery []  which is important to maintain adequate blood volume levels following parasite infection. Gastrointestinal parasites  especially   can cause severe blood loss  leading to haemorrhagic anaemia. Maintaining haemostasis is important for sheep recovery following infection as a way to minimise anaemia. Furthermore  haemostasis serves as a defence mechanism to expel parasites from the host body since clotting at the infection site significantly reduces blood supply to adult worms  inhibiting feeding and survival at the infection sites []. Other candidate genes in the OAR6 region include:  () and  ().  contains the sixth most significant SNP detected by GWAS analysis. In most mammalian species   contains trinucleotide repeats in the coding region  resulting in an expanded polyalanine tract in the amino-terminal region of its encoded protein []. The extreme expansions of trinucleotide repeats can alter protein function and cause genetic diseases such as the fragile X syndrome and Huntington’s disease [  ]. At present  the function and the propensity of repeat expansions in the coding region of the ovine  are not known.  is highly expressed in the canalicular membrane of the liver  kidney  colon  and in the epithelia of the small intestine [  ].  plays a major role in multidrug resistance []  and has been identified as a candidate gene for facial eczema in sheep []. The expression of  at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium  a layer of cells that forms a physical barrier between mucosa and the gut luminal content  suggests a potential role for this gene in protecting the host from parasites that try to destroy the lining of the lumen to access the bloodstream. The region between 17.64 and 18.92 on OAR18 overlaps with the  () gene  which regulates different cytokine signalling pathways in the immune system including ‘Interferon signalling’ and ‘Interferon alpha/beta signalling’ pathways  and - () gene which encodes a protein involved in the ‘class I MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation’ pathway. Fine mapping RHM analysis using smaller windows identified a novel region on OAR24 between 40.4 and 41.9 Mbp. This region overlaps with the ---- () gene  which plays an important role in T lymphocyte differentiation and development through regulating notch signalling []. The  () gene is another candidate gene in this region that is involved in the haemostasis pathway (see Additional file : Table S1)  an integral response mechanism against  infection. This study identified significant genomic regions on ovine chromosomes 2  6  18  and 24 that are associated with parasite resistance in sheep. These results show that RHM is more powerful in detecting regions for parasite resistance and capturing variance than single SNP GWAS. The identified regions overlap with candidate genes that are involved in innate and acquired immune mechanisms  as well as cytokine signalling. Genes involved with haemostasis and mucus production are also relevant for host protection against parasite infections. Our results support the hypothesis that parasite resistance is a complex trait  and is determined by a large number of genes with various roles  rather than by a few genes with a major role in resistance.

Since its foundation  the breed has experienced both strong directional selection  especially for size and colour  and severe population bottlenecks that are connected with its initial foundation and subsequent changes in agricultural and forestry practices. Here  we used sequences of the mitochondrial control region and genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate the genetic diversity and differentiation of the four Finnhorse breeding sections: trotters  pony-sized horses  draught horses and riding horses. Furthermore  we estimated inbreeding and effective population sizes over time to infer the history of this breed.ResultsWe found a high level of mitochondrial genetic variation and identified 16 of the 18 haplogroups described in present-day horses. Interestingly  one of these detected haplogroups was previously reported only in the Przewalski’s horse. Female effective population sizes were in the thousands  but declines were evident at the times when the breed and its breeding sections were founded. By contrast  nuclear variation and effective population sizes were small (approximately 50). Nevertheless  inbreeding in Finnhorses was lower than in many other horse breeds. Based on nuclear SNP data  genetic differentiation among the four breeding sections was strongest between the draught horses and the three other sections (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007–0.018)  whereas based on mitochondrial DNA data  it was strongest between the trotters and the pony-sized and riding horses (F<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.054–0.068).ConclusionsThe existence of a Przewalski’s horse haplogroup in the Finnhorse provides new insights into the domestication of the horse  and this finding supports previous suggestions of a close relationship between the Finnhorse and eastern primitive breeds. The high level of mitochondrial DNA variation in the Finnhorse supports its domestication from a large number of mares but also reflects that its founding depended on many local landraces.

Although inbreeding in Finnhorses was lower than in many other horse breeds  the small nuclear effective population sizes of each of its breeding sections can be considered as a warning sign  which warrants changes in breeding practices. Domestication of animals and plants has played an essential role in human history. At present  there are more than 8800 breeds of 38 domesticated animal species listed in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) []. Domestication has influenced the behaviour  morphology  physiology and performance of a species through selective breeding. It has also led to the fixation of breed-specific traits through inbreeding  genetic drift  founder effect and selection [  ]. Two examples of the occasionally large phenotypic differences between wild and domesticated animals are the great variation in coat colour [] and body size (e.g.  in dogs; see  for example  []) in domesticated species that still often show limited variation within breeds. Thus  captive breeding may decrease the overall genetic variation but may increase it for certain traits. A study of the genome-wide genetic diversity of 36 horse breeds [] based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data showed that the diversity was low in breeds that have experienced high selective pressures  been closed populations  gone through a population bottleneck  or have low current census sizes (e.g.  the Exmoor  Clydesdale and Florida Cracker breeds  with expected heterozygosity H ranging from 0.236 to 0.291). By contrast  a high level of diversity was detected in landraces or breeds that were old  had large population sizes  were outcrossing  displayed a high level of phenotypic diversity  or had experienced weaker artificial selection (e.g.  Mongolian  Tuva and New Forest Pony; H ranging from 0.314 to 0.322). The extremely low genetic variation of the horse Y-chromosome demonstrates that the domestic horse has only few paternal founders [  ]  whereas the genetic variation of the maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA is very high [  ]. In this study  we examined the genomic and mitochondrial diversity of the Finnhorse  which is an all-round horse breed and the national horse breed of Finland. It is closely related to other Nordic or eastern horse breeds  e.g.  the Norwegian Fjord  North Swedish horse  Gotland Russ  Icelandic horse  Estonian horse and Mongolian horse [  ]. Historical sources have revealed the existence of several breeding programs since  at least  the sixteenth century  which aimed mostly at increasing the size of the Finnish horse by crossing it with larger European breeds []. The history of this breed since the foundation of the studbook in 1907 is well recorded []. The number of Finnhorses declined strongly during the urbanization of Finland in the 1960s and 1970s  when people moved from rural areas into cities and agricultural and forestry practice began to use motorized ‘horsepower’ instead of real horses. The number of Finnhorses declined from over 400 000 in the 1950s to an all-time small number of 14 000 in 1987 []  later increasing to the present number of approximately 20 000. Finnhorses are currently bred in four breeding sections: harness trotters (since 1965; 218 stallions and 1575 mares in 2017)  riding horses (since 1971; 103 stallions and 611 mares)  pony-sized horses (since 1971; 64 stallions and 219 mares) and draught horses (since 1971; 30 stallions and 103 mares []). To be accepted in the studbook  the horses of each section need to fill certain section-specific criteria that include size  conformation  performance  gaits  health and behaviour. In practice  most Finnhorses are not evaluated before entering the studbook  but for an individual to be registered as a Finnhorse  it must trace back at least three generations of Finnhorses []. At the beginning of the twentieth century  when the studbook was founded  Finnhorses were strongly selected for colour (chestnut) and size (at least 148 cm at the withers)  and they were bred first for draught purposes to work in agriculture and forestry and  later also as a lighter  all-round cavalry horse []. Selection was subsequently directed towards traits that were specific to each breeding section (e.g.  maximum withers height of 148 cm for pony-sized horses  pulling capability for draught horses  athletic conformation for harness trotters and rhythmic  elastic and advancing gaits for riding horses [  ]). It is assumed that while all present-day Finnhorses can be traced back to only four founding stallions  which were born between 1879 and 1929  the number of founding mares was large []. The small number of founding stallions  together with the strict breeding standards  presumably decreased the genetic variation of the breed at the beginning of the 1900s. However  the later formation of the four separate breeding sections likely increased genetic differentiation. In addition  the decline in numbers until the 1980s created a population bottleneck  which possibly further decreased the genetic diversity and increased the effect of genetic drift. Today  the number of individuals in the draught horse breeding section  in particular  is alarmingly small. However  according to []  the levels of heterozygosity and inbreeding in the Finnhorse breed are not markedly different from those of other horse breeds (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.301  inbreeding coefficient F<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.004 and effective population size N<U+2009>=<U+2009>575 estimated from 27 Finnhorses  whereas the corresponding mean values for all studied breeds are equal to 0.295  0.007 and 341  respectively). This higher than expected level of heterozygosity and lower than expected inbreeding coefficient for a breed with strong directional selection and a recent decrease in population size have been explained by its within-breed genetic structure []  i.e. its differentiation into four breeding sections. It is still unknown how the history of the Finnhorse has influenced the genetic diversity of the breed as a whole or the differentiation among its four breeding sections. Therefore  our aims were to (1) characterize the genetic variation of the breed and breeding sections by analyses based on whole-genome SNPs and mitochondrial DNA sequences  (2) estimate the genomic and mitochondrial differentiation between the four breeding sections  and (3) estimate inbreeding and effective population sizes. Nine hundred and ninety-one samples of horses were obtained either directly from horse owners (hair samples from the mane or tail  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>960) or from a horse hospital (blood samples  with the permission from the owners  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>31). Among these  852 samples were from Finnhorses (67 harness trotters  79 riding horses  30 draught horses  51 pony-sized horses and 641 individuals that are not registered in the studbook) with 16 individuals that were concurrently registered in two breeding sections (three as trotter and riding  three as riding and draught  five as riding and pony-sized  one as draught and pony-sized  four as trotter and draught)  and thus they were included in both breeding sections for the estimations of genetic diversity and differentiation between sections. We also analysed samples from several other breeds: eight horses from different Baltic breeds (two Estonian horses  one Estonian riding pony  two Estonian Sport horses  one Tori horse  two Latvian Sport horses and one horse of unknown breed that originated from Estonia)  30 Warmblood Trotters (including seven American Trotters)  seven Finnish Warmbloods (FWB)  two Hanoverian horses  two Royal Dutch Sport horses (KWPN)  three Warmblood Riding horses  one Oldenburg horse  one Zangersheide horse  one American Quarter horse  one Friesian horse  two Irish Cobs  three Welsh Mountain ponies  one German Riding pony  three Gotland Russ ponies  one Norwegian Fjord horse  three crossbred ponies  one Icelandic horse  39 Shetland ponies  23 Pura Raza Españolas (PRE) and three Puro Sangue Lusitanos (PSL) or mixed PRE/PSL horses  one Sorraia pony  one crossbred coldblood horse and one Yakut horse. DNA was extracted from hair samples by cutting a ~<U+2009>1 cm long piece from the follicle end of ~<U+2009>25 hairs from each individual  then putting them into 200 µL of QuickExtract solution (Epicentre) and following the protocol of the manufacturer. For blood samples  DNA was extracted with the Mobio BloodKit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Mobio). We amplified a 774 bp long part of the mitochondrial control region by using the primers Eca_tRNAThr_L (5'-AAACCAGAAAAGGGGGAAAA-3'  []) and Eca_CR690_H (5'-TTGTTTCTTATGTCCCGCTACC-3'  designed for this study). PCR were carried out with 2 µL of 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>Phusion buffer  0.2 µL of 10 mM dNTPs  0.5 µL of both primers (10 µM)  0.5 to 2 µL (~<U+2009>20 to 200 ng) of template DNA and 0.1 µL of Phusion DNA polymerase  the reaction conditions included an initial denaturation step at 98 °C for 30 s  followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s  53 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s  and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were sequenced using the primer Eca_CR690_H  the BigDye Terminator v.3.1 kit and an ABI 3730 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were aligned by eye with the program BioEdit 7.2.5. []. In order to classify the sequences into previously defined haplogroups  we also included in the alignment the sequences from [] (GenBank Accession Nos. JN398377–JN398457)  and drew a haplotype network using TCS v. 1.21 []. When both a mare and its fowls were sampled  the fowls were excluded from the dataset. We determined the best substitution model for the alignment with the program Mega 6.06 [] and used the suggested model (see ) to calculate pairwise F-values between the Finnhorse breeding sections with Arlequin v.3.5.1.3 []. Indices of DNA polymorphism (nucleotide diversity   mutation parameter   haplotype diversity  and number of haplotypes) were calculated with DnaSP v. 5.1 []. We also used the mitochondrial sequences to estimate the past and present female effective population sizes of the Finnhorse breed based on the Bayesian skyline plot in the program BEAST v.1.8.0 []. BEAUTI v.1.8.0 [] was used to create an input file for BEAST  implementing the aforementioned substitution model with five gamma categories. We performed this analysis with two datasets  the first one including all the samples from the four Finnhorse breeding sections together with a random sample of 50 individuals that were not registered in the studbook  and the second one including only the samples of the breeding sections. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for 10 000 000 steps  using ten groups and the piecewise-constant model. Posterior distributions and effective sample sizes were inspected with TRACER v.1.7.1 []  which was also used to analyse the skyline. To transform the obtained times into years and female effective size estimates into individuals  we used the minimum mutation rate of 2.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and maximum mutation rate of 10<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 []. We randomly sampled 12 horses from each breeding section of Finnhorses (trotters  riding horses  pony-sized horses and draught horses)  12 horses that were not in the studbook and 12 horses from other breeds  i.e. one Estonian horse  two Warmblood trotters  one Irish Cob  one Welsh Mountain  two Shetland ponies  one KWPN (Royal Dutch Sport horse)  one Gotland Russ  one FWB (Finnish Warmblood)  one Norwegian Fjord and one American Quarter horse (Table ). These 72 horses were genotyped using the Illumina Equine SNP70 BeadChip at the laboratory of Dr. Van Haeringen (Wageningen  the Netherlands). This chip includes 65 157 SNPs across the horse genome. Across all samples  the average genotyping call rate was 0.988  after excluding three samples with call rates ranging from 0.355 to 0.419 (one mare and one stallion pony-sized Finnhorse and one mare Finnhorse that is not registered in the studbook; these individuals were not included in further analyses). The data were pruned for minor allele frequencies (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) and linkage (with a sliding window of 50 SNPs  shifting the window 5 SNPs forward and removing SNPs with an r higher than 0.5; –maf 0.05 –indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5) using the PLINK 1.9 software [  ]. Finally  37 445 SNPs remained for further analyses  unless stated otherwise. Genomic diversity and inbreeding were estimated with PLINK 1.9  using the functions –het (observed and expected homozygous genotype counts and method-of moments F coefficient)  –ibc (inbreeding coefficients   which is the variance-standardized relationship minus 1  based on the variance of additive genetic values within an individual    which is based on the excess of heterozygosity within an individual  and   which is based on the correlation between uniting gametes within an individual []) and –homozyg (runs of homozygosity  ROH  using a scanning window of 50 SNPs and recording a ROH when at least 100 SNPs are included across a total length of 1000 kb or more; the X chromosome was excluded). Pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients () were obtained from the studbook provided by the Finnish trotting and breeding association [] or calculated based on the pedigrees from a web portal of a pedigree database of horses that are registered mainly in Finland [] with a minimum of six generations backwards. Observed and expected heterozygosities were calculated with Arlequin v.3.5.1.3 []. Correlations between the different estimates were calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Past and present effective population sizes were estimated with SNeP v.1.1 []  by setting default values  for horses of each breeding section  horses that were not in the studbook  all the Finnhorses and all data (including the mixed breed group). This program estimates the trends of the historical effective population size trajectories from SNP data based on linkage disequilibrium []. First  we used a Bayesian iterative algorithm implemented in the program Structure v. 2.3.1 [] to investigate the presence of population genetic structure by placing samples into groups formed by individuals sharing similar patterns of variation. We used all the 65 157 SNPs and set the length of burn-in periods at 1000  used 10 000 MCMC replications and set the number of populations (K) at 1 to 10 for 10 iterations and used the admixture model with correlated allele frequencies. We performed the runs without LOCPRIOR  i.e. a priori knowledge of the sampled breeding sections or breeds. The Structure results were used to calculate Evanno’s <U+0394>K [] in Excel. Furthermore  the iterations of the best number of populations (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) were used to construct a barplot with the help of the output from the web-based program Structure Harvester v.0.6.94 []  which was used as input for the program CLUMPP v.1.1.2 []. This program aligns the membership coefficients of the iterations. Then  barplots of the individual assignment probabilities were constructed with Distruct v.1.1 []. Population structuring was further studied with principal component analysis in PLINK 1.9  using the function –pca and by calculating pairwise -values in Arlequin. Significance was estimated by 110 permutations. Analysis of the mitochondrial sequences resulted in the alignment of a 631-bp long fragment from 743 Finnhorses and 121 horses of other breeds (fowls excluded). The best-fitting substitution model was TN93<U+2009>+<U+2009>G<U+2009>+<U+2009>I  with a gamma shape parameter of 0.51 and proportion of invariant sites of 0.56 (BIC 34822.183 compared to the second best  GTR<U+2009>+<U+2009>G<U+2009>+<U+2009>I  34843.342). Among all the horses  we detected 249 haplotypes and 158 polymorphic sites  with a nucleotide diversity of 0.022 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00016) and haplotype diversity of 0.982 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0015). Among the Finnhorses  we detected 203 haplotypes and 150 polymorphic sites  with a nucleotide diversity of 0.022 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00018) and haplotype diversity of 0.979 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0019). Among the horses from the four Finnhorse breeding sections  the diversity parameters showed little variation  with nucleotide diversities being highest for draught horses and lowest for trotters and haplotype diversity and <U+03B8> being lowest for pony-sized horses (Table ). Of all haplogroups (A to R  as defined in [])  all haplogroups except O and K were present in the Finnhorses (Fig. ) and (see Additional file ). The sequenced part of the control region seemed to perform as well as the whole mitogenome for assigning the sequences into haplogroups. In riding horses  the most frequent haplogroups were L and M  in trotters B and Q  in draught horses B  C and M  and in pony-sized horses G and L (Table ). Interestingly  two of the haplotypes identified in the Finnhorses belong to haplogroup F  which is present in the Przewalski’s horse (). A Blast search against GenBank for these Finnhorse sequences also resulted in best matches with the Przewalski’s horse sequences (e: 0.0  identity: 626–627/630 bp). For the other breeds for which we had more than 20 representatives  Shetland ponies were in haplogroups D  G  I  L  M  N and Q  warmblood trotters in A  B  G  I  L and N and Pura Raza Españolas in B  G  L  N and Q (see Additional file ). Haplotype network of the sequenced Finnhorses. Haplogroups are named after [] Within each Finnhorse breeding section  the values of expected heterozygosity from the SNP data were lowest for the trotters (0.318) and highest for the pony-sized horses (0.326). Average   which was estimated with PLINK  ranged from 0.003 (pony-sized horses) to 0.027 (trotters). -estimates from Arlequin were slightly different  ranging from 0.004 (trotters) to 0.014 (pony-sized horses) (see Table ). Compared to all other breeds  we found the smallest number of ROH in the Finnhorse breed  with an average number of 8.1 while it ranged from 11 to 38 in all the other breeds studied here (Table ) and (see Additional file )  but in Finnhorses  the ROH were longer (on average 15 036 kb)  while they ranged from 6846 to 14 742 kb in the other breeds. The average distance spanned by ROH was 137.6 Mb in trotters  117.8 Mb in riding horses  104.4 Mb in pony-sized horses  126.1 Mb in draught horses and 131.9 Mb in the mixed breed group. The largest numbers of ROH were found in a Gotland Russ (38  spanning 517.0 Mb) and in a Warmblood Trotter (34  spanning 362.9 Mb)  whereas the smallest number (3) was found in three Finnhorse mares  each from a different breeding section  i.e. one trotter (spanning 25.8 Mb)  one draught horse (spanning 35.5 Mb) and one riding horse (spanning 38.3 Mb). The smallest number of ROH in the other breeds (11) was found in a Royal Dutch Sport horse  spanning 92.0 Mb. The mean sizes of ROH in kb (extending the set 1000 kb size limit) are in Table . The three inbreeding coefficients estimated with PLINK and from pedigrees showed essentially the same pattern: Finnhorses were less inbred than the breeds in the mixed breed group (Finnhorses <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.050  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.024  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.032  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.028  <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.009  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.036  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015  mixed breeds <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.382  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025  <U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.008  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.187  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.057  SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.056). For one horse (Irish Cob) of the mixed breed group  we could not find its pedigree. Inbreeding coefficients of individual Finnhorses varied less than those of the mixed breeds group (: from -<U+2009>0.094 to 0.030 for Finnhorses and from 0.197 to 0.637 for the other breeds  : from -<U+2009>0.020 to 0.079 for Finnhorses and from -<U+2009>0.192 to 0.194 for the other breeds  : from -<U+2009>0.038 to 0.033 for Finnhorses and from 0.066 to 0.334 for the other breeds  : from 0.011 to 0.075 for Finnhorses and from 0.000 to 0.166 for the other breeds). Inbreeding coefficients for each breeding section and breed are in Table . All correlations between the different inbreeding estimates were significant ( vs.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.406 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0005;  vs.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.948 and p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001;  vs. ROH  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.745 and p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001;  vs. ROH  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.878 and p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001;  vs.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.287 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0168;  vs.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.380 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0013;  vs.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.445 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0001; ROH vs.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.622 and p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001)  except between  and  (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.095 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.442) and between  and ROH (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.191 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.117). The Bayesian skyline results show that the female effective population size increased until approximately 110 to 300 years ago (applying the maximum and minimum mutation rates  respectively)  at which point it started to decrease with a steep decline that started about 30 to 110 years ago (applying the maximum and minimum rates  respectively)  both estimates including the time of foundation of the breed (Fig. a). When samples from only the Finnhorse breeding sections were analysed  the steep decline was more pronounced  and during the last 50 years  the female effective population size almost halved from 18 200 (8700 with the maximum rate) individuals to 9900 (2800 with the maximum rate) individuals (Fig. b). The current female effective population size of the Finnhorse breed that is estimated from the complete data  including the individuals that are not in the studbook  is equal to 17 200 (4900 with the maximum rate) individuals. Skyline plots of the female effective population sizes of the Finnhorses based on a mutation rate of 2.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for all the horses of the four breeding sections and those not registered in the studbook horses combined together and  for only the horses of the four breeding sections The effective population sizes estimated from the SNP data using SNeP were small  i.e. only 45 for trotters  56 for riding horses  43 for pony-sized horses  52 for draught horses and 49 for horses that are not registered in the studbook. The effective population size for the entire Finnhorse data was equal to 161  and for the whole SNP data  i.e. including all the other breeds  205. All the horses of the Finnhorse breeding sections as well as the horses that are not in the studbook showed a decline in effective population size over the complete estimated time period of 1000 generations. When the complete data was considered  the decline began slightly later  about 900 generations ago (Fig. ). Effective population sizes estimated from SNP data In the mitochondrial DNA dataset  the pairwise F-values were significant between riding horses versus trotters and draught horses  and between pony-sized horses  trotters and draught horses. We detected no differentiation between trotters and draught horses or between pony-sized horses and riding horses (Table ). For the SNP data  Evanno’s <U+0394>K suggested that a value of 2 was the best number of genetic clusters  which separated the Finnhorses from the mixed breed group (Fig. ). Similarly  the principal components analysis supported the separation between Finnhorses and the other breeds (Fig. a). Among the Finnhorse breeding sections  trotters and pony-sized horses are separated along the x-axis (Fig. b)  but this is not clearly reflected by the -values. The highest values were between the draught-type Finnhorses and all other groups  whereas the lowest values were between the riding and pony-sized Finnhorses (Table ).

Abbreviations:  Royal Dutch Sport horse and  Finnish Warmblood Among our sample of 743 Finnhorses  we found 16 of the 18 previously described horse haplogroups  with only the European haplogroup K and the Middle Eastern haplogroup O missing. Interestingly  haplogroup F  which so far was detected only in the Przewalski’s horse  was present in four of the Finnhorses analysed here  of which three were not included in any of the breeding sections and one was registered as a riding horse. To date  haplogroup F has not been found in any modern horse breed  which is unexpected since it was recently suggested that the Przewalski’s horse  the only extant wild horse species  is derived from the early domestic horses of the Botai culture []. This result contradicted the findings of previous studies that have placed the Przewalski’s horse as a sister taxon of domestic horses  with some possible gene flow from the domestic horse to the Przewalski’s horse [  ]. The existence of the Przewalski haplogroup F in the Finnhorse  if verified by sequencing whole mitogenomes  may reveal surprising events in the domestication history of the horse. Within the Finnhorse breeding sections  haplogroups L and M were most frequent in riding horses  haplogroups B and Q in trotters  haplogroups B  C and M in draught horses  and haplogroups G and L in pony-sized horses. All these haplogroups were considered as of European origin by [] except for haplogroup Q  which has a more Asian or Middle Eastern distribution and is present  for example  in the Arabian horse. Mitochondrial DNA diversity in the Finnhorses (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.022 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.979) is relatively similar to that detected in many other horse breeds [  ]. In the domestic horse  it has been suggested that the large number of haplogroups and haplotypes spread over wide geographic regions results from a large number of mares having been incorporated into the domestic horse population [    ]. This ancestral polymorphism has seemingly been retained in the Finnhorse as well  which is probably due to the high level of maternal genetic diversity of the founding population of the Finnhorse. Contrary to a previous Bayesian skyline plot that was constructed from a mixture of breeds in [] and showed a decrease in the female effective population size about 7000 years ago and an increase thereafter  the female effective size in Finnhorses began to decrease approximately 300 years ago. This decline was accentuated approximately 110 years ago  at the time when the breed was founded  and again approximately 50 years ago  when the breeding sections for trotters  riding and pony-sized horses were founded (Fig. a  b). This is possibly due to a founder effect connected with the selection of horses that were included in the breed and in the breeding sections. The present Finnhorse is closely related to the native Scandinavian  Estonian and Mongolian horses [  ] and presumably to the Russian heavy Mezen horse and the native Lithuanian Žemaitukas horse []. In our study  the Finnhorses also cluster with the native Estonian horse and with the native British and Irish breeds (Fig. ). These close relationships between eastern  southern and western native breeds might explain the presence of haplotypes in the Finnhorse that are found in breeds from Europe  Central Asia and Middle East. Historically  King Gustav Vasa established stud farms in Finland as early as the 16 century  with horses being imported from the Netherlands and northern Germany  to increase the size of Finnish horses. These horses most likely had the same ancestry as the modern Friesian and Oldenburg breeds  including the Spanish ancestry that was used to create the Friesian breed []. During and after the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648)  the Finnish cavalrymen who returned home brought with them horses from Central Europe and the Baltic region that were then bred with the Finnish horses. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries  some Arab horses were imported to Finland as well as Warmblood and heavy Ardennes horses from Sweden  and Orlov Trotters and ‘cossack horses’  possibly Don horses  from Russia [  ]. By the early twentieth century  all this crossbreeding had resulted in three different types of Finnish horses: heavy draught-type horses  light and long-legged (race) horses  and light and tough pony-sized horses []. Although most of the imported horses were stallions because they had more breeding value  occasionally imported mares may have introduced their Central European or eastern mitochondria into the Finnish horse population. Thus  the history of the breed may have resulted in a high level of mitochondrial genetic diversity and in a large female effective population size. Analysis of the nuclear diversity  measured as the expected heterozygosity based on SNP data  showed that its level in Finnhorses was similar to that of many other breeds  including  for example  the Akhal-Teke  Andalusian  Lusitano  Mongolian and Tuva horses []  which all have ‘moderate levels’ of nuclear diversity (the highest level i.e. 0.337 in Swiss Warmblood and Paint horses and the lowest level i.e. 0.239 in Clydesdale). The lowest and highest levels of diversity among our data for Finnhorse were in trotters (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.318) and pony-sized horses (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.326)  respectively. These estimates are slightly higher than the estimates obtained from 27 Finnhorses (0.301) in []  where the dataset was pruned for linkage equilibrium with an r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 compared to our r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.5  which might have had some effect on the estimates. Nevertheless  it is evident that the nuclear diversity of each of the Finnhorse breeding sections remains at a good level. Moreover  although ROH were longer in Finnhorses  there does not appear to be any strong inbreeding  since the numbers of ROH and inbreeding coefficients are smaller than in the other breeds that we studied here. Average inbreeding coefficients () estimated in [] varied from 0.015 in the Mongolian horse to 0.261 in Clydesdale  and was 0.052 for Finnhorses  whereas  based on a larger sample size  we found a lower estimate i.e. 0.032. Although the criteria used for the detection of ROH vary among studies  the length of the genome covered by ROH can be grossly compared between various studies of horse breeds. Using a 50-SNP window and setting the minimum length of ROH to 1000 kb  we found that the mean genome length covered by ROH in the Finnhorse breeding sections ranged from 104.4 to 137.6 Mb  whereas it ranged from 92.0 to 517.0 Mb in the other breeds that we studied. In a recent study []  also based on a 50-SNP window but using another SNP chip to detect homozygous segments of more than 500 kb  the mean genome length covered by ROH was 305.1 Mb and ranged from 227.5 Mb in the Noriker breed (a heavy Austrian draught horse) to 396.5 Mb in Purebred Arabians. Another study []  which used the previous version of the Illumina Equine BeadChip and a 50-SNP window to detect homozygous segments of more than 40 kb  found that the mean genome length covered by ROH ranged from 416.5 Mb in a Dülmen horse (a native German pony) to 953.2 Mb in a Thoroughbred. Although we found no clear evidence of inbreeding  the effective population sizes for each breeding section and for the horses not registered in the studbook were very small (from 43 to 56) when estimated based on the nuclear SNPs. This small effective size can result from only having four founding stallions for the breed but may also stem from recent breeding practices; although such practices were designed to avoid inbreeding  only five stallions have made approximately 50% of the genetic contribution during the 2005–2014 period (estimated from pedigree data based on the expected proportion of alleles in an individual originating from an ancestor []). Currently  the number of matings for each stallion is limited to 150 per year []  which could still be far too many if the aim is to increase the effective population size of the breeding sections and of the whole breed. Moreover  the overall number of stallions in each of the breeding sections is currently relatively small (218 stallions in harness trotters  103 in riding horses  64 in pony-sized horses and 30 in draught horses [])  and the horses share many ancestors in their pedigrees. The effective population size of the entire breed obtained by combining all breeding sections and horses not in the studbook was 161  which is still a reasonably good level and might  in fact  favour the current breeding practice  which is that any registered Finnhorse is allowed to be included in the breeding sections provided that the section-criteria are met. Thus  the non-studbook horses serve as a large gene pool for the breeding sections. Based on the SNP data  we found a clear differentiation between the Finnhorses and the other breeds. All the Finnhorses clustered together in the Bayesian clustering analysis and along the first principal component in the PCA analysis  and were separated from the other breeds that we studied here. However  the differentiation between breeding sections was less clear. In the PCA  some clustering of the trotters and pony-sized horses was observed  but when we estimated   -estimates were significant only for the comparisons between the draught horses and the others (Table ). Based on mitochondrial DNA  differentiation was strongest between the pony-sized horses and trotters  and overall  many pairwise comparisons were significant (Table ). The only non-significant comparisons were between the trotters  draught horses and non-studbook horses and between the riding and pony-sized horses. The higher -values obtained based on mitochondrial DNA compared to SNP data are most likely due to the different mode of inheritance of these two marker types: mitochondrial DNA is haploid and maternally inherited and thus has one-fourth of the effective population size of the diploid and biparentally inherited nuclear SNPs. This intensifies the effect of genetic drift on mitochondrial markers  leading to faster differentiation. The mainly non-significant -values between the Finnhorse breeding sections suggest very weak  if any  differentiation among trotters  pony-sized horses and riding horses. The traits that are used as criteria for accepting individuals in the breeding sections are quantitative  possibly very complex and likely to have very variable heritabilities. Indeed  estimated heritabilities in the Finnhorse breed vary considerably from height at withers and at croup (0.89 and 0.90  respectively) to movement at walk and trot (0.13 and 0.18  respectively) []. The low heritabilities of many of the traits used  the acceptance of new individuals to breeding sections from the ‘common gene pool’ (i.e. non-studbook horses)  the fact that several horses are registered in several breeding sections and that the breeding sections have been founded fairly recently  weaken the differentiation among the breeding sections. We found that the level of mitochondrial DNA variation was high in the Finnhorse  which confirms that the horse domestication in general involved a large number of mares  and the Finnhorse breed was founded using many local landraces. One of the haplogroups (F) that we identified in the Finnhorse breed has to date not been reported in domestic horses  but only in the Przewalski’s horse. This observation opens up new avenues for the study of the domestication of the horse. We show that the female effective population sizes in the Finnhorse and its breeding sections are large  but that their nuclear effective population sizes are small and the genetic differentiation between the breeding sections remains low. Although inbreeding in Finnhorses is lower than in many other horse breeds  the small nuclear effective population sizes can be considered a warning sign. The current common breeding practice of using only a few studs  which  e.g.  have been successful in harness racing or riding competitions  should be restricted and the number of studs used should be increased. This could be achieved by  for example  further restricting the number of matings/stud and by encouraging the use of studs from rare pedigrees.

We were further able to identify metabolic pathways (e.g.  phosphate and phospholipid metabolism and inorganic anion transport) and key regulator genes  such as    and -- that are functionally linked to milk composition. By using an approach that integrated GWAS with network and pathway analyses at the whole-genome sequence level  we propose candidate variants that explain a substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance of CMP traits and could thus be included in genomic evaluation models to improve milk CMP in Montbéliarde cows. About 40% of the bovine milk produced worldwide is processed into cheese; because of this  the cheese-making properties (CMP) of bovine milk are economically important for the dairy industry. Direct measurement of CMP is costly and time-consuming  and cannot be obtained on a very large scale. However  mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry  which is already widely employed to predict milk composition  has been shown to provide indirect measures of CMP that are sufficiently reliable to be used in genetic analyses []. Indeed  because of their strong dependence on milk composition traits []  milk CMP  especially cheese yields and coagulation properties  can be routinely assessed at low cost from MIR spectra []. The information obtained from high-throughput MIR spectra can then be combined with genotypic data from cows that are generated for the purpose of genomic selection to provide a unique resource for large-scale genomic analyses of CMP aimed at identifying the genes involved in the genetic determinism of these traits. Genomic regions containing quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect traits of interest  such as CMP  can be identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By combining the results of genotyping for genomic selection with reference data from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project  it becomes possible to carry out GWAS on imputed whole-genome sequences (WGS) that should contain the causative mutations for traits of interest []. However  even if these analyses are carried out at the sequence level  GWAS alone is generally not sufficient to identify causative genes  let alone causative variants for complex and polygenic traits. Indeed  due to the long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) in dairy cattle  many variants with almost identical P-values that are potentially located in more than one gene or in intergenic regions are generally found in a QTL region  which complicates identification of the causative mutations. Moreover  complex traits are typically influenced by many genomic regions  most of which explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variance and are thus difficult to detect by GWAS. Finally  GWAS performed on a single trait and single marker cannot take either the pleiotropic effects of variants or the interactions between them into account. Thus  a GWAS-based approach is a good starting point for identifying QTL regions but needs to be supplemented by additional analyses to capture a larger proportion of the genetic variance and to understand in depth the genetic architecture of complex traits  such as CMP. In the last decade  methods have been developed that build on GWAS results by using gene network analysis to highlight co-associated genes for a set of correlated traits [  ]. Once the gene network is built  it is then possible to carry out in silico functional analyses  based on databases from bovine or other organisms’ genomes  to identify key regulators that modulate gene expression or to highlight the enrichment of gene-sets linked to certain metabolic pathways. Gene network approaches have been applied to milk CMP []  fatty acid composition [  ]  and protein composition [  ] but  to date  there has been no joint analysis of CMP and milk composition in spite of the close relationship between the two groups of traits. Moreover  all previous studies examined only a limited number of cows (164 to 1100 cows) and genomic variants (50 K or HD SNP chips). The goal of the FROM’MIR project is to analyze CMP and milk composition traits predicted from MIR spectra in the Montbéliarde dairy breed from the Franche-Comté region  which boasts the highest production of protected designation of origin (PDO) cheeses in France. Nine CMP traits (three measures of cheese yield  five coagulation traits  and one acidification trait) and 27 milk composition traits (protein  fatty acid  mineral  citrate  and lactose contents) were predicted with a relatively high degree of accuracy from more than 6.6 million MIR spectra of milk samples collected from 410 622 cows. Of these cows  19 586 were genotyped with a SNP chip. A prior study revealed medium-to-high heritabilities for CMP traits as well as high genetic correlations among CMP traits and between CMP and some milk composition traits []. The objectives of the current study were first  to fine-map QTL for CMP and milk composition traits via GWAS of imputed WGS from 19 586 cows  and second  to explore the GWAS results using association weight matrices (AWM) [] and partial correlation and information theory (PCIT) [] analyses  in order to identify gene networks and metabolic and regulatory pathways that are associated with milk cheese-making and composition traits. For this study  we did not perform any experiments on animals; thus  no ethical approval was required. Details of the animals  milk analyses  and prediction equations were described in a prior study by Sanchez et al. []. Briefly  prediction equations were developed for nine CMP traits from 416 milk samples for which both reference measurements for those CMP traits and MIR spectra were taken. The CMP traits  described in Table   included three laboratory cheese yields (CY  CY  and CY)  five coagulation traits for pressed cooked cheese (PCC) and soft cheese (SC) (K10/RCT  K10/RCT  a  a  and a2)  and milk pH after adding starter for PCC (pH). The accuracies of MIR predictions  assessed by the coefficient of determination (R)  varied between 0.54 and 0.89 depending on the CMP trait (Table ). Milk composition was also predicted using equations that were developed in previous projects (0.44<U+2009><<U+2009>R<U+2009><<U+2009>1; Table ). Milk proteins and fatty acids were predicted with equations that were developed in the PhénoFinlait project [  ]  whereas for minerals and citrate content we used equations that were generated by the Optimir project []. Lactose was predicted by a Foss equation.  Prediction equations were applied to the original dataset  which comprised 6 670 769 milk samples originating from 410 622 Montbéliarde cows. Data from cows with at least three test-day records during the first lactation (1 442 371 test-day records from 189 817 cows) were adjusted for non-genetic effects in a mixed model with the Genekit software []. Herd<U+2009>×<U+2009>test-day<U+2009>×<U+2009>spectrometer  age at calving  and stage of lactation were included in this model as fixed effects  while animal genetic and permanent environmental effects were assumed to be random. Test-day data adjusted for fixed effects were then averaged over a lactation for each cow. A subset of 19 586 cows for which MIR spectra were available had also been genotyped for the purpose of genomic selection by using the BovineSNP50 (50 K  6505 cows) or the EuroG10 K BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  13 081 cows). Means and standard deviations of the traits for this subset are in Table . Using FImpute software []  all genotypes were imputed to the 50 K-SNP level. A total of 43 801 autosomal SNPs were retained after quality control filters were applied. These filters were taken directly from the French national evaluation system []: individual call rate higher than 95%  SNP call rate higher than 90%  minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 1% in at least one major French dairy cattle breed  and genotype frequencies in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with ><U+2009>10.  The 50 K SNP genotypes of the 19 586 cows were then imputed to whole-genome sequences (WGS). A two-step approach was applied in order to improve the accuracy of imputed genotypes of the WGS variants []: from 50 to 777 K high-density (HD) SNPs using FImpute software []  and then  from imputed HD SNPs to WGS  using Minimac software []. In spite of a longer computing time  Minimac was preferred over FImpute to impute on WGS because it infers allele dosages in addition to the best-guess genotypes. Compared to the best-guess genotypes  allele dosages are expected to be more correlated to true genotypes [] and to lead to a better targeting of causative mutations in GWAS analyses []. Imputations from 50 K to the HD SNP level were performed using a within-breed reference set of 522 Montbéliard bulls that were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) []. WGS variants were imputed from HD SNP genotypes using WGS variants of 2333  animals  from the 6th run of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project [  ]. These animals represent 51 cattle breeds and include 54 Montbéliard individuals  most of them being major ancestor bulls with a high cumulated contribution to the breed (80.6%). We applied the protocol defined by the “1000 Bull Genomes” consortium [  ]: (1) short reads were filtered for quality and aligned to the UMD3.1 reference sequence [  ]  and small genomic variations (SNPs and indels) were detected using SAMtools 0.0.18 []; (2) raw variants were filtered to produce 26 738 438 autosomal variants as described in Boussaha et al. []; and (3) filtered variants were annotated with the Ensembl variant effect predictor (VEP) pipeline v81 [] and effects of amino-acid changes were predicted using the SIFT tool []. The precision of imputation from HD SNP to sequence was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R) calculated with Minimac software []. In order to remove variants with low imputation accuracies  only variants with an R higher than 20% and a MAF higher than 1% were retained for further association analyses  i.e. 8 551 748 variants with a mean R of 76% (Fig. ). Distribution of imputation accuracies (coefficient of determination  R) for 26.7 million sequence variants imputed with Minimac. Variants in blue  with R<U+2009>><U+2009>0.20  were retained for GWAS analyses We performed single-trait association analyses between all 8 551 748 variants and the 36 CMP and milk composition traits described in Table . All association analyses were performed using the  option of the GCTA software (version 1.24)  which applies a mixed linear model that includes the variant to be tested []: where  is the vector of pre-adjusted phenotypes  averaged per cow;  is the overall mean;  is the additive fixed effect of the variant to be tested for association;  is the vector of predicted allele dosages  varying between 0 and 2;  is the vector of random polygenic effects  with  the genomic relationship matrix (GRM)  calculated using the HD SNP genotypes []  and  is the polygenic variance  estimated based on the null model  and then fixed while testing for the association between each variant and the trait of interest; and  is the vector of random residual effects  with  the identity matrix and  the residual variance. The Bonferroni correction was applied to the thresholds in order to account for multiple testing. We used a very stringent correction  which considered all 8.5 million tests as independent. Therefore  the 5% genome-wide threshold of significance corresponded to a nominal  value of 5.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.2). When a given trait was significantly affected by multiple variants  the variants that were located less than 1 Mbp apart were grouped in the same QTL region. The bounds of QTL regions were then determined by considering the positions of variants that were included in the upper third of the peak. For each trait  the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by each QTL was calculated as follows:   with  the phenotypic variance of the trait  and  and  are the frequency and the estimated allelic substitution effect  respectively  of the variant with the most significant effect in the QTL region. Co-associated genes were detected from the GWAS results using the AWM approach [  ]. We first constructed two <U+2009>×<U+2009> matrices with variants row-wise (<U+2009>=<U+2009>8 551 748) and traits column-wise (<U+2009>=<U+2009>36). The first matrix contained variants’ z-score standardized additive effects  whereas the second one contained the -values associated with those effects. Among the CMP traits  CY was selected as the key phenotype because it has the highest economic importance to the cheese-making process. The AWM was constructed following the procedure described in Ramayo-Caldas et al. []. SNPs were included in the analysis if their -value for CY was less than or equal to 0.001. Due to the large number of traits analyzed  we calculated correlation coefficients between SNP additive effects for different traits and then selected the set of traits correlated with CY (|r|<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25). Next  we explored the dependency among traits and we estimated that on average  six other phenotypes were associated with these SNPs at the same P-value (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). Other variants with significant effects on at least six traits were finally included in the analysis. Based on VEP annotation []  we then selected only the SNPs that were located within or close to (within 10 kb of) genes. Among these  we retained only one variant per gene  i.e. the SNP that was associated with the largest number of traits or  in case of a tie  the variant for which the sum of P-values for the traits was the lowest. Subsequently  to identify significant gene–gene interactions  partial correlations were computed using the PCIT algorithm developed by Reverter and Chan []; the algorithm was implemented in an R package designed for this purpose []. We visualized the gene network with Cytoscape 3.6.1 []  with each node representing a gene and each edge representing a significant interaction. The centrality parameters of each node were assessed using the CentiScaPe 2.2 plug-in for Cytoscape []. For each node  we calculated the number of adjacent genes (degree parameter) and the relative node contribution (eigenvector parameter)  with the latter value being higher (or lower) if the gene was connected to highly (or poorly) connected genes. Potential key regulators of the gene network were identified using two approaches. First  we used the iRegulon 1.3 plug-in for Cytoscape [] to identify transcription factors (TF) in silico; this method was based on human datasets but included orthologous regions of ten other vertebrate genomes  including . Two types of data were used to identify regulatory regions that were shared by the genes identified in the network: (1) TF binding site motifs in the cis-regulatory regions  and (2) thousands of ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) datasets from the ENCODE project [] corresponding to targets of known TF. More details are in Janky et al. []. We then applied an information loss-less approach [] that explored the connectivity of all regulators in the network  including TF  miRNA  and lnRNA. As recommended by Reverter and Fortes []  we tested trios of TF genes to find the minimal set of TF genes with maximal coverage of the network. Next  we searched in the gene network for enrichment in gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  using the ClueGO 2.5.1 plug-in for Cytoscape []. In order to avoid selecting GO terms that were too general (too many genes) or too specific (too few genes)  we selected the 4th to 8th levels of the GO hierarchy. A gene set was considered to be enriched if the -value associated with the hypergeometric test was lower than 0.05  after application of the Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing. GO terms and KEGG pathways were subsequently clustered in functional groups if the kappa statistic was higher than 0.4. GWAS that was carried out on 8 551 748 imputed WGS variants for the 36 CMP and milk composition traits revealed 236 332 significant variant<U+2009>×<U+2009>trait combinations (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>><U+2009>8.2)  corresponding to 79 803 different variants. Due to the high maximal -<U+2009>log() value for a large number of genomic regions (up to 560 for one of the QTL detected on chromosome 11)  the number of variants with significant effects (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>><U+2009>8.2) was sometimes very large in a given region. Thus  to best target candidate variants  we selected only the variants that were located in the upper third of the peaks  as described in the Methods section. In doing so  we defined 59 QTL regions  which contained 6757 distinct variants (Table ). In each of the QTL regions  we designated “candidate variants” as the variants that were located within the confidence intervals of the QTL and the “best candidate variant” (described in Table ) as the variant within a gene (or its upstream/downstream regions) with the most significant effects.  These QTL regions varied in size (from 9.2 kbp to 8.9 Mbp) and contained from 6 to 401 variants; they were distributed on all  autosomes (BTA) with the exception of BTA8 and 23 (Fig.  and [see Additional file : Figure S1]). In almost all the QTL regions (56)  we identified variants that were located in one or more candidate genes. Around 60% (i.e. 4312 of 7393) of the variants detected in the QTL regions were located within or in the upstream/downstream region of 264 genes [see Additional file : Table S1]. Fifty-one of these variants were predicted to be responsible for an amino-acid change in the protein  whereas most of them (2972) were located in introns (Table ). -log(P) values plotted against the position of variants on  autosomes for cheese-making traits.  Cheese yields (CY) and pH   coagulation traits We found the most significant effects around 103.3 Mbp on BTA11 (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>560)  144.4 Mbp on BTA1 (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>210)  58.4 Mbp on BTA20 (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>177)  1.6 Mbp on BTA14 (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>123)  and 46.9 Mbp on BTA6 (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>120). In each of these five QTL  we identified variants that were located in candidate genes  which were  respectively          and . All the variants were located in introns of the genes  with the exception of the best candidate variant of the  gene  which was found in the upstream region. Four other QTL had more moderate but nevertheless strong effects (-<U+2009>log() between 60 and 83)  on BTA5 (118 Mbp)  BTA6 (87.4 Mbp)  BTA17 (53.1 Mbp)  and BTA27 (36.2 Mbp)  with the best candidate variants located in  (upstream region)   (downstream region)   (upstream region)  and  (3’UTR region)  respectively. We also found candidate variants (-<U+2009>log() between 25 and 50) in 11 other candidate genes  on BTA2 ()  BTA4 ()  BTA5 ()  BTA7 ()  BTA12 ()  BTA19 ()  BTA22 ( and )  BTA25 ()  BTA26 ()  and BTA29 (). Finally  many other variants were identified in various genomic regions that had more moderate but significant effects after application of the Bonferroni correction (-<U+2009>log()<U+2009>><U+2009>8.2); most of these were located in genes. All the QTL regions are described in detail in Table . On average  each QTL had significant effects on about six traits. Only 13 QTL affected a single trait  while the other 46 QTL had pleiotropic effects on two to 26 traits. The QTL that affected the largest number of traits was located at about 1.6 Mbp on BTA14. For most traits  including FC  the variant with the strongest effect was not the well-known K232A polymorphism in the  gene [see Additional file : Table S2]. More than half of the QTL (33)  and in particular those with the most significant effects  had effects on CMP traits. Almost all of the QTL with significant effects on CMP traits presented significant pleiotropic effects on milk composition traits  as well. In contrast  the remaining 26 QTL affected milk composition (protein  fatty acid  mineral  citrate  or lactose content) but not CMP. Among traits  we observed large differences in both the number of QTL detected (ranging from 6 to 19) and in the total percentage of phenotypic variance (ranging from 4.7 to 62.4%) that was explained by the detected QTLs  and simply estimated by the sum of percentages per QTL. Overall  the larger the number of detected QTL for a given trait  the lower the percentage of phenotypic variance that was explained by each. For example  in our study  the most polygenic trait  a  was influenced by 19 QTL  each of which explained only 0.2 to 1.9% of the phenotypic variance. In contrast  we detected only six QTL for SWP but the QTL with the most important effect explained 56% of the phenotypic variance of this trait. As expected  the most heritable traits were those that presented the highest values of the total phenotypic variance explained by the QTL. The trait for which the largest amount of total phenotypic variance was explained by the QTL was ß-LG (62%)  which was also the most heritable trait analyzed in our study. For CMP traits  which are moderately heritable  from 12% (curd firmness) to 30% (curd firming time) of the phenotypic variability was explained by the QTL (i.e. from 27 to 65% of the genetic variance). Cheese yields presented intermediate results  as the detected QTL captured about 20% of their phenotypic variance  i.e. about 50% of their genetic variance. For CMP traits  the QTL that contributed the most were those detected in the regions of the     and  genes. However  other QTL regions on BTA5  6  16  20  and 22 also generated noteworthy contributions. For protein composition traits  the highest-contributing QTL region was the  gene region (up to 59% for ß-LG). The region of the  genes had a more moderate contribution (0.7–5.6%  depending on the trait)  while the lesser-known QTL detected on BTA20 (at about 58 Mbp) explained 18  9  and 7% of the phenotypic variance of a-LA  as1-CN  and <U+03BA>-CN  respectively. For fatty acid content  the QTL that we detected explained a much smaller part of the phenotypic variability. The top-contributing QTL were the  gene region on BTA14 (12% for FC)   on BTA19 (1.5% for C14:0)   on BTA27 (3.2% for C16:0)  and  on BTA26 (2% for C18:1). In contrast to fatty acids but similarly to proteins  a relatively large part of the phenotypic variance in mineral content was explained by QTL that were located in the region of the  gene (3  5  and 10% for Mg  K  and P  respectively) and the  gene (20% for Mg). Two other regions influenced mineral content to a lesser extent: those at 117 Mbp on BTA5 () and at 46 Mbp on BTA6 (). Using the AWM procedure  we reduced the set of 8.5 million variants tested in the GWAS to a set of 38 858 variants that had the most significant effects (-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) on the key phenotype (CY). Seven CMP (CY  CY  and the five coagulation traits) and eight milk composition traits (PC  FC  UNSAT  PUNSAT  C18:1  Ca  Mg  and P) were correlated with CY (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25). On average  each of the 38 858 variants had significant effects (P-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) on six of the correlated traits. We also retained 2322 additional variants that had significant effects on at least six of the correlated phenotypes. Thus  the final dataset included 41 180 variants  which had significant effects on CY or on at least six correlated traits. Of these 41 180 variants  15 330 were located in 736 genes (±<U+2009>10 kb); the PCIT approach subsequently revealed 59 168 significant interactions among these genes. Thus  by merging the AWM and the PCIT approaches  the GWAS results on milk CMP and composition traits could be interpreted as a gene network of 736 nodes and 59 168 edges. The list of the 736 genes selected by AWM is in [see Additional file : Table S3]. For most of the traits  correlation coefficients from the z-score additive effects of the 736 variants retained by the AWM procedure were close to the correlation coefficients obtained from pedigree for the 16 phenotypes (Table ). This suggested that the additive effects of the variants retained in the AWM analysis explained a large and representative part of the genetic relationships among the traits. Among the 736 genes  86 were located within QTL regions that had been highlighted by the GWAS analysis with a most-stringent threshold; these included the best candidate genes for 25 QTL. The remaining 650 genes were unique to the AWM analysis and had not been detected by GWAS. In contrast  178 genes located within the confidence intervals of QTL detected with GWAS were not found in AWM analyses. For each node of the gene network  we calculated the number of adjacent genes and the relative node contribution. Figure  lists the values of these parameters for the nodes of the gene network that were also best candidate genes in the GWAS analyses. This revealed genes that were highly connected with other genes in the network (            and )  genes that were moderately connected (                and )  and genes that were poorly connected (          and ). Centiscape scatter plot view: number of adjacent genes (degree) and the relative node contribution (eigenvector)  for the 736 genes of the gene network and  for the best candidate genes Key regulators in the gene network were identified in silico using two approaches. From the analyses of binding site motifs and ChIP-Seq datasets  first we identified eight TF that presented a significant normalized enrichment score (NES). Each of these TF targeted from 136 to 261 genes in the gene network (Table )  and all eight together targeted more than half of the network genes (416). Using an information loss-less approach  we then identified among the 736 genes the trios of regulators (TF  miRNA  and lnRNA) that had the best coverage of the whole gene network  i.e. trios that demonstrated the largest number of interactions with genes of the network with the least amount of overlap. With this second approach  we found 61 regulators  each with two to 276 significant interactions with genes of the network. The trios that covered the largest number of genes were —— and ——--. These two trios interacted with the majority of the genes of the network  i.e. 529 and 528 genes  respectively. Genes of the network were found to be enriched in five KEGG pathways and 115 GO terms (corrected -value between 2.10 and 2.10)  which clustered into 44 functional groups (Fig.  and [see Additional file : Table S4]). The largest group comprised 15 GO terms; it contained 31 genes of the gene network and was related to the metabolic processes associated with potassium transport.  The next three groups  with 28 GO terms and one KEGG pathway all related to phosphate and phospholipid metabolism  contained 66 genes of the network. Among these  there were many of the genes that had been highlighted by GWAS as having the most significant effects on milk CMP and composition traits:               and . Other groups  (for details [see Additional file : Table S4])  had a functional relationship with milk composition through endopeptidase activity (16 genes  including  and )  protein glycosylation (19 genes)  carboxylic acid biosynthesis (24 genes including         and )  inorganic anion transport (10 genes including  and )  and Ca- (11 genes) and phospholipase- (9 genes) signaling pathways. Description of the five KEGG pathways and 105 GO terms that were significantly enriched among genes of the network and which clustered in 44 functional groups The GWAS approach used here—performed on whole-genome sequences from a large number of animals for complex cheese-making traits as well as fine-scale milk composition traits—led to the identification of 59 QTL regions. In order to limit the detection of false positives  we retained only the QTL that still demonstrated significant effects after applying the Bonferroni correction (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>5.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and therefore those that presented the strongest effects overall. The downside of this approach was that all the QTL in our analysis explained  on average  less than 50% of the total genetic variation of each trait (i.e. 20% of the phenotypic variance)  and this value was probably overestimated. Indeed  when the true effect is small or when the P-value threshold is very low  the detection power is limited and a significant effect may be overestimated  leading to an overestimation of SNP variance. Some QTL were identified with very good resolution (narrow peaks)  such as the 12 QTL for which only one candidate gene was identified within the confidence interval. Other QTL regions were larger and more gene-rich (up to 25 genes within the confidence interval)  and identification of the best candidate gene was not straightforward. To address these two shortcomings—specifically  to capture the missing genetic variability and to better identify functional candidate genes within QTL regions—we carried out additional analyses  which complemented our GWAS results. The AWM-PCIT approach enabled us to identify a more comprehensive gene network of 736 genes from lower significant GWAS results (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) by taking co-associations between traits into account. When we used the additive effects of variants that were located in these genes to calculate correlations between traits  the values obtained were similar to the genetic correlations we calculated from pedigree []  suggesting that the gene network adequately explained the genetic relationships between traits. Finally  in silico functional analyses of genes of the network helped us to identify metabolic pathways and key regulators with functional links to milk cheese-making and composition traits. This last step  in addition to establishing functional links between the gene network and the analyzed traits  enabled us to identify candidate genes in some QTL regions. Therefore  by combining the results obtained through these different approaches  we are able to propose candidate genes for the main QTL regions  and for each  the best candidate for the causative variant  or at least  a variant in high LD with the causative variant. As expected  we confirmed the strong effects of the cluster of casein genes and the  gene regions on protein composition as well as milk CMP. The QTL detected in the casein genes region explained up to 20%  of the curd-firming time while the  gene region explained up to 8.5%  of cheese yields. The best candidate gene variants  i.e. variants with the most significant effects on traits  were located in the downstream region of the  gene  which encodes <U+03BA>-CN (at 87 392 899 bp on BTA6)  and in an intronic region of the  gene  which encodes ß-LG (at 103 301 982 pb on BTA11). The missense variants that are respectively responsible for the <U+03BA>-CN [] and ß-LG [] A/B polymorphisms had much weaker effects: they were ranked 100th and 56th  respectively  among the variants. The region of the  gene on BTA14 had also large effects on milk composition (12%  for FC) and on CMP (6.4%  for CY). In spite of its low MAF in Montbéliarde cows (0.015)  the  mutation [] was the top-ranked variant for traits that were linked with some protein and phosphorous contents  and coagulation traits (1st for PC  a-LA  ß-CN  and P; 2nd for a2  K10/RCT  and K10/RCT) and it was one of the 736 variants retained by the AWM. However  in this gene-rich region  the  gene  which we found to be highly connected  i.e. presenting significant gene–gene interactions with many other genes of the AWM gene network  appeared to be also a good candidate for FC  CY  CY  and fatty acid composition. The best candidate variant  located in the upstream region of  (-) at 1 629 753 bp (rs109035586)  was ranked 1st for 12 traits  including FC  cheese yields  fatty acid composition  aS1-CN  and CITRATE. Interestingly  two polymorphisms in the  gene  including a missense variant that is located very close to the best candidate variant detected in our study (1 629 600 bp)  were also recently found to be associated with fat percentage in a concordance analysis carried out on imputed whole-genome sequences of Holstein bulls []. This variant was also highly significant in our study but was ranked 44th among variants with significant effects on FC. In addition to the three well-known QTL regions described above  we also found evidence that other genomic regions have highly significant effects on the traits analyzed; specifically  our analysis highlighted the                 and  genes  which we had also previously detected in a sequence-based GWAS on milk protein and fatty acid composition [  ]. We confirm here their effects on milk composition and note their effects on CMP. As previously found  the       and  genes mainly affected fatty acids whereas the         and  genes had effects mainly on proteins and minerals. As a consequence  and in accordance with genetic correlations that we had previously estimated from this dataset []  the former set of genes exclusively influenced cheese yields whereas the latter set had greater effects on coagulation traits. Strong effects of    and  which we had previously identified for protein composition []  were confirmed for milk composition and CMP. In each of these regions  the current analysis reduced the size of the confidence intervals of the QTL and  in six of them  only one gene was found that encoded a known protein (          and ). On BTA17  we found two QTL regions associated with de novo milk fatty acid synthesis  i.e. synthesis within the mammary epithelial cells of fatty acids C4:0 to C10:0. The first was within the  () gene  for which the best candidate was a synonymous variant located at 29 938 428 bp. This result corroborates the discovery of Duchemin et al. []  who identified  as a causative gene for de novo synthesis of milk fatty acids through the imputation of sequence variants in this region. These authors noted a splice-region variant at 29 940 555 bp  which was close to the variant that we detected here. However  in spite of its high MAF (0.40)  we excluded this variant because it was not significant in our study (-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 vs. 5.10 for the variant located at 29 938 428 bp). This region had limited effects in our study and affected only short FA traits. Instead  further along the same chromosome  we identified another region with much more significant effects on de novo fatty acid synthesis that also affected CMP and protein and mineral composition. The best candidate gene for this region was  ()  with the most significant variant located at 53 072 959 bp in an intron of . This variant had been previously highlighted for its effects on FA composition in an independent population [] and  in another study  we recently confirmed its effects on both CMP and milk composition traits []. Thus  it is a serious candidate for the causative variant behind the strong effects that we observed in the region. Although the  gene was not an obvious functional candidate  it has been also described as affecting de novo fatty acid synthesis in a recent GWAS performed on imputed sequence variants in this region []. The most significant variant found by the authors of this study was also intronic (53 078 216 bp) but that particular variant was ranked 31 among variants with significant effects on C4–C10. Finally  we identified other candidate genes that contained variants with non-negligible effects on milk composition and CMP traits. Among these  both GWAS and AWM analyses highlighted                       and . The         and  genes have been previously identified as candidate genes for milk yield or milk composition [    ]  whereas the functional link between the other genes and bovine milk composition and cheese-making traits remains to be discovered. The  () and  () genes  which encode transmembrane proteins involved in ion transport  both play a role in the inorganic anion transport that was revealed by the GO analysis. Thus  these genes are good candidates for having an effect on CMP and milk composition  with the strongest effects obtained for phosphorous (about 11% ) and citrate (about 32% ) contents  respectively. For each of these genes  we propose here an intronic candidate variant  located at 58 446 058 bp for  and at 144 395 375 bp for . Very close to but distinct from those identified in previous studies [    ]  this variant is more significant in spite of a slightly lower imputation accuracy. A set of genes  including those detected previously (          and ) and those noted here for the first time (    )  appeared to play a role in phosphate and phospholipid metabolism as well as in the biosynthesis of carboxylic acids  which are fatty acid precursors.  () and  () encode transcription factors; the former interacted with only 16 genes while the latter interacted with 128 genes within the network  including with       and .  belongs to a superfamily of hormone receptors () that regulate the transcription of genes involved in different lipid metabolism pathways [].  () and  (- encode key enzymes in de novo fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid desaturation  respectively  and  (--) is paralogous to  (-)  with the two genes occupying adjacent nodes of the mammary triglyceride synthesis chain []. In addition to their effects on protein composition  the  and  genes  which encode milk ß-LG and as1-CN proteins  respectively  are also associated with genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. These results suggest a close link between milk fatty acid and protein metabolism. In goats  variants that are responsible for a decrease in  gene expression were also associated with a decrease in fat content  probably due to disruption of the structure and secretion of fat globules []. A similar relationship was pointed out in cattle by Knutsen et al. []  who found a major effect of the  gene region on the C4:0 content of bovine milk  and Pausch et al. []  who identified strong pleiotropic effects of variants located in the  gene on fat and protein content. In addition  a strong association between PAEP and omega-3 fatty acids was observed by Boichard et al. []. All of these genes  which contain the top-ranked variants for  in particular  cheese yields and fatty acid composition  thus represent good candidates. Alone  they explained the largest part of the phenotypic variance captured in the present study for CY and FC  i.e. around 16% out of 20%. In addition to the PPARA TF  we highlight here other genes for putative regulators as well  such as  () and --  which interact with many genes of the network (276 and 240  respectively). Both are good candidates for key regulators in the network  as the protein encoded by  has been shown to negatively regulate lipogenesis and -- miRNA has been found to be highly expressed in the mammary gland [  ] and present in milk whey []. Interestingly  all of the regulators that we identified in our study were different from the TF found in previous studies that applied similar approaches to study milk proteins [] or fatty acids []. Unlike these studies  we analyzed here milk protein  fatty acid  and mineral composition as well as cheese-making traits all together  which might explain the identification of different regulatory pathways. However  in spite of this  some of the significantly enriched GO terms or KEGG pathways that we highlight here were concordant with those previously reported for CMP traits (Ca signaling pathway) []  milk protein content (potassium ion transport) []  or fatty acid content (hormone and steroid metabolic processes) []. The approach that we used  which combines GWAS and post-GWAS analyses  was successful both in confirming previously reported candidate genes and in identifying new candidates that appear to be functionally linked to the analyzed traits. This was possible because our analyses were based on a large sample size  sequence-level genotypes  and detailed phenotypes for milk components in addition to complex CMP traits. However  for most of these genes  the top-ranked variant identified here was different both from what we had found before in an analysis of milk protein and fatty acid composition and from what had been detected in previous studies. Since the first GWAS on WGS imputed from the 1000 Bull Genomes reference population  in 2014 []  to date published GWAS based on this approach have generally converged towards the same candidate genes but rarely towards the same best candidate variants in these genes. Using data from humans  Faye et al. [] showed that when the causal variant is less accurately genotyped or imputed than one of its highly correlated neighboring variants  the neighboring variant can capture the association better than the causal variant. However  in our study  the HD SNP  imputed more accurately than sequence variants  were rarely the top variants of the peaks  with the noticeable exception in the  gene. For   the peak variant was more significant than variants already proposed in other studies and slightly better imputed. Nevertheless  we can anticipate that by accumulating bovine sequence data from different breeds and different populations  future runs of the 1000 Bull Genome Project will lead to better identification of causative variants by GWAS. More specifically  the expansion of the bovine sequence database should increase the accuracy of imputed genotypes and thus the probability of identifying the right variant. In addition  if GWAS analyses can be carried out in different breeds  meta-analyses should lead to a better resolution due to the linkage disequilibrium at shorter distances between breeds than within breed  and thus to a better discrimination of causal variants. By combining GWAS and AWM approaches at the whole-genome sequence level on milk cheese-making and composition traits predicted from MIR spectra  this study highlights candidate genes with major effects that are functionally related to milk composition. For most of these  we are able to propose some candidate variants that are likely to be either causative or in linkage disequilibrium with causative variants. In addition to providing a better understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in the genetic determinism of cheese-making traits  this study should make it possible to select a set of variants that explain a large part of the genetic variability of cheese-making traits. The increase in the number of cows for which both genotypes and phenotypes are available allows better detection of variants which could be included in genomic prediction to more accurately select animals with high genetic merit for CMP and finally improve the efficiency of the cheese-making process  which is of vital economic importance in the dairy industry.

Genotype imputation is a widely used tool that decreases the costs of genotyping a population by genotyping the majority of individuals on a low-density array and using statistical regularities between the low-density and high-density individuals to fill in the missing genotypes. Previous work on population-based imputation has found that it is possible to increase the accuracy of imputation by maximizing the number of informative markers on an array. In the context of pedigree-based imputation  where the informativeness of a marker depends only on the genotypes of an individual’s parents  it may be beneficial to select the markers on each low-density array on a family-by-family basis. In this paper  we examined four family-specific low-density marker selection strategies and evaluated their performance in the context of a real pig breeding dataset. We found that family-specific or sire-specific arrays could increase imputation accuracy by 0.11 at one marker per chromosome  by 0.027 at 25 markers per chromosome and by 0.007 at 100 markers per chromosome. These results suggest that there may be room to use family-specific genotyping for very-low-density arrays particularly if a given sire or sire-dam pairing have a large number of offspring. In this paper  we evaluate the value of optimizing the markers that are on low-density genotyping arrays for pedigree-based imputation. Over the past decade  the use of genomic information in livestock breeding has increased substantially and has led to higher accuracy of selection  particularly on traits with a low heritability []  decreased generational interval for some species []  and increased rate of genetic gain []. Many of these gains have been made possible due to the use of low-cost genotypes obtained through genotype imputation. In the context of animal or plant breeding programs  genotype imputation allows most of the individuals in the population to be genotyped with a low-cost and low-density genotype array  while only a small number of individuals (e.g.  the sires and top dams) are genotyped with a high-density array. The markers on the low-density array are used to identify shared haplotypes between low-density and high-density genotyped individuals. The shared haplotype segments are then used to fill-in missing genotypes []. High imputation accuracy is key for maximizing the rate of genetic gain in a population; low imputation accuracy decreases genomic prediction accuracy  which in turn decreases the response to selection []. One of the primary factors that influences imputation accuracy is the total number of markers on a low-density genotyping array. If there are too few markers  then it may be challenging to identify correctly the shared haplotypes between low-density and high-density genotyped individuals. Having more markers increases the specificity of detecting shared haplotypes  but also increases the cost of genotyping  which potentially limits the total number of individuals genotyped. An alternative way to increase accuracy is to keep the total number of markers constant  but to choose the markers to be as informative as possible [  ]. Past work on population-based imputation has shown that selecting markers that have a high minor allele frequency  are evenly spaced throughout the chromosome []  or co-vary strongly with other markers can improve imputation accuracy []. These three factors allow a population-based imputation method to distinguish between high-density reference haplotypes and find the specific reference haplotype that the low-density individual carries. For example  markers with a high minor allele frequency are likely to segregate between haplotypes  thus allowing similar haplotypes to be distinguished. In contrast  markers with a low minor allele frequency may be fixed in most of the haplotypes in the population and thus provide limited power to discriminate between haplotypes. The gains for optimizing the distribution of markers across a chromosome can be substantial  particularly at lower marker densities. Aliloo et al. [] reported a 0.1 increase in imputation accuracy by using an optimized set of 3757 markers compared to a random set. The relative increase was much smaller at higher marker densities  e.g.  the increase was only 0.02 at 11 773 markers genome-wide  which suggests that as the number of markers on a low-density panel increases  the value of any marker selection strategy decreases. It is well known that pedigree-based imputation algorithms have higher imputation accuracies than population-based imputation algorithms at low marker densities []. Therefore  the gains by using an optimized marker selection strategy may also occur at relatively lower marker densities. Unlike in the context of population-based imputation where informative markers depend on the distribution of haplotypes in the population  in pedigree-based imputation  informative markers only depend on the four parental haplotypes. In particular  informative markers are markers that distinguish between each set of parental haplotypes. If the parents have high-density genotypes (potentially by being imputed themselves) and are phased  then the informative markers will be the markers that are heterozygous in the parents. To illustrate this  suppose there is a biallelic marker for which both parents are genotyped and phased. If the sire is  and the dam is   then the marker is informative for distinguishing sire haplotypes. The resulting offspring will be either  or . If the offspring is   we know that it inherited the  allele from the sire and since the sire is phased  we know which haplotype the offspring inherited at that marker. Alternatively  if the offspring is   we know it inherited the  allele from the sire and the corresponding haplotype. If both parents are heterozygous at a marker ( and )  then the marker will be informative for both parents in half of the cases  i.e.  when the offspring is either  or . If the offspring is   the marker will not be informative  since we cannot determine the parent of origin for each allele. We illustrate these conditions in Fig. . A graphical representation of informative markers for pedigree-based imputation The fact that marker informativeness depends only on the genotypes of the parents broadens the options for marker selection strategies beyond optimizing the minor allele frequency and marker spacing only. This is particularly the case if multiple SNP arrays can be developed at low cost. For example  it is reasonable to expect gains in imputation accuracy if the low-density marker array is updated on a yearly basis to track the changing minor allele frequency of the sires and dams in the population  or if multiple panels can be developed to track the allele frequencies in specific subpopulations (e.g.  at a given farm or for a given breed/line). At the extreme  we could consider constructing family-specific genotyping panels. In this study  our aim was to evaluate different marker selection strategies in the context of pedigree-based imputation algorithms and to quantify the extent to which imputation accuracy could be increased by using an optimized marker selection strategy  and determine the marker densities required for those accuracy gains to be realized. To do this  we focused on three methods for creating a single SNP array for a population  and four family-specific methods. These methods place an upper and lower bound on the performance of any marker selection strategy because they represent the extremes: either a single array that was optimized for the entire population  which represents what is currently done in practice  or a family-specific array  which represents the best possible imputation accuracy that can be obtained for a given marker density (i.e.  because every marker is informative). Alternative strategies  which are likely to be more economically viable  will fall between the two extremes. In this study  we used genotypes for 1000 focal individuals and their ancestors from a large commercial pig breeding program. The focal individuals were selected such that they were genotyped on a high-density array (~<U+2009>50k markers across the 18 pig autosomes)  and had five generations of genotyped ancestors. Some of the ancestors were genotyped at a lower density  but all individuals were imputed to high-density. Although the focal individuals were not chosen to be explicitly related  we found that the focal individuals were the offspring of 50 unique sires and 300 unique dams. In total  we extracted the genotypes for 2405 animals (1000 focal individuals and 1405 ancestors). Then  we performed several simulations in which the genotypes of the focal individuals were masked according to a low-density marker selection strategy (explained below) and imputed based on the un-masked genotypes of the ancestors using AlphaPeel. AlphaPeel is a pedigree-based imputation method based on multi-locus peeling []. We ran AlphaPeel by using its default parameters. We evaluated two sets of marker selection strategies in which the markers on the low-density array were optimized either for the whole population  or for a specific family. For all methods  we split the chromosome into  bins  where  is the number of low-density markers  and used a marker selection strategy to select a marker from each bin. For each marker selection strategy  we varied the number of low-density markers per chromosome between 1 and 700 in 16 increments  using 1  2  3  5  10  15  25  50  100  150  200  300  400  500  600  or 700 markers. We evaluated three population-based marker selection strategies. We selected either the middle marker from each bin ()  the marker in the bin that had the highest minor allele frequency ()  or the marker that was both central and had a high minor allele frequency (). The centrality combined with high minor allele frequency was based on the method of Wu et al. []. For each marker  we calculated a score: where  is the distance (in number of markers) between the marker and the centre of the bin  and  is the minor allele frequency for marker . The term () gives a higher weight to markers that are close to the centre of the bin. The term  is the Shannon information content of the marker based on the minor allele frequency and is highest for markers with a minor allele frequency close to 0.5 []. Unlike Wu et al. []  we did not perform a global optimization of the location of each marker  but instead selected the marker for each bin independently. Previous work showed that selecting two markers from the first and last bins on the chromosome can improve imputation accuracy because of the higher than normal recombination rate at the ends of the chromosome []. Due to the small number of markers used in our study (in some cases  only one marker was used)  we selected only one marker from each bin  even for the first and last bins. We evaluated four family-specific marker selection strategies. We selected the marker that was closest to the centre of the bin and was heterozygous in both parents (/)  or heterozygous in one parent and homozygous in the other (/)  or heterozygous in at least one parent (/)  or heterozygous in the sire (/). In the Het/Hom condition  we used  bins and separately selected markers in each bin that were informative for the sire or the dam (if the number of markers was odd  the sire received  bins  and the dam received  bins). If a bin did not contain an acceptable marker for the family-specific strategy  we used the  population strategy to select the marker for that bin. This occurred more frequently when the number of low-density markers was large and the number of markers per bin was small  and in the / and / conditions that had the smallest pools of acceptable markers. For all family-specific strategies  we restricted the pool of potential markers to markers that were genotyped in the real dataset (i.e.  not missing) in the offspring. In addition  we required that the markers be genotyped for the sire in the / condition  for at least one parent in the / condition  and for both the sire and the dam in the / and / conditions. This generally produced a small reduction in the number of markers since most offspring were pre-selected such that they were genotyped at high-density  and most sires and many dams were genotyped at high-density. Because the pattern of missing data differed in each individual  we generated family-specific arrays separately for each individual  even when individuals came from the same full-sib family. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between an individual’s imputed genotype and their true genotype  corrected for their parent average genotype: This measure of imputation accuracy is designed specifically for pedigree-based imputation. It is equal to 0 if no genotype information is available on a focal individual (resulting in the individual being imputed as the parent average genotype)  and to 1 if the individual is imputed perfectly. The goal of this metric is to assess the accuracy of imputing within-family (Mendelian sampling) genotype variation. Based on simulations  we showed a close relationship between this measure of imputation accuracy and the accuracy of the breeding value estimates (see “”). In addition  this measure does not rely on using the population minor allele frequency (as opposed to correcting for major allele frequency  as in []  which may not be representative of the allele frequencies in specific families. In cases for which the genotypes of the parents were missing in the real dataset  we used the imputed values from AlphaPeel to calculate the parent average genotype. This was done primarily to fill-in spontaneous missing genotypes  and to impute dams that were genotyped at a lower density. Imputation accuracies were calculated separately for each chromosome and then averaged across all 18 autosomes. Figure  presents the performance of using either a population-based strategy or a family-specific strategy  for both the (a) absolute imputation accuracy or (b) imputation accuracy relative to the  population strategy. We found that the  strategy was the highest performing population strategy  followed by the  strategy  and then by the  strategy. The difference between the  strategy and the  strategy was less than 0.001 at above 25 markers per chromosome. We found that all of the family-specific strategies outperformed the  strategy. In particular  we found that the / strategy was the highest performing strategy  followed by the / strategy  and the / strategy. The / strategy performed better than the / strategy with less than five markers  but was worse with five or more markers. Imputation accuracy as a function of the number of markers per chromosome and the marker selection strategy.  Provides the absolute imputation accuracy (measured as correlation between the true and imputed genotypes of an individuals corrected for parent average genotype)  while  provides comparison relative to the  strategy The  strategy gave high imputation accuracies across a range of marker densities. Imputation accuracy was equal to 0.312 at one marker per chromosome  0.796 at 10 markers per chromosome  0.903 at 25 markers per chromosome  0.945 at 50 markers per chromosome  and 0.985 at 500 markers per chromosome. Using a family-specific strategy increased imputation accuracy. When the / strategy was used  we obtained an accuracy of 0.424 at one marker per chromosome  0.855 at 10 markers per chromosome  0.931 at 25 markers per chromosome  0.959 at 50 markers per chromosome  and 0.986 at 500 markers per chromosome. The performance of the other family-specific strategies was similar. The increase in imputation accuracy of the family-specific strategies over the  strategy was highest at low marker densities (e.g.  0.11 at one marker per chromosome)  and decreased as marker density increased (e.g.  0.001 at 500 markers per chromosome). In Fig. a  the imputation accuracy obtained with the / strategy is plotted by chromosome and in Fig. b by chromosome length. We found that imputation accuracy decreased as the chromosome length increased  but that this difference was small even for large chromosomes. To quantify these differences in imputation accuracy  we used a linear model to measure the effect of the number of markers and chromosome length (in cM) on accuracy. Chromosome lengths were drawn from []. The linear model treated chromosome length as a linear covariate and the number of markers as a categorical variable to account for the non-linear effect that number of markers has on accuracy. We found a significant effect of chromosome length on accuracy (regression coefficients decreased from a 0.0012 loss of accuracy per cM at two markers per chromosome to a 0.0001 loss of accuracy per cM at 100 markers per chromosome  p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and on the interaction between the number of markers and chromosome length (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001).  Imputation accuracy by  chromosome and  chromosome length. In both panels the Het/Any strategy was used to select the markers on the low-density arrays In this paper  we evaluate the performance of using family-specific low-density marker selection strategies to increase the accuracy of pedigree-based imputation. We show that using parental genotype information to select markers on a low-density genotype array increased imputation accuracy  with the largest gains occurring at very low marker densities (between a 0.11 and 0.05 increase in accuracy for between 1 and 25 markers per chromosome)  and with more limited gains occurring at higher marker densities (less than a 0.01 increase in accuracy at more than 100 markers per chromosome). In addition  we quantified the influence of chromosome length on imputation accuracy and found that increasing chromosome length had a near-linear impact on imputation accuracy when the number of informative markers per chromosome was kept constant. In the remainder of the discussion  we will highlight the performance of each family-specific marker selection strategy  compare our results to previous studies on the optimization of the design of low-density arrays for population-based imputation  and discuss the commercial viability of using family-specific genotype arrays. Our findings show that selecting the markers on a low-density genotype array based on parental information increased accuracy in all cases compared to using the same set of markers for every individual in the population. We evaluated four marker selection strategies and found that selecting markers that were heterozygous in one parent and homozygous in the other (/  Fig. a) yielded the highest imputation accuracies. Selecting markers that were heterozygous in both parents (/  Fig. b) resulted in much lower imputation accuracies than the / strategy  which is likely due to markers in the / condition not being informative if the offspring are heterozygous (Fig. b). In addition to the strategies presented in Fig.   we also investigated two hybrid strategies. The first one selected markers that were heterozygous in either parent (/)  and the second selected markers that were heterozygous in the sire (/). We found that the performance of the / strategy was in between that of the / and / strategies  which reflects the fact that the chosen markers were split between those that were heterozygous in one parent and homozygous in the other  and those that were heterozygous in both parents. We found that the / condition performed well with a few markers per chromosome  but that the gain in imputation accuracy declined more rapidly compared to the alternative strategies. This is likely due to the / strategy placing most of its weight on finding markers that are informative for the sire  and thus resulting in few markers being informative for the dam. All the same  the / strategy outperformed all of the population-based strategies tested  making it a potentially useful strategy when a single sire produces a large number of offspring. We focused on the family-specific marker selection strategies because they concentrate all their genotyping effort on informative loci  and thus these strategies provide an upper bound on the imputation accuracy for any alternative strategy for a fixed marker density. This is particularly important given that the development of a family-specific array will not be economically viable in many cases  particularly if the number of individuals per full-sib family is small  and the cost for developing a new array is high. However  there are alternative strategies that might be more economical  e.g.  developing a new low-density array for each generation or each year based on the minor allele frequencies of sires and dams in the population  or using separate arrays for different breeds or lines. These arrays may produce a larger number of informative markers than a population-based array  but less than a family-specific array. Because of this  we expect these arrays to be useful if less than 100 markers per chromosome are genotyped. At higher densities  these strategies will likely perform similarly to using a single low-density array for the entire population. Our results align closely with those of previous reports on the optimization of low-density genotyping arrays for population-based imputation. Similar to both Aliloo et al. [] and Wu et al. []  we found that the gains in imputation accuracy for an optimized array were highest at low-marker densities and decreased at higher densities. We were also able to replicate the primary finding of Wu et al. []  i.e. that simultaneously optimizing the low-density markers for both a high minor allele frequency and even spacing improved imputation accuracy particularly at low densities. One of the primary goals of our work was to quantify at what marker densities it was advantageous to optimize the design of low-density arrays. Based on the results of Aliloo et al. []  we expected that the performance of any specific marker selection strategy would depend on the number of low-density markers (with higher gains available at lower marker densities). Given that imputation accuracy tends to be higher with pedigree-based imputation compared to population-based imputation []  we expected that the gains in imputation accuracy for pedigree-based imputation would occur at lower densities than for population-based imputation  which was the case. As an example  Aliloo et al. [] reported a 0.10 gain in imputation accuracy using an optimized marker selection strategy at<U+2009>~<U+2009>125 markers per chromosome. In contrast  the gain at 100 markers per chromosome was less than 0.01 between using a family-specific marker selection strategy or using the midpoint strategy. Larger gains in imputation accuracy occurred at much lower densities (particularly between 1 and 25 markers per chromosome). The primary question of using family-specific genotype arrays revolves around the cost and the complexity of deploying such arrays in the context of a genetic improvement program. There are two primary issues: (1) in order for a family-specific array to be beneficial  the density of the array needs to be low; and (2) the use of a family-specific array may require the construction of a large number of arrays  which may be prohibitively expensive. We discuss both issues in more detail below. On the question of marker densities  we showed that in order for a family-specific genotype array to be beneficial  the underlying marker density has to be much lower than that traditionally used in an animal improvement program (<<U+2009>25 markers per chromosome)  and will result in lower absolute values of imputation accuracy than a traditional low or medium density array. This limits the use of family-specific arrays when it is acceptable to have imperfect genetic information  i.e.  when the accuracy of selection can be low  or when selection decisions are not directly made on the genotyped individual. Such situations might include genotyping individuals in a non-nucleus environment to establish a flow of phenotypic information to individuals in the nucleus or performing genetic improvement in breeding programs for which very low-density arrays are used to genotype a very large number of offspring. This might have potential in aquaculture [  ] and crop breeding [  ]. Regarding the question about the number of arrays  because family-specific genotype arrays depend on the genotypes of both the sire and the dam  the number of different arrays that are necessary to genotype individuals in the population may be large. This will be particularly the case when a single dam has a limited number of offspring (most notably in cattle and small ruminants  but also in pigs). In these cases  it may be possible to reduce the number of arrays needed by using a sire-specific genotype array. Alternatively  there may be situations where a single sire-dam pair may produce a large number of offspring as is the case in aquaculture and crop breeding  where a single array for multiple individuals could be developed  or where a more flexible genotyping method could be deployed []. Overall  in this paper we evaluate the utility of family information to select markers on a low-density array. Although we find minimal gains at the densities that are currently used in modern breeding programs (over 100 markers per chromosome)  the increases in accuracy at very low marker densities (between 1 and 25 markers per chromosome) were high. These results suggest that  for traditional animal breeding programs  the use of multiple low-density panels is likely not beneficial  and that there is little gain in optimizing the markers selected for the panel  beyond selecting markers that have a high minor allele frequency and are evenly spaced across the chromosome. However  for breeding programs for which the number of individuals in a full-sib family is large such as for some plants  aquaculture or insect species  and for which individuals would be genotyped at very low densities  there may be value in carefully selecting which markers to place on a low-density array  and potential advantage in constructing family-specific low-density arrays.

In the animal breeding literature  there are many measures of imputation accuracy that differ in subtle ways  which makes it difficult to know which metric to use and complicates comparisons between studies. Our ultimate motivation is to use imputation in the context of genomic selection. Thus  we carried out a small simulation study to assess the relationship between three measures of imputation accuracy and the accuracy of genomic prediction using the imputed genotypes. In this small study  we simulated five generations of an animal breeding program. We assumed that the first four generations were phenotyped and genotyped at high-density. We assumed that the fifth generation was not phenotyped and was genotyped at low-density. Our goal was to impute the genotypes in the fifth generation and predict the breeding values for those individuals. We assumed that each generation consisted of 1000 individuals  which were evenly split between males and females. The next generation was created by randomly mating the 50 males and 500 females with the highest true breeding value. We assumed that they were genotyped with 50 000 markers that were evenly spaced across 20 chromosomes of 100 cM. The initial haplotypes in the population were simulated by using a coalescent simulator  MaCS  and ancestral population parameters derived for cattle (as in []). The remainder of the simulation was carried out using AlphaSimR (Gaynor et al.  personal communications). We simulated breeding values and phenotypes for a single trait for each individual in the population. To do this  we assumed that all 50 000 markers on the high-density array were quantitative trait loci with additive and normally distributed effects. We varied the heritability of each trait between 0.1 and 0.9 in increments of 0.1. We assumed that high-density genotypes were available on the first four generations  and low-density genotypes were available on the final fifth generation. The low-density genotypes were chosen such that they were evenly spaced across the chromosome  similar to the  condition in the main study. Then  we used AlphaPeel to impute the genotypes of each individual in the population. We varied the number of low-density markers per chromosome between 1 and 700 in 16 increments  using 1  2  3  5  10  15  25  50  100  150  200  300  400  500  600  or 700 markers. Imputation accuracy was assessed either by (a) the correlation between an individual’s imputed genotype and their true genotype ()  (b) the correlation between an individual’s imputed genotype and their true genotype corrected for twice the population major allele frequency ( as in [])  or (c) the correlation between an individual’s imputed genotype and their true genotype corrected for twice the family major allele frequency  i.e.  the parent average genotype (  as in Eq.  in the main study). We predicted the breeding values of the last generation using a ridge regression model [  ]. The training population was assumed to consist of all the individuals in the first four generations. We predicted the breeding values of the final generation using either the imputed genotypes or the true genotypes. Prediction accuracy was assessed by evaluating the accuracy of the Mendelian sampling term  that is  the correlation between an individual’s true and estimated genetic deviation from the mean parental breeding value. The relative prediction accuracy was calculated as the ratio of the imputation accuracy using imputed genotypes to the prediction accuracy using the true genotypes: The performance of a given measure of imputation accuracy was assessed by evaluating the correlation and the regression coefficient between each measure of imputation accuracy and relative prediction accuracy. If a measure of imputation accuracy is a good proxy for the resulting prediction accuracy  we expect that both the correlation coefficient and the regression coefficients will be close to 1. If the regression coefficient is greater than 1  this suggests that the measure of imputation accuracy overestimates the resulting prediction accuracy. If the regression coefficient is less than 1  this suggests that the measure of imputation accuracy underestimates the resulting prediction accuracy. Figure  shows that all three measures of imputation accuracy correlate strongly with the relative prediction accuracy  (r  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.979  p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; r  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.981 p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001;   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.989 p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  but that r (b<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.958) has the regression coefficient closest to 1  followed by r (b<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.345) and r (b<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.161). Relationship between relative prediction accuracy and imputation accuracy and when imputation accuracy is either measured as the raw correlation between individual’s imputed genotypes and their true genotypes (r)  or when it is corrected for twice the population allele frequency (r)  or twice the family allele frequency (parent average genotype) (r) These results suggest that using either the raw individual-wise correlation or the individual-wise correlation corrected for twice the population allele frequency will overestimate the usefulness of using the imputed genotypes for predicting the Mendelian sampling term. In contrast  correcting for twice the family allele frequency (parent average genotype) will provide a less biased estimate of the relative information loss with imputed data. These results differ from those reported by Calus et al. []  probably because here  we focus on pedigree-based imputation. In the context of pedigree-based imputation  accurate genotypes can be constructed by setting the genotypes of the offspring equal to the parent average genotype. This will provide high accuracy when using the raw correlation or when correcting for twice the population allele frequency  but will not allow a breeder to distinguish between full-sibs who will be all imputed to the same value (i.e.  the Mendelian sampling terms). In contrast  correcting for twice the family allele frequency (parent average genotype) allows a more accurate assessment of the ability to distinguish between full-sibs  and the overall utility of the genetic information.

Fitting a GRM from the selected variants alongside a GRM from the 50k SNP genotypes improved the prediction accuracy substantially compared to fitting the 50k SNP genotypes alone. The gain in prediction accuracy was slightly more pronounced when variants were selected from WGS data compared to when variants were selected from the HD panel. When sequence variants that passed the GWAS  threshold of 3 across the entire genome were selected  the prediction accuracy improved by 5% (up to 0.21<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01)  whereas when selection was limited to sequence variants that passed the same GWAS  threshold of 3 in regions identified by RHM  the accuracy improved by 9% (up to 0.25<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01).ConclusionsOur results show that through careful selection of sequence variants from the QTL regions  the accuracy of genomic prediction for parasite resistance in sheep can be improved.

The accuracy of genomic prediction improved marginally from 0.16<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02 and 0.18<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 when using all the variants from 50k and HD genotypes  respectively  to 0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 when using all the variants from WGS data. Fitting a GRM from the selected variants alongside a GRM from the 50k SNP genotypes improved the prediction accuracy substantially compared to fitting the 50k SNP genotypes alone. The gain in prediction accuracy was slightly more pronounced when variants were selected from WGS data compared to when variants were selected from the HD panel. When sequence variants that passed the GWAS  threshold of 3 across the entire genome were selected  the prediction accuracy improved by 5% (up to 0.21<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01)  whereas when selection was limited to sequence variants that passed the same GWAS  threshold of 3 in regions identified by RHM  the accuracy improved by 9% (up to 0.25<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01). Our results show that through careful selection of sequence variants from the QTL regions  the accuracy of genomic prediction for parasite resistance in sheep can be improved. These findings have important implications for genomic prediction in sheep. Traditionally  genetic improvement in livestock species has relied on the use of phenotypes and pedigree information of animals to predict their breeding values. This approach has resulted in substantial genetic gains for most production traits. However  the efficiency of these methods declines for traits that are difficult  or expensive to measure  or have a low heritability. Gastrointestinal parasites pose a major health and economic burden to the Australian sheep industry with an estimated annual cost of $436 million []. Breeding sheep for enhanced resistance provides a sustainable long-term solution for controlling infections. Genomic selection is increasingly applied in breeding programs  offering an alternative to conventional methods; it can potentially increase the rates of genetic gain [] and could be particularly useful for traits that are difficult to improve using traditional methods. Whole-genome sequence (WGS) data can potentially accelerate genetic improvement by including causal mutations or variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with causal mutations. However  in practice the use of all the variants from WGS data in cattle populations resulted in little to no improvement in the accuracy of genomic predictions when investigated within breed [  ]. Even if all the causal variants are included in the sequence data  the number of causal variants that underlie quantitative trait loci (QTL) represent only a small proportion  with the majority of these sequence variants being trait neutral. Unless only the markers in strong LD with causal mutations and multi-breed datasets are used for genomic prediction  the accuracy of prediction might not increase  since prediction might be encumbered by the large number of uninformative markers. Furthermore  the effective population size (Ne) is typically small to moderate in some livestock populations such as Holstein dairy cattle []. For small values of Ne  increasing marker density will have a limited impact on the accuracy of genomic predictions []. Previous studies on genomic prediction often gave equal weight to evenly spaced markers  whereas studies now increasingly place more emphasis on quantitative trait loci (QTL) or variants that are selected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A larger increase in prediction accuracy has been reported in dairy cattle when sequence variants that are selected from GWAS were treated as a separate component alongside the 50k data compared to when the 50k or WGS data were fitted alone (e.g. [    ]). A simulation study by [] showed that sequence data can potentially improve genomic prediction by using only the variants that were close to causal mutations  whereas the accuracy dropped quickly when the distance between causal mutations and markers increased. Most existing variant selection methods are based on GWAS results [    ]. However  false positive and false negative associations can complicate variant selection  likely limiting improvements in prediction accuracy. Most GWAS appear to be relatively underpowered due to the small effects of causal variants and to limited sample size. Optimizing the power of GWAS is both crucial and challenging. Without increasing sample size  power could be increased by combining independent GWAS studies together  followed by an integrative meta-analysis [  ]. Another strategy to increase the power of GWAS is to develop statistical methods that can capture the genetic variation of the trait in genomic regions versus single loci. Regional heritability mapping (RHM) offers an alternative to conventional GWAS methods by integrating effects of common and rare variants within one genomic region []. Thus  RHM may identify QTL that may otherwise go undetected by conventional GWAS methods  potentially improving the prediction accuracy. The objectives of this study were to: (1) compare the accuracies of genomic prediction for parasite resistance based on WGS data to those based on 50k and HD SNP panels; (2) investigate whether the use of variants in QTL regions that were selected from WGS data would improve the accuracy more than variants selected from the HD SNP panel; and (3) compare the prediction accuracies between variants selected from RHM  GWAS  or GWAS in genomic regions detected by RHM. To evaluate the effect of preselected variants on improving prediction accuracy  we used a model in which a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) from the 50k SNP genotypes was fitted alongside a GRM from the preselected variants. We hypothesized that this would increase prediction accuracy for parasite resistance compared to fitting the 50k SNP genotypes alone. Parasite resistance  as measured by worm egg counts (WEC)  was investigated in a large multi-breed sheep population from the information nucleus (IN) flock of the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Sheep Industry Innovation (CRC). Details on the IN flock  design  and trait collection and measurements are described in van der Werf et al. []. The sheep CRC has developed a standardized procedure for collecting and measuring this trait. When a random faecal sample within a management group exceeded a threshold of 1000 eggs per gram (epg) in sites predominated by   and 500 epg in sites predominated by other species  faecal samples were collected from all individuals. Worm eggs were then counted using a modified McMaster counting technique []  and the presence of three main strongyle species  i.e.     and  was determined. A total of 10 950 animals were included in the analysis. Ages ranged from 79 to 214 days with an average of 130 days (Fig. ). The animals descended from 612 sires and 6639 dams. Number of records according to age (in days) Various breeds were represented in the population with Merino reaching the most significant proportion (64.6%)  and only individuals from this breed had a substantial proportion of purebred animals (39%). The remaining breeds were mainly represented by crossbred offspring of Border Leicester (BL)  Poll Dorset (PD) and White Suffolk (WS) sires and Merino or Border Leicester<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino ewes. Breed group size ranged from 4262 sheep for purebred Merino to 99 for East Friesian<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino cross. The complete breed content of this population is in Table . All animals with WEC phenotypes were genotyped with the Illumina 50k SNP panel (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA). The following quality measures were applied to the 50k SNP data: SNPs were removed if they had a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01  a call rate lower than 90%  an Illumina GenCall score (GC) less than 0.6  if they were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (a  value cut-off of )  and if the heterozygosity rate for each SNP deviated more than 3 standard deviations (SD) from the population mean. SNPs located on the X and Y chromosomes were also excluded. Furthermore  an individual sample for which the correlation between its genotype and that of another sample was equal or greater than 0.99 was removed. Missing genotypes were imputed using Beagle []. After applying the quality control measures  48 599 SNPs were retained. All animals with WEC phenotypes were then imputed from 50k genotypes to the 600 kOvine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip panel (International Sheep Genomic Consortium and FarmIQ Project NZ) and then to whole-genome sequence (WGS). The details of the imputation to WGS for sheep CRC animals (including those used here with WEC phenotypes) are in Bolormaa et al. []  but it is briefly described here for completeness. The high-density (HD) genotypes were imputed using a reference set of 1881 animals with real HD  which represented four main breeds (Merino  Poll Dorset  Border Leicester  and White Suffolk): 1042 represented various crosses of these breeds  whereas purebreds included 677 Merino  47 White Suffolk  44 Poll Dorset  32 Border Leicester  and 39 from 10 other breeds. After applying the same quality controls as above  510 065 SNPs were retained  and these 1881 HD animals were used as a reference set to impute the 50k genotypes to HD using Minimac3 []. Prior to imputation  phasing was performed on both the 50k-genotyped and HD-genotyped animals separately using Eagle2 []. The accuracy of imputation to HD  tested within subsets of animals with observed HD genotypes  was on average high (0.98). The phenotyped animals were then imputed from HD SNP genotypes to WGS  again with the combination of Eagle and Minimac3 [  ]. The reference population with WGS included 376 animals from the main Australian breeds that were sequenced (with<U+2009>~<U+2009>10<U+2009>×<U+2009>coverage) by the sheep CRC (some were immediate ancestors of the animals that were phenotyped for this study). Data on those animals were combined with WGS data that were available on 350 animals of European breeds from the “Sheep Genomes DB” project []. Details of the breed composition of the WGS reference animals are in Bolormaa et al. []. Sequence variants were imputed for all ovine autosomes but not for the X and Y chromosomes. All variants with a Minimac3 imputation quality statistic (R2) higher than 0.4 were retained  resulting in a final set of 31 154 082 imputed variants. The mean accuracy of imputation from HD to WGS for this filtered set of variants in Merinos  Poll Dorset or Merino<U+2009>×<U+2009>Bolder Leicesters was estimated to be 0.97 []. To avoid potential bias in estimating breeding values  the whole dataset was split randomly into a QTL discovery set and a training/validation set while retaining the same proportion of breeds in each set. The QTL discovery subset consisted of 6431 individuals  whereas the remaining 4500 individuals were assigned to the training/validation subset. Validation groups were chosen from the training/validation subset using a tenfold cross-validation design. The performance of genomic prediction was evaluated across sire families  i.e. entire sire families in the training/validation subset were randomly chosen and combined into ten non-overlapping subsets  each with roughly 450 animals. One of the ten subsets served as the validation group while all the remaining subsets served as the training population. The observed phenotypes of the validation animals were then masked and genomic breeding values were estimated. The accuracy of genomic prediction was calculated as the correlation between the estimated genomic breeding values (GEBV) of the validation set and their observed phenotypes  divided by the square root of the heritability  which was estimated based on the phenotypes of all the animals. We calculated the average correlation across the ten folds of the CV and the entire tenfold CV was replicated ten times and average accuracies were calculated across the replicate tenfold CV. Furthermore  the regression coefficient of the observed phenotypes on GEBV was calculated to evaluate the bias of genomic predictions and those were averaged across the replicate tenfold CV. Variant selection was based on the GWAS that was performed on the QTL discovery subset  whereas effects of the selected variants were estimated and validated using the training/validation subset. GWAS and genome-wide RHM were performed on the QTL discovery subset using WGS data. Phenotypes were pre-adjusted for fixed effects before being used in GWAS and RHM. The fixed effects included in the model to pre-correct phenotypes were: age of the animal at WEC recording  age of dam  gender  rearing type<U+2009>×<U+2009>birth type  contemporary groups (combination of flock site  birth year and management group effects) and breed proportions  which were fitted as fixed covariates. For GWAS  each variant was fitted separately  and a pedigree relationship matrix was fitted to account for population and pedigree structure. A linear mixed model was performed using the GEMMA software [] as follows: where  is a vector of adjusted phenotypes (residuals)   is the overall mean   is a vector of genotypes for SNP  (coded as 0  1  or 2 for the genotypes 00  01/10  or 11  respectively)   is the size of the effect of the marker (allele substitution effect)   is a design matrix for the random additive genetic effects;  is a vector of random additive genetic effects assumed to be distributed as   where  is the numerator relationship matrix calculated from pedigree records extending across nine generations using the pedigree package in R []  and  is the vector of residuals. SNP effects were estimated  and a Wald test was performed to calculate the  values of each SNP effect. Regional heritability mapping (RHM) analysis was performed on WGS data using MTG2 [] and using the same GWAS subset as that for the association study. For RHM  each chromosome was divided into regions with a pre-defined number of SNPs and the additive genetic variance attributable to the joint SNP effects within each window was estimated. A window size of 12 000 SNPs (~<U+2009>1 Mbp) was used to construct the genomic relationship matrix () from WGS genotypes in that specific region and the window was then shifted along the whole genome in steps of 6000 SNPs (0.5 Mbp). The significance of each window was then assessed by the likelihood ratio test (LRT)  comparing the full model (Model 2)  which includes the regional effect  with the base model which includes mean  and random animal and error terms (Model 3). Variance components were estimated using the residual maximum likelihood (REML) analysis as implemented in MTG2 assuming the following models: where the terms are as defined above in Model 1  but where  is the additive genetic effect estimated from SNPs in region  (window) and assumed to be distributed as   where  is the genomic relationship matrix constructed from SNPs in region   and  is the genetic variance explained by SNPs in region . The phenotypic variance () was given by  and therefore the regional genomic heritability was estimated as . For the RHM approach  LRT was assumed to follow a mixture of  and  distributions []. In total  4659 windows were tested across the genome. Windows identified with  higher than 3 were selected for further refinement using RHM analysis with a smaller 250-kbp window size and using variants within each window from either the 50k  HD  or WGS data in order to compare mapping precision across the three marker densities. Seven scenarios with different subsets of prediction variants were evaluated  using either WGS or HD genotypes and variants that were selected based on either GWAS  RHM or a combination of both. An overview of all scenarios  including the number of selected variants in each scenario  is in Table . In scenarios 1 and 2  variants were selected from GWAS results  testing all the variants across the entire genome. Variants that passed the GWAS  ( value) threshold of 3 were selected. In scenarios 3 to 5  variants were selected from windows that were identified by RHM analysis using a window size of 1 Mbp for scenario 3 and 250 kbp for scenarios 4 to 5. Windows that passed the  threshold of 3 were considered for variant selection  and all variants within those windows were selected. In scenarios 6 and 7  variants were also selected from windows that passed the RHM  threshold of 3  however variant selection in those windows was limited to variants with a GWAS  higher than 3. For all the scenarios  the selected variants were pruned for high LD () using PLINK () on 100-kbp windows by shifting every 50 kbp. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) were calculated using the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model as implemented in MTG2 []. MTG2 provides REML analysis to estimate variance components and breeding values. GBLUP was performed using a  built from the 50k  HD  or WGS markers. A GBLUP model that includes both a  from the 50k data () fitted together with a  from the selected variants () was also evaluated. Variants used in  were selected from one of the seven scenarios in Table . Variants included in  were excluded from the  for that scenario. In the models where  was fitted together with   GEBV were computed by adding the estimated genetic effects from  to those estimated from . In the scenarios in which  was tested  the proportion of variance explained by the selected variants  was calculated as: where  is the variance explained by the selected variants in each scenario and  is the variance explained by the 50k SNPs. Manhattan plots of the GWAS and RHM results for parasite resistance using WGS data are in Figs.  and   respectively. The numbers of variants from GWAS with a  higher than 3 before and after LD pruning were equal to 17 154 and 3913  respectively  all of these spanning the 26 ovine autosomes. For RHM based on WGS data  only 11 windows  which overlapped with five regions on OAR2  3  6  18  and 24 passed the  threshold of 3. These five RHM regions  between 105.2 and 119.3 Mbp on OAR2  148 and 149 Mbp on OAR3  34.3 and 38.2 Mbp on OAR6  17.2 and 18.3 Mbp on OAR18  and 39.9 and 41.9 Mbp on OAR24  all contained SNPs that were also selected in the GWAS results at the  thresholds 3.

The y-axis shows the  ( values) for each window and the x-axis shows the window number across the genome. The dashed horizontal line corresponds to the  ( value) threshold of 3 Windows that were identified by RHM using WGS data with  higher than 3 were selected for further RHM analysis using a 250-kbp window size. To investigate the impact of marker density on mapping precision  RHM was performed on those regions and using variants from the three marker densities: 50k  HD  and whole-genome sequence variants.  values of RHM using a 250-kbp window size from the HD data were similar to those obtained from sequence data for the regions on OAR2  6  18  and 24  except for the region on OAR3  which had a higher  value when RHM was based on sequence data compared to HD data (Figs.         ). However   values of RHM based on the 50k panel were lower than those of RHM based on the HD and WGS panels. GWAS results for the selected regions based on WGS variants generally have both increasingly higher and sharper peaks than GWAS results based on HD or 50k variants.

Each RHM result was positioned at its midpoint. Wheat-coloured dots are GWAS results from WGS variants Accuracies of genomic predictions for parasite resistance based on GBLUP using all genome-wide variants from the three marker densities (50k  HD  and WGS) are in Table . Using all the variants from WGS and HD data gave a 3% () and 2% () increase in prediction accuracy  respectively  compared to using variants from the 50k panel (). The slope of the regression of the adjusted phenotypes on GEBV  improved from 0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.015 when using the 50k variants to 0.91<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.014 and 0.95<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.013 when using the HD and WGS variants  respectively. Accuracies of genomic predictions using variants that were selected from either HD or WGS data fitted together with the 50k variants are in Table . Fitting a GRM from the selected variants with a GRM from the 50k genotypes improved the prediction accuracy by varying degrees when compared to fitting the 50k SNPs alone. Sequence variants selected from RHM window sizes of 250kbp (scenario 4) slightly improved the prediction accuracy by 1% compared to sequence variants selected from RHM window sizes of 1 Mbp (scenario 3). There was no difference in prediction accuracy when variants were selected from WGS genotypes compared to those selected from HD genotypes when selection was based only on RHM results. However  when selection was based on GWAS results within the identified RHM regions  the prediction accuracy for variants selected from WGS data (scenario 6) slightly improved by 2% compared to those selected from HD data (scenario 7). The highest prediction accuracy was obtained when sequence variants  that passed the GWAS  threshold of 3 within windows identified by RHM (0.25 )  were selected. All scenarios showed some degree of bias  with slopes ranging from 0.86 for scenario 1 to 0.97 (nearly unbiased) for scenario 7. The estimated heritability of WEC  based on pedigree or WGS data  was moderate (0.20<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03)  which suggests that a reasonable part of the phenotypic variation is heritable and therefore repeatable.  varied substantially across the scenarios  ranging from 0.0139<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0072 for scenario 7 to 0.036<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.013 for scenario 1  and it was generally higher when variants were selected from WGS than HD in the same scenario (Fig. ). However  differences between scenarios were smallest when variant selection was based only on RHM results (scenario 4 vs. scenario 5) and largest when variant selection was based only on GWAS results (scenario 1 vs. scenario 2). When using selected variants only  the highest prediction accuracy 0.018<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.008 of  (10% of the genetic variance) was obtained with the set of variants generated by scenario 6. Although variants used in scenario 1 resulted in lower prediction accuracy than variants in scenario 6  they explained the largest  (0.036<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.013  20% of total heritability) among all the scenarios that were tested. These variants probably estimate a proportion of the polygenic effect rather than accurately estimating the genetic variance due to the causal variants only. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by each set of selected markers. Each coloured dot refers to a scenario with its corresponding number. Red dots represent scenarios using WGS data and blue dots represent scenarios using HD data. The x-axis represents the proportion of variance explained by each set of selected variants and the y-axis represents the prediction accuracy obtained when the selected variants were used for genomic prediction In this study  we investigated the possible improvements in QTL discovery and accuracy of genomic prediction for parasite resistance in Australian sheep when using whole-genome sequence data. Using a GRM built from WGS data explained marginally more genetic variation than a GRM built from 50k (4% more) or HD SNP genotypes (1% more). The accuracy of genomic prediction improved by 3 and 1% when using WGS data compared to using 50k and HD genotypes  respectively. The bias of genomic prediction also decreased by 13 and 4% when using WGS data compared to using 50k and HD SNP genotypes  respectively. Fitting variants selected from WGS together with the 50k SNP genotypes improved the prediction accuracy for parasite resistance substantially  up to 9%  compared to fitting the 50k SNPs alone. Of all the scenarios tested  the highest prediction accuracy i.e.  was reached when variants from WGS were selected based on a GWAS  threshold of 3 in windows identified by RHM. Significant regions identified by RHM jointly explained only 10% of the estimated heritability. RHM using a window size of 250 kbp narrowed the peaks for those regions although the  values remained similar. Using smaller window sizes (e.g. 150 kbp)  in an attempt to improve the mapping resolution  did not further narrow those peaks or provide  values higher than 3. In fact  the significance of the peaks decreased with window sizes smaller than 250 kb  except for a slight improvement in the region on OAR2. Overall  the significance level and the size of the QTL effects were relatively small  which combined with the observation that only a small part of the genetic variance was explained by the significant regions  suggests that the genetic architecture underlying the WEC phenotype is relatively polygenic. A similar observation was made by Riggio et al. [] when using RHM for mapping QTL regions for parasite resistance in Scottish blackface sheep. In comparison with previous mapping studies  the identified OAR2 region fell within the QTL region (61.7–137.9 Mbp) reported by Crawford et al. [] for resistance to  in Romney and Coopworth crossbred sheep  and partly overlapped with the QTL region (117.9–133.9 Mbp) reported by Davies et al. [] for resistance to  in Scottish blackface sheep. The region on OAR6 corresponds to the QTL region (33–39 Mbp) reported by Riggio et al. [] for resistance to strongyles in Scottish Blackface sheep and the QTL region (25.1–62.6 Mbp) reported by Silva et al. [] for resistance to  and  in a backcross of Red Maasai and Dorper sheep. The region identified on OAR3 (148–149 Mbp) is close to the  locus () at 151 Mbp  which plays a crucial role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens [  ]. Comparison with other mapping studies showed that this region was within the QTL region (127.3–157.8 Mbp) reported by Dominik et al. [] for eosinophil count in a Romney<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino backcross sheep and the QTL region (138.6–150.3 Mbp) reported by Davies et al. [] for immunoglobulin A (IgA) activity in Scottish blackface sheep. In addition  Riggio et al. [] identified two significant SNPs around 150 Mbp on OAR3 that were associated with IgA and WEC traits in Scottish blackface sheep. In this study  increasing marker density from 50k to WGS genotypes resulted only in a small improvement in prediction accuracy for parasite resistance. Similar results were also reported for growth and meat quality traits in the Australian sheep population when increasing the marker density from 50k to WGS genotypes (2% on average) [  ]. Although increasing marker density to WGS adds a very large number of genome-wide markers  only a few of these are within or close to causal mutations  leaving the majority of markers in weak or incomplete LD with causal mutations. Variants in weak or incomplete LD with causal mutations add noise  thus limiting the accuracy of genomic prediction  which means that only a limited increase in prediction accuracy will be achieved when using all sequence data unless only the variants in strong LD with causal mutations are used. This agrees with results from simulation studies by van den Berg et al. [] and Pérez-Enciso et al. []  which showed a rapid decrease in prediction accuracy when more variants in low LD with causal mutations were included in the prediction models compared to fitting only causal mutations. In our data  we used individuals from a range of breeds. Using many markers that are not closely linked to QTL would be even less useful in this case  because the LD phases between observed variants and QTL across populations are more inconsistent. LD between markers and QTL would be conserved over shorter distances across-breeds than within-breeds. However  using markers in close LD with causal variants may provide information for genomic prediction across breeds  although to date there is little evidence that this is meaningful across breeds. A multibreed population can be valuable for fine mapping of QTL with WGS data  which provide more predictive markers that are in closer LD with causal variants. In this study  the top variants from WGS data increased prediction accuracy more than those from HD data when fitting the top variants from the identified regions and the 50k markers in a separate GRM. For the same sheep population  Duijvesteijn et al. [] performed a multi-breed GWAS using WGS data on five meat quality traits and detected many new regions that had not been previously identified using lower density SNP arrays. Moghaddar et al. [] showed that when fitting sequence variants selected from these identified regions together with the standard 50k variants  prediction accuracy for the meat quality traits improved by up to 6% for Australian sheep. Fitting a GRM from the selected variants together with a GRM from the 50k SNP genotypes substantially improved the prediction accuracy for parasite resistance compared to fitting only 50k SNP genotypes. In this study  the selected variants were obtained from either the HD or WGS data and are likely to be closer to causal mutations than variants from 50k genotypes. Importantly  when variants were selected from WGS data  the prediction accuracy slightly improved by an additional 2% over HD selected SNPs. This is probably because variants selected from WGS data are more likely to be in high LD with rare causal variants that are not fully tagged by variants selected from the HD SNP panel. In our study  variants were selected from a separate QTL discovery set and their effects were estimated and validated using the training/validation set. This procedure was performed in order to avoid any potential bias in estimating breeding values []. The dataset was split randomly into a QTL discovery set and a training/validation set while simultaneously retaining the same proportion of breeds in each set. The estimates of QTL variants can be biased if they are selected and their effects subsequently estimated and validated using the same dataset. Hence  there is a trade-off such that when including all the animals in the training dataset the prediction accuracy based on the 50k genotypes improves slightly (i.e. prediction accuracy was 0.18 using the larger training dataset compared to 0.16 using the reduced training dataset)  however  there is potential for the bias to be quite severe  since we select relatively only a few of the top variants from the larger dataset. This was also observed by []. Splitting the data in this way requires to find a balance between the power and accuracy of QTL discovery and the accuracy of genomic prediction although we did not attempt to formally optimise this balance. The improvement in accuracy of genomic predictions when fitting the selected variants in a separate variance component is most likely due to the GBLUP model with two components of genetic effects  which allows the effects of the selected variants from HD or WGS data to have a larger variance than those from the 50k genotypes  thus putting more weight on the preselected variants. This is in line with results from a study by Brøndum et al. [] who used variants selected from WGS data by GWAS to predict the genetic merit of production traits in dairy cattle. Their study reported up to 4% increases in prediction accuracy for Nordic Holstein animals  up to 5% for French Holstein  and up to 3% for Nordic Reds when variants selected from WGS data were fitted in a separate component together with the 50k genotypes. Furthermore  van den Berg et al. [] reported substantial increases in prediction accuracy for milk production in Holstein  Jersey and Danish Red cattle up to 10% when sequence variants selected from multi-breed GWAS were fitted in a separate component with the 50k genotypes  whereas there was no increase in prediction accuracies for Holstein cattle when all sequence variants were used for genomic predictions [  ]. GWAS have been increasingly used in genomic prediction studies to identify and select variants to be included in genomic prediction models (e.g. [    ]). Unfortunately  type-1 (false positive) and type-2 (false negative) errors can complicate variant selection and obscure the genetic architecture of the trait. In this study  the prediction accuracy improved by 5% when selection was based only on GWAS results across the entire genome  and 9% when selection was limited only to variants that were detected by GWAS in regions identified by RHM. On the one hand  the probability of type-1 errors in GWAS is generally minimized by setting very stringent thresholds [  ]. These thresholds are reasonable because after testing tens of millions of genome-wide variants  there can be many random variants that have small  values purely by chance. However  avoiding type-1 errors may inflate type-2 errors  especially when GWAS are underpowered because of the small effects of causal mutations and/or limited sample size. Balancing between both type-1 and type-2 errors is therefore crucial for GWAS analyses. On the other hand  RHM can increase the power of detection by integrating the effects of multiple variants that are grouped together in a sliding window [    ]. Furthermore  RHM can potentially control type-1 errors much better than GWAS because the number of tests generated by RHM is much smaller than that by GWAS  especially when the associations are performed on WGS data (~<U+2009>5000 tests from RHM using a window size of 1 Mbp compared to tens of millions of tests from GWAS). In spite of the potential advantage of using RHM over GWAS in controlling both type-1 and type-2 errors  GWAS can potentially map the causal variants more precisely than RHM  especially when sequence data are used. RHM facilitates the capture of genetic variation in a given region by integrating the effects of all variants  which may also contain variants with no effect on the trait. For better optimization  one might suggest performing RHM with smaller window sizes. However  in this study  this was not always the case. Moving window size from 250 kbp to smaller sizes (e.g. 150 kbp) led to improved mapping power only in a few cases  i.e. for some windows in the region on OAR2 (results not shown). The highest accuracy (0.25<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01) was obtained when selection within each RHM window was limited to the variants detected from GWAS. This confirms our expectation that restricting the number of prediction variants per window results in higher prediction accuracy than using all the variants. Similar results were also reported by van den Berg et al. [] who obtained higher prediction accuracies when the number of selected variants per QTL interval was limited to the few variants with the lowest  values than selecting all the variants within the QTL region. Our results suggest that RHM combined with GWAS could be a better approach for mapping regions and increasing the prediction accuracy for parasite resistance. Our findings show that  by carefully selecting variants from sequence data  the accuracy of genomic predictions can be substantially improved compared to a standard GBLUP based on 50k SNP data. The largest observed gain was a 9% increase in accuracy (from 0.16 to 0.25)  which was achieved when selection was restricted to sequence variants detected by GWAS in regions identified by RHM.

This study contributes to the knowledge on the genomic control of response to heat stress in laying hens. Heat stress negatively affects the welfare and production of chickens worldwide. Heat is considered one of the most ubiquitous environmental challenges to laying hens around the world []. Numerous studies have reported a consistent decrease in feed intake  body weight  egg production  egg quality  and feed efficiency after exposure to high environmental temperatures [   ]. Lower egg production and lower egg quality mean that food security and food safety for the global human population are also negatively impacted by heat stress in laying hens []. Many of the studies that have reported the effects of high ambient temperature on the losses in production in broilers and layers have been reviewed by []. However  few studies have investigated the genetic component of the response to high ambient temperature in laying hens. Mack et al. [] demonstrated genetic differences in production and behavior traits during a heat challenge between two genetically and phenotypically distinct lines of White Leghorns (DeKalb XL and KGB)  which opens the door for identifying genomic regions or variants that impact layer production under high ambient temperature. In this study  we exposed white egg-laying hens to a 4-week heat challenge. Egg production  feed intake  body weight  digestibility  and egg quality traits were recorded before exposure to heat and at multiple time points during exposure to heat to quantify changes in these phenotypes. Heritabilities were estimated and associations between these traits and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested using genotype information from the Axiom Chicken 600k Genotyping SNP Array [] (Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc.  Waltham  MA  USA). Understanding the genetic control of response to heat exposure should contribute to the implementation of selective breeding to produce chickens that are more tolerant to heat stress. Hy-Line W-36 female parent line chicks were reared at Hy-Line International (Dallas Center  IA) until 18 weeks of age. For this study  we used 400 pullets that were transported from Hy-Line International to Virginia Tech (Blacksburg  VA). The birds were transferred into pullet transportation coops  loaded into a long haul livestock trailer that was outfitted with ventilation fans  transported overnight  and immediately transferred to individual cages in an environmentally-controlled room in order to reduce as much as possible exposure to high temperatures during transportation. Four cages (length 38.1 cm<U+2009>×<U+2009>width 22.9 cm  height 43.2 cm) were stacked on one of three levels in each bank with the resulting 12 cages placed on wheels so that they could be transported from pre-heat to heat treatment chambers. Temperature was maintained at 23 °C until 24 weeks of age for acclimation. Birds were allowed ad libitum access to a mash layer diet and water. The diet contained 0.20% titanium dioxide as a marker for the calculation of apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn). At the beginning of the heat treatment  each battery cage bank was split into two  and each of these was placed into pre-heated rooms (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>200 hens  each) that received the same treatment. Heat treatment began at 24 weeks of age and continued until 28 weeks of age  i.e. during 4 weeks. The profile of the daily heat cycle  beginning at 9:00 am  was 7 h at 35 °C and then at 30 °C for the remaining 17 h. Eggs were collected each day between 9:00 and 10:00 am. Egg weight  egg production  and egg mass were recorded individually each day and averaged over 2-week periods: the 2 weeks before initiating the heat treatment  the first 2 weeks of heat treatment  and the last 2 weeks of heat treatment. Feed intake was recorded for the same 2-week periods by weighing the feed added each day and weighing the feed remaining at the end of each 2-week period. Egg quality measurements (Haugh units  albumen weight  yolk weight  shell weight  and shell thickness) were recorded 1 day before exposure to heat  then 2 days  1  2  3  and 4 weeks after initiating the heat treatment. Haugh units were measured with a Mattox and Moore Haugh meter. After determining the Haugh unit of each egg  the yolk was separated from the albumen and their weights were recorded. To quantify shell thickness  shells were left to dry overnight at room temperature  then three individual measurements of each egg’s thickness were recorded with a micrometer and an average value was calculated per egg. Cloacal body temperature measurements and sampling of fecal material for calculation of AMEn  were performed 1 day before exposure to heat  three to five hours after initiating the heat treatment on the first day  and 2 and 4 weeks after initiating the heat treatment. Gross energy (kcal/g)  nitrogen (g)  and titanium (%) contents were quantified from feed and fecal samples to calculate AMEn [] using the following equations []: The terms acute and chronic refer  respectively  to the first measurement of a trait after the initiation of heat treatment and the later measurements of the same trait. The specific time of measurement of the acute traits varies with the phenotype. Blood was collected before exposure to heat and after initiating the heat treatment for in-depth analysis of blood gas and chemistry components. The genetic analysis of these traits is described in a companion manuscript []. Whole blood was collected from the 400 pullets at 17 weeks of age and shipped to GeneSeek  Neogen Genomics (Lincoln  NE  United States). Genomic DNA was isolated and used for genotyping with the Axiom Chicken 600k Genotyping SNP Array [] (Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc.  Waltham  MA  USA). Axiom Chicken Genotyping Array annotation files  release 35  were based on the galGal genome version 5.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following quality filtering criteria  which are described in the Axiom Analysis Suite User Guide obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific []  were applied: call rate (CR)<U+2009>=<U+2009>95  minor allele frequency (MAF)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01  Fisher’s linear discriminant (FLD)<U+2009>=<U+2009>4  homozygote ratio offset (HomRO)<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.6  BB cluster variance X (BB.varX)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9  BB cluster variance Y (BB.varY)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.45  AB cluster variance X (AB.varX)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.55  AB cluster variance Y (AB.varY)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5  AA cluster variance X (AA.varX)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6  homozygous Fisher’s linear discriminant (HomFLD)<U+2009>=<U+2009>9  heterozygous strength offset (HetSO)<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.2  and conversion type<U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>off-target variant (“OTV”). After these filtering steps  261 509 SNPs and 374 animals remained for analyses. For all traits  differences between all the measurements performed before exposure to heat and after initiating the heat treatment were calculated to determine the change in each phenotype caused by heat across time. These values were used for estimating heritabilities and the association analysis. Heritabilities and variance components were estimated using ASReml 4.0 [] with a univariate animal model:  is the dependent variable of each phenotype (phenotypes are listed in Tables    and )   is animal and  is cage row within a room. A fixed effect for cage row within the room () was included if the effect on the phenotype was significant  which was the case for body temperature only. Animal genetic effects () with a genomic relationship matrix computed from SNP genotypes  as described by []  and residual effects () were the two random effects. Heritabilities were defined as different from 0 when they were more than two times the standard error. Only the traits that had an estimated heritability different from 0 were used in the association analyses  since a heritability not different from 0 indicates absence of a genetic component and thus association analysis is not appropriate. Association analyses were performed using a hierarchical generalized linear model (same effects as described for the estimation of heritabilities) [] in GenABEL []. The association analysis method used in GenABEL  polygenic hglm and mmscore  is similar to the FASTA method used for related individuals as described by []. To determine the number of independent tests  we used a modified Bonferroni multiple test correction  previously described in []  and found 16 085 independent tests. The 20% genome-wide threshold was calculated to be 1.2<U+2009><U+2009>10. Seventeen phenotypes had heritability estimates higher than 0: feed intake (2 weeks after initiating the heat treatment (hereafter termed as post-heat)  0.31)  feed efficiency (2 weeks post-heat  0.23)  body weight (before exposure to heat (hereafter termed pre-heat)  0.35; 2 weeks post-heat  0.44; 3 weeks post-heat  0.31; 4 weeks post-heat  0.37)  albumen weight (acute heat  0.39; 1 week post-heat  0.42; 2 weeks post-heat  0.23)  Haugh units (pre-heat  0.26; 1 week post-heat  0.59; 2 weeks post-heat  0.24; 4 weeks post-heat  0.40)  egg mass (pre-heat  0.43; 2 weeks post-heat  0.30; 4 weeks post-heat  0.24)  and change in egg mass from prior to heat exposure to 4 weeks after initiation of heat exposure (Tables    and ). This last trait was the only one calculated as a change before and after heat treatment that had a measureable heritability  0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 (data not shown for the other traits). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for 10 of the 17 phenotypes that had a heritability higher than 0 (see Figs.      and ). The QTL that reached the 20% genome-wide threshold  the genes that are located within 1 Mb on either side of each SNP  and previously reported relevant QTL associations are listed in Table . Details for each individual SNP reaching the 20% genome-wide threshold are in Additional file : Table S1. Manhattan plots for body weight 2 weeks ()  3 weeks ()  and 4 weeks () post-heat initiation. The purple line indicates the 20% genome-wide threshold Manhattan plot for albumen weight 1 week post-heat initiation. The purple line indicates the 20% genome-wide threshold Manhattan plots for Haugh units pre-heat ()  1 week post-heat ()  2 weeks post-heat ()  and 4 weeks post-heat (). The purple line indicates the 20% genome-wide threshold Manhattan plots for egg mass 2 weeks post-heat initiation () and change from pre-heat to 4 weeks post heat (). The purple line indicates the 20% genome-wide threshold The moderate heritabilities estimated for body weight (0.31–0.44) before heat exposure and during heat treatment are in agreement with those reported in many other reports for the same trait [  ] (Table ). Body weight is generally accepted as a moderately heritable trait. In our study  exposure to heat did not significantly impact heritability estimates for body weight  which is not surprising since the measures were performed on mature hens that are not expected to show significant changes in body weight. In a broiler by Fayoumi cross  Van Goor et al. [] estimated a heritability of 0.34 for body weight after 1 week of heat challenge. To our knowledge  this is the first time that estimated heritabilities for albumen weight  Haugh units  and egg mass under heat treatment are reported. For albumen weight  we estimated moderate heritabilities (0.23–0.39) (Table )  which agree with previous reports  i.e. 0.12–0.59 for albumen weight under normal conditions in various populations [   ]. For Haugh units  Wolc et al. [] based on genotyping data reported an estimated heritability of 0.34 in a non-heat-challenged population of brown layers at 26–28 weeks of age (similar to the age (22–28 weeks) of the birds in our study)  which is slightly higher than our estimated heritability i.e. 0.26 (Table ). This difference could be due to the difference in the breed used or the number of observations. Other studies [    ] have reported heritability estimates for Haugh units that range from 0.21 to 0.41  which is line with the above results. For egg mass  the estimated heritabilities were moderate (0.24–0.43) and decreased during heat treatment (Table ). Three QTL were identified for body weight at three different time points  two on chromosome 18 and one on chromosome 3 (Table  and Fig. ). One of the QTL on chromosome 18 was identified for body weight 2 weeks post-heat. The  gene located near this QTL controls growth hormone secretion []. Another QTL on chromosome 18 was detected for body weight at three and at 4 weeks post-heat and the  gene located near this QTL negatively regulates EGFR degradation  which ultimately decreases growth []. Down-regulation of growth during a hyperthermic challenge may serve to release resources for more essential  life-sustaining functions or for the reproductive traits for which layer lines are intensively selected. A third positional candidate gene on chromosome 18 near a QTL for body weight    protects cells from DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner []. Preventing and recovering from DNA damage is a crucial function under hyperthermic conditions. The QTL for body weight  on chromosome 3  has also been associated with body weight in two other independent populations [  ]. The  gene located near this QTL has a role in lipid metabolism []. We identified one QTL on chromosome 23 for albumen weight at one time point  i.e. 1 week after heat initiation (Table  and Fig. ) and one gene   and one microRNA  --- were located near this QTL. Because neither of these elements has been previously implicated in heat response or egg formation  these are novel associations. Interestingly  --- was isolated from both the albumen and yolk []. The egg is the reproductive unit in chicken and micro RNAs are known to play an important role in gene regulation  thus their existence within the egg suggests that --- may have a role in embryonic development. Two QTL were identified for Haugh units at four time points (Table  and Fig. ). The QTL on chromosome 5 was found for Haugh units before exposure to heat and at 4 weeks post-heat  which suggests a shared genomic control for these two phenotypes and that genetic selection for Haugh units under normal conditions will also impact Haugh units under a long-term heat treatment. We identified several genes in the vicinity of this QTL and two of these could have a role in Haugh units  i.e.   which is upregulated in response to heat [] and plays a role in hepatic yolk lipoprotein synthesis []  and   which is involved in calcium ion binding  a crucial function for eggshell formation. The phenotype Haugh units has been reported to be genetically correlated with eggshell characteristics (genetic correlations ranging from 0.13 to 0.36) []. The QTL on chromosome 2 was detected for Haugh units at 1 week and at 2 weeks post-heat  which as above suggests a shared genomic control for these two phenotypes. Previously  the region of this QTL has been shown to be associated with eggshell thickness [] and with albumen height in independent populations of non-heat-challenged hens [  ]. Some of the genes located in this region are involved in heat response  i.e.  has a role in DNA repair  which is essential in response to a thermal challenge  and  and  are known to be downregulated under heat stress []. Two QTL were identified for egg mass phenotypes (Table  and Fig. ): one on chromosome 33 for average egg mass during the first 2 weeks of heat treatment and one on chromosome 2 for change in average egg mass from prior to heat exposure to the measure at 4-week heat exposure. We found one gene within the region on chromosome 2    which has been reported to be involved in egg number in geese []. In this study  we quantified phenotypic changes in response to acute and chronic heat exposure in commercial egg laying hens  and found that all the phenotypes were significantly impacted by exposure to high temperature at one or more time points. Seventeen phenotypes had an estimated heritability different from 0  which indicates that they are under genetic control and that there is potential for improving these traits by selective breeding. QTL were identified for 10 of these 17 phenotypes. Some of these phenotypes shared the same QTL across time points  which indicates shared genomic control. Our findings contribute to the knowledge on the genomic control of response to heat stress in laying hens.

Based on our results  the PCG method combined with the proposed second-level diagonal preconditioner seems to be more efficient than the DPCG method in solving ssSNPBLUP. However  the optimal combination of ssSNPBLUP and solver will most likely be situation-dependent. Since its introduction in the late 1990s []  the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method has been the method of choice to solve breeding value estimation models in animal breeding. Likewise  the systems of linear equations of the different single-step single nucleotide polymorphism BLUP (ssSNPBLUP) models are usually solved with the PCG method with a diagonal (also called Jacobi) or block-diagonal preconditioner [  ]. Several studies [   ] observed that the PCG method with such a preconditioner applied to ssSNPBLUP is associated with slower convergence. By investigating the reasons for these convergence issues  Vandenplas et al. [] observed that the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP proposed by Mantysaari and Stranden []  hereafter referred to as ssSNPBLUP_MS  resulted from the presence of the equations for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects. In their study  applying a deflated PCG (DPCG) method to ssSNPBLUP_MS solved the convergence issues []. In comparison to the PCG method  the DPCG method introduces a second-level preconditioner that annihilates the effect of the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP_MS on the convergence of the iterative solver. After deflation  the largest eigenvalues of the ssSNPBLUP_MS preconditioned deflated coefficient matrix were reduced and close to those of single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP). As a result the associated convergence patterns of ssSNPBLUP were  at least  similar to those of ssGBLUP []. While it solves the convergence issues associated with ssSNPBLUP  the DPCG method requires the computation and storage of the so-called Galerkin matrix  which is a dense matrix that could be computationally expensive for very large evaluations and that requires some effort to be implemented in existing software. In addition  as implemented in Vandenplas et al. []  each iteration of the DPCG method requires two multiplications of the coefficient matrix by a vector  instead of one multiplication for the PCG method. As a result  computing time per iteration with the DPCG method is roughly twice as long as with the PCG method. Accordingly  it is of interest to develop a second-level preconditioner that would reduce the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP at a lower cost than the DPCG method. As such  the aim of this study was to develop a second-level preconditioner that would decrease the unfavourable largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP and to compare its performance to the DPCG method. The performance of the proposed second-level preconditioner was tested for two different ssSNPBLUP models. The two datasets used in this study  hereafter referred to as the reduced and field datasets  were provided by CRV BV (The Netherlands) and are the same as in Vandenplas et al. []  in which these two datasets are described in detail. Briefly  for the reduced dataset  the data file included 61 592 ovum pick-up sessions from 4109 animals and the pedigree included 37 021 animals. The 50K SNP genotypes of 6169 animals without phenotypes were available. A total of 9994 segregating SNPs with a minor allele frequency higher than or equal to 0.01 were randomly sampled from the 50K SNP genotypes. The number of SNPs was limited to 9994 to facilitate the computation and the analysis of the left-hand side of the mixed model equations. The univariate mixed model included random effects (additive genetic  permanent environmental and residual)  fixed co-variables (heterosis and recombination) and fixed cross-classified effects (herd-year  year-month  parity  age in months  technician  assistant  interval  gestation  session and protocol) []. For the field dataset  the data file included 3 882 772 records with a single record per animal. The pedigree included 6 130 519 animals. The genotypes  including 37 995 segregating SNPs  of 15 205 animals without phenotypes and of 75 758 animals with phenotypes were available. The four-trait mixed model included random effects (additive genetic and residual)  fixed co-variables (heterosis and recombination) and fixed cross-classified effects (herd x year x season at classification  age at classification  lactation stage at classification  milk yield and month of calving) [  ]. In this study  we investigated two ssSNPBLUP linear equations systems. The first system was proposed by Mantysaari and Stranden [] (ssSNPBLUP_MS). This system was also investigated in Vandenplas et al. []. The standard multivariate model associated with the ssSNPBLUP_MS system of equations can be written as: where the subscripts  and  refer to genotyped and non-genotyped animals  respectively   is the vector of records   is the vector of fixed effects   is the vector of additive genetic effects for non-genotyped animals   is the vector of residual polygenic effects for genotyped animals   is the vector of SNP effects and  is the vector of residuals. The matrices    and  are incidence matrices relating records to their corresponding effects. The matrix  is equal to   with  being an identity matrix with size equal to the number of traits  and the matrix  containing the SNP genotypes (coded as 0 for one homozygous genotype  1 for the heterozygous genotype  or 2 for the alternate homozygous genotype) centred by their observed means. The system of linear equations for multivariate ssSNPBLUP_MS can be written as follows:  where   is a symmetric positive (semi-)definite coefficient matrix   is the vector of solutions  and   is the right-hand side with   being the inverse of the residual (co)variance structure matrix. The matrix  is the inverse of the covariance matrix associated with    and   and is equal to   The matrix  is equal to   with  being the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix. The parameter  is the proportion of variance (due to additive genetic effects) considered as residual polygenic effects and  with  being the allele frequency of the th SNP. The second system of linear equations investigated in this study is the system of equations proposed by Gengler et al. [] and Liu et al. []  hereafter referred to as ssSNPBLUP_Liu. The system of linear equations for a multivariate ssSNPBLUP_Liu can be written as follows:  where   and  The matrix  is equal to   with . It is worth noting that the absorption of the equations associated with  of ssSNPBLUP_Liu results in the mixed model equations of single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) for which the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix is calculated using the Woodbury formula []. Several studies (e.g.  [  ]) investigated the possibility of using specific knowledge of a priori variances to weight differently some SNPs in ssGBLUP. Such approaches are difficult to extend to multivariate ssGBLUP  while they can be easily applied in ssSNPBLUP by replacing the matrix  by a symmetric positive definite matrix  that contains SNP-specific (co)variances obtained by  e.g.  Bayesian regression []. In the following  matrix  will refer to either  or  (and similarly for the vectors  and ). In addition  the matrices  and  have the same structure  and both can be partitioned between the equations associated with SNP effects () and the equations associated with the other effects ()  as follows: From this partition  it follows that  and that     and  are dense matrices. The PCG method is an iterative method that uses successive approximations to obtain more accurate solutions for a linear system at each iteration step []. The preconditioned systems of the linear equations of ssSNPBLUP_MS and of ssSNPBLUP_Liu have the form: where  is a (block-)diagonal preconditioner. In this study  the (block-)diagonal preconditioner  is defined as: where the subscripts  and  refer to the equations associated with fixed and random effects  respectively and  is a block-diagonal matrix with blocks corresponding to equations for different traits within a level (e.g.  an animal). After  iterations of the PCG method applied to the Eq. ()  the error is bounded by [  ]: where    is the -norm of   defined as   and  is the effective spectral condition number of   that is defined as  with  () being the largest (smallest) non-zero eigenvalue of . Vandenplas et al. [] showed that the largest eigenvalues of the ssSNPBLUP_MS preconditioned coefficient matrix  were larger than those of the ssGBLUP preconditioned coefficient matrix  while the smallest eigenvalues were similar. This resulted in larger effective condition numbers  and convergence issues for ssSNPBLUP_MS. As applied by Vandenplas et al. []  the DPCG method annihilates the largest unfavourable eigenvalues of the ssSNPBLUP_MS preconditioned coefficient matrix   which resulted in effective condition numbers and convergence patterns of ssSNPBLUP_MS similar to those of ssGBLUP solved with the PCG method. The preconditioned deflated linear systems of ssSNPBLUP_MS and of ssSNPBLUP_Liu mixed model equations have the form: where  is a second-level preconditioner  called the deflation matrix  equal to   with the matrix  being the deflation-subspace matrix as defined in Vandenplas et al. [] and  being the Galerkin matrix. The DPCG method requires the computation and the storage of the Galerkin matrix   which is computationally expensive for very large evaluations []. Furthermore  as implemented in Vandenplas et al. []  each iteration of the DPCG method requires two multiplications of the coefficient matrix  by a vector  instead of one multiplication for the PCG method. Here  our aim is to develop another second-level preconditioner that decreases the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix  at a lower cost than the DPCG method and results in smaller effective condition numbers and better convergence patterns. To achieve this aim  we introduce a second-level diagonal preconditioner defined as: where  is an identity matrix of size equal to the number of equations that are not associated with SNP effects   is an identity matrix of size equal to the number of equations that are associated with SNP effects   and  are real positive numbers and . Possible values for  and  are discussed below. Therefore  the preconditioned system of Eq. () is modified as follows: Hereafter  we show that the proposed second-level preconditioner  applied to ssSNPBLUP systems of equations results in smaller effective condition numbers by decreasing the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices. For simplicity  the symmetric preconditioned coefficient matrix  with  is used instead of . Indeed  these two matrices have the same spectrum  i.e.  the same set of eigenvalues. In addition  the effective condition number of     is equal to the effective condition number of     because: with   and . The result is that  depends only on  and therefore only on the  ratio. Regarding the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix  or equivalently of   the effect of the second-level preconditioner  on  can be analysed using the Gershgorin circle theorem []. From this theorem  it follows that the largest eigenvalue of the preconditioned coefficient matrix  is bounded by  for all th and th equations: Partitioned between the equations associated with SNP effects () and with the other effects ()  it follows from Eq. () that  has the following lower and upper bounds (see Additional file  for the derivation): with    and  and  referring to the equations not associated with and associated with SNP effects  respectively. Therefore  for a fixed value of   the upper bound of  will decrease with decreasing  ratios  up to the lowest upper bound   that is the upper bound of . Nevertheless  decreasing the largest eigenvalue does not (necessarily) mean decreasing the effective condition number   because  could decrease at the same rate as  or faster than  leading to constant or larger . As such  it is required that  decreases at a lower rate  remains constant  or even increases  when  decreases with decreasing  ratios. This would be achieved if  is independent of . Hereafter  we formulate a sufficient condition to ensure that  for any  ratio. Let the matrix  be a matrix containing (columnwise) all the eigenvectors of  sorted according to the ascending order of their associated eigenvalues. The set of eigenvalues of  sorted according to their ascending order is hereafter called spectrum of . The matrix  can be partitioned into a matrix  storing eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues at the left-hand side of the spectrum (that includes the smallest eigenvalues) of  and a matrix  storing eigenvectors at the right-hand side of the spectrum (that includes the largest eigenvalues)of   and between equations associated with SNP effects or not  as follows:  A sufficient condition to ensure that  is that    and that all eigenvalues associated with an eigenvector of  are equal to  or larger than  (see Additional file  for proof). Therefore  the effective condition numbers  will decrease with decreasing  ratios until the largest eigenvalue  reaches its lower bound   as long as the sufficient condition is satisfied. In practice  the pattern of the matrix  will never be as required by the sufficient condition  because the submatrices  and  contain non-zero entries. However  this sufficient condition is helpful to formulate the expectation that convergence of the models will improve with decreasing  ratios up to a point that can either be identified from the analyses or by computing the eigenvalues of . Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ssSNPBLUP_MS preconditioned coefficient matrices  with values of  from 1 to  (and ) were computed for the reduced dataset using the subroutine  provided by Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (MKL) 11.3.2. Using the matrix-free version of the software developed in Vandenplas et al. []  the system of ssSNPBLUP_MS and ssSNPBLUP_Liu equations for the reduced and field datasets were solved with the PCG and DPCG methods together with the second-level preconditioner  for different values of  (with ). The second-level preconditioner  was implemented by combining it with the preconditioner   as . Accordingly  its implementation has no additional costs for an iteration of the PCG and DPCG methods. The DPCG method was applied with 5 SNP effects per subdomain []. To illustrate the effect of   the system of ssSNPBLUP_MS equations was also solved for the reduced dataset with the PCG method and different values of  (with ). For both the PCG and DPCG methods  the iterative process stopped when the relative residual norm was smaller than . For all systems  the smallest and largest eigenvalues that influence the convergence of the iterative methods were estimated using the Lanczos method based on information obtained from the (D)PCG method [    ]. Effective condition numbers were computed from these estimates []. All real vectors and matrices were stored using double precision real numbers  except for the preconditioner  which was stored using single precision real numbers. All computations were performed on a computer with 528 GB and running RedHat 7.4 (x86_64) with an Intel Xeon E5-2667 (3.20 GHz) processor with 16 cores. The number of OpenMP threads was limited to 5 for both datasets. Time requirements are reported for the field dataset. All reported times are indicative  because they may have been influenced by other jobs running simultaneously on the computer. The spectra of the ssSNPBLUP_MS preconditioned coefficient matrices  solved with the PCG method and with  values from 1 to  (and ) are depicted in Fig. . It can be observed that the largest eigenvalues decreased with decreasing  ratios  up to  (Fig. ; Table ). On the other side of the spectrum  a set of approximately 10 000 small eigenvalues that decrease with decreasing  ratios can be observed. Eigenvalues of different preconditioned coefficient matrices  for the reduced dataset. Eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP_MS are depicted on a logarithmic scale. All eigenvalues less than  were set to . Eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order Figures    and  depict all the eigenvectors of the ssSNPBLUP_MS preconditioned coefficient matrices  with different values of  (and ). Non-zero eigenvector entries indicate an association of the eigenvalue (associated with this eigenvector) and the corresponding equations  while (almost) zero entries indicate no such (or a very weak) association. When   it can be observed that the smallest eigenvalues of  are mainly associated with the equations that are not associated with SNP effects. On the other side  with   the largest eigenvalues of  are mainly associated with the equations that are associated with SNP effects (Figs.  and ). Decreasing  ratios resulted in modifying the associations of the extremal eigenvalues (i.e. the smallest and largest eigenvalues) with the equations. Indeed  decreasing  ratios resulted in the smallest eigenvalues of  mainly associated with the equations that are associated with SNP effects  and in the largest eigenvalues of  mainly associated with the equations that are not associated with SNP effects.

Reported values are aggregate absolute values of sets of 15 eigenvectors sorted following the ascending order of associated eigenvalues  and of 15 entries per eigenvector.

Reported values are aggregate absolute values of sets of 15 eigenvectors sorted following the ascending order of associated eigenvalues  and of 15 entries per eigenvector.

Darker colors correspond to higher values. Equations associated with SNP effects are from the 41 950th equation until the 51 944th equation The extremal eigenvalues of the ssSNPBLUP_MS and ssSNPBLUP_Liu preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices  with various values for  and   are in Table . For both ssSNPBLUP_MS and ssSNPBLUP_Liu solved with the PCG method  the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix decreased with decreasing  ratios to a lower value of 11.9 that was reached when . In addition  for both models  the smallest eigenvalues remained constant with decreasing  ratios  until  for ssSNPBLUP_MS and  for ssSNPBLUP_Liu. Due to these results  the effective condition numbers and the number of iterations to reach convergence were the smallest for  for ssSNPBLUP_MS and for  for ssSNPBLUP_Liu (Table ; Figs.  and ). In comparison to the PCG method without the second-level preconditioner (i.e.  with )  the number of iterations to reach convergence decreased by a factor of more than 3.5 for ssSNPBLUP_MS and by a factor of more than 2.4 for ssSNPBLUP_Liu. The minimum number of iterations to reach convergence with the PCG method was 417 for ssSNPBLUP_MS and 561 for ssSNPBLUP_Liu (Table ; Figs.  and ). Termination criteria for the reduced dataset for ssSNPBLUP_MS using the PCG and DPCG methods Termination criteria for the reduced dataset for ssSNPBLUP_Liu using the PCG and DPCG methods For the same  ratio  the extremal eigenvalues (i.e. the smallest and largest eigenvalues) of the different preconditioned coefficient matrices were proportional by a factor of  (Table ). Therefore  for the same  ratio the effective condition numbers of the different preconditioned coefficient matrices and the associated numbers of equations to reach convergence were the same (Table ). It is also worth noting that  for a fixed value of   the largest eigenvalues decreased almost proportionally by a factor of  with decreasing  ratios until they reached their lower bound (Table ). For both ssSNPBLUP_MS and ssSNPBLUP_Liu solved with the DPCG method and 5 SNPs per subdomain  the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned deflated coefficient matrices remained constant (around 6.44) for all  ratios (Table ). However  for both models  the smallest eigenvalues started to decrease for  ratios smaller than  () for ssSNPBLUP_MS (ssSNPBLUP_Liu). These unfavourable decreases of the smaller eigenvalues with decreasing  ratios resulted in increasing the effective condition numbers and the number of iterations to reach convergence when the second-level preconditioner  was applied with the DPCG method (Table ; Figs.  and ). For the field dataset  regarding the extremal eigenvalues  the application of the second-level preconditioner  together with the PCG method led to a decrease of the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix from  for ssSNPBLUP_MS  and from  for ssSNPBLUP_Liu  to about 5. Ratios of  smaller than  for ssSNPBLUP_MS and smaller than  for ssSNPBLUP_Liu did not further change the largest eigenvalues (Table ). For the DPCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP_MS  the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned deflated coefficient matrices remained constant for all  ratios (Table ). For the DPCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP_Liu  the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned deflated coefficient matrices slightly decreased with  and then remained constant for all  ratios (Table ). The application of the second-level preconditioner  with both the PCG and DPCG methods led to the smallest eigenvalues of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices decreasing with decreasing  ratios (Table ). These observed patterns of extremal eigenvalues resulted in an optimal  ratio for the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP_MS and an optimal  ratio for the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP_Liu  in terms of effective condition numbers and numbers of iterations to reach convergence (Table ; Figs.  and ). With these ratios  the PCG method converged within 3825 iterations for ssSNPBLUP_MS and within 2665 iterations for ssSNPBLUP_Liu  while the PCG method did not converge within 10 000 iterations for both models (Table ; Figs.  and ). For the DPCG method  the application of the second-level preconditioner  generally deteriorated the effective condition numbers and numbers of iterations to reach convergence  for both ssSNPBLUP_MS and ssSNPBLUP_Liu. The DPCG method converged within 748 iterations for ssSNPBLUP_MS with  and within 2877 iterations for ssSNPBLUP_Liu with  (Table ; Figs.  and ). Termination criteria for the field dataset for ssSNPBLUP_MS using the PCG and DPCG methods Termination criteria for the field dataset for ssSNPBLUP_Liu using the PCG and DPCG methods The total wall clock times of the iterative processes and for the complete processes (including I/O operations and computation of the preconditioners  and Galerkin matrices) for the PCG and DPCG methods are in Table . Across all combinations of systems of equations and solvers  the smallest wall clock time for the complete process was approximately 14 000 s for the PCG method with the second-level preconditioner  applied to ssSNPBLUP_Liu. Slightly greater wall clock times were needed for ssSNPBLUP_MS solved with the DPCG method (without the second-level preconditioner ). It is worth noting that the wall clock times needed for the computation of the inverse of the Galerkin matrix () were approximately 9700 s for ssSNPBLUP_MS and approximately 2500 s for ssSNPBLUP_Liu. In this study  we introduced a second-level diagonal preconditioner  that results in smaller effective condition numbers of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices and in improved convergence patterns for two different ssSNPBLUP mixed model equations. From the theory and based on the results  the use of the second-level preconditioner  results in improved effective condition numbers of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP by decreasing the largest eigenvalues  while the smallest eigenvalues remain constant  or decrease at a lower rate than the largest eigenvalues. In this section  we will discuss the following three points: (1) the influence of the second-level diagonal preconditioner  on the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP; (2) the application of the second-level preconditioner in ssSNPBLUP evaluations; and (3) the possible application of the second-level preconditioner  to more complex ssSNPBLUP models and to models other than ssSNPBLUP. Applying the second-level preconditioner  with an optimal  ratio to the linear systems of ssSNPBLUP results in a decrease of the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP. As observed by Vandenplas et al. [] and in comparison with ssGBLUP  the largest eigenvalues that influence the convergence of the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP_MS were associated with SNP effects. The second-level preconditioner  allows a decrease of these largest eigenvalues by multiplying all entries of these SNP equations of the preconditioned coefficient matrices by a value proportional to   as shown with the Gershgorin circle algorithm [] [see Eq. ()]. However  if the  ratio is applied to a set of equations that are not associated with the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices  the second-level preconditioner  will not result in decreased largest eigenvalues. This behaviour was observed when the second-level preconditioner  was applied to ssSNPBLUP_MS with the DPCG method for the reduced dataset (Table ). For these scenarios  the DPCG method already annihilated all the largest unfavourable eigenvalues up to the lower bound of the largest eigenvalue that is allowed with the second-level preconditioner . Therefore  the second-level preconditioner  did not further decrease the largest eigenvalues. It is worth noting that  if the DPCG method did not annihilate all the unfavourable largest eigenvalues up to the lower bound defined by Eq. ()  the application of the second-level preconditioner  with the DPCG method did remove these remaining largest eigenvalues  as shown by the results for ssSNPBLUP_Liu applied to the field dataset (Table ). The decrease of the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices with decreasing  ratios (and until the lower bound is reached) can be explained by the sparsity pattern of the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices  of ssSNPBLUP. Indeed  Figs.  and  show that the entries that correspond to the equations that are not associated with SNP effects  are close to 0 for the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues of  of ssSNPBLUP_MS. Accordingly  if we assume that these entries are 0  i.e.   being an eigenvector associated with one of largest eigenvalues of   it follows that the largest eigenvalues of  multiplied by  are also the eigenvalues of . These largest eigenvalues of  will therefore be equal to the largest eigenvalues of  until the lower bound defined by Eq. () is reached (see Additional file  for the derivation). This observation can also motivate an educated guess for an optimal  ratio for ssSNPBLUP with one additive genetic effect. If the largest eigenvalues  and  are (approximately) known  an educated guess for the  ratio can be equal to . For example  in our cases   was always equal to the largest eigenvalue of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of a pedigree BLUP (results not shown). It follows that the educated guess for the field dataset is equal to  for ssSNPBLUP_MS and  for ssSNPBLUP_Liu  since . Both values are of the same order as the corresponding optimal  ratios. However  the second-level preconditioner  will be effective only if the smallest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices are not influenced  or at least less influenced than the largest eigenvalues  by the second-level preconditioner . The decrease of the smallest eigenvalues of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices mainly depends on the sparsity pattern of the eigenvectors associated with the smallest eigenvalues. We formulated a sufficient condition such that the smallest eigenvalues remain constant when the second-level preconditioner is applied. While this sufficient condition is not fulfilled for the reduced dataset (and probably also not for the field dataset)  it can help us to predict the behaviour of the smallest eigenvalues based on the sparsity pattern of the associated eigenvectors. For example  if the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of  has mainly non-zero entries corresponding to the equations associated with SNP effects  the use of the second-level preconditioner  will most likely result in a decrease of the smallest eigenvalues proportional to   which is undesirable. Other behaviours of the smallest eigenvalues of the preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices can lead to the conclusion that the associated eigenvectors have a different sparsity pattern  which helps understand if and how the use of the proposed second-level diagonal preconditioner will be beneficial. The second-level preconditioner  is easy to implement in existing software and does not influence the computational costs of a PCG iteration  since it can be merged with the preconditioner . Indeed  it is sufficient to multiply the entries of  that correspond to the equations associated with SNP effects by an optimal  ratio to implement the second-level preconditioner . Furthermore  the value of an optimal  ratio for a ssSNPBLUP evaluation can be determined by testing a range of values around the educated guess defined previously and then re-used for several subsequent ssSNPBLUP evaluations  because additional data for each new evaluation is only a fraction of the data previously used and will therefore not modify  or will modify only slightly  the properties of the preconditioned coefficient matrices . In this study  we used the second-level diagonal preconditioner  for two different ssSNPBLUP models. To our knowledge  it is the first time that ssSNPBLUP_Liu was successfully applied until convergence with real datasets [  ]. From our results  it seems that the preconditioned coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP_Liu are better conditioned than the preconditioned coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP_MS  leading to better convergence patterns for ssSNPBLUP_Liu. Therefore  among all possible combinations of linear systems (i.e.  ssSNPBLUP_MS and ssSNPBLUP_Liu)  solvers (i.e.  the PCG and DPCG methods) and the application (or not) of the second-level preconditioner   it seems that ssSNPBLUP_Liu solved with the PCG method combined with the second-level preconditioner  is the most efficient in terms of total wall clock times and implementation. However  in our study it was tested only on two datasets and the most efficient combination of linear system and solver will most likely be situation-dependent. The proposed second-level preconditioner  can be applied and may be beneficial for ssSNPBLUP models that involve multiple additive genetic effects  or for other models that include an effect that would result in an increase to the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices. The developed theory does not require a multivariate ssSNPBLUP with only one additive genetic effect. As such  for example  if multiple additive genetic effects are fitted into the ssSNPBLUP model  such as direct and maternal genetic effects  the second-level preconditioner  could be used with different  ratios applied separately to the direct and maternal SNP effects. A similar strategy was successfully applied for ssSNPBLUP proposed by Fernando et al. [] with French beef cattle datasets (Thierry Tribout  personal communication). Furthermore  the second-level preconditioner  could be used to improve the convergence pattern of models other than ssSNPBLUP. For example  with the field dataset  the addition of the genetic groups fitted explicitly as random covariables in the model for pedigree-BLUP (that is  without genomic information) led to an increase of the largest eigenvalue of the preconditioned coefficient matrix from 5.1 to 14.8. The introduction of the second-level preconditioner  into the preconditioned linear system of pedigree-BLUP with a  ratio applied to the equations associated with the genetic groups reduced the largest eigenvalues to 6.0  resulting in a decrease of the effective condition number by a factor of 2.6. This decrease of the effective condition number translated to a decrease in the number of iterations to reach convergence from 843 to 660. The proposed second-level preconditioner  is easy to implement in existing software and can improve the convergence of the PCG and DPCG methods applied to different ssSNPBLUP methods. Based on our results  the ssSNPBLUP system of equations proposed by Liu et al. [] solved using the PCG method and the second-level preconditioner seems to be most efficient. However  the optimal combination of ssSNPBLUP and solver will most likely be situation-dependent. Strandén I  Lidauer M.

Beef cattle production plays an important role in food security by converting forages and agricultural by-products into high-quality protein  and by optimizing land use through the occupation of grasslands that are unsuitable for agriculture [  ]. A large proportion of beef cattle are raised on tropical grasslands []. Under this production system  animals are usually subject to periods of food scarcity due to seasonal patterns of rainfall and  consequently  seasonal variation of pasture quality and availability. Depending on the severity of the dry season  the animals can be subject to seasonal weight loss if no supplementation is provided  this being a major constraint to beef cattle production in the tropics [  ]. However  supplementation is costly  and a more effective strategy would be to select cattle that are less sensitive to environmental variation in unfavorable environments and more adapted to harsh conditions. Selection for reduced sensitivity to environmental variation can be addressed in different ways in animal breeding programs []. One alternative is to use reaction norm models (RNM)  in which the response of each individual to environmental variation is modeled through a unique random regression curve that has its trajectory determined by a continuous environmental descriptor [  ]. For instance  RNM has been used to study heat tolerance in beef [] and dairy cattle [  ] by modeling animals’ performance and the underlying breeding value as a function of a temperature-humidity index. In this application  animals with a smaller decline in production during high heat load were considered heat tolerant. The choice of the type of curve to be used in RNM is of primary importance to properly assess the sensitivity of each animal to environmental variation. Generally  a linear regression is fitted since higher order polynomial coefficients may be difficult to estimate and interpret. However  if the change in phenotypic expression as a function of environmental variation is not constant along the environmental gradient  the random slope of a linear regression may not be a good indicator of the animal’s sensitivity. Therefore  testing higher order RNM is recommended []. Genotypic information has allowed extending RNM from the individual to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level [  ]. Given a large dataset and a sufficient number of genotypes across the range of environments  the reaction norm of each SNP can reveal the size and direction of its effect on the trait of interest along the environmental gradient. An interesting feature of this approach would be to consider nonlinear reaction norms and investigate the possible existence of SNPs having environment-dependent sensitivity  i.e. SNPs that express more response to improvements in the environment and less response to its deterioration (and vice versa). This is particularly appealing in tropical beef production given the importance of genotype-by-environment interaction under these conditions []. Understanding the genetic background of sensitivity to environmental variation is critical in developing strategies to ameliorate current constraints on efficiency of beef cattle production in the tropics. This knowledge could be used  for example  in statistical models  which incorporate biological information to attain more accurate genomic predictions [  ]. The objective of our study was to unravel genetic sensitivity of beef cattle to environmental variation under tropical conditions. More specifically  we tested if sensitivity from harsh to average environment is similar to sensitivity from average to good environment  by comparing the fit of linear and non-linear RNM for post-weaning weight gain (PWG) of Nellore cattle. We tested this at the individual (animal) and molecular marker levels. Phenotypic and pedigree data were obtained from the Alliance Nellore dataset ()  which has information for over one million Nellore calves born between 1984 and 2016  from approximately 500 different commercial herds widely distributed in Brazil  Bolivia and Paraguay  which are highly related through the intensive adoption of artificial insemination (AI) (><U+2009>50% calves born from AI). This dataset is suitable to assess the sensitivity of beef cattle performance to environmental variation not only because of its size but also because of the diversity of management and environmental conditions in which the animals are raised. For instance  the average annual precipitation can vary from<U+2009>~<U+2009>700 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>3000 mm depending on the farm’s location  and the dry season in some regions may last up to 7 months. As mentioned previously  this variation of precipitation affects drastically the quality of the forage and  consequently  the animal’s performance since they are raised predominantly on pasture. Some farmers provide protein and mineral supplementation to the animals  especially during the dry season  but other farmers provide only urea to complement pasture. We focused on the study of the post-weaning weight gain (PWG) trait because  after weaning  the animals are exposed to a wide range of environmental conditions  which makes PWG a suitable trait to assess sensitivity to environmental variation. For each animal  PWG was calculated as the difference between long-yearling and weaning weights  which were obtained at about 510 (310–730) and 210 (90–300) days of age  respectively. For the analysis  we considered only animals with known sires and dams  from contemporary groups (CG) with a minimum of 20 animals and PWG (adjusted for 300 days) between 30 and 250 kg. After filtering  the phenotypic dataset had individual PWG records for 421 585 animals from 9934 CG. Contemporary groups were formed by animals born in the same herd  year and season  from the same sex and raised in the same management group. The phenotyped animals were progeny of 6637 sires and 271 408 dams. The overall mean (sd) of PWG was 97.37 (33.13) kg. The distribution and other descriptive statistics of PWG are in Table S1 (see Additional file : Table S1) and in Figures S1 and S2 (see Additional file : Figures S1 and Additional file : Figure S2). Genotyping information for 13 806 Nellore cattle () were used in genome-wide association (GWA) analyses. This information came from 1993 bulls  4571 cows and 7242 progeny  which were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD (HD) chip (~<U+2009>778 K SNPs; 4073 samples) or with a lower density (LD) chip (from<U+2009>~<U+2009>28 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>74 K SNPs; 9733 samples). A detailed list of the number of samples per chip is provided in Table S2 (see Additional file : Table S2). Lower density genotypes were imputed to HD using the software FImpute v.2.2 []  with an expected imputation accuracy higher than 0.97 []. Only autosomal SNPs with a GenCall score  call rate and minor allele frequency higher than 0.15  0.98 and 0.02  respectively  were used in the GWA analyses. We also discarded SNPs with a  value for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test lower than 10  and showing linkage disequilibrium (r) greater than<U+2009>0.998 with syntenic SNPs located within a window of 50 neighboring markers. After filtering  the total number of SNPs was equal to 412 456. All samples had a call rate higher than 0.90 (before imputation) and were kept for the GWA analyses. Genetic sensitivity to environmental variation was assessed by reaction norm models (RNM) []. In this framework  the response of each animal to environmental variation is modeled as a unique curve that has its trajectory determined by a continuous environmental descriptor. In the absence of environmental descriptor information (e.g. temperature-humidity index or quality of pasture)  descriptors derived from phenotypic data are commonly used (e.g. []). We opted for the use of the best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) of CG effects as our environmental descriptor  since it encompasses the different management and environmental conditions to which the animals were exposed. In particular  we obtained BLUE from a regular mixed animal model [] using PWG as the response variable  post-weaning age (linear and quadratic effects) and CG as fixed effects  and animal and residual as random effects. Estimated CG effects ranged from 31.38 to 225.16 kg  highlighting the diversity of conditions in which the animals were raised (~<U+2009>sevenfold difference between extremes). The mean (sd) was 93.71 (28.16) kg. More information about CG solutions is in Figures S3 and S4 (see Additional file : Figures S3 and Additional file : Figure S4). The environmental descriptor used on RNM  hereafter referred to as environmental gradient (EG)  was the BLUE of CG effects that were standardized to have a zero mean and standard deviation (sd) equal to 1. Few CG (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>72) had EG greater than 3 sd. Post-weaning gain records from those CG (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2728) were discarded for the subsequent analyses to avoid prejudicing the reaction norm estimates  since outliers can dramatically change the magnitude of regression coefficients []. After filtering  the average  minimum and maximum values of EG were equal to -<U+2009>2.21  0.0 and 3.0 sd  corresponding to CG effects on PWG equal to 31.5  93.7 and 178.2 kg or  equivalently  to average daily gains (ADG) during the post-weaning period (300 days) equal to 105  312 and 594 g/day  respectively. To attain this ADG over the full period  the animals most probably lost weight during the dry season (~<U+2009>½ post-weaning period) on lower EG  maintained their weight during the dry season on average EG  and gained weight even in the dry season on higher EG conditions. Thus  we will refer to lower  average and higher EG as harsh  average and good environments  respectively. However  it is important to keep in mind that the average EG consists of a challenging condition during the dry season. Progeny of genotyped sires comprised 78% of phenotypic records and  in general  they had records well distributed (within sire) across the range of EG (see Additional file : Figure S5). This is essential to obtain good reaction norm estimates at the marker level []. Five RNM were tested. The first applied RNM (RNM_homo) assumed that the residuals for the EG were homogenous and can be described by the equation: where  is the phenotypic record (PWG) of animal  recorded in the level  of EG;  is the vector of fixed effects (post-weaning period and CG)  and  is its corresponding row covariable/incidence vector;  is the overall linear fixed regression coefficient of  on ;  is the covariate associated to the -th EG (estimated in the previous step);  is the random overall additive genetic effect or the intercept of animal  for an average EG ();  is the random additive genetic effect of the reaction norm slope of animal  on  expressed as a deviation from ; and  is a random residual. RNM_homo was fitted under the assumptions: where  is the relationship matrix based on pedigree information ( is the Kronecker product);    and  are the variances of the intercept  the slope and their covariance  respectively;  is an identity matrix and  is the residual variance. The second RNM (RNM_hete) was similar to RNM_homo except that the residuals were modeled assuming a specific residual variance for each EG  using a linear regression on . The heterogeneous residual variance coefficients for the intercept and slope were modelled using a log-residual function []. The third RNM (RNM_quad) was similar to RNM_hete except that it considered a polynomial quadratic regression to model the fixed curve and the reaction norm of the random effects (additive genetic and residual) instead of a linear regression. RNM_quad can be described by the equation: where   is the overall quadratic fixed regression coefficient of  on ;  is the squared value of ;  is the quadratic effect of the random additive genetic effect of the reaction norm of animal  on  expressed as a deviation from ; and all other terms as previously specified. The other two tested RNM also fitted heterogeneous residual variances and used a linear–linear (RNM_l-l) and a quadratic–quadratic (RNM_q-q) spline function to model the fixed curve and the reaction norm of the additive genetic and residual random effects. For both spline functions we used only one knot (k) placed at the average EG (k<U+2009>=<U+2009>0). RNM_l-l can be described by the equation: where  is the overall difference between the linear fixed regression coefficients of the first and second segments of the linear–linear spline function of  on  ( if ;  if );  is the difference between the reaction norm slopes of the first and second segments of the linear–linear spline function of the random additive genetic effect of animal  on  expressed as a deviation from ; and all other terms as previously specified. With this model parameterization  the estimates of the slope of the second segment () were obtained as: . RNM_q-q can be described by the equation: where  is the overall difference between the quadratic fixed regression coefficients of the first and second segments of the quadratic–quadratic spline function of  on  is the difference between the reaction norm quadratic effects of the first and second segments of the quadratic–quadratic spline function of the random additive genetic effect of animal  on  expressed as a deviation from ; and all other terms as previously specified. With this model parameterization  the quadratic effect estimates of the second segment () were obtained as: . Quadratic RNM (RNM_quad and RNM_q-q) were used to evaluate any advantage compared with linear reaction norms. Spline RNM (RNM_l-l and RNM_q-q) were used to evaluate if sensitivity in the first segment (harsh to average EG) is correlated with sensitivity in the second segment (average to good EG). Higher order polynomials were tested but convergence was not achieved (results not shown). Estimates of (co)variance components of all RNM were obtained by restricted maximum likelihood using the AIREMLF90 software []. The different RNM were compared based on Akaike (AIC) [] and Bayesian (BIC) [] information criteria. GWA analyses were performed using the weighted single-step genomic BLUP method []  which first predicts genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) and then back-solve GEBV to SNP effects using equivalent models []. Two analyses were run using models similar to RNM_hete and RNM_l–l  but this time assuming that (co)variance components are known by using the corresponding estimates obtained in the previous step  and also replacing  by   a matrix which combines pedigree () and genomic () relationships []. Matrix  was computed as the first method proposed by []. Association analyses were not run for RNM_quad and RNM_q-q because SNP effects of the quadratic coefficient are difficult to interpret and also because sensitivity assessed as the slopes of RNM_l-l was highly correlated (0.97-0.99) with sensitivity measured as the first derivatives of RNM_quad and RNM_q-q. Association analysis was not run also for RNM_homo because it was the worst fitting model (as will be shown later). For each GWA model (RNM_hete and RNM_l-l)  SNP effects were iteratively recomputed weighting them proportionally to the genetic variance they explained in the previous iteration  resulting in an increased shrinkage of the SNPs explaining a lower variance and more pronounced effects of the SNPs explaining a higher proportion of genetic variance  compared to the previous iteration. Following []  the same weight (equal to 1) was given to all SNPs in the first iteration and two additional iterations were performed. In addition to SNP effect estimates  the percentage of genetic variance explained by the segment of five adjacent SNPs was also computed for each SNP. GWA analyses were performed using BLUPF90 family programs []. Enrichment analyses were performed for the slopes of models RNM_hete (b1) and RNM_l-l (b1.seg1 and b1.seg2). For each slope  SNPs that explained at least 0.5% of the genetic variance were identified and genes that were located within 200 kb were annotated using Ensembl BioMart (Ensembl 93) [] and UMD3.1 bovine reference genome []. Since a high proportion of genes within significant regions had human orthologs  functional enrichment analyses were performed with the GENE2FUNC process of the integrative web-based platform FUMA v1.3.3 []  using all the human genes with bovine orthologs as background  totaling 18 425 genes with unique Entrez ID retrieved from the Ensembl genes 93 database. FUMA overrepresentation analyses were performed using hypergeometric tests and Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction. Biological functions of genes with an adjusted enrichment  value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 were reported. GENE2FUNC also provided enrichment of tissue-specific gene expression based on GTEx v6 RNA-seq data [] using Bonferroni multiple test correction. Additive genetic variability was observed for the slope of RNM  which indicated the presence of genotype-by-environment interaction (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) on PWG (Table ). Evidence of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E was also observed in a preliminary multi-trait analyses  assuming PWG from three categories of EG (EG<U+2009><<U+2009>-1; -1<U+2009>=<U+2009>EG<U+2009>=<U+2009>1; EG<U+2009>><U+2009>1) as different traits. For instance  the genetic correlation between PWG from harsh (EG<U+2009><<U+2009>-1) and good (EG<U+2009>><U+2009>1) environments was equal to 0.79  in the multi-trait analyses (results not shown). Based on AIC and BIC criteria  all heteroscedastic RNM outperformed the homoscedastic model (Table ). Among the heteroscedastic models  the quadratic (RNM_quad) and the spline models (RNM_l-l and RNM_q-q) outperformed the linear model (RNM_hete)  which suggests the existence of a nonlinear component in the reaction norm of PWG in Nellore cattle. Model RNM_q-q had the best fit among the tested models according to both criteria  AIC and BIC. Models RNM_homo and RNM_hete showed a high correlation (0.96 and 0.86  respectively) between intercept and slope (Table )  which indicates that animals with better EBV for the average environment tended also to present higher sensitivity to environmental variation. However  correlation estimates showed by RNM_l-l suggest that this association is strong only for the first segment (harsh to average EG). In fact  the correlation was close to 0 for RNM_l-l between intercept and slope of the second segment (-<U+2009>0.02) and between slopes of the first and second segments (0.06)  whereas the correlation between intercept and slope of the first segment was 0.89 (Table ). Increasing additive genetic variance (see Additional file : Figure S6) and heritability (Fig. ) estimates from lower to higher EG were obtained for all models. Because homoscedastic residuals were assumed  RNM_homo overestimated heritability in good environments and underestimated it in harsh environments  compared to heteroscedastic models. All heteroscedastic models showed similar heritability estimates for intermediate EG (-<U+2009>1.5<U+2009><<U+2009>EG<U+2009><<U+2009>1.5). Model RNM_quad presented higher heritability estimates for EG<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and RNM_q-q showed lower heritability estimates for EG<U+2009>=<U+2009>-2  in comparison with the other heteroscedastic models (Fig. ). Heritability estimates (h2) for post-weaning weight gain of Nellore cattle according to the environmental gradient  for different reaction norm models. RNM_homo: linear homoscedastic; RNM_hete: linear heteroscedastic; RNM_quad: quadratic heteroscedastic; RNM_l-l: spline linear–linear heteroscedastic; RNM_q-q: spline quadratic–quadratic heteroscedastic Heritability estimates of RNM_homo resulted in over-shrinkage of EBV in lower EG  the opposite occurring with EBV in higher EG  compared to EBV of heteroscedastic models (Fig. ). In accordance with (co)variance component estimates and model comparison results  there was further evidence from the comparison of EBV from the RNM_quad  RNM_l-l and RNM_q-q models that the nonlinear component in the reaction norm of PWG in Nellore cattle was important (Fig. c–e). The EBV from RNM_l-l illustrate that sensitivity to environmental variation from harsh to average EG tends to not be genetically correlated with sensitivity from average to good EG  in agreement with the genetic correlation estimates. Some animals were robust (i.e. had a flatter slope) for EG<U+2009><<U+2009>0 but were not robust for EG<U+2009>><U+2009>0  and vice versa (Fig. d). The same pattern was observed when PWG data from the two EG classes (EG<U+2009><<U+2009>0 and EG<U+2009>><U+2009>0) were analyzed independently  using two separate heteroscedastic linear regression RNM (see Additional file : Figure S7)  which reinforces the plausibility of the RNM_l-l results. Figure f illustrates that the different models can provide quite different EBV rankings between animals  especially at higher EG levels.

However  estimates of SNP effects obtained with RNM_l-l indicate that this similarity holds only for sensitivity from harsh to average environmental variation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.97)  whereas a low correlation (0.14) was observed between estimates of SNP effects of the intercept and slope of the second segment (Fig. ). SNP effect estimates distribution (diagonal)  correlation (upper triangular) and scatter plot (lower triangular) for coefficients of reaction norm models (RNM). b0.linear: intercept of RNM_hete; b1.linear: slope of RNM_hete; b0.spline: intercept of RNM_l-l; b1seg1(2).spline: slope segment 1(2) of RNM_l-l; RNM_hete: linear heteroscedastic RNM; RNM_l-l: spline linear–linear heteroscedastic RNM. X-axis and y-axis (lower triangular): SNP effect estimates (kg); y-axis (diagonal): frequency Twenty-three genomic regions  from 16 chromosomes  were identified containing segment(s) of five adjacent SNPs that explained 0.5% or more of the genetic variance for at least one of the coefficients of RNM_hete and RNM_l-l (Table ) (see Additional file : Figure S8). These regions  with a size ranging from 400.0 to 436.6 kb (200 kb upstream and downstream the significant SNP(s))  include 54 annotated genes in total. The numbers of regions (genes) associated with the intercept and slope of RNM_hete were equal to 7 (19) and 6 (13)  respectively  and the numbers of regions (genes) associated with the intercept and the slopes of the first and second segments of RNM_l-l were equal to 7 (12)  7 (10) and 11 (30)  respectively. In accordance with the results of correlation between effects of SNPs  there were overlapping candidate regions for the intercept and slope of RNM_hete (5) and for the intercept and slope of the first segment of RNM_l-l (6). No overlapping candidate regions were observed between slopes of RNM_l-l or between its intercept and slope of the second segment (Table ). From the 49 genes associated with the slopes of models RNM_hete or RNM_l-l  37 (75.5%) have human orthologs (Table ) and were used for functional enrichment analyses. Seven from the eight genes with human orthologs associated with the slope of RNM_hete (b1) had 48 significantly enriched biological processes (BP) (see Additional file : Figure S9). The BP associated with this set of genes (           and ) were predominantly related to epithelial  inflammatory  homeostatic  and cell proliferation and differentiation processes. For the slope of the first segment of RNM_l-l (b1seg1)  five genes (       and )  out of six with human orthologs  showed 35 significantly enriched BP  predominantly related to epithelial  inflammatory  nitrogen compound  and cell proliferation and differentiation processes (see Additional file : Figure S10). For the slope of the second segment of RNM_l-l (b1seg2)  16 genes (                             and )  out of 26 with human orthologs  showed 104 significantly enriched BP (the majority associated with  and )  predominantly related to immune response  metabolic  and cell death  proliferation and differentiation processes (see Additional file : Figure S11). GENE2FUNC gene expression results evidenced that the human orthologs of the bovine genes associated with sensitivity assessed by the slope of RNM_hete (b1) tend to be more differently expressed in humans in the small intestine and adrenal gland (see Additional file : Figure S12). For the genes associated with the slope of the first segment of RNM_l-l  GENE2FUNC identified significant enrichment of up-regulated genes in the human pancreas (see Additional file : Figure S13). For sensitivity assessed by the slope of the second segment of RNM_l-l  the set of candidate genes tended to be more differently expressed in humans in the brain (see Additional file : Figure S14). When running genetic evaluations  genetic sensitivity to environmental variation can be addressed in different ways in an animal breeding context. In this study  we used RNM to model the response to environmental variation of the trait PWG in Nellore cattle raised under tropical pasture conditions. The existence of additive genetic variability for the slope of RNM indicated the presence of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E on PWG. It offers the possibility of using the individual random slopes as a selection criterion for robustness  since animals with a flatter slope are less sensitive to environmental variation. Other studies have also identified  through RNM  the importance of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E for different traits in Nellore cattle [  ]. An interesting modelling alternative to our environmental descriptor is a Bayesian hierarchical RNM (BHRNM). This model has been recommended when the environmental descriptor needs to be derived from phenotypic data [  ]. We chose not to use BHRNM because it would have drastically increased the computational time required for the analyses. Moreover  there is also evidence in the literature that “two-step” RNM (using BLUE previously estimated as environmental covariates) achieves a similar fit to BHRNM []. As in []  we also observed that heteroscedastic RNM provided a better fit than homoscedastic RNM. In addition  we found that spline and quadratic RNM outperformed linear RNM  which suggests the existence of a nonlinear component in the reaction norm of PWG in Nellore cattle. This nonlinearity indicates that within-animal sensitivity depends on the EG level and that animals may present different patterns of sensitivity depending on the degree of EG. For instance  some animals may be less sensitive to variation in harsher environmental gradients and more sensitive to variation in not so challenging environmental gradients  and vice versa. This nonlinearity in the reaction norm seems to be less significant in cattle that are raised in more intensive systems  at least in dairy cattle []  possibly because environmental factors that influence intensive systems tend to be more controlled  compared to pasture-based systems  resulting in a smaller environmental variation. The high genetic correlation estimate between the intercept and slope of RNM_hete suggested little opportunity of joint selection for increased performance and reduced sensitivity. A similar result was also observed by []  in a study on PWG of Angus cattle raised in Brazil. However  the results of RNM_l-l revealed that this high correlation holds only for harsher environments and that there are good opportunities to select for increased PWG and reduced sensitivity in not so challenging environmental conditions. An alternative to select for increased PWG and reduced sensitivity jointly is to identify and select the best genotype for specific environmental conditions. However  this strategy may provide suboptimal genetic gain especially for tropical pasture systems where environmental conditions can vary substantially among years  even within farms. This reinforces the relevance of using sensitivity as a selection criterion. There is strong evidence that the mechanisms associated with sensitivity depend on the degree of EG. GWAS results of RNM_l-l revealed that important genomic regions associated with sensitivity from harsh to average environmental conditions differed from those associated with sensitivity from average to good environmental conditions. This result is not surprising given the diversity of environmental conditions in which the animals were raised and the complexity of livestock response to stressful conditions []. In harsher environments  genes associated with acute inflammatory response and keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation processes seem to play an important role in sensitivity of beef cattle that is assessed as the slope of the first segment of RNM_l-l (b1seg1). For instance  the - () gene is associated (in humans and mice) with wound repair after skin injury and with homeostasis of the skin  thus contributing to immune defense []. Another candidate gene of the REG3 family ()  also associated with sensitivity to harsher environments (b1seg1)  was found to be related with antimicrobial defense of the mammalian intestine [] and with intestinal strategies for maintaining symbiotic host-microbial relationships []. The barrier function of gastrointestinal epithelium in host protection is well documented in the literature [  ] and severe feed restriction has been shown to compromise the total tract barrier function in beef cattle []. These results reinforce the plausibility of  and  being associated with sensitivity of beef cattle to harsh environments. Another candidate gene potentially associated with sensitivity to harsh environmental conditions is the  (). This gene was identified in a region with copy number variation in South African Nguni cattle  which are recognized for their ability to sustain harsh environmental conditions and resistance to parasites and disease []. In not so harsh environments  candidate genes associated with inflammatory and immune response seem also to play an important role in sensitivity of beef cattle that is assessed as the slope of the second segment of RNM_l-l (b1seg2). Among them  the  () and  () are perhaps the most plausible candidates. Both genes are known to share a wide range of activities on monocytes  epithelial cells and B cells  and thus play an important role in host defense [   ]. Although interleukins and other cytokines are mainly reported to be involved in the regulation of immune response  there is also evidence about their role in regulating protein metabolism and muscle function []  among other metabolic functions as  for example  energy homeostasis [  ]. Members of the heat shock protein (HSP) family have been considered as candidate genes for sensitivity or stress response in different studies [   ]. No HSP genes were observed in our candidate regions. However  for sensitivity in not so harsh environments (b1seg2)  the - () was identified as a candidate gene.  is involved in glutamine synthesis  which  in turn  has been shown to be a powerful effector of HSP expression [].  has also been reported to be associated with cellular response to starvation []. Other important candidate genes associated with b1seg2 are the:  ()   () and  ().  is involved in the regulation of the sequestering of zinc ion  and zinc has been shown to have multiple impacts on the immune function [].  is upregulated in heat-shocked Holstein oocytes [] and differently expressed in a bovine tick-resistance study [].  is a key gene for the immune system [] and was identified as candidate gene for harsh environmental adaptation in cattle []. Eleven out of the 30 genes associated with sensitivity to not so harsh environments (b1seg2) were from the same region between 22.7 and 23.2 Mb on chromosome 17. The genes within this region are highly conserved in different species and multiple organisms have orthologs with those genes (NCBI databases; ). In humans  they are located in two regions  according to the reference assembly GRCh38.p12  one on chromosome 5 between 132.6 and 132.8 Mb (          ) and another on chromosome 19 between 2.0 and 2.2 Mb (      ). In Nellore cattle  the markers within this region are in high linkage disequilibrium (see Additional file : Figure S15). It is important to note that this candidate region would not have been identified  if we had performed GWAS using only RNM_hete. Enrichment results from FUMA showed that besides the differences in candidate regions associated with b1seg1 and b1seg2  the genes in those regions also differ in their gene expression profile. This result cannot be extrapolated to cattle since it is based on human data  but can serve as a guide for future gene expression studies in cattle that aim at identifying differentially expressed genes associated with adaptation or sensitivity. Based on the results of the FUMA analysis  in harsher environments  sampling of gastrointestinal and pancreas tissues is recommended. In not so harsh but still challenging environments  sampling of brain and skin tissues is also recommended. Our results reveal important G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions that affect the performance of beef cattle raised under tropical conditions or  more specifically  that G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions affect PWG in Nellore cattle. Sensitivity to environmental variation at the individual level is not linear along the environmental gradient  since animals that are less sensitive to environmental changes under harsher conditions are not necessarily less responsive to not so challenging conditions  and vice versa. The same pattern was observed at the molecular marker level  i.e. genomic regions associated with sensitivity to harsh conditions are not the same as those associated with sensitivity to not so harsh (but still challenging) conditions  although the genes within those regions share common biological processes  such as those related with inflammatory and immune response. These results highlight the diversity and complexity of mechanisms that are involved in cattle response to stressful/unfavorable conditions  and should serve as a basis for future studies aiming at unraveling the genetic control of sensitivity.

Point estimates of marker effects from SSGBLUP are often used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) without a formal framework of hypothesis testing. Our objective was to implement p-values for single-marker GWAS studies within the single-step GWAS (SSGWAS) framework by deriving computational algorithms and procedures  and by applying these to a large beef cattle population.MethodsP-values were obtained based on the prediction error (co)variances for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  which were obtained from the prediction error (co)variances of genomic predictions based on the inverse of the coefficient matrix and formulas to estimate SNP effects.ResultsComputation of p-values took a negligible time for a dataset with almost 2 million animals in the pedigree and 1424 genotyped sires  and no inflation of statistics was observed.

Point estimates of marker effects from SSGBLUP are often used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) without a formal framework of hypothesis testing. Our objective was to implement p-values for single-marker GWAS studies within the single-step GWAS (SSGWAS) framework by deriving computational algorithms and procedures  and by applying these to a large beef cattle population. P-values were obtained based on the prediction error (co)variances for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  which were obtained from the prediction error (co)variances of genomic predictions based on the inverse of the coefficient matrix and formulas to estimate SNP effects. Computation of p-values took a negligible time for a dataset with almost 2 million animals in the pedigree and 1424 genotyped sires  and no inflation of statistics was observed. The SNPs that passed the Bonferroni threshold of 10 were the same as those that explained the highest proportion of additive genetic variance  but even at the same significance levels and effects  some of them explained less genetic variance due to lower allele frequency. The use of a p-value for SSGWAS is a very general and efficient strategy to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). It can be used for complex datasets such as those used in animal breeding  where only a proportion of the pedigreed animals are genotyped. With availability of high-density SNP genotypes  detection and mapping of causal genes and QTL in livestock genetics is usually accomplished by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The most frequent GWAS method is single-marker fixed regression in a mixed linear model  in which genotypes at one marker are fit in the model as a covariate  and correction for the remaining genetic effects is based on a genetic relationship matrix. This is also known as efficient mixed-model association expedited (EMMAX) [  ]. In human and livestock genetic studies  the associated variance components are often estimated once on the same dataset and then assumed as known  e.g. [  ] with negligible effects on the p-values computed []. However  the use of EMMAX requires all phenotyped individuals to be genotyped and vice versa. In livestock  this requirement is not met for  e.g. dairy bulls  that do not have sex-limited phenotypes (e.g. milk yield). In general  many animals that are phenotyped (e.g. for growth) would benefit from phenotypic information on relatives (e.g. growth in daughters  ancestors and collateral relatives). Typically  for GWAS using EMMAX  phenotypes of relatives are “projected” onto the genotyped animals [  ] in a process called de-regression  which has been successfully used to detect and map QTL in livestock [  ]. De-regression is a cumbersome process and usually it is not optimal because it is an approximation that loses information and can lead to inaccuracies (e.g. spurious signals) due to selection not being accounted for  or by ignoring environmental effects. In particular  using de-regression leads to double-counting when the genotyped population includes both sires and their progeny. Legarra and Vitezica [] proposed a more general two-trait variance component model for GWAS  where the two traits modeled are the phenotype and “gene content” (number of copies of the reference allele) at the marker. Single-marker EMMAX regression is a particular case of the model in [] when all individuals are genotyped and phenotyped. However  the method in [] would be very slow for a GWAS because it requires maximization of a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) at each marker. The GBLUP or SNP-BLUP framework [  ] allows for the joint estimation of marker effects and the automatic correction for genetic structure in the population. The so-called single-step methods [i.e. single-step GBLUP (SSGBLUP) and single-step SNP-BLUP (SSSNP-BLUP)] project genotypes onto phenotyped individuals  using pedigree relationships [   ]. These “single-step methods” allow estimation of both breeding values and marker effects [    ]  and the latter have been used for GWAS analysis [  ]  typically based on the size of estimated marker effects or a related statistic such as the proportion of genetic variance explained by a marker or chromosome segment. Proper GWAS analyses typically consider the estimates of either marker estimates or variance explained by segments  together with their uncertainty  to derive either p-values being different from 0 [    ]  or posterior probabilities of a region explaining more than a predetermined threshold [  ]. Both are proper statistical analyses with well-defined error rates. However  in most single-step methods used for GWAS (e.g. [  ])  point estimates (posterior means) of marker effects are used  without accounting for their incertitude  because this is the output of common software. The use of “variances explained” is also often poorly implemented  because the variance explained has the form   which ignores the uncertainty on the estimate of marker effects  the linkage disequilibrium between markers. In other words  variances explained are reported as point estimates  without confidence intervals  p-values or posterior probabilities. An additional source of confusion for the reader is the arbitrary choice of “windows” of adjacent SNPs  since  to date  there is no current consensus. As a result  studies are difficult to compare. For instance  [] studied “the 20 largest explanatory loci”  [] studied “the 10 windows explaining the largest amount of genomic variance for gene annotation  gene network and pathway analyses”  whereas [] considered “1.5-Mb SNP windows that explained more than 0.50% of the genetic variance”. In these studies  there was no assessment (in the form of p-values or posterior probabilities) to check if the variances explained by these regions were not due to chance. Although using estimates of marker effects or explained variances considers correctly the  of the estimated marker effects  it does not always consider correctly the  in the estimation of marker effects. Even worse  there is a possibility that different iterative schemes are used. All these problems render interpretation of signals more difficult and perhaps suboptimal []. Recently  equivalences between GBLUP and single-marker GWAS (EMMAX) results have been demonstrated in a series of papers [  ]. In both cases  the statistic used is  (i.e. the marker effect estimate over its standard deviation). Papers [  ] proved that these statistics are mathematically equivalent  i.e.  from EMMAX is equal to  from GBLUP. This is remarkable because  in EMMAX  the effect of the marker is fitted as fixed and  in GBLUP  as random. An application and the comparison with Bayesian methods were performed on a dataset of gait in horses []. Still  the method using GBLUP results could not be applied to datasets that consisted of mixtures of genotyped and ungenotyped animals. Lu et al. [] showed that the same logic used in [  ] for GBLUP can be used in a SSGBLUP context. Simply stated  to obtain a statistical test for the effect of a single marker  we need only estimates of the breeding values of genotyped animals and their sampling distribution  which can be readily obtained from SSGBLUP. Unfortunately  the article of Lu et al. [] seems to have gone unnoticed because its main focus is on feed efficiency (not on methods for GWAS) and uses a small dataset (i.e. 7000 phenotyped animals of which 5000 are genotyped)  and therefore the applicability to large datasets was unclear. In the present work  we present the implementation of single-step GWAS (SSGWAS) with frequentist p-values  as in []  together with an application on a very large beef cattle dataset. We describe algorithms and computational procedures along with their bottlenecks. We try to show that GWAS with frequentist p-values can be applied to quite large datasets  comparable to datasets used in many national evaluations. GWAS of the beef cattle dataset led to the detection of highly significant signals in marker loci that have already been described in the literature and showed good empirical behavior. The classical GWAS method (EMMAX) for marker  uses a linear model   where vector  contains fixed effects   is a vector with “gene contents” (0  1  or 2 at the marker)   is the allele substitution effect of the th marker  and  is a vector of breeding values  modelled as   where  is a genomic relationship matrix and  is a matrix with gene contents for all markers;   is the frequency of the reference allele at the th marker. We assume  as customary []  that variances  and  are assumed known  if needed from a single preliminary estimate from the same dataset. The normal hypothesis test for the effect of the marker uses the statistic   where both values are obtained from the inversion of the coefficient matrix of the mixed model equations of the model. P-values testing whether the allele substitution effect differs from 0 are obtained as   where  is the cumulative standard normal function. It has been shown [  ] that joint estimates of marker effects  from SNP-BLUP (or GBLUP models) of the form  with prior assumption  lead to the statistics  that are equivalent to the statistic obtained for marker  in the EMMAX fixed regression framework. The use of SSSNP-BLUP instead of SSGBLUP to obtain p-values is straightforward  because  and  are immediately available from the output of SSSNP-BLUP (e.g. []). In GBLUP and SSGBLUP  the same values can be obtained as linear transformations of the estimates of breeding values  and their prediction error (co)variances [    ]. These can be obtained from the inverse of the mixed model equations [  ]. The algorithm for SSGWAS  which accommodates both genotyped and non-genotyped animals  has been implemented in the blupf90 suite of programs []. It combines the algorithms for SSGBLUP (e.g. []) and back-solving to obtain estimates of marker effects and their associated p-values from estimates of breeding values []: 1. Construct the inverse of the joint pedigree-genomic relationship matrix   with   which projects genomic relationships  from genotyped animals (labelled as “2”) to non-genotyped animals (labelled as “1”). Matrix  is the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Matrix  is (usually) constructed as   where  and  are chosen to equate average inbreeding and average relationships in  and  and  is a small value (typically from 0 to 0.05). This results in genomic and pedigree relationships to be compatible [  ] and  is invertible []. Matrix  contains centered gene content as in []  but using observed allele frequencies. Other possibilities exist to create  depending on model assumptions []. 2. Construct the mixed model equations for SSGBLUP. In a simple case (a model with a single genetic effect) these would be: where  are estimates of fixed effects and  are estimates of breeding values (not marker effects). More complex cases and multiple-trait models can be easily accommodated []. 3. Factorize and obtain the sparse inverse of the coefficient matrix. The whole inverse cannot be obtained directly as it is typically too big []. Instead  a “sparse inverse” () is obtained with selected elements of the inverse that corresponds to the non-zero entries of a (sparse) Cholesky factor (). In our case  this is achieved using supernodal sparse factorization and inversions as programmed in YAMS [  ]. Factorization is the computing bottleneck of the procedure and is roughly cubic on the number of genotyped animals; YAMS reduces the computing time by  roughly  one order of magnitude. 4. Solve the mixed model equations for  by using the sparse Cholesky factor. 5. Extract from  the submatrix that corresponds to the genotyped animals    which contains the prediction error (co)variances of their estimated breeding values    i.e. . 6. Back-solve for SNP effect estimates using . If matrix  is full rank and compatible with pedigree relationships (for instance  if  is built with base allele frequencies) then  [    ]. 7. Obtain individual prediction error variances of SNP effect estimates as []: where  is the -th column of   corresponding to genotypes of marker  across individuals. The values of  in steps 6 and 7 refer to the “blending” of  with  in step 1 and will change with different choices of blending parameters. 8. The p-value for marker  is obtained as . Note that this analysis has to be run only once  as opposed to the  individual runs for  markers in the classical “fixed effect” regression or EMMAX (e.g. []). Note that within the framework of SSSNP-BLUP  the estimates of SNP effects and their variance are obtained directly without steps 1 to 6. From expressions in []  it is possible to convert estimates of the random marker effects    to the fixed regression estimates    using   with   which results in  We re-analyzed a dataset on birth weight from the American Angus Association []. The complete dataset is very large  with about 7 million individual weights  52 000 genotyped animals and 8 million animals in the pedigree  and the SSGBLUP evaluations cannot be run in core. Thus  we used only phenotypes recorded in the last 4 years  specifically from 2009 to 2012  which comprised 1 046 623 birth weights. Three generations of ancestors were traced back  totaling 1 849 865 individuals. All available genotypes of sires with phenotyped offspring were used (i.e. 1424 genotyped sires). Other genotyped animals were not considered since they include selection candidates (with no phenotypic information) and elite cows  which do not represent the population well. Genotypes were obtained with the BovineSNP50k v2 BeadChip; 38 122 polymorphic SNPs were used after quality control []. The linear model for birth weight included the effects of contemporary group  animal breeding values and the permanent environmental effect of the mother  which considers maternal ability during pregnancy. This differs from the model actually used in national evaluations  which also considers a maternal genetic effect. Variance components were fixed at values used in the national evaluation  with a heritability of 0.48 and a maternal component of 0.10. Computations were done using the blupf90 software suite and GWAS results were plotted with qqman []. Rejection thresholds used a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of 0.05/38 122  which equals 5.9 on the  scale. Significant regions were explored in AnimalQTLdb and Jbrowse [] using the bovine map assembly UMD 3.1 []. Although a new genome map assembly has already been published (i.e. ARS-UCD 1.2)  the aforementioned genome browsers still use the UMD 3.1 assembly. In addition to SSGWAS p-values  we plotted GWAS results based on the percentage of variance explained by marker effects []. This estimates the population genetic variance explained by the marker effect  and is approximately computed as . There are no theoretical thresholds in this approach  and we used an arbitrary threshold of 0.10% of total genetic variance explained by one marker. Note that there is no formal assessment of this hypothesis: neither the p-values nor the posterior distributions are obtained for the “variance explained”. Opposite to []  we do not present results of iterating the SSGBLUP using “weights” for each marker  as this procedure did not result in increased marker effect and variance (results not shown). Factorization of the mixed model equations and extraction of  required 30 Gb of RAM memory and 14 h (wall-clock time). Computation of  and p-values took only a few minutes. Quantile–quantile plot and Manhattan plots are in Figs.  and . The quantile–quantile plot did not show large deviations from the null hypothesis  which means that SSGBLUP correctly captured the structure of the population through the relationship matrices. When population structure is not accounted for  inflation of GWAS signals (in our case   or ) is expected [    ].

The red line corresponds to the Bonferroni rejection threshold for nominal alpha<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 The GWAS results pointed to two chromosome regions that are significant at the genome-wide level  with values of  near 8. The region at the end of chromosome 7 includes three markers: ARS-BFGL-NGS-107035  ARS-BFGL-NGS-101886 and ARS-BFGL-NGS-18900  which were in very high linkage disequilibrium with each other (correlation between genotypes<U+2009>><U+2009>0.95 in all cases).  reports signals in the same region for “body conformation” in Holstein cattle [] and for “average daily body weight gain” in Brangus cattle (composite of Brahman and Angus) []  which indicates that our finding is not a false positive. The second region at the end of chromosome 20 only includes marker Hapmap42635-BTA-68718  which is included in a QTL region for mid-test body weight that was detected in the Hereford breed []. Figure  shows estimates of the percentage of genetic variance attributed to each marker (as ) based on estimates of marker effects from SSGBLUP. The top markers are the same as in Fig.  (ARS-BFGL-NGS-18900 and Hapmap42635-BTA-68718)  but the region on chromosome 7 has a smaller peak than the region on chromosome 20. At first sight  this raises questions  because estimates of marker effects<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard errors were similar for the peaks on chromosomes 7 and 20 (-<U+2009>0.041<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.007 and 0.043<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.008  respectively). The different relative heights of the peaks on chromosomes 7 and 20 in the variance plot (Fig. ) and in the  plot (Fig. ) are entirely due to the different minor allelic frequencies: 0.28 and 0.46  respectively  which enter into the estimator of explained variance . For the marker on chromosome 7  the variance explained is   whereas for the marker on chromosome 20  it is . In the case of these two markers  the estimates of the fixed marker effects are also nearly identical (not shown). In other words  these two figures explain two different things  i.e. Figure  explains whether markers have apparent effects that are seemingly different from 0 (with statistical assessment) and Fig.  explains whether markers explain part of the genetic variance—but with no statistical assessment. Percentage of genetic variance explained by markers for birth weight in American Angus. The red line corresponds to an arbitrary rejection threshold of 0.10% Single-step methods can include genotyped and ungenotyped animals in a single genomic analysis. Estimates of SNP effects from single-step methods became available in 2012 [  ]. However  to date  a measure of the significance for SNP estimates has not been available in current implementations of single-step GBLUP. Expanding the ideas based on the equivalence between GBLUP and single-marker GWAS [  ]  Lu et al. [] derived GWAS within a ssGBLUP framework for a relatively small dataset. In our study  we show  for the first time  the acquisition of p-values calculated by using a large dataset including genotypes  phenotypes  and pedigree. In this paper  we addressed frequentist statistics for GWAS. Single-step Bayesian methods using mixtures of distributions exist []  and the posterior probabilities that they report may better control the error rate in discoveries; we refer the reader to Fernando et al. [] for a thorough review and discussion. Here  we discuss models that assume multivariate normality  i.e. for which posterior probabilities are not explicitly obtained. However  Bayes factors can be easily obtained from  and  []  and they can be transformed into posterior probabilities. Known associations from studies on beef cattle in the literature show good empirical agreement with our GWAS findings. The quantile–quantile plot showed no inflation of p-values  as expected  because the structure of relationships was well accounted for [    ]. Compared to EMMAX  SSGWAS is a more comprehensive method that can include phenotypes from non-genotyped individuals. Additional advantages compared to “approximate” SSGWAS include avoiding the need for arbitrary choices  such as the length of segments or the use of iterative schemes. The use of the percentage of explained variance  as advocated by several authors [  ]  needs to be done with formal testing  either frequentist or Bayesian. Explained variance is useful for breeding purposes  but may not be useful for QTL detection if the final objective is to have a detailed understanding of the action of genes. In particular  point estimates of explained variance using  are neither statistics with defined distributions nor posterior probabilities. The exact form of matrix  depends on modelling assumptions. The weight  given to markers in  depends on the proportion of additive genetic variance that is explained by the markers  which can be estimated by REML []. Our experience shows that GEBV are fairly insensitive to values of  between 0.95 and 1  and estimates of SNP effects should not change much. The values of  and  depend (basically) on the structure of the genotypes of the population  but they can be obtained from the data. Although SSGWAS could be implemented for a dataset that included the last 4 years of phenotypes and all genotyped bulls present in the American Angus data  it was computationally not feasible with the entire dataset. Even for the reduced dataset  the computational burden for the factorization of the left-hand side of the mixed model equations was not negligible. For this dataset   contained (roughly) 16 million non-null elements from pedigree data and 2 million non-null elements from genotypes. However   for the whole dataset in Lourenco et al. [] contained 63 million non-null elements from pedigree data and 2704 million non-null elements from genotypes. One simple method to reduce the size of the problem is to include only genotyped ancestors in SSGWAS and exclude genotyped selection candidates. This leads to a number of genotyped animals in the thousands or tens of thousands. Another strategy is to use a sparse version of  based on the APY (algorithm for proven and young) approach [    ]  which substantially increases the number of null elements in . If animals in the APY core portion of  are a representative sample of the population  this also improves estimates of the SNP effects []. However  the use of the APY approach for SSGWAS on marker effect estimates and p-values should be explored further. Overall  our method is appropriate for data in the order of several thousands of genotyped individuals and several millions of phenotypes and non-genotyped individuals. This includes the datasets used in many national and private company genetic evaluations but it does not include the very large evaluations  such as used in dairy cattle. We emphasize that  contrary to regular single-marker GWAS  SSGWAS do not require computations to be repeated at each marker. Instead  all p-values are obtained in a single run of SSGWAS. Single-step GWAS is a very general and efficient strategy for the detection  localization and testing of QTL  providing frequentist p-values of marker effects. It can be used in complex datasets such as those used in animal breeding  with many unbalanced effects  very complex mixed linear models and the presence of genotyped and ungenotyped animals. Our proposed strategy is computationally viable for very large populations and solves the main issues in single-step GWAS that precluded use of the method. The data that support the findings of this study were provided from the American Angus Association but restrictions apply to the availability of these data  which were used under license for the current study  and thus are not publicly available.

However  in these studies  animals were not exposed to an environmental challenge. To demonstrate the advantages of this mouse line with a low environmental variability of birth weight  animals from two divergent lines (high and low variability of birth weight) were subjected to feed restriction. The objective of this study was to use these divergent lines to compare their response in terms of robustness against an environmental challenge. At weaning  120 females  i.e. four full-sib females from 10 random litters of three consecutive generations of selection  were chosen from these divergent lines. The total number of females was divided into four groups  which were subjected to a feeding regimen by imposing different levels of feed restriction (i.e. 75  90 and 85% of full ad libitum feed across three generations  respectively) in different combinations during the growth and reproduction periods. Animals from the “low” line were less sensitive to a change in feed level than those from the “high” line. Regarding reproduction  the “low” line performed better in terms of number of females having parturitions  number of parturitions  and litter size. Imposing a feed restriction on female mice during their growth period did not affect the birth weight of their pups. The “low” line was preferred because of its higher reproductive efficiency and survival under an environmental challenge. Selection for decreased environmental variability of birth weight produces animals that are less sensitive to environmental conditions  which can be interpreted as having greater robustness. Animal production requires the effective use of resources  i.e. animals that perform better and that are more robust. Moreover  sustainability is related to robustness  and robustness is related to homogeneity  but evaluating robustness and homogeneity in an experimental population has rarely been carried out []. Mormede and Terenina [] suggested that robustness is the combination of a high production potential with a low sensitivity to environmental changes or to a certain level of stress. Since several decades  feed costs represent the major part of breeding costs and are one of the major concerns for breeders. Different feeding strategies  such as feeding to appetite (ad libitum) or feeding under restrictions  are common practices in commercial animal production []. Efficient use of feed resources for growing animals is one of the major factors that influence the economic sustainability of animal production []. Selection for homogeneity  in general  can affect feed efficiency and may benefit productivity and animal welfare  even when feed restrictions are applied. However  feed restriction can affect both animal performance and welfare. In rabbits  it has been demonstrated that an ad libitum diet maximizes performance [] increases sexual receptivity  ovulation rate  blastocyst size  and implantation rate []. Previously a divergent selection experiment was carried out for 17 generations in two mouse lines to gain more insight into the effect of selection for homogeneity of birth weight (BW) []. The study of these two ad libitum fed lines by Formoso-Rafferty et al. [] included the evaluation of production  reproduction  and animal welfare traits. They showed that feed efficiency was similar in both lines  but that fertility and welfare were higher in the homogeneous line  which suggested higher robustness. Previously  some authors reported that homogeneity of body weight was correlated with important reproductive traits such as fertility or litter size in rabbits [  ] and with robustness traits such as welfare [] or survival in piglets and rabbits [  ]. However  in these studies  the animals were not exposed to any environmental challenges  which did not allow direct assessment of the change in performance under new environmental conditions. Animals with a performance that remains unchanged under an environment challenge can be considered as being more robust. Hence  the objective of our study was to analyze the influence of feed restriction  which is considered an environmental challenge  in two mouse lines that were divergently selected for environmental variability of birth weight (BW). Data were recorded on two mouse lines that were divergently selected for environmental variability of BW. Details of the selection process are in Formoso-Rafferty et al. []. In the current paper  “low” and “high” will be used for the line with  respectively  a low and high environmental variability of BW. Briefly  this selection experiment demonstrated a divergent response for the residual variance of BW and that it was positively correlated with traits related to welfare and robustness. Data for animals from three consecutive generations of the selection experiment (12  13 and 14) were available. Hence  40 females (four full-sib females from 10 random litters) per generation and line were chosen at weaning  divided into four treatment groups (1 full-sib per group) that were assigned different combinations of feed restriction during the growth and reproduction stages. First  the 40 females per line were divided into two groups (20 females per group)  with one group fed ad libitum and the other with a restricted diet during the growth period (GP). The effect of the feeding regime during the GP was noted as R_GP. Female body weight in g (W) was recorded weekly from weaning to 3–11 weeks of age. Starting at 11 weeks of age  both groups were fed ad libitum (recovery period) until the start of the reproduction period (RP). To explore the effects of line and feeding regime (ad libitum or feed-restricted) on feed efficiency during the GP  the cumulated transformation index was computed for each of the 10 weeks after weaning as the ratio of cumulative feed intake (in g from weaning to the specific week) and weight gain (in g from weaning to the specific week). The last 2 weeks of this 10-week period were a recovery period during which all animals were fed ad libitum. One week before mating  each GP feeding group was divided into two new groups (Fig. ): one was fed ad libitum and the other with a restricted feed regimen during the RP. Thus  the resulting four groups had a combination of ad libitum and restricted feeding regimes during GP and RP (Fig. ). The effect of the feeding regime during the RP was identified as R_RP. Design of the post-weaning experiment and distribution of the females in the corresponding experimental group according to their feeding regimen (ad libitum or restricted) during growth and reproduction periods During the RP  each female cohabitated with one male from the same line for two reproduction cycles to give the female the opportunity to become pregnant twice. Pregnant females were checked daily  litter size was recorded within 24 h after birth  and the new-borns were weighed and identified individually. The number of females with only one (P1) or two (P2) parturitions were also recorded. P1 was recorded on all 40 females that were available within line and generation  while P2 was recorded only on the females that had a P1. An overall measurement of fertility (%) was also recorded within line  generation  and feeding regime  as the percentage of available females that had a parturition. In generation 12  survival (%) was also measured as the percentage of females alive compared to the total number at the start of the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment  in generation 12  and taking the current literature concerning feeding restriction on mice and other species [     ] into account  we decided to apply a feeding restriction of 75% of the full ad libitum intake. The amount of feed provided to the restricted groups was 75% of the mean ad libitum consumption in the corresponding line at a particular physiological state (GP or RP) in the three previous generations []. Unexpectedly  75% of ad libitum feeding resulted in increased mortality  particularly in the high line  which suggests that animals from this line were less robust. Because of this unexpected mortality  we decided to reduce the percentage of restriction in the subsequent generations  i.e. in the second generation (13)  feeding restriction was modified to 90% of the ad libitum intake. In this particular case  some animals did not consume all the food provided  which strictly speaking means that the feeding regimen was not restricted. Thus  in the third generation (14)  we applied a feeding restriction of 85%. The data used in this study included weekly weights for each female from weaning to 10 weeks of age  with an initial 240 records and a final count of 225 at the end of the experiment. The weights for each week were analyzed with a model that included the effects of R-GP (ad libitum or feed-restricted)  line (low or high)  generation (12  13 or 14)  the litter size in which the female was born (with 3 levels  i.e. from 4 to 9  10 to 11 and 12 to 15 pups)  and the first order interactions between line  generation  and R_GP. It would have been better to include also a genetic effect to separate the influence of selection from the environmental effect of the generation  but this was not possible because of the small number of animals in the dataset. The analysis was carried out with the Release 4.1 ASReml program []. Survival and fertility were compared based on single statistical Chi square tests using the FREQ procedure of the SAS software []. The dataset contained 1275 records for BW of the progeny of 116 females with at least one parturition  158 litters  and 4900 pedigree records. The heteroscedastic model of SanCristobal-Gaudy et al. [] was fitted to the BW data. This model assumes that the BW mean and its residual variance are both affected by genetic and environmental factors and can be written as: where  and  represent the systematic effects that affect the mean and environmental variability of BW  respectively   and  are random effects that account for the maternal genetic effects that affect the mean and variability of BW  respectively  and   is a random litter effect with variance . Vectors  and  of the genetic values were assumed to follow a joint distribution: where  denotes the Kronecker product and  is the additive genetic relationship matrix between animals. Regarding the systematic effects  the model included the feeding regimen of the dam during the growth (R_GP) and reproduction (R_RP) periods (ad libitum or feed-restricted)  line (low or high)  generation (12  13  or 14)  the litter size (LS) that each dam was born in (LS: from 4 to 9  10 to 11 and 12 to 15 pups; i.e. 3 levels)  parturition number (P1 or P2)  litter size of the progeny (LS: from 1 to 5  6  from 7 to 9  10  and from 11 to 13 pups; i.e. 5 levels)  and the sex of the progeny (male  female  or unknown)  along with the first order interactions between line  generation  and RP. A first analysis included all of these effects in the model but  in a second step  those that were not significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) were removed. Only the results obtained from this second analysis are presented. The pedigree information went up to the founding population of both lines and  thus  we could assess the genetic influence of line on BW by considering differences in the means of breeding value predictions for the animals involved in the experiment  which means that the systematic effect of line explains exclusively the environmental effects associated with line. The heteroscedastic model was solved through a double hierarchical generalized linear model (DHGLM) developed by Felleki et al. [] within the frame of ASReml (ASReml Release 4.1 software) []. Since this model assumes a residual variance for each level of combination of systematic effects []  when required  the estimate of the residual variance for a given level of a given effect was obtained by averaging over the solutions of all other effects as: where  is the solution for a particular level  of a systematic effect   and  is the number of levels of the systematic effect. In particular  the estimate of the residual variance for the combined effect of line and RP was obtained as: Table  shows the differences in survival between lines and feed intake regimens at 10 weeks of age and at mating in generation 12 of the experiment  in which the feeding restriction was 75% of full ad libitum. At 10 weeks of age and at mating  there were significant differences in survival between feeding regimes (ad libitum or feed-restricted) in the high line  and between lines in the restricted feeding regimen. Regarding W  Table  shows the significance level of the factors considered in the model at week 0 (at weaning)  1  2  3  4  5  6  or 7 after weaning. There was no significant environmental influence of the line on any of the weights analyzed. The generation effect on W was highly significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) at 2 weeks after weaning and later on. The effect of litter size on W was also highly significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) throughout the experiment (weeks 0–7). As expected  the feeding regime (R_GP) showed a highly significant effect on W (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) for all weeks after weaning (weeks 1–7). The interaction between line and generation was either not or weakly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) significant across the growth period  but the interaction between generation and R_GP was highly significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 or <U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  reflecting differences in the level of restriction applied in each generation. In fact  all first-order interactions for W were significant to some extent at some weeks. The significance of the interaction between line and R_GP on W was also high (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 or <U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) from weeks 2 to 7  which indicates that the impact of feed restriction differed between the two lines. Figure  shows the least square means for W at 4 weeks after weaning in both lines in the three generations analyzed. Week 4 was taken as a reference for the adult age of a mouse  but the pattern was similar for all weeks throughout the experiment. Irrespective of diet (ad libitum or restricted)  females from the low line were slightly lighter than those from the high line and females that were fed ad libitum in the low line maintained a similar weight over all three generations  in contrast to those of the high line. The least square mean estimates of female weight (in g) in the fourth week after weaning in the low line (continuous lines) and high line (discontinuous lines) depending on feeding regimen (ad libitum or restricted) in the three generations Figure a  b show the evolution of female weight (Fig. a) and of the cumulated transformation index (Fig. b) for each line and feeding regime from 0 to 10 weeks after weaning. The effect of feed restriction was similar in both lines but animals from the low line recovered their normal body weight in one or 2 weeks after being put back on the ad libitum feeding regimen  whereas those from the high line continued to have a slightly smaller body weight than individuals from the same line that were permanently fed ad libitum (Fig. a). The cumulated transformation index was similar for both lines regardless of the feeding regimen. After a short recovery period  females that had been subjected to feed restriction reached a lower (better) transformation index value than females that were never feed-restricted  in both lines (Fig. b). This compensatory growth effect could be interesting for application to livestock. Phenotypic evolution of the female weekly weight (in g) () and the cumulated transformation index () depending on feeding regimen (ad libitum or restricted) in both lines with high and low environmental variability of BW from weaning to 10 weeks later Table  shows the significance levels for the effects of generation  line and feeding regimen in the growth and reproduction periods  as well as their first order interactions  on fertility (%) in both parturitions (P1 or P2). The effect of line was highly significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) for both parturitions. The other effects were more important in P2 than P1  except in generation 12  in which a stronger feed restriction was applied. The raw data for overall fertility (%) for each combination of line  generation  and feeding regimen during reproductive and growing periods are in Table  for P1 and P2. The statistical test refers to differences in feeding regimen. Fertility of animals from the low line was higher than that of animals from the high line. Concerning feeding regimen  feed-restricted females performed worse than those fed ad libitum  except at P1 for high line females of generation 14 that were feed-restricted during the reproduction period. Table  also shows that the negative influence of feeding restriction on fertility was stronger when it was applied during the reproduction period than during the growth period  thus reducing the percentage of animals that had a P2. When the restriction was applied during the reproduction period  the number of P2 differed significantly between lines. Feed restriction seemed to affect animals from the high line more  regardless of the physiological stage  growth or reproduction  but these differences were not significant. Table  shows the significance of the systematic effects and the estimated variances of the random effects for the mean and the variability of BW. The genetic correlation between the location and dispersion parameters for BW was 0.34  but the standard error of this estimate was very large due to the numerous factors of variation and to the limited amount of data. Regarding the effect of feed restriction in dams on the BW of their offspring  the effect of offspring generation was significant only for the offspring of mothers that were feed-restricted during the growth period. For these feed-restricted dams  the BW of their pups decreased as the level of feed restriction of the dams increased (Fig. a). Similarly  as shown in Fig. b  the effect of feed restriction of the mothers during their growth did not affect the BW of their pups  when they were fed ad libitum during the reproduction period. Nevertheless  when the females were feed-restricted during the reproduction period  pups from the females that were fed ad libitum during their growth had a slightly higher BW  than those had been feed-restricted during the same period. Birth weight of pups (BW) depending on the feeding regimen (ad libitum or restricted) of the dam during the growth period (R_GP) () and the reproduction period (R_RP) () in the three generations Among the effects that influence the variability of BW  only sex and the interaction between line and feeding regime during the reproduction period were significant (Table ). This interaction led to different residual variances between the combinations of line and feeding regimens during reproduction  as shown in Table   with corresponding estimates of residual variances in Fig. . Note that from the ad libitum to the restricted feeding regimen  the residual variance decreased more in the high line (18%) than in the low line (5%). Drop in residual variance () in the lines with low and high environmental variability of BW depending on feeding regimen (ad libitum or restricted) during the reproduction period (R_GP) We hypothesized that the effect of a feed restriction challenge would be stronger in the line selected for a high than for a low environmental variability of BW  which could be interpreted as the low line being more robust. Although our analysis was on mice that were divergently selected for variability of BW  this could reflect the advantages of selection for decreased variability of a particular trait on robustness and animal welfare in livestock production. Although there is no agreement in the definition of robustness  Knap [] defines it as the capacity of achieving a high level of productive potential and supporting  at the same time  a certain level of stress  or expressing high productive level in different environments. Mormede and Terenina [] expressed the same idea in a different way by suggesting that it is a combination of a high production potential with a low sensitivity towards environmental changes. Formoso-Rafferty et al. [] showed that animals from the low line were more robust and expressed higher animal welfare and reproductive performance. They mentioned the need to study whether homogeneity could also be desirable under environmental challenges. Thus  the aim of our research was to study the relationship between homogeneity and robustness in a stressful environment. We tried to achieve this by assessing the relationships that exists between a very important production feature  i.e. feed efficiency and homogeneity and robustness. Silalahi et al. [] argued that animals selected for high production efficiency might be more susceptible to behavioral  physiological  or immunological problems  thus making them less robust [  ]. In the present experiment  the level of feed restriction had to be modified at each generation  because of unexpected and undesired observations in the initial generations. Thus  we applied a feeding regimen that consisted of 75  90  and 85% of ad libitum intake in the first  second  and third generations of the experiment  respectively. As a result  the effects of feed-restriction were expected to differ between generations  with a stronger effect in the first generation. However  even in these last two generations  the feed-restrictions applied were expected to generate the desired challenged environment. Although in the design used here  the effect of feed-restriction level could be influenced partly by other causes associated with generation and selection effects  we assumed that the observed differences between generations were mainly due to feed-restriction levels. The results show that  although the two lines did not statistically differ in weight after weaning  there was a significant interaction between line and feeding regime during the growth period (Table ). This interaction  which was observed from week 2 after weaning  could be interpreted as a consequence of a cumulated negative effect from the previous weeks. Figure  shows the least square means of the weights in week 4 after weaning  at which time animals had reached maturity (i.e. at 49 days of age []). Although there were differences in body weight between the lines  they were not significant (Table ); animals from the low line were lighter than those from the high line within feeding regimen and generation  as shown in Fig. . The smaller weight of animals from the low line under ad libitum feeding had already been reported based on a larger number of animals [  ]. The differences between animals fed ad libitum and feed-restricted were always higher for the high than for the low line. Thus  our results suggest that animals from the low line are less sensitive to a change in feed level than those from the high line. In some cases  a low level of feed-restriction can have a beneficial effect. Young mammals [] are prone to digestive diseases  particularly around the weaning period. Feeding practices such as restricted feeding are known to affect physiological and productive traits in growing rabbits [    ]. Lu et al. [] reported that  after returning to ad libitum feeding  feed-restricted animals can show compensatory growth [  ]  increased nutrient digestibility [  ]  and increased feed conversion rate []. This compensatory growth depends on the duration  level  and pattern of feed restriction [      ]. The effect of feed-restriction on growth was more easily compensated for  when the duration of feed restriction was short or moderate. We observed that the high line was more negatively affected by a greater level of feed restriction than the low line. Although feed restriction affected the growth of both lines similarly  animals from the low line recovered their normal weight in one or 2 weeks  whereas those from the high line did not attain a normal weight at the end of the experiment (Fig. a). Nevertheless  it is generally assumed that a very low level of feed restriction could prevent animals from fattening  and this effect seemed to be more beneficial for the high than the low line since feed restriction increased reproductive performance in the high line and not to the same extent in the low line. The effect of feed restriction during the reproduction period was greater for females that had also been feed-restricted during their growth period  thus manifesting a memory effect. However  we would not have observed this differential effect of feed restriction during the reproduction period  if the experiment had been designed to feed-restrict animals only during the growth period. In spite of the recovery capacity of females  the low effect on the BW of their own pups made the memory effect patent  confirming previously reported results in rats [] and cattle []. The estimate of the variance of the litter effect was threefold greater than the genetic variance of the maternal effect  which was small but different from zero. This result is in agreement with that previously reported during the selection process []. Overall  selection for decreased environmental variability of BW appeared to have conferred a lower sensitivity of the mothers to the changing environmental conditions. Animals from the high line were more sensitive to harsh feeding restrictions than those from the low line. However  a moderate feeding restriction prevented the high line females from fattening  resulting in fertility rates that were comparable between lines  as shown in generation 14 (Table ). The estimate of the genetic correlation between the mean and dispersion parameters for BW was 0.34 (Table )  which is similar to that obtained by Formoso-Rafferty et al. [] on the same population but with a higher accuracy. Because of this correlation  the mean BW of the offspring was greater for the high line than for the low line  as shown by Formoso-Rafferty et al. []. The genetic component of the environmental variance can be related to the capacity of animals to adapt to new environmental conditions  which can affect their welfare []. There is some evidence that environmental variability is under genetic control []. In addition to the parameters estimated in several datasets []  two selection experiments that used variability of BW as a selection criterion were performed with success  one in mice [] and one in rabbits []. Feed costs represent the largest financial input in livestock production systems but can be reduced by reducing feed intake [  ]. However  limiting feed intake is also expected to reduce production and  therefore  livestock must be selected based on feed efficiency rather than only on feed intake []. Based on our findings  animals that show less environmental variability of BW are more robust  which means that they cope better with the environmental challenge of feed restriction. Blasco et al. [] demonstrated that a rabbit line selected for homogeneity in litter size tolerated external stressors more effectively than the line selected for heterogeneity in litter size. Thus  in general  animals selected for increased environmental variability appear to be more sensitive to stress  have a lower immune response to infections  and a higher hepatic activity []. These effects have consequences on disease resistance but also on animal welfare  because animals that cope more effectively with their environment have better welfare than animals that are more sensitive. Using the definition by Mormede and Terenina [] and the conclusions in Formoso-Rafferty et al. []  our findings demonstrate a relationship between low environmental variability and robustness in a challenging environment. We also show that the low line has a higher survival rate and better fertility even when the animals were feed-restricted. Finally  the low line is more stable and better able to tolerate stressful conditions. The mouse is frequently used as a model animal in selection experiments because of its favorable characteristics such as short generation intervals and large number of pups per parturition. Conclusions based on mice can be extrapolated to livestock species such as pigs or rabbits []. A research project on homogeneity in sheep is in progress in which the selection index has been modified to include a specific weight for this selection objective []. More research is needed to ensure the suitability of applying this type of selection in cattle. When an environmental challenge in the form of a feed restriction was applied  the mouse line selected for a low environmental variance of BW had a higher survival rate and better reproductive efficiency than the high line. The animals from the low line were less affected by the feed restriction and were more robust to this environmental challenge than those from the high line.

Nevertheless  the genetic variability of farmed salmonid lines  which have been selected for several generations  should be assessed. Indeed  a significant decrease in genetic variability due to high selection intensity could have occurred  potentially jeopardizing the long-term genetic progress as well as the adaptive capacities of populations facing change(s) in the environment.

These results were consistent with inbreeding estimates that varied from 10.0% in an unselected experimental line to 19.5% in a commercial line  and which are clearly higher than corresponding estimates in ruminants or pigs. In addition  strong variations in LD and inbreeding were observed along the genome that may be due to differences in local rates of recombination or due to key genes that tended to have fixed favorable alleles for domestication or production.ConclusionsThis is the first report on ROH for any aquaculture species. Inbreeding appeared to be moderate to high in the six French rainbow trout lines  due to founder effects at the start of the breeding programs  but also likely to sweepstakes reproductive success in addition to selection for the selected lines.

Efficient management of inbreeding is a major goal in breeding programs to ensure that populations can adapt to future breeding objectives and SNP information can be used to manage the rate at which inbreeding builds up in the fish genome. Rainbow trout () is native to the Pacific drainages of North America and also to Kamchatka in Russia. This fish was introduced at the end of the nineteenth century to waters on all continents except Antarctica  for recreational angling and aquaculture purposes. Rainbow trout is one of the main species of fish reared in cold freshwater around the world  particularly in Europe  North America and Chile []. For several decades  the rainbow trout farming industry has been endeavoring to continually increase production efficiency and sales by increasing rearing densities  improving diets  water quality and recirculation technology  controlling sexual maturation and gender  or developing genetically superior lines of fish for improved growth  fillet quality and disease resistance. Recent access to the genome sequence of rainbow trout []  genetic maps [  ]  and a medium-throughput genotyping chip [] of 57 501 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) offer new perspectives for research and organization of trout breeding programs  which may be more effective than those that are historically based on phenotypic or genealogical selection of the broodstock. Selective breeding can contribute to a significant decrease in the genetic variability of farmed populations  jeopardizing long-term genetic progress as well as reducing the adaptive capacities of populations in the event of a change in the environment []. Greater genetic variability within a population increases the likelihood that some of its individuals will have alleles that are better adapted to environmental fluctuations and are likely to survive and to transmit to their offspring alleles and favorable genetic characteristics. Selection  mutation  migration between populations and genetic drift constitute the different evolutionary forces that can create linkage disequilibrium (LD)  e.g. preferential association of alleles at different loci. The analysis of LD plays a central role in many areas of population genetics  including: the determination of genetic maps  ascertainment of levels of recombination at the population level  and estimation of effective population sizes (). The  of a population is a concept that was developed by Wright [] and defined as the size of an idealized population undergoing the same rate of genetic drift as the population under study. A number of methods to estimate  from demographic  pedigree  or molecular data have been proposed (e.g. Leroy et al. []). Most of the molecular estimates are derived from LD or temporal methods that give indirect estimators of  [] through the use of a genetic index: the squared correlation  of alleles at different gene loci using a single sample in the LD method or the standardized variance in allele frequency between two temporal samples in the temporal approach. The temporal method is based on the theory that  is the only parameter that is needed to determine rates of change in allele frequency at neutral loci in a population in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium []. The LD method of estimating   developed by Sved [] and modified by Hill []  is based on the principle that in closed finite populations in approximate drift–mutation–recombination equilibrium and constant census size  associations between alleles at different neutral loci are a function of the population’s . Therefore  if an estimate of the rate of recombination between loci is available   can be derived from the expected level of allele association across loci . The maintenance of genetic diversity within a population is achieved by maximizing   or equivalently  by minimizing the increase in inbreeding across generations. A molecular estimate of the inbreeding coefficient can be based on measuring long stretches of consecutive homozygous genotypes in each individual  the so-called runs of homozygosity (ROH; McQuillan et al. []). Long homozygous regions throughout the genome result from mating between close relatives  reduction in population size  and selection. Thus  population structure and selection effects can be assessed based on the distribution and location of ROH. Several studies have shown that characterizing inbreeding based on ROH provides a better measure of individual autozygosity because parents transmit identical haplotypes to their offspring than estimating overall inbreeding based on pedigree information  because kinships between base animals are not accounted for in pedigree files [  ]. In the present study  we used medium-density SNP chips to analyze the genetic diversity within and between six lines of rainbow trout. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of selection practices on genetic diversity through basic population indices and individual molecular genetics statistics. Our results may help to evaluate breeding practices in the light of the genetic evolution of farmed fish populations under selection. In addition  it provides commercial breeders a better understanding of the genetic composition of their selected lines and allows them to design and implement effective genomic breeding programs. The INRA synthetic line was initially developed by intercrossing several domesticated lines of rainbow trout in order to create a population with a large genetic variability. The line was constituted from a mixture of French farmed populations with some new introductions from Denmark and USA in the early 1980s. The population was then closed to outside germplasm  and has since been bred without any intentional selection in order to maintain genetic diversity using a full factorial mating design between 2-year-old breeding animals (about 60 dams and 80 sires  each year). Individuals genotyped for the current study were from the 2006 birth year class (SY)  and from the 2016 birth year class (SY) (Fig. ). Chronology of the breeding schemes that were set up for the six French rainbow trout lines In early 2008  the first generation of the Suave (SU) line was spawned from a full factorial cross among SY founder parents (32 dams and 44 sires). The SU line in the current study is the 5th generation of selection for survival and growth on a totally plant-based diet provided from first feeding []. Each generation of the SU line is created from a full factorial design between at least 40 dams and 45 sires. The selection is a sequential phenotypic selection: among the surviving animals  fish with the longest body length are selected through three to four selection events during the first year. The proportion of selected fish at each generation is around 4 to 5%. After the first three generations of selection  survival of SU fish was increased by 15% compared to SY fish and their final weight (at 197 days post-fertilization) was increased by 48% due to a 19% increase in feed intake when fish were fed a plant-based diet []. Breeding schemes for the four commercial lines (SA  SB  SC and SD) have been based on closed populations that were selected for at least five generations at the time the cohorts were sampled for the study. The samples represented the 5th  8th  9th and 10th generation of selection in SB  SC  SA and SD breeding companies  respectively (Fig. ). The history and the composition of these lines before the initiation of their structured selection program are unknown  however all four lines were created using sex-reversed males from INRA. The four commercial lines are reproduced by an artificial fertilization protocol to balance the contribution of each parent by partial factorial mating of 6 to 10 dams and 10 sires according to the PROSPER procedure []. Each spawn is subdivided in 10 subgroups  with each subgroup being fertilized by a different sire before recombining the dam subgroups. Each of the 10 sires is used to fertilize subgroups from 6 to 10 different dams. At eyed stage  similar numbers of eggs from each dam are mixed together to balance the maternal contributions in the fry rearing tank (effectively also balancing the contribution of each sire). This procedure is expected to minimize inbreeding  since a very large number of families per generation are then created (><U+2009>600) limiting the risk of mating related fish from the same full-or half-sib families []. Commercial lines are selected for growth traits (mainly weight and length at 18 months) by optimized within-group mass selection and a 3 to 10% selection pressure according to the PROSPER procedure []. To maintain the four commercial lines  a minimum number of broodstock (><U+2009>150) is selected at each generation. In addition  for the SA  SB and SC lines  a sib-based selection is performed based on carcass quality traits (carcass and fillet yields) assisted by ultrasound prediction [  ]. The management of inbreeding within these three lines has been based on DNA parentage assignment []  and has since been improved over the last 10 years by using an optimal pedigree-based selection strategy []. The 57 501 SNPs (57K SNP) Axiom Trout Genotyping array [] was used to genotype 302 females from six French lines of rainbow trout at the INRA genotyping Platform Gentyane. Animals were sampled to represent the genetic diversity of their birth cohorts by avoiding full-sib relationships for the three commercial lines with pedigree information available (SA  SB  SC). Among the genotyped animals  eight individuals with more than 45% identity-by-state (IBS) with another individual were removed from the INRA and SD populations for which pedigrees are unknown. In addition  four animals with less than 95% of the SNPs genotyped were removed from the study. After editing  290 genotyped animals were considered in the analysis  including 48  48  49  48  32  32 and 33 fish from SA  SB  SC  SD  SU  SY and SY lines  respectively. Quality control of SNPs was performed in several steps. First  all 57 501 SNP probes were positioned with a BLASTn procedure on the second genome assembly at the chromosome level Omyk_1.0 [  ] and only 50 820 SNPs with a unique position were retained. Although  is a diploid species  there is still residual tetraploidy in the 2.2 Gb of the rainbow trout genome due to the fourth round salmonid whole-genome duplication event that occurred approximatively 96 million years ago [  ]. In addition  intraspecific variation in diploid chromosome number (2n varying between 58 and 64) exists in rainbow trout []. The American reference genome is based on a set of 29 pairs of chromosomes. However  all six French lines are expected to carry a set of 30 pairs of chromosomes  the American Omy25 being split into two chromosomes (French Omy25a and Omy25b). Second  we used the Axiom Analysis Suite 2.0 software [] to control the quality of the remaining markers on a large dataset of 3418 genotyped individuals from the six French rainbow trout lines (including the 302 individuals of the current study). Edits consisted in discarding 7711 SNPs with probe polymorphism or a call rate lower than 97%; 2995 SNPs for which no homozygous individual was observed for the minor allele on the full genotyped set; and 1689 SNPs that were monomorphic in all lines. Third  regarding the genotypes for the remaining 38 425 SNPs  we performed a final quality control using PLINK v1.9 software [] on each line set considered in the current study. We discarded SNPs with a very significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) in one or several populations. Thus  only 38 350 SNPs remained for the analysis of genetic diversity between populations (PCA and  analysis). Finally  we only retained the SNPs that had a sufficiently high minor allele frequency (MAF) to obtain reasonable results for each of the analyses. For the ROH studies (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>1%)  34 077–37 340 SNPs were kept depending on the lines. For LD calculation (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>5%)  31 190–34 723 SNPs were considered depending on the lines (see Additional file : Table S1). Observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) for a population under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were derived with the PLINK v1.9 software []. Levels of genetic variation in the different lines were compared using a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test on Ho values. Genetic differentiation between populations was measured with pairwise  estimates []  using the VCFtools v0.1.13 software []. In addition  a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the R package Adegenet [] to visualize the genetic structure of the lines. To estimate LD  we used the squared correlation based on genotypic allele counts (number of non-reference alleles at each locus) using the PLINK v1.9 software []. This  value does not necessitate phasing  it is very similar to but not identical to the  estimate derived from haplotype frequencies []. Pairwise LD between adjacent SNPs and pairwise LD between all SNPs in a 60-Mb long window were derived for each chromosome and line. Mean  values were calculated for each chromosome and line by considering the following average distances between SNPs: 10 kb with a 20 kb-window; 50 kb and 100 kb with a 50 kb-window; 1  3  5  10 and 30 Mb within a 100-kb window for each distance. Two metrics were considered to estimate : () was based on LD and could be derived for all populations  whereas () was based on temporal changes in allele frequency and could therefore only be calculated for the SY and SU lines. For all populations   was derived using the formula proposed by Sved [] and based on the expected LD:  in which  is the distance in Morgan between SNPs. Estimating  by sampling from the populations produces another source of error []; consequently  for sample size   the formula is   which can be rearranged as: .  was estimated by transforming physical distance between SNPs into genetic distance   based on the genetic map recently established for a French rainbow trout population: 10 cM corresponded to six Mb on average across the 30 chromosomes []. We derived  at  past generations () based on the equation  based on the coalescent theory and the assumptions of Wright–Fisher model []  considering  as the mean  across all the chromosomes and all SNP pairs across a distance of . To derive mean   the window around  was determined for any  generation by considering the interval ]-<U+2009>0.5; t<U+2009>+<U+2009>0.5]; for instance at    averaged 33.3 Mb between SNPs with possible values ranging from 20 Mb () to 60 Mb (). For all populations   was calculated up to the 10th generation back. Standard errors for these  estimates were derived according to equations (5) and (6) of Hill [] considering the chromosome average  over all SNP pairs across a distance of  per chromosome. Second   was derived by considering the temporal approach [] and the formula proposed by Nei and Tajima []:   with  the standardized variance of allele frequency (corresponding to the Wright inbreeding coefficient)   and  sample sizes at generation 0 and   respectively.  was derived as  as proposed by Pollak [] and considering only two alleles per SNP  where  is the major allele frequency at generation 0 and  is the allele frequency at generation . Then   was averaged for all SNPs to estimate . ROH were identified for each fish within all lines using PLINK v1.9 []. ROH were defined by sliding windows with a minimum length of one Mb containing at least 30 homozygous SNPs. The maximum gap between two consecutive homozygous SNPs in a run was set to the default value of one Mb. To ensure that the low SNP density did not falsify ROH length  a minimum density of one SNP every 100 kb was also set (the median and average distances between adjacent SNPs across all the genomes were 31 and 56 kb  respectively). No more than five SNPs with missing genotypes were allowed per window and up to one possible heterozygous genotype was permitted per ROH. These parameters are common practice when deriving ROHs in animal livestock populations with 2–3 Gb genome sizes and 50 K SNP chips. In most studies  the minimum number of SNPs to constitute a ROH is in-between 20 and 50 [  ]. According to the formula proposed by Purfield et al. []  the minimum number of SNPs that constituted a ROH should be about 35 SNPs in each line in order to minimize the number of ROH that may occur only by chance in the SNP panel (accepting a 5% false positive rate). Mean number of ROH (N)  number of SNP per ROH (S)  length of ROH (L) and percentage of ROH segment longer or equal to 10 Mb were calculated per individual and line. To identify the genomic regions most commonly associated with ROH  the percentage of individuals with a SNP in a ROH segment was calculated by counting the number of times the SNP was detected in a ROH within the population. This count was plotted against the position of the SNP along the chromosome. Inbreeding coefficients () were calculated as the sum of ROH lengths of an individual divided by the total length of the autosomal genome covered by SNPs. The total size of the autosomal genome covered by SNPs was calculated within each line and chromosome. Genome regions with a gap between two adjacent SNPs larger than 1 Mb (authorized gap to derive a ROH) were deducted from the total size of the genome covered by SNPs. In addition  recent inbreeding () was derived as the sum of the lengths of ROH segments longer than 10 Mb in order to estimate inbreeding occurring within the last three generations (10 Mb<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.166 and ; therefore  generations for 10 Mb). Chromosome  was also derived as the sum of the lengths of ROH in a given chromosome of an individual divided by the total length of the chromosome genome covered by SNPs and then averaged for each line. When considering SNPs irrespective of their MAF  the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 33.5 to 35.3% (Table ). On average  values for Ho went up to 36.5 to 38.0% when only SNPs with a MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>5% within the population were considered (Table ). Frequencies at almost all loci were in agreement with Hardy–Weinberg expectations in each line  although  on average across all the SNPs the expected heterozygosity (He) tended to be one point below that of Ho in all selected populations. Kruskal–Wallis tests showed that there was a very significant difference in Ho (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001) between the lines when considering all SNPs and still some significant variation (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>1%) when considering SNPs with a MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>5%. Comparing the Ho values two-by-two showed that the commercial SA  SB and SC lines had significantly lower heterozygosity values than the SD and INRA experimental lines. Results showed moderate genetic differentiation between lines. Overall  10% of the total genetic variation is explained by the first two PCA axes (Fig. ). Except for the null differentiation between the two cohorts of the INRA unselected line (Table )   values ranged from 0.02 (SY–SU) to 0.15 (SA–SB). All commercial lines were moderately distant from each other with  ranging from 0.09 to 0.15. The SD line was the commercial line that was genetically the closest to the INRA SY line  whereas the SA and SB were the most distant. Principal component analysis plot of the genetic diversity between the French rainbow trout lines. PCA was performed with 290 individuals and 38 350 SNPs As expected  average  tended to decrease with increasing distance between pairs of SNPs in all the populations studied  the most rapid decline being over the first 100 kb (Fig. ). On average  LD decreased from 0.34 (0.30–0.39) to 0.25 (0.22–0.30)  0.23 (0.19–0.28)  0.16 (0.13–0.20)  0.10 (0.09–0.12) and 0.07 (0.07–0.09) for distances between markers of 10 kb  50 kb  100 kb  1 Mb  5 Mb and 10 Mb  respectively (see Additional file : Table S2). The unselected lines SY and SY and the commercial line SD had the lowest LD with an average  equal to 0.22 at 50 kb  whereas the selected lines SU  SC  SA and SB had corresponding  values of 0.25  0.27  0.27 and 0.30  respectively (see Additional file : Table S2). Linkage disequilibrium () decay with physical distance between markers in each of the six French rainbow trout lines Average  for the 50 kb-distant markers varied strongly between chromosomes: from 0.18 for Omy22 to 0.37 for Omy5 with an average value of 0.24 across chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S1). Within chromosome   varied also between lines: for Omy5  average  for 50 kb-distant markers varied from 0.34 for SY to 0.41 for the SU line; for Omy22   varied from 0.16 for SD to 0.22 for the SA and SB lines. For some other chromosomes  in particular for the sex chromosome Omy29  variation in average  was more important across lines: from 0.18 for SD to 0.31 for SB. The  of all lines showed a decreasing trend over the last 10 generations with a steeper slope for the INRA experimental lines and SD line (Fig. ) than for the four other lines.  stabilized during the last three generations for the SA  SB and SC lines and even started to increase for the last two generations for the SA and SB lines. LD-based estimates of effective population size () in the French rainbow trout lines over the last ten generations In the last generation ()   ranged from only 24 for the SU line to 48 for the SA and SY lines  with intermediate values of 37  38  39 and 42 for the SB  SD  SC and SY lines  respectively. For the experimental lines SU and SY  estimates of  in the last generation () due to variations in allele frequency were higher than estimates based on LD: 66 versus 24 and 216 versus 48 for the SU and SY lines  respectively (results not shown). Statistics concerning the average number and size of ROH segments per individual according to the lines are reported in Table S3 (see Additional file : Table S3). The average number of ROH per individual varied from 46 for the SY to 68 for the SA line. Individuals with the smallest number (25) and the largest number (90) of ROH belonged to the SY and SA lines  respectively. The average size of ROH varied from 3.84 Mb for SY to 5.38 Mb for SB. The proportion of long ROH (=<U+2009>10 Mb) varied from 7% for SY to nearly 14% for SB. Average  varied from 10.0% for SY to 19.5% for SB [Fig.  and Table S3 (see Additional file : Table S3)]. Individual  varied from 4.6 to 31.7% (Fig. ). Recent inbreeding () ranged from 2.9 for SY to 7.9% for SB [Fig.  and Table S3 (see Additional file : Table S3)]. Individual  varied from 0 to 22.9% for an individual in SY (Fig. ). An increase in inbreeding of 1 point (from 10 to 11% between SY and SY) was observed in the unselected SY line in five generations. All selected lines had higher average inbreeding levels than the unselected SY line  the highest levels for total (><U+2009>16%) and recent (><U+2009>5%) inbreeding being found for the SA  SB and SC lines that are selected based on pedigree information since seven  four and six generations  respectively. Box plots of total inbreeding () and recent inbreeding () for each rainbow trout line. Plain box: total inbreeding (); hatched box: recent inbreeding () Regarding  at the chromosome level (Fig. )  the mean  across lines ranged from 11% for Omy13 to 20% for Omy5 with an average of 14% across chromosomes. The highest mean  (30%) was observed for SA on Omy23 and the lowest value (4%) for SY on Omy3. Average  is sometimes relatively close from one line to another (for instance for Omy10  the lowest value is 11% for SD and the highest value is 17% for SB)  whereas variation in  is much larger for Omy23  from 7% for SY to 30% for SA. Box plots of the line averages of inbreeding coefficients () derived from ROH per chromosome Most of our rainbow trout populations were moderately differentiated according to the qualitative guidelines proposed by Wright [] for the interpretation of : 0–0.05 for little genetic differentiation  0.05–0.15 for moderate genetic differentiation  0.15–0.25 for large genetic differentiation  and above 0.25 for very large genetic differentiation  respectively. Little genetic differentiation (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.03) was observed between the SU and SY experimental lines  which is reasonable given that the SU selected line was derived from the SY line. The SD commercial line was also genetically close to the SY INRA lines  partly due to the fact that about 50% of the male founders of the SD line came from the INRA sex-reversed males  25 years ago. Although the other commercial lines are more distant from the INRA line than the SD line (Fig. )  it is also important to note that all of these four lines were created using sex-reversed males from INRA. Among all the selected lines   values were quite similar to the observed differentiation levels between Chinese or Western pigs breeds []  European cattle breeds [  ] or sheep breeds [  ]. As far as we know  only one  study has been performed for rainbow trout based on a panel of 99 SNPs [] and found a global F of 0.13 across eight commercial lines and a pairwise F between any two lines ranging from 0.056 to 0.195. Some older works based on microsatellites [  ] or allozymes [] also indicated a moderate degree of differentiation among wild population and/or farmed stock rainbow trout lines. One way to assess the genetic diversity within populations is through observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity. We believe that these parameters should be derived without setting a threshold MAF value in order to keep all SNPs in the analysis and avoid any bias. In this way  we estimated an Ho of about 34% (±<U+2009>1%); however  most of studies in the literature give results for a subset of SNPs with MAF above 5%. We also calculated Ho under this MAF threshold and found values close to 37% in all lines  which are very similar to the values estimated in pig lines [] or cattle breeds []. Based on allozyme markers  Cárcamo et al. [] indicated that commercial lines of rainbow trout showed a similar range of variation in heterozygosity to that of wild populations. In our study  we observed a slight heterozygosity excess (Ho<U+2009>><U+2009>He) with a large set of neutral loci for all lines. This observation may indicate a recent (<<U+2009>100 generations) bottleneck [] that is likely due to the recent domestication and selection process. The LD at short distances between markers (=<U+2009>100 kb) is very similar to  values reported for dairy cattle breeds [] and slightly higher than values reported for beef cattle breeds or sheep breeds []; however  LD estimates for our trout lines at short distances are lower than in most pig breeds [  ]. At longer distances between markers (e.g.<U+2009>~<U+2009>1 Mb)  LD in French rainbow trout lines (0.13–0. 20) is clearly higher than in ruminant breeds  but very similar to the LD observed in most pig breeds. This high LD  even at long distances  enables accurate genomic predictions for rainbow trout populations even with low density SNP chips []. Similar values of  using long distance windows (5 Mb) were observed between the French rainbow trout lines and an American commercial line of rainbow trout []  with a similar large variation in average  among chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S1)  i.e. very high  values on Omy5 and very low values on Omy21 and Omy22. The higher than average LD on Omy5 is likely caused by a large chromosomal double-inversion of 56 Mb []  which prevents recombination in fish. This double-inversion contains key genes involved in photosensory processes  circadian rhythm  adiposity  and sexual differentiation []. This inversion is shown to mediate sex-specific migration through sex-dependent dominance. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for spawning date and body weight have been detected on Omy5 [] and may also explain the high LD because of selection of favorable haplotypes for these important traits for breeding. Furthermore  Omy5 is one major exception to the strong association observed between large metacentric chromosomes and high female:male recombination rate ratios []. In addition to having an equal female:male recombination rate ratio (average 9:1 ratio for metacentric chromosomes)  there is evidence that the short arm of Omy5 is the homeologous linkage group to the Omy29 []  sex chromosome for which we observed a large variation of  values among lines. The estimates of  for the selected lines were consistent with the reports in other aquaculture species such as the Pacific abalone []  catfish []  Atlantic salmon [] for which  was less than 50 after a few generations of mass selection. The  across many livestock breeds is less than 100 [    ]. Nevertheless  large and ongoing genetic gains for production traits are typically achieved in livestock  and there are no apparent signs of reaching selection plateaus []. Across both domestic and wild populations  the minimal  to avoid inbreeding depression in the short term has been estimated to be at least 50 []. For instance  in a long-term (120 generations) selection experiment in mice  several lines were kept at an average  of 60 with no apparent inbreeding problems []. In the ideal scenario  population genetics theory recommends keeping equal numbers of males and females and maintaining a constant population size over time. However in most livestock breeding programs  it is often impossible to maintain a 1:1 sex ratio  which greatly affects the  of a population. In the trout lines under study  the dams-sires ratios are relatively well balanced with values ranging from 6:10 to 10:10. In fish  an additional explanation for the small  may be asymmetric reproduction  e.g. high variance in individual reproductive success or survival rate of broodstock []. This last phenomenon has been described as “sweepstakes reproductive success” (SRS [])  which maintains much less genetic diversity than expected on the basis of a large census size  and would increase the impact of inbreeding depression for aquaculture farms. Christie et al. [] found in their review of salmon species that early-generation hatchery fish averaged only half the reproductive success of their wild-origin counterparts when spawning in the wild. For   the ratio of  to the estimated census population size () was estimated to range from 0.09 to 0.18 []  0.17 to 0.40 []  and a 0.45 []  with a large variance in reproductive success among individuals being the key factor to reduce the  ratio in salmonid species []. Fish breeding from multigenerational hatchery program without pedigree information resulted in a decrease in   not only by decreasing the mean reproductive success but also by increasing the variance in reproductive success among breeding parents  whereas there was no reduction in  found in fish breeds for a single generation in a local hatchery []. Intense directional selection of relatively few animals often results in a skewed genetic contribution and may explain why  values less than 100 are observed for many livestock populations. In our study  the impact of intense selection can be quantified by comparing the evolution of  between the SU and SY lines  but also by taking into account that  is affected by the smaller number of broodstock used for SU than for SY breeding. Based on LD values   at  generation was estimated to be equal to 24 and 48 for those two lines  respectively. The discrepancy was even greater when considering estimates of  based on allele frequency variation  66 for the SU line and 216 for the SY line. Due to the existence of two major inversions [] on Omy5 and Omy20 that may influence our LD-based analysis (and to a lower extent the ROH)  we removed these chromosomes from the derivation of  and . Values for total  and recent inbreeding were almost unchanged  but  estimates were very sensitive to the absence of Omy5 and Omy20 although  values were averaged per chromosome before deriving . Removing these chromosomes increases our estimates of  across all lines  on average by 40% at generation  and by 14% at generation  (see Additional file : Table S4). However  LD-based estimates of  remained small for all the lines compared to census sizes that were close to 200 for all commercial lines  140 for the SY line and 80 for the SU line. Regardless of the line considered in the study (selected or not)  we observed that in general  tended to decrease in the last 10 generations  which may be explained by drift and SRS phenomena. It should also be noted that in the three selected lines (SA  SB and SC) for which a mating optimization procedure to limit inbreeding was set up in the last 10 years by SYSAAF   stabilized (SC) or even slightly increased (SA and SB) in the last three generations. This suggests that some mating optimization protocol (genomic-based pedigree) should be similarly introduced to limit the inbreeding increases in the SD  SU and SY lines. In addition to quantifying the important decreases in  due to selection  our results underscored the difficulty in acquiring accurate estimates for this parameter  since estimates based on the same molecular information can be doubled or tripled depending on the evolutionary model considered []. It is well-established that better estimates of inbreeding levels and  are obtained using molecular rather than genealogical information []  at least when considering more than 10K SNPs []. In most cases  a full-depth pedigree is unavailable and most base populations include selected or partially inbred founders in the pedigree files. These unknown relationships between animals may lead to strong underestimation of the pedigree-based estimates of inbreeding []. In addition  by considering complete pedigree back to a base population in simulation studies  Liu et al. [] and Forutan et al. [] reported that pedigree-based estimates of inbreeding were lower than true inbreeding in selected populations. The pedigree-based inbreeding assumes neutral loci  i.e. that the two alleles at the same locus on two homologous chromosomes have an equal chance of being selected. In reality  for some loci  the two alleles may have different effects on a naturally or artificially selected trait  which leads to unequal selection probabilities between the two alleles. Most methods applied to infer  from genomic population data rely on the Wright–Fisher model’s assumptions of low fecundity non-skewed offspring distributions. Although proven to be robust to violations of most of these assumptions  these methods drastically failed to approximate the genealogies of species with high SRS  whereby few individuals contribute most of the offspring to the next generation []. As stated by Montano []  the development of statistical tools based on models that consider SRS will substantially improve estimates of population demographic parameters. The majority of metrics to estimate  assumes that the value remains constant across the genome. However   varies across the genome  such that some regions have an increased loss of diversity compared with others [  ]. The  is expected to vary across the genome as a consequence of genetic hitchhiking due to selection [] and negative selection acting on deleterious mutations (i.e.  background selection []). The action of selection  particularly in regions of the genome with low rates of recombination  is expected to reduce   leading to lower levels of genetic diversity and reduced effectiveness of selection. We could have derived  per chromosome based on chromosome-specific LD estimates; however  we preferred to study the heterogeneity of genetic diversity throughout the genome using ROH because  estimates have been proven unreliable for fish populations (see previous section)  and quantifying the absolute level of inbreeding (in total and for each chromosome) in our rainbow trout lines was per se an objective of the study. ROH can be used to directly estimate inbreeding depression [] and can identify the chromosome regions that are responsible for inbreeding depression along the genome []. While for selected rainbow trout lines   varied between 12 and nearly 20%  estimates were a bit lower (~<U+2009>11%) for the INRA unselected line. These results are consistent with our  estimates for three to ten generations ago: the SY and SD lines had the largest  and the lowest  whereas SB had the smallest  and the highest  (Pearson correlation  and : -<U+2009>0.90  p value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.005). It is difficult to compare our results to other broodstock programs because the few published estimations of levels of inbreeding for fish commercial populations are all based on pedigree information  and thus are likely to be underestimated due to unknown relationships and inbreeding in the base populations. In rainbow trout  Pante et al. [] estimated inbreeding levels that varied between 3 and 10% at the 6th generation of selection for three commercial populations. A hierarchical mating system was used (one male mated to two to three females) with a very variable number of families from one generation to another; full-sib and half-sib matings were avoided and matings that would yield inbreeding coefficients of 12.5% or more were restricted. In Coho salmon  Myers et al. [] reported inbreeding levels of about 15–16% in two lines after the 9th and 10 generations of the Domsea selection program based on a circular mating design with 60 families produced at each generation []. More recently  in two different lines of Coho salmon  Yáñez et al. [] estimated inbreeding levels at 5 and 7% after 6 and 7 generations of selection  respectively  under a hierarchical design (one male mated to three to five females) with 100 families produced at each generation and inbreeding controlled by avoiding half- and full-sib matings. While empirical information on genome-wide diversity in model species and livestock has been collected  we still lack a clear picture for farmed fish of the heterogeneity of genetic diversity across the genome. As far as we know  our study is the first to calculate ROH and estimate  in any fish species.  estimates from this study were higher than estimates for terrestrial livestock regardless of their breeding management (in breeds for ruminants or in lines for pigs). Estimates varied from 3 to 9% in dairy cattle breeds [    ]  from 2 to 11% in sheep breeds [  ] and from 3 to 11% in pig lines [    ]. Although the SY line is not under selective breeding  inbreeding is relatively high (11%) and has increased by 1% in six generations (see Additional file : Table S3). This is probably partly due to a founder effect as well as to SRS  as previously discussed for . In spite of the existence of mating plans for selected lines with known pedigree (SA  SB and SC)  recent inbreeding is relatively high in these lines (5–8%). Nevertheless  we may be able to manage their genetic diversity along the entire genome. Because no ROH fragments are fixed within the populations (see Additional file : Figure S2)  we can develop selection and mating strategies to specifically limit inbreeding in genome regions for which an important proportion of individuals (><U+2009>50% for instance) share the same ROH. It is worthwhile to underscore that  estimates may vary depending on the parameters considered to define ROH segments. These parameters have to be tuned according to marker density and pan-genomic heterogeneity and the level of recombination along the genome. There is no clear consensus in the literature on how to choose these parameters and most studies used Plink default values. In a recent study []  a gene-dropping simulation was performed and inbreeding estimates based on ROH and pedigree data were compared to true inbreeding. Inbreeding based on ROH was estimated using different software and different threshold parameters using 50 K chip data. While pedigree inbreeding underestimated true inbreeding  using ROH with a minimum window size of 20 to 50 SNPs provided the closest estimates to true inbreeding regardless of the software [  ]. In our study  we observed that inbreeding estimates were similar for window sizes of 30 and 50 SNPs  and estimates were almost identical when considering recent inbreeding (results not shown). Nevertheless the results were sensitive to the maximum gap between two successive SNPs (1000 kb vs. 250 kb) and  to a lesser extent  to the MAF threshold (see Additional file : Table S3). Due to the heterogeneity of the marker density along the genome  long ROH were fragmented into smaller ones when considering a maximum gap of 250 kb  leading to underestimated  in our lines. The largest differences were for recent inbreeding estimates    that were less than 1% for the gap threshold of 250 kb  but varied between 3 and almost 8% for the 1000 kb threshold (see Additional file : Table S3). As shown in previous studies on the sheep genome [    ]  we observed a strong variation in  values among chromosomes  these results being consistent with variation in LD among chromosomes. Chromosome ends are less represented in ROH segments (results not shown)  probably due to the very low marker density in these areas. Hotspot areas for ROH were observed for each chromosome (see Additional file : Figure S2). In general  these areas and the proportions of individuals within a population that shared ROH hotspots in those areas were highly variable from one line to another. Nevertheless a few hotspot areas were commonly detected across lines  such as the position at<U+2009>~<U+2009>48 Mb of Omy10 (see Additional file : Figure S3). At this specific position  is located a QTL for bacterial cold disease resistance that was detected in an American rainbow trout population [] and in a French commercial line []. When hotspot areas are common to different lines  they may be due to local low recombination rates [] or to key genes for domestication or production [    ]. These hotspot areas could then help identify important genes for domestication or production. The accumulation of inbreeding is heterogeneous across the genome  such that certain regions are being inbred at a faster rate than other regions of the genome. Currently  SNP information is predominantly used to predict breeding values for genomic selection in livestock populations  now including farmed fish (catfish  tilapia and salmonids). However  this information could also be used to manage the rate at which inbreeding builds up in the genome of livestock populations. Characterizing and efficiently managing inbreeding levels is a major goal to ensure that populations can adapt to future breeding goals while maintaining genetic diversity and avoiding the accumulation of detrimental effects associated with inbreeding. Identifying the main regions of the genome that contribute to inbreeding depression may help to manage inbreeding not only at the individual level but directly at the genome level. Our findings provide the breeding companies a better understanding of the genetic diversity in their rainbow trout lines in order to implement efficient breeding programs. The availability of a genome-wide SNP chip allowed us to characterize genetic diversity between and within lines. Lines are moderately differentiated across commercially developed trout lines  with similar  values as those reported across ruminant breeds or pig lines. Within each line  effective population size seems rather small and inbreeding levels are higher than in terrestrial livestock selected populations. This may be explained by founder effects  sweepstakes reproductive success  and intense selection in some lines. The impact of these significant levels of inbreeding on rainbow trout performance should be quantified in order to assess potential inbreeding depression phenomena and risks for future genetic gains. The levels of molecular inbreeding derived from the identification of homozygous genomic segments could also be used to directly identify the regions that are responsible for inbreeding depression along the genome. We could then expect a more efficient purging allowing for higher relatedness between selected individuals without inbreeding drawbacks in breeding programs. The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available because they belong to commercial breeding companies but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request and with permission of the relevant companies.

Cuticle-specific staining and in situ absorbance measurements have been used to quantify cuticle deposition in several pure breeds of chicken. For brown eggs  a pre-stain and a post-stain absorbance measurement is required to correct for intrinsic absorption by the natural pigment. For white eggs  a post-stain absorbance measurement alone is sufficient to estimate cuticle deposition. The objective of the research was to estimate genetic parameters and provide data to promote adoption of the technique to increase cuticle deposition and reduce vertical transmission of microorganisms.ResultsFor all pure breeds examined here  i.e. Rhode Island Red  two White Leghorns  White Rock and a broiler breed  the estimate of heritability for cuticle deposition from a meta-analysis was moderately high (0.38<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04). In the Rhode Island Red breed  the estimate of the genetic correlation between measurements recorded at early and late times during the egg-laying period was<U+2009>~<U+2009>1. There was no negative genetic correlation between cuticle deposition and production traits. Estimates of the genetic correlation of cuticle deposition with shell color ranged from negative values or 0 in brown-egg layers to positive values in white- or tinted-egg layers. Using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan in the cuticle proteins to quantify the amount of cuticle deposition failed because of complex quenching processes. Tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 330 nm was moderately heritable  but there was no evidence of a non-zero genetic correlation with cuticle deposition. This was complicated furthermore by a negative genetic correlation of fluorescence with color in brown eggs  due to the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by energy transfer to protoporphyrin pigment. We also confirmed that removal of the cuticle increased reflection of ultraviolet wavelengths from the egg.ConclusionsThese results provide additional evidence for the need to incorporate cuticle deposition into breeding programs of egg- and meat-type birds in order to reduce vertical and horizontal transmission of potentially pathogenic organisms and to help improve biosecurity in poultry."

Cuticle-specific staining and in situ absorbance measurements have been used to quantify cuticle deposition in several pure breeds of chicken. For brown eggs  a pre-stain and a post-stain absorbance measurement is required to correct for intrinsic absorption by the natural pigment. For white eggs  a post-stain absorbance measurement alone is sufficient to estimate cuticle deposition. The objective of the research was to estimate genetic parameters and provide data to promote adoption of the technique to increase cuticle deposition and reduce vertical transmission of microorganisms. For all pure breeds examined here  i.e. Rhode Island Red  two White Leghorns  White Rock and a broiler breed  the estimate of heritability for cuticle deposition from a meta-analysis was moderately high (0.38<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04). In the Rhode Island Red breed  the estimate of the genetic correlation between measurements recorded at early and late times during the egg-laying period was<U+2009>~<U+2009>1. There was no negative genetic correlation between cuticle deposition and production traits. Estimates of the genetic correlation of cuticle deposition with shell color ranged from negative values or 0 in brown-egg layers to positive values in white- or tinted-egg layers. Using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan in the cuticle proteins to quantify the amount of cuticle deposition failed because of complex quenching processes. Tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 330 nm was moderately heritable  but there was no evidence of a non-zero genetic correlation with cuticle deposition. This was complicated furthermore by a negative genetic correlation of fluorescence with color in brown eggs  due to the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by energy transfer to protoporphyrin pigment. We also confirmed that removal of the cuticle increased reflection of ultraviolet wavelengths from the egg. These results provide additional evidence for the need to incorporate cuticle deposition into breeding programs of egg- and meat-type birds in order to reduce vertical and horizontal transmission of potentially pathogenic organisms and to help improve biosecurity in poultry. The cuticle is a very thin and invisible layer that is deposited on the outside of the egg [] [for an illustration (see Additional file : Figure S1)] and  therefore  there are few studies on this component of the biology of the egg  although it serves an important function. By filling the gas exchange pores  the cuticle prevents bacterial contamination of the egg contents [  ]. The more pronounced deposition of cuticle on the eggshells of aquatic birds [  ]  which are faced with significant microbial challenges  is evolutionary evidence that the trait is important for protection of the egg in dirty environments [] and is genetically controlled. More directly  in a previous study on Rhode Island Red hens  we demonstrated that the size of the genetic component for deposition of cuticle on the eggs was substantial []. In that study  we used quantification of a cuticle-specific stain to measure cuticle deposition using reflectance spectroscopy. The staining is related to protein quantity []  which is linearly related to the depth of the protein layer  as determined by microscopy []. More importantly  for a functional application  we observed that within the normal range of variation in cuticle deposition  there was a significant effect on bacterial penetration of eggs [  ]  with bacteria almost never penetrating eggs that had the most cuticle deposition  whereas those with a poor cuticle were frequently penetrated. We extended these studies to include more breeds of chicken (layers and broilers) and strains of bacteria [] and obtained results that are consistent with the observation that complete removal of the cuticle increases both water and particle penetration [  ]. Vertical and horizontal transmission of bacteria in chickens can threaten embryo development and compromise biosecurity [  ]  thus improving cuticle deposition on eggs is a potentially worthwhile breeding goal for commercial poultry since it could reduce pathogen entry. Improving the egg’s natural barrier to microbial entry will strengthen and be complementary to the already large physical separation that exists in the poultry industry between offspring and parent from the use of artificial incubation of eggs. This separation is arguably one of the keys to the biosecurity of commercial production. In our previous work on the Rhode Island Red breed  we estimated the heritability for cuticle deposition at only one time-point during the hen’s productive life []. It is also unclear how widely selection for cuticle deposition could be applicable  for example in broiler production. Furthermore  although there is a widespread belief that egg color and cuticle deposition may be associated []  our previous study found only a small negative genetic correlation between these two traits [] and failed to show any physiological relationship or dependence between egg color and cuticle deposition []. Thus  the aim of the current study was to improve confidence in the measurement of cuticle deposition as a tool for genetic selection  by both replicating and extending our previous findings  by extending the analyses to a White Leghorn (white-egg layer) and a broiler meat-type breed. These breeds have very different genetic backgrounds and can be clearly separated by DNA analyses []. In addition  the predictive ability of a measure of cuticle deposition  which is recorded early in the laying period  on future performance was investigated. This knowledge would be valuable to geneticists since (1) qualitatively  it would demonstrate that cuticle deposition is an attribute of a hen’s whole productive lifetime rather than of a short interval within it  and (2) quantitatively  it would reduce the number of measurements that need to be made during a lifetime. Developing a method that requires less specialized equipment or simplifies the measurement of cuticle deposition is also important for incorporating this trait into standard breeding practices. This was explored by comparing single wavelength absorbance with results from a Minolta colorimeter  and by measuring the auto-fluorescence of cuticle proteins under UV excitation  which would avoid the need for staining. We used five breeds of chicken to determine genetic parameters that are relevant to the suitability of the trait for selection. Hens for breed 1 originated from a single generation of the Rhode Island Red (RIR) breed  which is a pure breed laying brown eggs and a contributor to the male that was used to produce the Lohmann Brown commercial layers (Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH  Germany). The populations used in our study were from a later generation of the line that was studied previously [    ]  and comprised 1262 females from three hatches  which were the offspring of 48 sires and 330 dams. Between 17 and 18 weeks of age  hens were housed in cages prior to commencement of egg laying  with a controlled regime of 16 h of light per day. Two eggs per hen were collected between 30 and 32 weeks of age (referred to as 31 weeks throughout this paper) for cuticle deposition determination  and again at 50 weeks of age. Hens from breed 2 originated from two separate and closed pure lines (2A and 2B) of the White Leghorn (WL) breed  which lay white eggs and contribute to the breeding of commercial Lohmann Selected Layers (LSL; Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH  Germany). Breed 2B hens came from later generations of the same genetic line that was previously studied for bone traits []  whereas breed 2A hens had not been studied previously. Breed 2A comprised 915 females  which were the offspring of 46 sires and 345 dams from two hatches and were housed in three huts at the same location. Breed 2B comprised 994 females  which were the offspring of 92 sires and 576 dams from a single hatch  and were housed in one hut at the same location. All hens were housed in individual cages from 17 to 18 weeks of age  with a regime of 16 h of light per day prior to commencement of egg laying. Two eggs per hen were collected for cuticle deposition determination  at 32 weeks of age for breed 2A and at 28 to 29 weeks of age for breed 2B (referred to as 29 weeks throughout this paper). This population was a pure broiler breed that lays tinted eggs and contributes to the breeding of meat-type poultry (Aviagen  Scotland). The hens were from a single generation and comprised 1459 females from 13 flocks  which were the offspring of 152 sires and 518 dams. Hens were reared in pens with a single male and the source of each egg was ascertained from nest box recording. Two eggs per hen were collected at 39 weeks of age for cuticle deposition determination. This population comprised hens from a single generation of White Rock (WR)  which is a pure breed laying brown eggs and contributing to the female used to produce Lohmann Brown commercial layers (Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH  Germany). The population included 1374 females  which were the offspring of 67 sires and 521 dams and were housed in cages in one hut at the same location. Two eggs per bird were collected  between 60 and 63 weeks of age  for cuticle deposition determination (referred to as 62 weeks of age throughout this paper). Cuticle deposition was measured after staining with a combination of tartrazine and lissamine green []. For breeds 1  2A  and 3  we used a commercial preparation (MST Cuticle Blue  M.S. Technologies Ltd  England) []  whereas for breeds 2B and 4  we prepared the staining solution as described in []. A photograph that illustrates the different levels of cuticle staining is in Figure S2 (see Additional file : Figure S2). For eggs with the best cuticle  the staining is strong and regular over the whole surface  whereas for eggs with a poor cuticle  the staining is predominately very weak. During the course of this project  the technology was progressively improved to accelerate data acquisition  but the basic principle remained the same throughout. The amount of light absorbed at 640 nm by the cuticle-bound tartrazine and lissamine green stain was used as the gold standard for cuticle deposition. Absorbance at 640 nm was measured using reflectance spectrometry on the intact egg prior to staining (Pre-stain Abs@640 nm) and after staining (Post-stain Abs@640 nm)  and the difference before and after staining (<U+0394>Abs @640 nm) was used to estimate cuticle deposition []. The Pre-stain Abs@640 nm is a measure of the depth of ‘brown-ness’ in the pigmentation of the eggshell  as the peak of protoporphyrin absorbance is around 644 nm []  and this peak in absorbance is clearly demonstrated in a transmission scan of brown eggs []. For all breeds  two eggs per hen were used to estimate cuticle deposition but only one measurement per egg was recorded since within-egg variance was small []. The data from breed 2A showed that variation in the Pre-stain Abs@640 nm measurement was negligible (<<U+2009>0.009) compared to that in Post-stain Abs@640 nm  thus no Pre-stain Abs@640 nm measurement was recorded for breed 2B and the post-stain measurement was used as the value of <U+0394>Abs@640 nm. In other words for white eggs we assumed the Pre-stain Abs@640 nm was zero. For breed 1  measurements were recorded with a USB4000-VIS–NIR spectrometer coupled to an ISP-REF integrating sphere and the data were collected using the Oceanview spectroscopy software (Ocean Optics  Oxford  England). For breeds 2A and 3  we used a custom-made stand-alone device  the EggometerV2  which is based on the same methodology as the spectrometer but has an improved speed of data acquisition and robustness. The EggometerV2 combined a tungsten halogen light source (Ocean Optics  Oxford  England)  a custom-made optical-fiber reflectance probe (Ocean Optics  Oxford  England)  and a fiber-coupled spectrometer (FLAME-S-UV–VIS-ES  Ocean Optics  Oxford  England) that was optimized for the visible spectrum. For breeds 2B and 4  we used an Ecutimeter 3 (Lomond Instruments  Kinross  Scotland)  which is a next-generation prototype with custom software for rapid  automated data collection and reporting of parameters such as absorbance at a particular wavelength  in this case at 640 nm. In addition  among other refinements  the Ecutimeter 3 incorporates a silica window to protect the probe tip and allow easy cleaning. For all breeds  the instruments were calibrated using a WS-1 diffuse reflectance PTFE standard (Ocean optics  Oxford  England). Absorbance (A) is a unit-less measurement and was calculated as   where  is the reflectance expressed relative to the WS-1 white standard. As a possible alternative to staining and measurement at 640 nm  the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence was measured on eggs obtained from breed 1 (both ages)  2A  and 3  by using a custom-built fluorimeter. The fluorimeter employed an epifluorescence excitation/detection geometry  which uses the same objective lens to focus excitation light onto the sample and collect the emitted fluorescence. The excitation source was a 290-nm fiber-coupled LED (Ocean Optics  Oxford  England) and the spectrum of the emitted fluorescence (with emission maximum at 330 nm) was measured by a fiber-coupled spectrometer (FLAME-S-UV-VIS-ES  Ocean Optics  Oxford  England). For one batch of 48 eggs from breed 1  we performed UV reflectance measurements to determine the absorbance at 290 nm of the cuticle and the underlying shell matrix. Measurements were made on unstained eggs  using the same optical system as in the Ecutimeter 3 (described above)  but with the tungsten-halogen source replaced by the 290-nm LED. The absorbance at 290 nm was measured on the intact egg with respect to the WS-1 reflectance standard  and then on the same egg after removal of the cuticle. For both steps  three measurements were recorded in the area around the egg’s equator and averaged. The difference before and after removing the cuticle corresponds to the absorbance of the cuticle. L*a*b* scores were available for hens from breeds 1 and 2A. These traits were measured at Lohmann Tierzucht by using a Minolta colorimeter (Konica Minolta  Langenhagen  Germany) on a single egg that had been laid by the same hens as those contributing to this study  although the age of the hens at which eggs were laid differed  i.e. either 35 or 48 weeks of age. The colorimeter measured: (1) the luminance  L*  which ranges from dark to light; (2) the color on the green–red axis  a*  which ascends to ‘more red’; (3) the color on the blue-yellow axis  b*  which ascends to ‘more yellow’ []; (4) a combination L*a*b* score  which provides a numerical value for the perceived color that was made to have a positive sign for the desired breeding direction using the following equations  i.e. darker for brown eggs (100<U+2009>-<U+2009>L*<U+2009>+<U+2009>a*<U+2009>+<U+2009>b*) and lighter for white eggs (L*<U+2009>+<U+2009>a*<U+2009>-<U+2009>2b*); and the (5) ‘shininess’  i.e. the relative surface gloss or matt appearance of brown eggs  which derives from the amounts of light diffused or reflected back to the colorimeter []. Shininess was only available for breed 1 at 35 weeks of age. In addition  a subjectively scored dark brown spots (speckles) on the eggshell surface were measured on the same egg Minolta colorimetry  it is a subjective score ranging from 1 (many and big dark spots) to 9 (no spots). Traits related to production were available for breeds 1 and 2A and included: total egg production over the production period; egg weight  shape index  and mottling; body weight and feed intake at 30 weeks of age; and the breaking strength of eggs  measured at 35 and 48 weeks of age  using quasi-static compression at the poles. The methods used to make these measurements have been described previously [  ] and were analyzed in the same way as the other traits as described in the statistical methods below. All analyses were carried out using mixed linear models fitted in R using the ASReml R-4 plug-in (VSN International  Hemel Hempstead  UK). Models were fitted separately within each breed. Multivariate models were used  for which a bivariate example is presented in the following. The model had the following terms: where  and  are column vectors of two traits (where  and  are taken from the traits described in the above sections ‘Measurement of stained cuticle’  ‘Fluorescence and UV absorption measurement’  ‘Color shininess traits measured by Minolta colorimetry’ and ‘Production traits’);  and  are their respective means with  a column vector of 1’s;  and  are additional fixed effects for hatches or flocks or tiers according to the design for each breed  with  and  their respective design matrices;  and  are vectors of breeding values for the traits  with  and  their respective design matrices; and  and  are the residual errors. The fixed effects in addition to the mean were 2 degrees of freedom (df) per trait for breed 1  1 df per trait for breed 2A  2 df per trait for breed 4  and 12 df for breed 3. There were no additional fixed effects for breed 2B. The breeding values  were assumed distributed as   where  is the numerator relationship matrix generated from the pedigree (the depth of the pedigree for Breed 1  2A  2B and 4 was 5 generations; breed 3 it was 7 generations)  and  is a  matrix of genetic (co)variances; for  traits   was . For elements of   the genetic variance for trait  is denoted  and the covariance between traits  and  is   where  is their additive genetic correlation. The residuals  were assumed distributed as   where  is the identity matrix and  is a  matrix (or  for  traits). For elements of   the residual variance for trait  is denoted  and the covariance between traits  and  is   where  is their environmental correlation. For trait  the phenotypic variance was calculated as  and the heritability was calculated as . Preliminary analyses showed no evidence (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) of maternal effects associated with the dams of the hens that laid the eggs. Hypothesis testing was conducted using maximum likelihood ratio tests for H:  against the alternative H:  and  where appropriate  for H:  against the alternative H: . For these tests  the critical value of  was adjusted following Self and Laing [] since the null hypotheses lie on the boundaries. When  was close to 1 (or bound by ASReml to 1)  the 95% support interval for  was calculated as the set of values of  for which the drop in 2  log-likelihood from its maximum value was less than the 95%-ile of . Our approach for analyzing the many traits that were measured across several breeds was to assess the relevant genetic and environmental parameters in three steps: (1) estimate the parameters for the Pre-stain Abs@640 nm  Post-stain Abs@640 nm  and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm for each breed; since these three traits are linearly dependent  the results were obtained by fitting a bivariate model for two traits and deriving the parameters involving the third trait algebraically within ASReml; (2) test the hypothesis that tryptophan fluorescence could replace staining measures by estimating the parameters that relate fluorescence at 330 nm to the ‘gold standard’ <U+0394>Abs@640 nm and the potential confounder Pre-stain Abs@640 nm; these parameters were obtained from a tri-variate model; and finally  (3)  explore the use of Minolta colorimetry by estimating correlations of traits from the colorimeter with <U+0394>Abs@640 nm and Pre-stain Abs@640 nm using a series of tri-variate and quadri-variate analyses. Furthermore  the data from a flock of White Leghorn hens at the Roslin Institute were used to obtain a phenotypic predictor of <U+0394>Abs@640 nm based on L*  a* and b* using multiple linear regression which is described in detail in Additional file . The predictor was used as a trait () in analyses for heritability and genetic correlation. Meta-analyses [] were used in steps (1) and (2) to summarize the variation in the parameter estimates obtained from the five breeds. To simplify the presentation of the results from step (3) for breed 1 (RIR)  correlations between traits were estimated using the simple average of the values measured at the two ages  see the Results section and (Additional file : Tables S1 and S2)  and provide evidence that this latter approach was reasonable because the genetic correlation was not distinguishable from 1. Summary statistics related to cuticle measurement for each breed are in Table  and graphs of the distribution of Pre-stain Abs@640 nm and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm are in Figure S3 (see Additional file : Figure S3). Variation in Pre-stain Abs@640 nm was very small for breed 2A  with the whiteness of the egg being ‘whiter’ than the standard used. For breed 1  phenotypic standard deviations for measurements at the two ages recorded were very similar. Evidence of genetic variation  i.e.   was found for all 640-nm traits and for all breeds (see Table ). Estimates of heritability for Pre-stain Abs@640 nm traits differed between breeds (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  with breeds 1 (31 weeks) and 2A exhibiting much lower estimates than the other breeds  which had estimates in excess of 0.5. These differences were not associated with either egg color or the instrument used. Although the value of  is population-specific  the meta-analysis detected no statistical evidence of heterogeneity among breeds (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) in the  estimates for Post-stain Abs@640 nm and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm. For breed 1  estimates of  for <U+0394>Abs@640 nm at the two ages were similar  but estimates differed more for Pre-stain Abs@640 nm. Summary estimates of  from the meta-analysis across breeds were equal to 0.43 (SE 0.04) for Pre-stain Abs@640 nm and 0.38 (SE 0.04) for <U+0394>Abs@640 nm. Among breeds  the highest estimate of  for <U+0394>Abs@640 nm was from breed 2B (0.53  SE 0.10; WL at 29 weeks) and the lowest from breed 4 (0.26  SE 0.06; WR at 62 weeks). There was no evidence of maternal effects from the dam of the hen laying the egg on <U+0394>Abs@640 nm in any of the breeds studied. Estimates of genetic and environmental correlations for measurement of a trait over the period-of-lay for the same bird were based on repeated measurements at 31 and 50 weeks in breed 1 (RIR) and are in Table . Estimates of the genetic correlation between ages for Pre-stain Abs@640 nm  Post-stain Abs@640 nm and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm were all higher than 0.95 and the lower bounds of their 95% support intervals were all higher than 0.80 (0.905 for <U+0394>Abs@640 nm). Estimates of genetic correlations between measurements by age were much higher than estimates of environmental correlations  which ranged from 0.58 (SE 0.04) for Pre-stain Abs@640 nm to 0.16 (SE 0.07) for <U+0394>Abs@640 nm. Estimates of phenotypic correlations were intermediate between the estimates of genetic and environmental correlations  since they are a weighted average of the latter. The estimate of the phenotypic correlation for Post-stain Abs@640 nm was intermediate to those of the other two traits. Genetic correlations between traits are more complex than correlations for a given trait between ages  as shown by the differences observed between breeds (see Table ). Among these  only the correlations between Pre-stain and Post-stain Abs@640 nm showed no evidence of differences between breeds  with all the estimates being positive and statistically different from 0 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  and with a pooled estimate of 0.55 (SE 0.05). This indicates that eggshell color explains<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.3 (0.55) of the genetic variation in Post-stain Abs@640 nm  irrespective of color; however the standard errors of the individual breed estimates were substantial (~<U+2009>0.10)  and this sampling error could mask important differences. The trait that is associated with functional effects that arise from variation in cuticle deposition is <U+0394>Abs@640 nm. For this trait  the picture was clearest for populations that lay white or tinted eggs  i.e. breeds 2 (WL) and 3 (the broiler line)  respectively  for which the relative variation in Pre-stain Abs@640 nm is sufficiently small such that all correlation estimates with Post-stain Abs@640 nm were higher than 0.95 (Table ). Because the benefit from measuring Pre-stain Abs@640 nm was very limited  we did not measure it in breed 2B. For the brown-egg breeds (breeds 1 and 4)  the picture was less clear  particularly for breed 4. The gold standard <U+0394>Abs@640 nm is not independent of color (as measured by Pre-Stain Abs@640 nm)  for the different sources of variation  unless the corresponding regression coefficient ( in Table ) of Post-stain on Pre-stain Abs@640 nm estimates are equal to 1 (as <U+0394>Abs@640 nm<U+2009>=<U+2009>Post-stain Abs@640 nm<U+2009>-<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>Pre-stain Abs@640 nm). The evidence in Table  shows that  for Breed 4  the use of <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 is insufficient to remove the genetic association of <U+0394>Abs@640 nm with color  resulting in a negative genetic correlation. Estimates of the genetic correlations between Pre-stain Abs@640 nm and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm were statistically significantly different from 0 for breeds 3 and 4 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  suggestive for breed 2A (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.1)  but was not significant for breed 1 at either age (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.1). The intensity of tryptophan fluorescence measured at 330 nm decreased between the two ages examined in breed 1 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1262  mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>3875<U+2009>±<U+2009>1088 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1230 <U+2009>1052±<U+2009>241 at 31 and 50 weeks  respectively). There was also a large numerical difference between the values obtained for breed 1 (brown eggs) at both ages and breed 2A (white eggs) (<U+2009>=<U+2009>934  13 478<U+2009>±<U+2009>1272) at 29 weeks of age. Measurement of tryptophan fluorescence at 330 nm was based on the hypothesis that this may avoid the need for staining  and that strong associations would exist between tryptophan fluorescence and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm  particularly at the genetic level. The estimate of heritability of tryptophan fluorescence was quite high (Table )  with a combined estimate from the meta-analysis of 0.48 (SE 0.05)  with no statistical evidence of differences between the four estimates from the 3 breeds. Breed 1 had two measurements available  at 31 and 50 weeks  and the genetic correlation between them was high (0.98 SE 0.01)  with an environmental correlation of 0.51 (SE 0.06) and a phenotypic correlation of 0.75 (SE 0.01). The 95% support interval for the estimate of genetic correlation was (0.93  1] (Table ). However  across all breeds  there was little consistency in the relationship of tryptophan fluorescence with all traits measured by absorbance at 640 nm and estimates of genetic correlation all significantly differed from 1 and none differed significantly from 0. Estimates of the corresponding environmental and phenotypic correlations were also low. Tryptophan fluorescence was negatively associated to Pre-stain Abs@640 nm  both genetically and environmentally. These genetic and environmental associations were substantial in the brown (breed 1) and tinted (breed 3) egg laying breeds  but they were weak and not statistically different from 0 for the white-egg laying breed 2A. This means that in brown or tinted egg layers  higher tryptophan fluorescence was genetically correlated with lower pigmentation of the shell  whereas in white egg layers (breed 2A)  fluorescence was not correlated with color (Table ). However  the phenotypic correlation of tryptophan fluorescence and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm or Pre-stain Abs@640 nm suggested that  in brown or tinted egg layers  tryptophan fluorescence explained a small fraction of the phenotypic variance in <U+0394>Abs@640 nm  but a relatively large amount of the phenotypic variance in Pre-stain Abs@640 nm (Table ). This was also true for the genetic correlation of tryptophan fluorescence and Pre-stain Abs@640 nm  where the values were large for the brown and tinted eggs. The genetic and phenotypic correlations were all negative between tryptophan fluorescence and Pre-stain Abs@640  indicating that the greater the amount of pigment on the shell  the lower the tryptophan fluorescence emitted. On a subset of brown eggs (<U+2009>=<U+2009>48  breed 1)  the absorbances at 290 nm measured before and after cuticle removal were equal to 1.94 (SE 0.06)  and 1.74 (SE 0.07)  respectively  with the difference in absorbance averaging 0.21 (SE 0.10). The difference in absorbance is attributable to the removal of the cuticle and represents how much light at 290 nm is absorbed by the cuticle. Additional file  documents a prediction equation of absorbance at 640 nm from Minolta colorimetry traits L*a* b*  which has been denoted as  Table  shows the genetic correlations of L*  a*  b* and  with Pre-stain Abs@640 nm and <U+0394>Abs@640 nm on brown eggs from breed 1 and white eggs from breed 2A. Results for the heritability and the genetic correlations between the Minolta traits at the two ages are in Table S1 and S2  respectively (see Additional file : Tables S1 and S2). The colorimetry traits were measured on the same hens as the cuticle measurements but on eggs laid at different ages  so the phenotypic measurements would not necessarily be expected to be close to 1 (see Additional file  Table S3). However it would be expected that the genetic correlation of  with Pre-stain Abs@640 nm for breed 1 would be close to 1 since the genetic correlation of Pre-stain Abs@640 nm across ages was 0.95 (see Table )  and this is observed in Table . The genetic correlation of  with <U+0394>Abs@640 in Table  is also consistent with the genetic correlation of Pre-stain Abs@640 with <U+0394>Abs@640 for breed 1 shown in Table . The results for Breed 2A are less clear since the variation in absorbance at 690 nm prior to staining in this breed was on a negligible scale (see Table ). For all breeds  we found no evidence of non-zero genetic correlations of <U+0394>Abs@640 nm with production traits  i.e. total egg production over the production period  egg weight between 26 and 48 weeks of age  shape index  body weight and feed intake at 30 weeks of age or breaking strength of eggs measured at 48 weeks of age using quasi-static compression at the poles (data not reported). Our findings constitute an important step towards the implementation of selection for improved cuticle deposition on eggs. The expected benefit is to decrease the likelihood of vertical transmission of pathogens from parent to offspring by reducing the entry of microorganisms into eggs  as well as improving food safety of table eggs that are directed to human consumption. We have both replicated and extended our previous observations [] on the genetic parameters of this trait and  thus  have greatly increased the confidence in this approach. As indicated by the lack of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis  estimates of the heritability of cuticle deposition were substantial for all breeds  which indicates that about 38% of the variation in the trait is explained by genetics  which is more than adequate for allowing genetic progress. Furthermore  it is likely that  with technical improvements in staining and measurement of the cuticle  the proportion of variation attributable to genetics will increase  since undoubtedly some of the non-genetic variation is attributable to the reliance of the measurement on the consistency of staining the eggs. Although the estimate of heritability for cuticle deposition was high for all breeds  differences in estimates of heritability between breeds should be considered with caution given the differences in the instrumentations used within this study  the dates of the measurements  and the hens’ environments and ages. Our attempts to identify non-genetic factors involved in the variation of the cuticle suggest that stressors [] and fixed environmental factors  such as hatch or house  have significant effects in this and other studies []. For poultry breeders  one of the most important correlations is the genetic correlation between early and later performance  which if it is high  would favor a single early measurement of a trait. Our results show that  for the cuticle  a single measurement at an early stage would be effective. In breed 1  for which measurements were made at two ages  we found a genetic correlation of 1 between measurements  with a tight 95% support interval. There was also no difference in the estimates of heritability between the measurements at two ages; therefore  our studies provide no evidence of benefit in measuring cuticle deposition at one age or another. Increasing age is typically associated with a decline in egg quality  color being a good example []  which was replicated in this study and in a related longitudinal study []  but also occurs for many other quality traits []. However  for cuticle deposition  we have no support for a decline in the trait with age  both in this study or in related longitudinal studies []. In our studies  we used staining of the egg and spectrophotometric absorbance at a single wavelength to measure the cuticle deposition on eggs. In the layer breeding industry  the Minolta colorimeter is widely used to provide a measurement of shell color using the L*a*b* color space system. Our estimates of the genetic and environmental correlations of using an independently-derived Minolta prediction of Abs@640  which we termed r  with the single-wavelength Pre-stain Abs@640 nm absorbance measurement was close to 1  even when eggs measured by Minolta and Pre-stain@640 nm were laid several weeks apart in this study. This means that breeders can use Minolta colorimetry with confidence to assess differences in staining to estimate cuticle deposition  as already reported in the literature [    ]. In addition  the near perfect genetic correlations across ages for egg shell color in breed 1 confirms the widely accepted perception among breeders that egg color can be measured early or late in a hens life with similar results for selection; however  evidence for this does not seem to be widely reported. The most debated relationship is probably that between cuticle deposition and pigment. The argument centers on how much of the pigment is located in the cuticle [  ]. If significant amounts of pigment were in the cuticle  it seems plausible that the amount of cuticle is associated to the amount of pigment. In brown eggs  our physiological studies suggest that pigment deposition and cuticle deposition are distinct processes []. This is also supported by the estimated genetic correlation between these traits that is not significantly different from 0 in our previous studies []  and by our current findings that show heterogeneity in the genetic correlation between the traits among the breeds studied. Our estimates of genetic correlation were either low or statistically not different from 0 for breeds that lay brown or tinted eggs  negative for breed 4  and positive for the tinted egg laying broilers  breed 3. However  for the white egg layer  breed 2A  we did observe a positive genetic correlation. Although pigment is minimal in white egg layers  the color perception may be affected by cuticle deposition  which is plausible because of the significant positive genetic correlation of cuticle deposition with the Minolta b* value  which indicates ‘yellower’ on the blue-yellow axis. However  overall  the positive  albeit non-significant  genetic correlation between cuticle deposition and luminance  L*  and significant negative correlations with a* and the L*a*b index would suggest that selection for cuticle deposition would also favor the selection of hens laying lighter whiter eggs. Although the authors of a study on the characterization of shell pigment observed that porphyrins are tightly bound to the shell mineral  they did point out that porphyrins would have been soluble when secreted into the shell gland at the end of shell formation and before oviposition []. This would at least allow for temporal secretion of cuticle and porphyrins  with subsequent binding of the porphyrins to the shell matrix and  therefore  give a physiological basis for a possible competition between the amount of shell pigment and cuticle. Thus  it is prudent to keep in mind that there is heterogeneity in the relationship between color and cuticle  although none of the observed genetic associations would prevent poultry breeding programs from moving both of these traits in the desired direction  regardless of the color of the eggs of the population. The relatively high genetic correlation of shininess with both cuticle deposition and tryptophan fluorescence is suggestive that shininess may be dependent on an aspect of the proteins in or on the shell. Given that shininess is almost certain to result from changes in the microcrystalline texture of the shell surface []  it is possible that the proteins of the cuticle  or of the outer shell  modify the surface structure to give a finer texture and therefore more specular (non-diffuse) reflectance of light. A further consideration is the genetic associations of cuticle deposition with production and quality traits other than color. Our analysis  over a wide range of egg quality and production traits  leads to the conclusion that there was  however  no evidence of any adverse correlation that would prejudice the use of cuticle deposition as a trait for selection. In this study  we also tested an alternative method of assessing cuticle deposition that does not rely on staining the egg. We hypothesized that fluorescence intensity at 330 nm of the amino acid tryptophan from unstained eggs would be proportional to the amount of cuticle on the egg  since the cuticle is mainly composed of protein [    ]. Measurement of tryptophan fluorescence proved to be rapid and repeatable  with heritabilities higher than 0.36. However  unfortunately this measure did not correlate strongly  either genetically or phenotypically  with the existing measurement of cuticle deposition. In breed 1  there was a reasonable genetic correlation between tryptophan fluorescence and cuticle deposition  but there was no evidence for a phenotypic correlation. For these reasons  we cannot recommend the use of tryptophan fluorescence as an indicator of cuticle deposition. The failure to find significant correlations between cuticle deposition and tryptophan fluorescence was unexpected since tryptophan concentration is greater in the cuticle than in the shell. Our hypothesis was further undermined by the interaction between tryptophan fluorescence and shell color  as discussed below. An obvious explanation is that we are measuring tryptophan fluorescence from the proteins within the shell rather than just the cuticle; however  we found that removal of the cuticle resulted in an increase in tryptophan fluorescence intensity. This clearly indicates the presence of tryptophan-containing protein in the sub-cuticle eggshell matrix. Further investigation revealed that removal of the cuticle caused a decrease in the absorbance at 290 nm  which is characteristic of tryptophan. This is consistent with a previous observation that removal of the cuticle resulted in a significant increase in measured reflected light at ultraviolet wavelengths down to 300 nm in the eggs of chicken and of other species [  ]. For a sample of eggs from breed 1  we found that the absorbance for the cuticle was around 0.2  compared with a value of around 1.7 for the sub-cuticle matrix  which means that the cuticle absorbs about 40% of the incident UV light intensity at 290 nm  whereas the sub-cuticle shell matrix absorbs about 98% of the incident light at the same wavelength after cuticle removal. If one considers that the thickness of the cuticle is about 1/50th of that of the underlying shell  the absorbance values suggest that the concentration of tryptophan is about 6 times more in the cuticle than in the sub-cuticle matrix. The increase in tryptophan fluorescence intensity observed when the cuticle is removed shows that absorption of 290-nm light by the cuticle gives rise to less fluorescence than does its absorption in the sub-cuticular matrix; i.e.  the fluorescence quantum yield of tryptophan is lower in the cuticle than in the underlying matrix. This quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in the cuticle is likely due to a combination of energy transfer to protoporphyrin pigment and self-quenching due to the high concentration of protein []. Removal of the cuticle allows a higher intensity of excitation light to reach the more emissive shell matrix  resulting in an increase in tryptophan fluorescence intensity; moreover  any attenuation of the matrix emission by absorption in the cuticle will be removed along with the cuticle. Thus  it is evident that the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence measured for an intact egg is made up of contributions from both the cuticle and the sub-cuticle matrix  and is subject to the complex influence of variations in the structure and composition of both components. This means that neither absorbance at 290 nm nor the fluorescence were related to cuticle quantity. Large differences in the measured tryptophan fluorescence emission were observed between breeds  which may be explained in part by differences in protoporphyrin deposition between breeds  with the tryptophan fluorescence intensity being inversely related to the breed’s protoporphyrin deposition on the egg  which will quench the tryptophan fluorescence. A negative genetic and phenotypic correlation of egg color with tryptophan fluorescence was only evident in the breeds laying colored eggs. This suggests that fluorescence and pigment deposition are genetically linked  most likely due to the physical quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by protoporphyrin (the principal pigment in the shell of brown eggs []). Quenching occurs as a result of Forster resonance energy transfer [] from excited tryptophan molecules to protoporphyrin molecules. In effect  light energy absorbed by a tryptophan molecule is transferred to a nearby protoporphyrin molecule  resulting in the fluorescence of tryptophan being suppressed and in emission occurring instead from protoporphyrin  at much longer wavelengths  between 620 and 700 nm. The greater the concentration of protoporphyrin  the greater the probability of energy transfer (quenching)  resulting in a negative correlation between tryptophan fluorescence intensity and egg color. The effect of the cuticle in suppressing UV reflectance and tryptophan fluorescence from the egg at around 330 nm might suggests a role of the cuticle in camouflage [  ] at this wavelength. After all  many birds  including chickens  are thought to perceive light at this wavelength []. Simplicity of measurement is important for implementation of a new trait in a breeding program. For white eggs (breed 2)  we have shown that the very low background level of protoporphyrin absorption makes a pre-stain measurement unnecessary; cuticle deposition can be estimated simply from only a post-stain measurement. For brown eggs (e.g. RIR  breed 1)  the situation is less simple and the difference between pre- and post-stain measurements must be calculated to obtain an accurate estimate of the amount of cuticle. For tinted broiler eggs (breed 3)  we found that a single post-stain measurement had a large enough genetic correlation with cuticle deposition to obtain satisfactory results  particularly since  for broilers  correlated changes in color are of no economic value. In view of the favorable effects on bacterial penetration previously observed [] and since replicated [  ]  we believe that selection for cuticle deposition will contribute to reducing the risk of vertical transmission of avian pathogens  and reduce the incidence of infected eggs in the incubation process. In wild birds  the pressure to maintain a good cuticle is likely strong  which  to some extent  is supported by the observation that cuticle deposition is enhanced in species that have dirty nests  in particular eggs of aquatic birds []. It is conceivable that the almost universal use of artificial incubation  including at the pedigree level in a breeding program  and the relatively clean bio-secure environment in which breeding hens are kept  have reduced natural selection pressure on the deposition of cuticle. Given that the environment of chickens in production may contain greater challenges than in pedigree farms  we think considerable benefit can be accrued by incorporating this measurement into selection programs of both egg- and meat-type chickens. We have demonstrated  across independent breeds  a moderate heritability of cuticle deposition  which is adequate for genetic progress to increase the deposition of the cuticle. We have developed a simple-to-use instrumentation or suggested deployment of existing technology to be used in combination with a straightforward staining protocol to quantify the cuticle for genetic estimation. The results suggest that one measurement during the life of a hen is adequate to estimate genetic merit for the trait. Furthermore  we found no genetic correlations that could cause a problem in selection programs  assuming continued selection for shell color traits takes place. Overall  the trait of cuticle deposition can form part of a strategy to reduce the incidence of transmission of microorganisms in poultry breeding and reduce disease in production animals.

In the presence of IGE  heritable variance and response to selection depend on size of the interaction group (group size)  which can be modelled via a ‘dilution’ parameter () that measures the magnitude of IGE as a function of group size. However  little is known about the estimability of  and the precision of its estimate. Our aim was to investigate how precisely  can be estimated and what determines this precision.MethodsWe simulated data with different group sizes and estimated  using a mixed model that included IGE and . Schemes included various average group sizes (4  6  and 8)  variation in group size (coefficient of variation () ranging from 0.125 to 1.010)  and three values of  (0  0.5  and 1). A design in which individuals were randomly allocated to groups was used for all schemes and a design with two families per group was used for some schemes. Parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Bias and precision of estimates were used to assess their statistical quality.ResultsThe dilution parameter of IGE can be estimated for simulated data with variation in group size. For all schemes  the length of confidence intervals ranged from 0.114 to 0.927 for   from 0.149 to 0.198 for variance of DGE  from 0.011 to 0.086 for variance of IGE  and from 0.310 to 0.557 for genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. To estimate   schemes with groups composed of two families performed slightly better than schemes with randomly composed groups.ConclusionsDilution of IGE was estimable  and in general its estimation was more precise when  of group size was larger. All estimated parameters were unbiased. Estimation of dilution of IGE allows the contribution of direct and indirect variance components to heritable variance to be quantified in relation to group size and  thus  it could improve prediction of the expected response to selection in environments with group sizes that differ from the average size."

However  little is known about the estimability of  and the precision of its estimate. Our aim was to investigate how precisely  can be estimated and what determines this precision. We simulated data with different group sizes and estimated  using a mixed model that included IGE and . Schemes included various average group sizes (4  6  and 8)  variation in group size (coefficient of variation () ranging from 0.125 to 1.010)  and three values of  (0  0.5  and 1). A design in which individuals were randomly allocated to groups was used for all schemes and a design with two families per group was used for some schemes. Parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Bias and precision of estimates were used to assess their statistical quality. The dilution parameter of IGE can be estimated for simulated data with variation in group size. For all schemes  the length of confidence intervals ranged from 0.114 to 0.927 for   from 0.149 to 0.198 for variance of DGE  from 0.011 to 0.086 for variance of IGE  and from 0.310 to 0.557 for genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. To estimate   schemes with groups composed of two families performed slightly better than schemes with randomly composed groups. Dilution of IGE was estimable  and in general its estimation was more precise when  of group size was larger. All estimated parameters were unbiased. Estimation of dilution of IGE allows the contribution of direct and indirect variance components to heritable variance to be quantified in relation to group size and  thus  it could improve prediction of the expected response to selection in environments with group sizes that differ from the average size. Most livestock species are housed in groups in which individuals interact socially and can influence each other’s phenotype. Thus  from a genetics perspective  the phenotype of an individual is influenced by the direct genetic effect (DGE) of the individual itself and by the indirect genetic effects (IGE) of the other individuals (group mates) [  ]. Theory-based research has demonstrated that IGE affect the rate and direction of response to selection [  ]. Furthermore  in the presence of IGE  heritable variance and response to selection depend on the number of individuals that interact (referred to as group size) [  ]. The dependency of the magnitude of IGE on group size [  ] has been modelled using a function of group size and a ‘dilution’ parameter () [  ]. Estimation of  is particularly important for species for which the sizes of the groups vary fundamentally and for traits that are recorded over time (such as gain  feed efficiency  or longevity)  for which group size may change over time. For instance  in layer chickens  the average group size can vary from 5 to 40 [  ]. For layer breeding programs  group size will remain constant over time  apart from mortality. However  in pig breeding (with an average group size of 8 to 15 [])  group size can vary more because barn and pen sizes  both within and between farms  depend on e.g. choices of the farmer and economic factors. In such a situation  animals from the same genetic line appear in a mix of group sizes within and across farms and  thus  it is necessary to investigate the relationship between IGE and group size for proper estimation of variance components  including for IGE  and consequently for proper interpretation of response to selection in a breeding program. Thus  when group size varies  a statistical model that takes the relationship between the magnitude of IGE and group size into account is required [  ]. Three statistical models have been proposed to model the relationship between IGE and group size [    ]. In the current study  we used the model of Bijma [] because it is easier to implement and interpret  since it involves only one parameter for the degree of dilution  while the model proposed by Hadfield and Wilson [] involves the estimation of additional covariance parameters. Moreover  the model developed by Anacleto et al. []  which is a non-linear IGE model and uses adaptive Bayesian computational techniques to estimate the model parameters  is more suitable for modelling infectious diseases []. In the model of Bijma []  the dilution parameter  can range from 0 to 1 in its Eq. 3:   where  is the IGE of individual  in a group of  members  and  is the IGE of  in a group of two members. When there is no dilution (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0)  IGE are independent of group size and when <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 (full dilution)  IGE are inversely proportional to the size of the group. Generally  the magnitude of  can be trait- and population-specific []. Ignoring  results in the overestimation of both the total heritable variance   which is equal to   (see Table  for a notation key)  and of the potential of a population to respond to selection in larger groups [  ]. With dilution ()  the total heritable variance is:  []. With incomplete dilution (<U+2009><<U+2009>1)  the total heritable variance increases with group size  while with complete dilution (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)  the total genetic variance does not depend on group size and will  therefore  be the same for all group sizes []. Several studies have investigated estimation of IGE [       ] and the contribution of IGE to heritable variance  either in real or simulated data with a constant group size (see review by Bijma []). However  knowledge about the impact of varying group sizes on estimability of genetic parameters and the dilution parameter () is limited. Here  we used the model proposed by Bijma [] to simulate data with varying group sizes and to estimate  and other parameters in the model such as the genetic variances of DGE and IGE and the genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. To investigate how precisely  can be estimated and what determines this precision  we used simulated schemes that differed in variability of group-size  quantified by the coefficient of variation ()  and in average group size. Two designs for allocation of individuals to groups were tested: (1) a random design and (2) a two-family design. For the random design  individuals were randomly allocated to groups. The two-family design  in which each group was composed of two families  was used to investigate if it yielded more precise estimates of  than the random design  as was previously shown for estimates of the variance of IGE with fixed group sizes [  ]. In addition  we hypothesized that estimates would be more precise for schemes with larger  of group size  since the impact of  on the phenotype is larger with larger  of group size (see “” section). A population with two discrete generations was simulated using R []. The base population included 50 sires and 200 dams all unrelated. To generate the second generation  sires and dams from the base population were mated at random. Each sire was mated to four dams and each dam produced 40 full-sib offspring  resulting in 8000 simulated individuals. Both direct and indirect effects had a genetic and a non-genetic component. The sex of each individual was randomly assigned with equal probability. The DGE and IGE of each individual in the base population were sampled from a bivariate normal distribution:  (see Table  for a notation of parameters and effects). DGE and IGE of the individuals in the second generation were calculated as:  and   where  and  are the DGE and IGE of the sire   and  are the DGE and IGE of the dam  and  and  are the direct and indirect Mendelian sampling components  which were sampled from . Direct and indirect non-genetic components were similarly sampled from . Both generations were included in the pedigree but phenotypic values were only generated for the second generation. Bijma [] proposed to model the dilution of IGE as:   where  is the IGE of individual  in a group of  members   is the IGE of  in a group of two members  and d is the degree of dilution. When d<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  IGE does not depend on group size  and when d<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  IGE is inversely proportional to the number of group mates []. The degree of  can be estimated from data with varying group size and IGE can be estimated as a function of average group size  as:  []. As explained in the next paragraph  in the simulation  both indirect genetic and non-genetic effects were scaled by . The phenotype of each individual in the second generation consisted of a direct effect  and the sum of the indirect effects  of each of its group mates []. Finally  the phenotype of each individual used for subsequent estimation of variance components was computed by scaling the indirect genetic and non-genetic effects depending on group size and summing all effects as follows: where  and  are the sum of the indirect genetic and indirect non-genetic effects  respectively  over the <U+2009>-<U+2009>1 group mates () of the focal individual . Details about parameters values used in the simulation are shown in a section below. In total  18 schemes were simulated (Table ) with different average group sizes (4  6  and 8) and variation in group size (<U+2009>=<U+2009>coefficient of variation  ranging from 0.125 to 1.010). For investigating the estimability of   group size must vary because  is irrelevant if there is no variation in group size. We chose  as the measure of variation in group size that affects the precision of the estimate of  because we hypothesized that  can be estimated more precisely if the variance of  is larger  which occurs when  varies more relative to its average (i.e. the ). For all simulated schemes  three values of  (0  0.5  and 1) were evaluated (Table ). Parameter values  and  were defined for the average group size  as was proposed in Eq. 7 in Bijma []  in which  and  were scaled by . For a fair comparison between schemes with different average group sizes but the same value of   the indirect effects for a given group size should be comparable across schemes. In other words  when   the values assigned to  and  were different for schemes that differed in average group size and were calculated using the scaling factor   which determines the change in total variance due to IGE with a change in group size (an example is shown below). This scaling was applied to avoid having large  and  for schemes with a large average group size. Table  lists the values that were assigned to the indirect genetic and non-genetic variances and shows that the scaled variances were the same across schemes that had the same value for  but different average group sizes. In other words  the schemes with the same value for  are comparable  since the same dilution was applied both between and within the schemes. For example  consider scheme 1 (3  4  5) and scheme 7 (4  6  8)  for  (note that both schemes include groups of size 4). Scheme 1 has  for a group of . Therefore  we chose the value of  for scheme 7 such that  for   the  is also equal to 0.1. The resulting value for scheme 7 was   such that  which is the required value (Table ) and Additional file : Table S1. For each value of   values of  and  for the schemes with  were considered to be the base values (Table   and Additional file : Table S1). For all schemes   was set to 0. A moderate heritability (both direct and indirect heritability  ) was used (Table ). Direct heritability is defined as:  and indirect heritability as: . Direct phenotypic variance  was set to 1  resulting in a direct genetic variance of . The indirect phenotypic variance  was set to  for all schemes with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. With   depending on the average group size  values for  differed (Table ). Table  shows that when    remains constant  whereas for    decreased with group size. Thus  schemes are only comparable within each dilution parameter but schemes with different dilution parameters are not comparable. For each scheme  50 replicates were simulated and  thus  the reported estimates were the average over 50 replicates. In the basic scenario  individuals were assigned randomly to groups. Thus  group mates were unrelated  except by chance  each family contributed individuals to many groups and each group contained members of multiple families. As an alternative  we also considered groups that were composed of members of two full-sib families  to investigate whether this improved the quality of the estimates (bias and precision)  as was previously shown for the variance of IGE in schemes with constant group size [  ]. Distribution of the 8000 individuals from a family of size 40 across two-family groups was possible only for simulated schemes 14  16 and 18 (Table ). In these three schemes  each group consisted of members of two randomly selected full-sib families  each family contributing half of the group members  and each family contributing to several groups. For example  for scheme 14 with group sizes 6 and 10  the members from a given full-sib family of 40 individuals were allocated to five groups of size 6 (three members of the specific family per group) and to five groups of size 10 (five members of the specific family per group) (Additional file : Figure S1). However  for these three schemes  the number of groups shown in Table  for random designs and the number of groups for the two-family design do not match. Therefore  in order to make the comparison between the two-family design and the random design as fair as possible  they both consisted of 500 groups of a given size (i.e. 500 groups of 6 plus 500 groups of 10). The number of individuals (<U+2009>=<U+2009>8000) and families (full-sib family size of 40) were kept the same. Genetic parameters (variance and covariance components) and the degree of dilution in the simulated data were estimated using the following mixed model []: where  is a vector of phenotypic records   is a vector of the fixed effects of the two sexes   is the design matrix corresponding to the fixed effect of sex   is the vector of DGE   is the design matrix corresponding to DGE   and  are vectors of IGE and indirect non-genetic effects  respectively  referring to the average group size   and  are design matrices corresponding to IGE and indirect non-genetic effects  respectively  which depend on the dilution parameter () and on group size ()  and  is a vector of residuals. Elements of  are []: and   otherwise. Elements of  were computed the same way as the elements of . Direct  and indirect genetic effects  were assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution:   where  is a 2*2 direct–indirect genetic (co)variance matrix   and  is the additive genetic relationship matrix calculated from the pedigree. Residual effects were assumed to be normally distributed as: . Note that when group size is constant  fitting indirect non-genetic effects (the  term) is equivalent to fitting a random group effect []  but this is not the case when group size varies. Since our simulated data included different group sizes and due to the dependency of the group variance on group size in model () (see formula 9a in Bijma [])  this can only be captured by including indirect non-genetic effects in the model. The above mixed model was fitted with the DMU software using REML []. To estimate   the likelihood was computed for a set of values of  to identify its maximum. Thus  for each replicate  the dilution of IGE was estimated for different values of   in steps of 0.04. The intervals for  were sufficiently large to avoid choosing the best  at the border of the interval. In other words  when the best  was on the border of the interval  the interval was expanded. Then  the best value for  was chosen based on the maximum likelihood. To assess whether the estimates of the (co)variance components and of  were biased  differences between the true simulated values and means of estimates across 50 replicates were evaluated. To measure the precision of the estimates of (co)variances and genetic correlations  their standard errors were used to calculate the 95% confidence interval (parameter<U+2009>±<U+2009>SE*1.96 rather than<U+2009>±<U+2009>SE such that the same measure of confidence intervals was used for all parameters  including ). The longer the length of the 95% confidence interval was  the lower was the precision of the estimates and vice versa. Since for   the SE was not obtained directly from DMU  the 95% confidence intervals for  were obtained from log-likelihood values and a Chi square statistic test with one degree of freedom. Estimates of both  and (co)variances were unbiased  irrespective of the  and average group size (Additional file : Figure S2  Additional file : Figure S3 and Additional file : Figure S4). For all schemes  the true values of the parameters were within<U+2009>±<U+2009>2 SE of the mean estimated values. Figure  shows the lengths of the confidence intervals for all parameters (dilution  variances of DGE and IGE  and the genetic correlation between DGE and IGE) for different group sizes (schemes) as a function of the  of group size. The schemes were compared within each  for three average group sizes (4  6  and 8). Estimates  standard errors  and confidence intervals of  are in Additional file : Tables S1 and Additional file  Table S2. For all schemes  the length of the confidence intervals ranged from 0.114 to 0.927 for   from 0.149 to 0.198 for the variance of DGE  from 0.011 to 0.086 for the variance of IGE  and from 0.310 to 0.557 for genetic correlation between DGE and IGE.

Lengths of the confidence intervals for dilution  variance of DGE  variance of IGE  and the genetic correlation between direct and indirect effects for different group sizes (simulated schemes) according to the  of group size. Group compositions were random with respect to family For all simulated  within each average group size  the length of the confidence interval for  decreased with increasing  of group size  except for schemes 17 and 18 (2  8  14 vs. 2  14) for which  (Fig. ) and Additional file : Table S1  for schemes 9 and 10 (2  6  10 vs. 2  10) for which   and for schemes 3 and 4 (2  4  6 vs. 2  6) for which  and <U+2009><<U+2009>1. For these schemes  there was a slight increase in the length of the confidence interval for  as  increased. For example  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and   the length of the confidence interval increased from 0.114 to 0.182 when  increased from 0.707 to 1.010. To investigate whether this pattern is real or due to noise  the number of replicates was increased to 200 for these schemes  but the pattern remained the same. For the variance of DGE  we observed no clear pattern of the length of the confidence intervals with changes in the  of group size. The precision of the estimate of the variance in IGE was expected to follow the same pattern as that for   since these parameters are related and  indeed  in general the length of the confidence interval for the variance of IGE decreased as the  increased (the same pattern as for ). For the genetic correlation between DGE and IGE  in general  a decrease in the length of the confidence interval with increasing  of group size was also observed. However  some discrepancies in this pattern were found when the  was smaller than 0.2. We had expected that  for estimating   the two-family design would perform better (shorter length of the confidence interval) than the random design but the two-family design was only slightly better (Additional file : Figure S5). The two-family design performed considerably better than the random design with respect to the precision of the estimate of the variance of IGE and of the genetic correlation  in agreement with results from previous studies with constant group size [  ]. For example  with the two-family design and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  the length of the confidence interval for IGE was equal to 0.054 for scheme 14 (group sizes 6 and 10) and 0.055 for schemes 16 (group sizes 4 and 12) and 18 (group sizes 2 and 14)  while the corresponding values for the random design were 0.085  0.082  and 0.086 (Additional file : Figure S5). For the variance of DGE  which design was better depended on . For <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  the two-family design performed better than the random design  whereas for <U+2009>><U+2009>0  the random design had a smaller confidence interval for the estimate of the variance of DGE (Additional file : Figure S5). When <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  superiority of the two-family design over the random design was largest for the scheme with the lower  (scheme 6  10 with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.353)  whereas with <U+2009>><U+2009>0  superiority of the random design was largest for the scheme with the highest  (scheme 2  14 with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.01). In this study  we investigated whether dilution () can be estimated and whether this estimation depends on variation in group size (). Other relevant genetic parameters such as the variances of DGE and IGE and the genetic correlation between DGE and IGE were also estimated. Our findings show that  can be estimated unbiasedly with varying group size and that  in general  the precision of the estimate of  increases with increasing  of group size. The group sizes used in this study for estimation of  ranged from 2 to 14  which applies for both chicken and pig breeding programs. However  we believe that our results on the estimability of dilution parameter also holds for group sizes larger than 14. To our knowledge  the estimability of  and the bias and precision of its estimates have not been investigated to date. Some studies based on real data did investigate the dependency of IGE on group size and tested whether IGE become smaller when groups get larger (i.e. testing whether dilution exists) [    ]. Some of these studies did in fact detect a dilution effect  while others did not. For example  Canario et al. [] investigated the effect of group size (constant group sizes ranging from 5 to 15) on IGE for growth in pigs and found that both the indirect genetic and indirect litter effects decreased proportionally to group size. This means that the influences of pigs on the growth of their groupmates were diluted across more recipients in large groups compared to small groups. They compared several models with and without a dilution effect and models that took dilution into account increased the goodness of fit of the statistical model. Duijvesteijn et al. [] investigated the dependence of IGE on group size for androstenon level in a population of boars (group sizes ranging from 3 to 11). They estimated the dilution for the IGE by computing the maximum likelihood of the model for  ranging from 0 to 1  with a step size of 0.25. Their results showed that the magnitude of IGE was not affected by group size  which they argued could be because of the relatively small group sizes they had. The degree of dilution also depends critically on the biological background of the trait [  ]. For a trait such as level of androstenon  which is a pheromone  dilution  is expected to be negligible because androstenon is spread by air in addition to being spread by physical contact []. In another study  Nielsen et al. [] tested whether the IGE for growth (life time daily gain from birth to slaughter) in Danish pigs depended on group size []. Group sizes in their study ranged from 8 to 15. They found that IGE increased with increasing group size (i.e. they found that  was smaller than zero). Due to the imperfections of real data with varying group sizes  the studies that have investigated dilution are inconclusive. It is difficult to compare these studies because their power to estimate  is relatively low (e.g. the group sizes are sometimes different or the number of groups per group size is sometimes small). Therefore  before concluding that there is no dilution  it is necessary to be sure that it can be estimated. Our study shows that  given the mentioned designs and simulated schemes (group sizes) (see “” section)  it is in fact possible to estimate dilution. Bijma [] reported that more accurate parameter estimates of IGE were obtained with the two-family design than the random design with constant group size  and concluded that this design is optimal or near optimal for the estimation of the variance due to IGE. In our study  the two-family design was tested only for three simulated schemes with an average group size of 8 and the conclusion is that  in general  the two-family schemes performed better than random designs. However  differences between the two simulated schemes in terms of length of the confidence interval for estimates of  were small. This may be because family sizes and the number of groups were sufficiently large for estimation of  with a random design. For estimation of the variance of IGE and of the genetic correlation between DGE and IGE  superiority of the two-family design increased for   which is consistent with the results of []. For estimation of the variance of DGE  with   the random design performed better than the two-family design  because each family is distributed across a larger number of groups  making the random design more optimal for estimating DGE []  since there is less confounding with IGE. In addition to the nature of the trait of interest (when real data is used for dilution estimation)  population structure  trait heritability (both direct and indirect heritability)  genetic correlation between DGE and IGE  and group size may affect the estimation of dilution. In this study  data were simulated using a moderate indirect heritability  and a zero genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. When indirect heritability is low  the optimal family size and/or group size for precise estimation of dilution may be different. Generally  the lower the true heritability  the larger the optimal family size []. Estimation of  is relevant when different group sizes are present in the data. Different group sizes can be relevant for breeding programs of several species for which animals are group-housed such as layers  pigs  and in aquaculture  where the group sizes vary due to mortality from diseases and involuntary culling. However  different group sizes are particularly relevant for pig breeding programs  in which each genetic line (breed) is typically represented on multiple farms that can have different group sizes  both between and within farms. In addition  in pig breeding programs  group sizes typically differ between the nucleus and commercial levels  with the larger group sizes at the commercial level. Before implementing selection for social genetic effects in a breeding program  it is crucial to know whether or not dilution exists and to be able to estimate it. If  in reality  dilution existed but we did not or could not estimate it  response to selection (genetic progress that was created in the selection pure lines) could not be accurately predicted. For example  the prediction of the genetic progress which would be disseminated to the commercial animals would be inaccurate. In other words  ignoring dilution may result in reduced observed response to selection compared to the predicted response to selection  because an indirect genetic model without dilution may cause overestimation of the total heritable variance and response to selection in commercial animals  due to the improper interpretation of direct and indirect variances that contribute to the heritable variance in relation to group size. Therefore  to predict selection response at the commercial level as accurately as possible  estimation of the magnitude of dilution cannot be ignored. Dilution of indirect genetic effects could be detected in simulated data with varying group size and all parameters could be estimated without bias. The precision of the estimate of dilution was higher when the  of group size was larger. For the estimation of dilution  schemes with groups composed of two families were slightly superior to the schemes with groups composed at random in terms of families.

To be able to digest feedstuff  the cow depends on its rumen microbiome. The relative abundance of the microbes has been shown to differ between cows. To date  there is little information on the impact of the microbiome on the formation of specific milk FA. Therefore  in this study  our aim was to investigate the impact of the rumen bacterial microbiome on milk FA composition. Furthermore  we evaluated the predictive value of the rumen microbiome and the host genetics on the composition of individual FA in milk.

The rumen microbiome has a pronounced influence on the content of odd chain FA and polyunsaturated C18 FA  and to a lesser extent  on the content of the short- and medium-chain FA in the milk of Holstein cattle. The accuracy of prediction of FA phenotypes in milk based on information from either the animal’s genotypes or rumen bacteria composition was very low. The bovine rumen provides an anaerobic environment for the acquisition and promotion of a complex microbial community that consists of bacteria  archaea  fungi and protozoa  with bacteria being the most abundant []. The relative microbiome composition may differ between cows []. The rumen microbiome composition has been shown to have an important impact on the production of methane. Difford et al. [] reported that variation in the relative rumen microbiome composition could explain up to 13% of the variation in total methane emission from dairy cattle and that the microbial community in the cows’ genetic make-up is associated with methane emission. The function of the metabolic activity of these microbial symbionts is to digest complex fibrous feed substrates into volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbial proteins that are used directly by the host for maintenance  growth and lactation []. Furthermore  these fermentation products have an effect on milk composition [  ]  thus the rumen microbial content has the potential to influence variation in host phenotypes []. Bovine milk contains many different fatty acids (FA)  from essential FA such as linoleic (C18:2) and a-linolenic (18:3) FA to human health promoting FA such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (C18:2) []. The short and medium chain FA (C4:0 to C14:0) are synthesized in the mammary gland. The long chain FA derive mainly from the feed but can be modified in the rumen and the mammary gland []. C16:0 can be derived both from feed and de novo synthesis in the mammary gland. To date  studies have focused on the genetic factors that affect the synthesis of FA in the milk and have shown that they are the main factors that influence the synthesis of saturated FA  whereas feed is more important for the synthesis of unsaturated FA [  ]. Within the context of the digestion of feed by the microbial community in the rumen  it is interesting to investigate how much of the variation in milk FA can be explained by variation in the rumen microbiome. Thus  our study focused on the influence of bacterial composition in the rumen microbiome on the synthesis of specific milk FA in Holstein cows by evaluating the value of the rumen microbiome in addition to the host genetics in predicting differences in the composition of individual FA phenotypes in milk. Morning milk samples were collected from 339 Holstein cows from three different herds. Each herd had one to three visits within a short time period  during which rumen samples were collected from individual cows immediately after milking (one sample per cow). The cows were kept indoors  fed a total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum  and milked individually using automated milking systems. They were divided into two groups according to parity: 120 cows for parity 1 and 209 cows for parity 2  and days in milk (DIM) ranged from 3 to 877. For all herds  a standardized TMR recipe was provided  which consisted primarily of rolled barley  corn silage  grass clover silage  rapeseed meal  soybean meal  and up to 3 kg of concentrate supplement given during milking. The procedures for collecting biological samples from the animals were approved by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration under the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark and performed in accordance with the National Guidelines for Animal Experimentation and the guidelines of the Danish Animal Experimental Ethics Committee. Analysis of milk FA was done as previously described in []. Fat percentage (FP) and protein percentage (PP) were determined on fresh whole-milk samples by infrared spectroscopy using a MilkoScan FT2 (Foss Analytical  Hillerød  Denmark). Cream was separated from skim milk by centrifugation (2643 for 30 min at 4 °C). Cream samples were stored at -<U+2009>20 °C until analysis of FA composition by gas chromatography (GC)  as described by Larsen et al. []. Peak areas for individual FA were calculated after GC separation. Fatty acids were identified and quantified based on external standards (Supelco 37 component FA methyl ester (FAME) mix  Supelco Inc.  Bellefonte  PA and GLC 469 methyl ester standard  Nu-Chek Prep Inc.  Elysian  MN)  and values were expressed as weight proportion of total identified FA []. We measured the following FA: caproic acid (C6:0)  caprylic acid (C8:0)  capric acid (C10:0)  lauric acid (C12:0)  tridecylic acid (C13:0)  myristic acid (C14:0)  myristovaccenic acid (C14:1 -9)  pentadecylic acid (C15:0)  palmitic acid (C16:0)  palmitoleic acid (C16:1 -9)  margaric acid (C17:0)  stearic acid (C18:0)  oleic acid (C18:1-9)  elaidic acid (C18:1 -11)  linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6)  a-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3)  and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA -9  -11). Since C18:1  isomers were not fully separated  the FA assigned as C18:1 -11 was a mixture of -10 and -11 isomers. Fatty acid measures are presented as proportions of total fat weight (wt%/wt%). Rumen sampling  DNA extraction  library generation and analysis of the bacterial community were performed as previously described in detail by Difford et al. []. Briefly  approximately 40 g of rumen content (both liquid and particle matter) were sampled using a flora rumen scoop and a representative subsample was immediately frozen at -<U+2009>80 °C for DNA extraction []. The profile of the bacterial community was assessed by sequencing the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. DNA extraction  sequence library construction and paired-end sequencing were performed by a commercial company (GATC Biotech  Constance  Germany). After quality control and processing of sequence reads  they were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) based on a similarity threshold of 97% using the LotuS pipeline [] via the UPARSE algorithm []. Low quality read ends were trimmed  and reads were quality filtered based on the following criteria: (1) a minimum average phred score of 27 and (2) a maximum accumulated error (E) of 0.75  which represents the average number of errors per read  i.e. on average 0.75 wrongly sequenced basepairs per read. In order to focus on representative samples that had a sufficient sequencing depth to be able to describe less abundant taxa as well  we removed samples with less than 50 000 reads after quality control []. Finally  OTU that contained less than 10 sequences were filtered from the OTU table. Taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using the RDP classifier with a confidence level of 0.8 using greengenes (gg_13_8_otus) as the reference database (). Genomic DNA was extracted from ear tissue of the 339 Holstein cows and genotyped with the Bovine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 50 beadchip () using an Illumina Infinium II Multisample assay device. The iScan and the Beadstudio version 3.1 software were used to scan the SNP chips. SNPs were selected based on the following quality parameters: a minimum call rate of 80% for individuals and a minimum call rate of 95% for loci. SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 1% were excluded. The quality of the SNPs was assessed using the Illumina GenCall data analysis software. Individuals with average GenCall scores lower than 0.65 were excluded as described in []. SNP positions were based on the  genome assembly (-) []. Finally  39 121 SNPs remained for analysis. We retained only the cows that had matched rumen samples  milk samples and genotypes (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>310)  and removed from these  those that were in lactation for more than 400 days  which resulted in 292 animals available for the analysis. In order to detect (biological) patterns in the bacterial OTU  a cluster analysis was performed based on the count data of the individual OTU. In total  8515 bacterial OTU with 97% sequence similarity were identified. OTU with a total sequence count less than 10 were removed from the data  which resulted in 3055 bacterial OTU available for this analysis. The sequence count data of the bacterial genomes were centered (by subtracting the column means from their corresponding columns) and scaled (by dividing the (centered) columns by their standard deviations)  resulting in the  matrix of 292 (number of cows) by 3055 (number of OUT). The distance matrix for cows based on  was calculated using the Dist function of the R package amap with the Pearson distance measure (). Hierarchical clustering based on the distance matrix was calculated using the hclust function of the R package stats (R version 3.2.3). To estimate the variance explained by the host’s genetics and rumen bacteria  we used the REML approach in DMU []: where  is the FA phenotype of individual    is the fixed mean effect   is a fixed effect ()   is a fixed effect ()   and  are the regression coefficient for   is a covariate of days in milk (d3–d398) and is modelled according to Wilmink []   is the random additive genetic effect of the animal   is the random effect associated with bacterial composition  and  is the random residual effect. The random effects are assumed to be independent normally distributed values described as follows:    and  The genomic relationship matrix (GRM)  was computed using all the SNPs based on the first method described by VanRaden []. The metagenomics relationship matrix () was computed based on the bacteria counts as previously described by Difford et al. []:   where  is the centered and scaled bacteria count matrix  and  is the number of bacterial OTU. The proportion of the total variance explained by the genetic effect of the animal () was defined as: where  is the genetic variation  and  is the residual variation. The proportion of the total variance explained by the effect associated with bacteria count ()  which is also called microbiability []  was defined as: where  is the bacterial variation  and  is the residual variation. To assess the influence of the animal’s genome and of the metagenome on milk and FA traits  we performed a cross-validation study by using a two-step procedure. In the first step  phenotypic records on milk FA  PP and FP were adjusted for relevant factors (herd  parity  DIM) using the following linear model: where  is the phenotype of individual   and the factors are as for Model M1. In the second step  we built a model in several steps for each adjusted phenotype (i.e. residuals obtained from Model M3) using the following linear mixed models: where  is the adjusted phenotype for each milk or FA trait   is the random additive genetic effect of the animal   is the random effect associated with bacteria count   is the Hadamard product between  and   and  () are the random residual effects. The random effects are re-estimated and are assumed to be independent normally distributed values described as follows:    and . The analysis was performed using a genomic feature best linear unbiased prediction (GFBLUP) for each model separately  as implemented in the R library qgg () [  ]. The features in Models M5  M6 and M7 are the bacteria count data and the genetic data (39 121 SNPs). The ability of each of the models (M4–M7) to predict phenotypes was assessed using a cross-validation procedure. The validation set was generated by randomly sampling 50 out of 292 animals and the remaining 242 animals were used as the training set. In the validation procedure  we estimated the model parameters based on the observations of the cows in the training data and predicted the phenotypes of the cows in the validation data. Then  we calculated the correlation between the predicted phenotype and the observed phenotype. This was repeated 10 times and the predictive ability of a model was defined as the average correlation of these 10 validations. The predictive ability of each model was compared using a Welch’s t test (i.e. unequal variance t test) as implemented in R (R version 3.2.3). We tested whether the average correlation of these 10 validations was significantly higher than the average correlation obtained from another model. We performed the following comparisons: M4 versus M6 (bacteria are important); M5 versus M6 (genetics is important); M6 versus M7 (interaction between bacteria and genetics is important). A Bonferroni corrected P value lower than 0.05 was considered significant (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>57 comparisons). The descriptive statistics for milk FA  FP and PP traits are in Table . Proportions in milk FA varied with the highest proportions being in C14:0 (11.60%)  C18:1 -9 (20.27%) and C16:0 (31.24%)  and the lowest in C13:0 (0.14%)  CLA -9  -11 (0.48%) and C18:3 n-3 (0.53%). Coefficients of variation (CV) were highest for C14:1 -9  C16:1 -9  and C12:0  i.e. 33.97  27.24  and 24.19%  respectively  and lowest for C16:0  C18:2n6  and C6:0 i.e. 10.92  12.95  and 14.30%  respectively. The hierarchical cluster analysis on the 3055 rumen bacterial OTU (after filtering) did not show a clear pattern of OTU clusters. Among the OTU with high abundance  most of the OTU were assigned to  and  (see Additional file )  whereas those with low abundance were mostly assigned to the two aforementioned groups and to           and . Table  shows the estimated heritability () and microbiability () for each trait based on M1 and M2  respectively. In general   was relatively high for all FA [ranging from 0.69 (C14:1 -9) to 0.11 (C18:1 -11; C18:1 -9)]  except for C14:0 and C18:3 n-3  which had values close to 0. In general   was lower than   and the main FA affected by rumen bacteria were C15:0  C17:0  C18:2 n-6  C18:3 n-3 and CLA with  ranging from 0.26 to 0.42. For the other FA C6:0  C8:0  C10:0  C12:0  C16:0  C16:1 -9 and C18:1 -9   was close to 0. In all cases  the estimated standard errors were relatively large  which can be explained by the limited sample size (Table ). The predictive ability of each model is in Table . In general  predictive ability for individual FA was low regarding both the rumen bacteria component and the genetic component. The comparison M4 versus M6 shows that adding rumen bacteria information improved predictive ability significantly for C15:0 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.50e-07) and C18:3 n-3 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.81e-18)  and only slightly for C13:0 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.07)  C14:0 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) and C18:2 n-6 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.08). The comparison M5 versus M6 shows that genetic information had a more significant effect on improving predictive ability for C6:0  C8.0  C10:0  C12:0  C14:1 -9  C16:0  C16:1 -9 and C18:1 -9 (Table ). Finally  the comparison M6 versus M7 suggests a slight improvement in predictive ability for C18:1 -9 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003) when adding an interaction component between bacteria and genotype  but it was not significant after adjustment for multiple testing. In this study  we evaluated the influence of the bacterial composition of the rumen microbiome on the biosynthesis of specific FA in bovine milk. FA composition in milk is the result of a complex process in which FA originate from different sources. Short chain and medium chain FA are synthesized de novo in the mammary gland  while long chain FA derive mainly from feed []. In general  the heritability of de novo synthesized FA is high  whereas that of long chain FA is low to moderate []. Poulsen et al. [] reported that the feeding regime has a clear influence on the composition of long chain FA  but also that they are modified considerably in the rumen and by desaturation in the mammary gland. Even if cows have the same feeding regime  individual feed intake per cow varies because its energy requirement differs depending on parity and lactation stage. Furthermore  cows sort out their feed even when fed a TMR. Thus  one can argue that the microbial composition in the rumen could be a proxy for feed type  rather than influencing milk fat composition. However  Sasson et al. [] showed that abundance of some bacteria in the rumen is heritable []. Thus  variation in the rumen microbiome may influence the biosynthesis of milk FA and the modifications of feed-derived FA. Henderson et al. [] have suggested that a ‘core microbiome’ of dominant bacteria exists in the rumen at the genus level or higher and consists of      as well as unclassified      and . Our results are in line with the results of Henderson et al. []  i.e. they show that the clusters of OTU with the highest counts were mainly assigned to  and the unclassified group   whereas the clusters with the lowest count data also contained the (unclassified) groups           and . In our study  estimated heritabilities for fat % and protein % were low (0.19  and 0.18  respectively) compared to previous reports on fat %  i.e. 0.24 in [] and 0.47 in [] and on protein %  i.e. 0.47 in [] and 0.53 in []. The discrepancy between our current results and those in the literature could be due to the use of different models to estimate the variances or simply to the relative small sample size used here. Ideally  the variance parameters in this study would be estimated jointly  combining models M1 and M2  but the sample size in our study limits the possibility of estimating parameters from the full model in which both  and  are fitted simultaneously. Nevertheless  we believe that our results show that some of the milk FA are affected by the rumen microbiome  and that our study could serve as a basis for future studies on the influence of the microbiome on milk FA composition. Our results show that the short and medium chain FA have a stronger genetic component  compared to the long chain C18 FA  which is in line with the expectation that long chain FA derive from feed. However  our results do not confirm the trend that saturated FA have a higher heritability than unsaturated FA as previously reported [  ]. Comparison of our results to an earlier independent study on milk FA composition in Holstein cattle [] indicates that the estimated heritabilities are in line with those in [] except for C14:0 and C18:3 n-3  for which we detected no genetic component. Interestingly  both C14:1 -9 and C16:1 -9 had high heritabilities  which reflect a strong genetic influence related to the desaturase activity in the mammary gland. The conversion of C14:0 and C16:0 into their mono-unsaturated counterparts is catalyzed by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). The SCD1 gene is located on  chromosome (BTA) 26 and is associated with milk FA composition []. We detected no influence of the rumen bacteria composition on the C6–C12 and C16 FA group  which suggests that they have little or no effect on de novo synthesis in particular  but also on C16:0 derived from feed. This is further reflected by the absence of influence on C14:1 -9  and C16:1 -9. In general  the influence of bacteria in the rumen on the formation of milk FA is more pronounced for the odd-chain FA (C15:0  C17:0) and polyunsaturated C18 FA (C18:2 n-6  C18:3 n-3 and CLA -9  -11)  as expected based on the origin of the FA in milk []. These FA originate partly from hydrogenation processes in the rumen by specific microorganisms that affect feed-derived C18 FA and partly from odd-chain FA that are mainly synthesized microbially in the rumen []. For C17:0 and many of the C18 FA  the variation in rumen bacterial content explained more of the host phenotypic variation than the host genome variation  albeit marginally  and with a large standard error. Although variation in these FA is often associated with differences in the feed  in our study  feed variation was minimized since animals were fed a standardized TMR. Furthermore  these findings confirm the existence of variation in the host genome and that the microbiome can explain a part of the variation in some complex host traits. This agrees with the findings of a study that investigated the influence of gut bacteria in 207 pigs and estimated the proportion of variation explained by  and  for feed intake (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.16  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.42)  daily gain (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.28  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11) and feed conversion ratio (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.21 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.19) []. That study also showed that the abundance of 49 genera of the pig gut microbiome was heritable []. Recent findings in dairy cattle suggest that the host genetics has some influence on the rumen microbiome [    ]. There is considerable interest in understanding the interactions between the host and the rumen microbiome for directing desired changes to the host phenotype. If associations between heritable rumen bacteria and phenotypes of the host exist  there is scope for research in selective breeding. Selective breeding takes generations to induce genetic changes in livestock populations  whereas interventions on the rumen microbiome can act rapidly within a few generations. Rumen transfaunation using the cud from a healthy donor cow to treat a recipient cow with a digestive disorder has long been an effective method of implementing a desired change to the host cow phenotype []. Recent work with repeated inoculations in beef heifers on a poor straw-based diet with rumen contents from bison has shown that the rumen bacteria and the host metabolic activity are altered  which result in increased protein and nitrogen retention []. It is relevant to investigate whether the bacterial and genetic information can contribute to predicting the milk fat composition of cows. In general  we found that the predictive value for FA was low  which could be due to the relatively small sample size used in our study. Genotype information is of higher value for the prediction of specific FA in the milk than information on the rumen bacterial composition. We found that genotype information was relevant for the prediction of the medium chain FA C6 to C12  C14:1 -9 and C16:0  C16:1 -9. This is in line with the fact that these FA are fully or partly de novo synthesized or reflect desaturase activity in the mammary gland. Interestingly  information on the rumen bacterial community was better at predicting the C15:0 and C18:3 n-3 content in milk (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.29–0.34) than genotype information. The predictive value of rumen bacteria for C15:0 and C18:3 n-3 was in line with that of gut bacteria in pigs for feed intake  daily gain and feed conversion (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.33–0.41) [] and that of methane emission in dairy cows using full rumen metagenomics sequences (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.466) []. The estimated  and  for C15:0 were similar  which is as expected since C15:0 is known to be both synthesized de novo and derived from blood [  ]. However  information on the microbiome is preferable for predicting the C15:0 content in milk. Regarding the prediction of C18:3 n-3 content in milk  C18:3 n-3 derives from the feed and thus depends highly on the feeding regime of the cow [] and on the microbiome  which plays an important role in degrading the feed in the rumen and thereby regulates the C18:3 n-3 content in milk through rumen biohydrogenation. Our results also show that  when  or  are equal to 0 (Table )  the mean predictive value is negative (Table )  which indicates that the correlation between the observed and predicted phenotypes are biased downwards. Our findings show that variation in rumen microbiome composition has a pronounced influence on the content of odd chain FA and the polyunsaturated C18 FA  and to a lesser extent  on the content of the short and medium chain FA in milk. The prediction of individual FA content in milk based on information of either the animals’ genotypes or the rumen bacteria was low. The results can be explained from a biological point of view  e.g. the  for the saturated FA was generally higher than  and the predictive ability of the model fitting the GRM was better for the saturated FA than the model fitting the microbial relationship matrix. Nevertheless  standard errors of the heritability estimates were large and  in some cases  the predictive values tended to be biased downwards  which indicated that it is necessary to increase the sample size in a future study.

The use of molecular data to identify genomic regions that may contribute to inbreeding depression in the NSCT will likely prove to be a valuable tool for the preservation of its genetic diversity in the long term. In recent years  there has been a rapid increase in the intensity of selection in many livestock breeding programs with the growing use of elite animals  which ultimately reduces the effective population size (N) of some breeds [     ]. Consequently  a small N not only reduces genetic variability  but it also increases the effects of inbreeding (F) and genetic drift  and potentially alters the patterns of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in the long term [     ]. While such alterations may not necessarily be of concern for large and highly diverse populations  increased homozygosity at loci with a heterozygous advantage in small native populations reduces furthermore their genetic diversity []. Small populations can be particularly vulnerable to inbreeding depression since mating between relatives often decreases individual fitness and can significantly reduce population growth [  ]. Moreover  selection programs  while driving favorable alleles to fixation  also allow deleterious alleles to hitchhike along with favorable mutations. In addition to this  more intense selection resulting from combining genomic selection with embryo biotechnologies (e.g. artificial insemination) not only increases rates of genetic gain  but can also increase levels of inbreeding [  ]. The Norwegian–Swedish Coldblooded trotter (NSCT) is a domestic breed of horse in Norway and Sweden and is one of the few remaining descendants of the original Nordic coldblooded horse []. Since the 1950s  the breed has been intensively selected for harness racing performance with estimated breeding values produced annually since the 1980s [  ]. As a result  a remarkable improvement in the racing performance of NSCT has occurred during the last half-century. However  this improved racing performance has also been accompanied by a gradual increase in pedigree-based F levels []. Although today NSCT is considered as a relatively healthy breed  the NSCT breeding industry is well aware that increased levels of inbreeding are widely known to increase the expression of recessive deleterious alleles that are linked to genetic diseases. Historically  inbreeding in NSCT has been monitored by using traditional methods that are based on pedigree analysis [  ]. While informative  the NSCT industry understands that this classical metric likely underestimates inbreeding within the breed and does not account for the fact that homozygosity at some regions may  in principal  be more or less desirable than at other regions. Two animals that have the same level of inbreeding  may display drastically different unfavorable effects of inbreeding. Even with an extensive and complete pedigree  realized inbreeding levels will likely differ from pedigree-based F levels due to recombination and Mendelian sampling  which is then compounded by the fact that  although the base animals in a pedigree are considered unrelated  they are more often than not  related. Consequently  the NSCT industry has actively supported a shift towards using genomic data for F calculations in the breed  thus allowing for diversity across the entire genome as well as at specific regions to be evaluated and monitored  and providing not only a more accurate assessment of inbreeding within the breed  but also a much more detailed assessment. As such  the aims of the current study were to provide genomic-based F coefficient estimates (F) for a sample of NSCT using a high-density genotyping array and to compare the rate of F to that of classical pedigree-based F (F) within the breed. Common ROH within the breed were also assessed for overlaps with previously characterized quantitative trait loci (QTL) for health and reproduction traits in the horse  thus providing a first look at genomic regions and traits that may warrant industry intervention in the future. Complete pedigree information on all raced and unraced NSCT were provided by the trotter associations in both Norway and Sweden (Det Norske Travselskap and Svensk Travsport). The pedigree consisted of 112 195 individuals with a median pedigree depth of 15 generations. In total  566 individuals born between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2009 were selected for this study based on the following criteria: (1) each horse had to have participated in at least one race during its lifetime; this restriction was implemented to allow for a broader use of the data in future analyses that will explore racing performance traits within the breed; (2) hair and/or blood samples had to be readily accessible from the pedigree registration authorities in either Norway (Department of Basic Sciences and Aquatic Medicine  Norwegian University of Life Sciences) or Sweden (Animal Genetics Laboratory  Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences); and (3) a sufficient amount of sample material had to be available to ensure high DNA quality standards. DNA was extracted from hair roots using a standard procedure of hair preparation. Briefly  186 µL of Chelex 100 Resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories  Hercules  CA) and 14 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL; Merck KgaA  Darmstadt  Germany) were added to each sample. This mix was incubated at 56 °C for 2 h and proteinase K was inactivated for 10 min at 95 °C. For DNA preparation from blood  DNA from 350-µL blood samples were extracted by using the Qiasymphony instrument and the Qiasymphony DSP DNA mini kit (Qiagen  Hilden  Germany). Prior to quality control (QC)  the dataset consisted of individuals that were genotyped with the 670K Axiom equine genotyping array (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>473) and the 670K+ Axiom equine genotyping array (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>93). Data from the two arrays were subsequently merged based on SNP name  chromosome number and position  which yielded a combined SNP dataset of 611 888 SNPs for 566 horses (SNPs located on chromosomes X and Y were excluded during this process). Then  QC was performed with the PLINK v1.07 software. SNPs were screened based on minor allele frequency (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01)  Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.0001)  and genotyping rate (><U+2009>0.95) with data that did not conform to these criteria and individuals with missing genotypes (><U+2009>15%) being removed. Descriptive data for the sample of horses used in the analyses are in Table . Inbreeding coefficients (F) were calculated based on the complete pedigree of the breed using the Contribution  Inbreeding (F)  Coancestry v1.0 software  which uses a modified algorithm of Sargolzaei et al. [] to compute inbreeding coefficients that is a fast and accurate tool for F calculations. Inconsistency between ROH-defining criteria in various industries and breeds has been shown to convolute the comparison of studies over time and across population samples [            ]. Since the criteria to define a ROH continue to remain ambiguous  in our study  we applied a wide range of ROH-defining criteria. Runs of homozygosity were defined in PLINK v1.07 using the sliding windows approach through the  command. The details of each applied threshold setting are in Table S1 (see Additional file : Table S1). Genomic inbreeding coefficients (F) were estimated for each threshold setting by dividing the summed length of all ROH (per individual) by the length of the genome (2 242 879 462 bp) covered with SNPs. Pearson correlation coefficients between F and all F were determined using the statistical software R []. Paired t-tests between all F were also performed. To better identify population-wide ROH in the breed  custom scripts in R were applied to ROH data from the threshold setting that resulted in the highest correlation between F and F. These scripts were used to determine which regions of the genome were shared in at least 95% of individuals in the sample []. Ultimately  we chose the threshold setting that resulted in the highest correlation between F and F since not only did it allow the capture of longer ROH that would subsequently be more beneficial when evaluating previously associated QTL  but it also yielded a more conservative estimate of inbreeding within the breed (i.e. an estimate that was more likely to be skewed upwards than downwards). Homozygous regions that were present in at least 95% of the sampled NSCT were then compared to previously reported QTL for reproduction and health traits in the horse (downloaded from the horse QTL database; []) using bed file comparisons in BEDOPS []. After QC  360 977 autosomal SNPs and 566 horses were available for analyses. Summary statistics  stratified by country of birth  for F are in Table . F and F of Norwegian born horses were higher than those of Swedish born horses  although the highest F estimate was found for a Swedish born horse. Median F and F for the entire cohort of sampled horses  stratified by year  are shown in Fig. . Inbreeding in the NSCT population during the 2000–2009 period increased by 1.48 and 3.15% based on F and F estimates  respectively. Average F (%) ranged from 1.78 to 13.95% (see Additional file : Table S1). Correlations between F and all F estimates were significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and ranged from 0.27 to 0.56 (see Additional file : Table S2) and Fig. . The threshold settings as defined below resulted in the highest correlation (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5629) between F and F: Size of the sliding window in SNPs: 50 SNPs.

Paired  test between all F yielded significant differences for most of the F threshold settings with only 35 (1.49%) comparisons resulting in no significant difference (see Additional file : Table S3). Variations in sliding window size  minimum length in kb and minimum number of SNPs of a run to be called as a ROH clearly altered F. The influence of different threshold settings on ROH length and ultimately on F is illustrated in Figures S1 and S2 (see Additional file : Figure S1 and file 5 Figure S2). By applying the threshold settings that resulted in the highest correlation between F and F  the average percentage of a single chromosome covered in ROH ranged from 9.84 to 18.82% (Table  Column D). Comparisons of ROH between individuals yielded 1403 regions that were present in at least 95% of the sampled horses (Fig. ). The length of these regions ranged from 1 bp to 935 kb and overlapped with 35 previously characterized QTL for reproduction and health traits (see Additional file : Table S4). A visual representation of overlapping regions is in Fig.  with a brief description of each overlapped QTL in Table . QTL associated with osteochondrosis accounted for 48.6% of the overlapped QTL with only one of the 35 QTL being associated with fertility (QTL 103450  located on  chromosome (ECA) 1). Location of runs of homozygosity (ROH) across the horse chromosomes tha are common to 95% of the sampled Norwegian–Swedish Coldblooded Trotter population. Regions containing previously characterized QTL for reproduction and health traits are shaded in blue with the shade of blue reflecting the number of QTL in the region (darker as the number of QTL increases) As expected based on previous studies in other species  the realized F in the NSCT population tended to be slightly higher than the F estimates [          ]. However  in our study  applying strict threshold settings regarding the number of heterozygous SNPs or missing calls allowed in a ROH significantly reduced correlations between F and F  and drastically altered the ability to capture longer ROH. Since size and frequency of ROH provide evidence for relatedness within and between populations  as well as details on distant and recent ancestry  the ability to capture consistently long ROH is essential for the integration of genomic data into breeding evaluation and preservation protocols for the NSCT breed [      ]. Shorter ROH (<<U+2009>1 Mb) tended to be more easily detected regardless of the ROH criteria applied  but longer ROH (><U+2009>10 Mb) were more difficult to capture when no heterozygous SNPs or missing calls were allowed in a ROH and at least 100 SNPs were required for a run to be called as a ROH. Although this seems logical since a true ROH does not include any heterozygous SNPs  the high-density equine genotyping array contains more than 670 000 SNPs. Even a genotyping error rate of only 1% could yield 6700 possibly incorrectly genotyped SNPs. Since these incorrectly genotyped SNPs  which are likely attributable to poor sample quality in the current study  tend to be randomly scattered across the entire genome  individual horses can be disproportionately affected simply by chance. Nevertheless  regardless of the ROH threshold settings applied  F in the NSCT breed appears to have steadily increased between 2000 and 2009. While the overall inbreeding level within the breed is slightly underestimated based on classical metrics  the upward trend of inbreeding level revealed by the F calculations is clearly supported by the F estimates and likely warrants additional exploration by the NSCT breeding industry—particularly in relation to the difference in inbreeding levels between Norwegian born horses and Swedish born horses (Table ). Furthermore  it is important to note the difference in F between the entire population and the sample of individuals used in our study (Fig. ). Generally speaking  inbreeding is expected to increase by 1% per generation (i.e. 7–9 years in the NSCT). This 1% increase in inbreeding level is clearly seen in the F values for the whole population  but is not so obvious for the sample of individuals analyzed here  for which a<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.5% increase was observed instead of the expected 1% over the same time period. Consequently  since the sample of individuals used in our study included only raced horses  although  not certain  it is plausible that the population of raced NSCT is perhaps slightly more inbred than the unraced population. Although NSCT is not currently considered an at risk breed  it represents unique Norwegian and Swedish genetic resources and is present on the department of agriculture’s list of horse breeds that should be preserved []. The NSCT industry has historically been at the forefront regarding the application of emerging genetic technologies in racehorses  and is currently providing F estimates  as well as estimated breeding values (EBV) for breeders and owners to use as part of their criteria for determining sire/dam pairing [  ]. While this information has undoubtedly proved valuable over the last half-century  genomic information provides the opportunity to manage NSCT breeding more effectively - particularly if it is used to produce genomic EBV. In addition  the use of genomic information to determine both inbreeding levels and relationships between individuals is also likely to have a knock-on effect on performance  increasing the accuracy of the industry’s current EBV and therefore increasing the industry’s ability to improve the performance and health of their horses. As with other species and breeds  opportunities exist for the NSCT industry to develop software programs that provide breeders with easily interpretable feedback on regions of the genome that are suboptimal from the perspective of genetic merit or that are sensitive to inbreeding within the population. Overall  1403 common ROH regions were identified within the sample of raced horses used here. There were few overlaps with known QTL for health and reproduction traits  which indicates that perhaps only a small percentage of these regions may warrant concern  at this time []. Whereas multiple ROH regions (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>17) contained QTL that are associated with osteochondrosis (OC) [   ]  it is possible that homozygosity in these regions may be optimal rather than detrimental when one considers the widely heralded robustness of the breed and that only raced horses were evaluated in our study. It is likely that both the draught horse origins of NSCT and the breeding industry’s emphasis on continued production of robust  tractable horses through artificial selection  have resulted in the breed displaying a strong resistance to the development of OC with increasing homozygosity in specific areas of the genome over time. A similar observation can also be made for the common ROH that overlap with QTL associated with recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER)  which is another condition rarely seen in NSCT []. However  additional research is required to confirm this. Increased inbreeding within a population also tends to impact fertility traits unfavorably; however  only one of the common ROH regions overlapped with a known QTL related to reproduction []  which suggests that  at present  poor fertility may not be a major concern in the NSCT breed. Nevertheless  it is strongly recommended that future genomic studies in this breed should consider the inclusion of data on fertility traits  since it will likely prove to be highly beneficial in subsequent efforts to preserve the breed’s genetic variability in the long term [  ]. In the current study  both F and F were calculated for a sample of raced NSCT with F resulting in higher inbreeding coefficients  and both methods showing a gradual increase in inbreeding between 2000 and 2009. Stricter ROH threshold criteria regarding the number of heterozygous SNPs and missing calls allowed in a ROH significantly reduced correlations between F and F and noticeably altered the chances of capturing long ROH. While the exact reasons behind this decrease in correlations are not known with certainty  the established associations between classical F estimates and recent inbreeding within a pedigree (characterized by long ROH) in other species provide some insight. Since retaining genetic variation is important to allow populations to adapt to changing environments  the integration of genomic data into their EBV and the use of molecular data to identify both genomic regions contributing to inbreeding depression and pedigree errors will likely prove invaluable as the NSCT industry moves forward in its conservation and selection efforts.

Sequence variant genotyping using  is accurate  sensitive and computationally feasible in cattle. Graph-based methods enable sequence variant genotyping from variation-aware reference genomes that may incorporate cohort-specific sequence variants  which is not possible with the current implementation of state-of-the-art methods that rely on linear reference genomes. The sequencing of important ancestors of many cattle breeds revealed millions of sequence variants that are polymorphic in dairy and beef populations [   ]. In order to compile an exhaustive catalog of polymorphic sites that segregate in   the 1000 Bull Genomes consortium was established [  ]. The 1000 Bull Genomes project imputation reference panel facilitates the inference of sequence variant genotypes for large cohorts of genotyped animals  thus enabling genomic investigations at the nucleotide level [    ]. Sequence variant discovery and genotyping typically involve two successive steps [   ]. First  raw sequencing data are generated  trimmed and filtered to remove adapter sequences and bases with low sequencing quality  and then aligned to a linear reference genome using  e.g.   [] or the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment ( software []. Second  the aligned reads are compared to the nucleotide sequence of a reference genome in order to discover and genotype polymorphic sites using  e.g.   [] or the  ( [  ]. Variant discovery may be performed either in a single- or multi-sample mode. The accuracy (i.e.  ability to correctly genotype sequence variants) and sensitivity (i.e.  ability to detect true sequence variants) of sequence variant discovery is higher using multi-sample than single-sample approaches particularly when the sequencing depth is low [    ]. However  genotyping sequence variants from multiple samples simultaneously is a computationally intensive task  particularly when the sequenced cohort is large and diverse and had been sequenced at high coverage []. The multi-sample sequence variant genotyping approach that is implemented in the  software has to be restarted for the entire cohort  once new samples are added.  implements two different approaches to multi-sample variant discovery  i.e.  the  and  modules  with the latter relying on intermediate files in gVCF format that include probabilistic data on variant and non-variant sites for each sequenced sample. Applying the  module allows to separate variant discovery within samples from the estimation of genotype likelihoods across samples. Once new samples are added to an existing cohort  only the latter needs to be performed for the entire cohort  thus enabling computationally efficient parallelization of sequence variant genotyping in a large number of samples. Sequence variant genotyping approaches that rely on alignments to a linear reference genome have limitations for variant discovery  because a haploid reference sequence does not reflect variation within a species. As a result  read alignments may be erroneous particularly at genomic regions that differ substantially between the sequenced individual and the reference sequence  thus introducing reference allele bias  flawed genotypes  and false-positive variant discovery around indels [  ]. Aligning reads to population- or breed-specific reference genomes may overcome most of these limitations [  ]. However  considering multiple (population-specific) linear reference genomes with distinct genomic coordinates complicates the biological interpretation and annotation of sequence variant genotypes across populations []. Genome graph-based methods consider non-linear reference sequences for variant discovery [    ]. A variation-aware genome graph may incorporate distinct (population-specific) reference sequences and known sequence variants. Recently  the  software has been developed in order to facilitate sequence variant discovery from a genome graph that has been constructed and iteratively augmented using variants from the sequenced cohort []. To date  sequence variant genotyping using variation-aware genome graphs has not been evaluated in cattle. An unbiased evaluation of the accuracy and sensitivity of sequence variant genotyping is possible when high confidence sequence variants and genotypes that were detected using genotyping technologies and algorithms different from those to be evaluated are available []. For species for which such a resource is not available  the accuracy of sequence variant genotyping may be evaluated by comparing sequence variant genotypes to microarray-derived genotypes (e.g.  [  ]). Due to the ascertainment bias in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip data  this comparison may overestimate the accuracy of sequence variant discovery particularly at variants that are either rare or located in less accessible genomic regions [  ]. In this study  we compared sequence variant discovery and genotyping from a variation-aware genome graph using  to two state-of-the-art methods ( and ) that rely on linear reference genomes from 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. We compared sequence variant genotypes to microarray-derived genotypes in order to assess accuracy and sensitivity of sequence variant genotyping for each of the three methods evaluated. We selected 49 Original Braunvieh (OB) bulls that were either frequently used in artificial insemination or explained a large fraction of the genetic diversity of the active breeding population. Semen straws of the bulls were purchased from an artificial insemination center and DNA was prepared following standard DNA extraction protocols. All samples were sequenced on either an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (30 animals) or an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (19 animals) sequencer using 150 bp paired-end sequencing libraries with insert sizes ranging from 400 to 450 bp. Quality control (removal of adapter sequences and bases with low quality) of the raw sequencing data was carried out using the  software (version 0.19.4) with default parameters []. The filtered reads were mapped to the UMD3.1 version of the bovine reference genome [] using  (version 0.7.12) [] with option-M to mark shorter split hits as secondary alignments  default parameters were applied in all other steps. Optical and PCR duplicates were marked using  (version 0.1.24) []. The output of  was converted into BAM format using  (version 1.3) []  and subsequently coordinate-sorted using  (version 0.6.6) []. We used the  (version 3.8)  and  modules to realign reads around indels. The realigned BAM files served as input for  base quality score recalibration using 102 092 638 unique positions from the Illumina BovineHD SNP chip and Bovine dbSNP version 150  as known variants. The  software (version 0.2.2) [] was used to extract the number of reads that covered a genomic position. We followed the best practice guidelines recommended for variant discovery and genotyping using  (version 4.0.6) with default parameters for all commands [    ]. First  genotype likelihoods were calculated separately for each sequenced animal using  []  which resulted in files in gVCF (genomic Variant Call Format) format for each sample []. The gVCF files from the 49 samples were consolidated using . Subsequently   was applied to genotype polymorphic sequence variants for all samples simultaneously.  (version 1.3) was run in a multi-sample mode as recommended in Eggertsson et al. []. Because the original implementation of  is limited to the analysis of the human chromosome complement  we cloned the  repository ()  modified the source code to allow analysis of the cattle chromosome complement  and compiled the program from the modified source code (see Additional file ). The  workflow consisted of four steps that were executed successively. First  sequence variants were identified from the read alignments that were produced using  (see above). Second  these cohort-specific variants were used to augment the UMD3.1 reference genome and construct the variation-aware genome graph. Third  the sequencing reads were locally realigned against the variation-aware graph. A clean variation graph was produced by removing unobserved haplotypes paths from the raw graph. In the final step  genotypes were identified from the realigned reads in the clean graph. The  pipeline was run in segments of 1 million bp and whenever the program failed to genotype variants for a particular segment either because it ran out of memory or exceeded the allocated runtime of 12 h  the interval was subdivided into smaller segments (10 kb). Our implementation of  (version 1.8) [] was run in a multi-sample mode to calculate genotype likelihoods from the aligned reads for all samples simultaneously. The parameters - and - were used to recalculate (and apply) base alignment quality and produce per-sample genotype annotations  respectively. Next  the estimated genotype likelihoods were converted into genotypes using  using the - and - flags to output variable sites only  and permit sites to have more than two alternative alleles  respectively. We implemented all pipelines using  (version 5.2.0) []. The scripts for the pipelines are available via  repository (). The  module was used to parse and filter the raw VCF files. Quality control on the raw sequencing variants and genotypes was applied according to guidelines that were recommended for each variant caller. Variants that were identified using  were retained if they met the following criteria: QualByDepth (QD)<U+2009>><U+2009>2.0  FisherStrand<U+2009><<U+2009>60.0  RMSMappingQuality (MQ)<U+2009>><U+2009>40.0  MappingQualityRankSumTest (MQRankSum)<U+2009>><U+2009>12.5  ReadPosRankSumTest (ReadPosRankSum)<U+2009>><U+2009>-8.0  SOR<U+2009><<U+2009>3.0 (SNPs) and QD<U+2009>><U+2009>2.0  FS<U+2009><<U+2009>200.0  ReadPosRankSum<U+2009>><U+2009>20.0  SOR<U+2009><<U+2009>10.0 (indels). For the variants identified using   the thresholds that have been applied in the 1000 Bull Genomes project [] were considered to remove variants with indication of low quality. Variants were retained if they met the following criteria: QUAL<U+2009>><U+2009>20  MQ<U+2009>><U+2009>30  ReadDepth (DP)<U+2009>><U+2009>10  DP<U+2009><<U+2009>median(DP)<U+2009>+<U+2009>3<U+2009>*<U+2009>mean(DP). Moreover  SNPs were removed from the data if they had the same positions as the starting position of an indel. The output of  was filtered so that it included only variants that met the criteria recommended by Eggertsson et al. []: ABHet<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0 | ABHet<U+2009>><U+2009>0.33  ABHom<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0 | ABHom<U+2009>><U+2009>0.97  MaxAASR<U+2009>><U+2009>0.4  and MQ<U+2009>><U+2009>30. We used  (version 4.1) [] to improve the raw sequence variant genotype quality and impute missing genotypes. The genotype likelihood () mode of  was applied to infer missing and modify existing genotypes based on the phred-scaled likelihoods () of all other non-missing genotypes of the 49 Original Braunvieh animals in our study. To ensure consistent variant representation across the different sequence variant genotyping methods evaluated  we applied the  software (version 0.5) []. Normalized variants are parsimonious (i.e.  represented by as few nucleotides as possible) and left aligned []. The number of variants detected and transition to transversion (Ti/Tv) ratios were calculated using  [] and  []. The intersection of variants that were common to the evaluated tools was calculated and visualized using  [] and the UpSet R package []  respectively. Mendelian inconsistencies were calculated as the proportion of variants showing opposing homozygous genotypes in nine parent–offspring pairs that were included in the 49 sequenced animals. For this comparison  we considered only the sites for which the genotypes of both sire and son were not missing. All 49 sequenced cattle were also genotyped using either the Illumina BovineHD (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>29) or the BovineSNP50 (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) Bead chip that comprise 777 962 and 54 001 SNPs  respectively. The average genotyping rate at autosomal SNPs was 98.91%. In order to assess the quality of sequence variant genotyping  the genotypes detected by the different variant calling methods were compared to the array-called genotypes in terms of genotype concordance  non-reference sensitivity and non-reference discrepancy [  ]  and for more details on the metrics (see Additional file ). Non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were applied to determine if any of the three metrics differed significantly between the three tools evaluated. All computations were performed on the ETH Zurich Leonhard Open Cluster with access to multiple nodes equipped with 18 cores Intel Xeon E5-2697v4 processors (base frequency rated at 2.3 GHz) and 128 GB of random-access memory. Unless otherwise stated  the R (version 3.3.3) software environment [] was used for statistical analyses and ggplot2 (version 3.0.0) [] was used for data visualisation. Following quality control (removal of adapter sequences and low-quality bases)  we aligned more than 13 billion paired-end reads (2<U+2009>×<U+2009>125 and 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>150 bp) from 49 Original Braunvieh cattle to the UMD3.1 assembly of the bovine genome. On average  98.44% (91.06–99.59%) of the reads mapped to the reference genome and 4.26% (2.0–10.91%) of these were flagged as duplicates and not considered for further analyses. Sequencing depth ranged from 6.00 to 37.78 with an average depth per animal of 12.75 and was above 12-fold for 31 samples. Although the realignment of sequencing reads around indels is no longer required when sequence variants are genotyped using the latest version of  (v 4)  it is still recommended to improve the genotyping of indels by using . To ensure a fair comparison of the three tools evaluated  we realigned the reads around indels on all BAM files and used the re-aligned files as a starting point for our comparisons (Fig. ). The sequencing read data of 49 cattle were deposited at European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) () under primary accession PRJEB28191. Schematic representation of the three sequence variant discovery and genotyping methods evaluated. According to the best practice recommendations for sequence variant discovery using   the VQSR module should be applied to distinguish between true and false positive variants. Because this approach requires a truth set of variants  which is not (publicly) available for cattle  the VQSR module was not considered in our evaluation Polymorphic sites (SNPs  indels) were discovered and genotyped in the 49 animals using either  (version 4)   (version 1.3) or  (version 1.8). All software programs were run using default parameters and workflow descriptions for variant discovery (Fig.  and also see Methods). Only autosomal sequence variants were considered to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of sequence variant genotyping. Because variant filtering has a strong impact on the accuracy and sensitivity of sequence variant genotyping [  ]  we evaluated both the raw variants that were detected using default parameters for variant discovery (Fig. ) and variants that remained after applying filtering criteria that are commonly used but may differ slightly between different software tools. Note that  was run by using the suggested filtering parameters  when application of  (VQSR) is not possible. Using default parameters for variant discovery for each of the software programs evaluated  21 140 196  20 262 913  and 20 668 459 polymorphic sites were discovered using  and   respectively (Table . The vast majority (86.79  89.42 and 85.11%) of the detected variants were biallelic SNPs. Of the 18 594 182  18 120 724 and 17 592 038 SNPs detected using    and   respectively  7.46  8.31 and 5.02% were novel  i.e.  they were not among the 102 091 847 polymorphic sites of the most recent version (150) of the Bovine dbSNP database. The Ti/Tv ratio of the detected SNPs was equal to 2.09  2.07 and 2.05 using    and   respectively. Using  revealed four times more multiallelic SNPs (246 220) than either  or . We identified 2 478 489  2 044 585  and 3 076 421 indels using     and   respectively  and 26.78%  29.15%  and 41.75% of them were novel.  revealed the largest number and highest proportion (14.9%) of indels. Between 12 and 14% of the detected indels were multiallelic. While  and  identified more (12%) deletions than insertions  the proportions were almost the same using . On average  each Original Braunvieh cattle carried between 7 and 8 million variants that differed from the UMD3.1 reference genome. Of these  between 2.4 and 2.6 million SNPs were homozygous for the alternate allele  between 3.8 and 4.7 million SNPs were heterozygous and between 0.7 and 1 million were indels (Table ). An intersection of 15 901 526 biallelic SNPs was common to all sequence-variant discovery tools evaluated (Fig. a)  i.e.  between 85.51 and 90.39% of the detected SNPs of each tool  and 466 029 (2.93%  Ti/Tv: 1.81) of them were novel  i.e.  they were not present in dbSNP 150. The Ti/Tv-ratio of the common SNPs was 2.22.  had the largest number of SNPs in common with the other two tools (90.39%). The number of private SNPs  i.e.  SNPs that were detected by one but not the other tools was largest for  and smallest for . Number of biallelic SNPs () and indels () identified in 49 Original Braunvieh cattle using three sequence variant genotyping methods. Blue horizontal bars represent the total number of sites discovered for each method. Vertical bars indicate private and common variants detected by the methods evaluated In total  1 299 467 biallelic indels (Fig. b) were common to all evaluated tools and 98 931 (13.13%) of these were novel  i.e.  they were not present in dbSNP 150. The intersection among the three tools was considerably smaller for indels than for SNPs.  had the highest proportion of indels in common with the other tools (74.11%).  discovered the largest number (2 704 413) of biallelic indels and most of them (41.26%) were not detected using either  or .  (21.2%) and  (12.38%) discovered fewer private indels than . The 49 sequenced animals were also genotyped using either the Illumina BovineHD or the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. Genotype concordance  non-reference sensitivity and non-reference discrepancy were calculated using array-called and sequence variant genotypes at corresponding positions. Genotype concordance is a measure of the proportion of variants that have identical genotypes on the microarray and in whole-genome sequencing data. Non-reference sensitivity is the proportion of microarray-derived variants that were also detected in the sequencing data. Non-reference discrepancy reflects the proportion of sequence variants that have genotypes that differ from the microarray-derived genotypes [for more details on how the different metrics were calculated (see Additional file )]. All metrics were calculated both for raw and filtered variants either before or after applying the algorithm implemented in the  software for haplotype phasing and imputation. In the raw data  the proportion of missing non-reference sites was 1.90%  0.56%  and 0.47% using    and  respectively. The genotype concordance between the sequence- and microarray-derived genotypes was higher (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.005) when  (97.72%) was used than when either  (97.68%) or  (95.99%) was used (Table ). For the three tools evaluated  the genotype concordance was higher at homozygous than heterozygous sites  particularly in animals that were sequenced at low depth (see Additional file ) In order to take the variable proportions of missing genotypes in the sequence variants into account  we calculated non-reference sensitivity and non-reference discrepancy. Non-reference sensitivity was almost identical using  (98.26%) and  (98.21%). However  non-reference sensitivity was clearly lower using  (93.81%  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Non-reference discrepancy was lower using  (3.53%) than using either  (3.6%  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003) or  (6.35%  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Next  we analysed the proportion of opposing homozygous genotypes for SNPs and indels in nine sire-son pairs that were included among the sequenced animals (Table ). We observed that SNPs that were discovered using either  or  had almost a similar proportion of genotypes with Mendelian inconsistencies in the full and filtered datasets  whereas the values were two times higher using . The proportion of opposing homozygous genotypes was higher for indels than SNPs for all the tools evaluated. However  in the full and filtered datasets  it was lower when  was used than when either  or  was used. Using filtering parameters that are commonly applied for the three evaluated tools (see Methods)  we excluded 1 378 517 (6.52%  Ti/Tv 1.24)  2 583 758 (12.75%  Ti/Tv 1.47) and 1 796 910 (8.69%  Ti/Tv 1.36) variants due to low mapping or genotyping quality from the     and  datasets  respectively. The genotype concordance between sequence- and microarray-derived genotypes was slightly higher for the filtered than the raw genotypes  but the non-reference sensitivity was lower for the filtered than the raw genotypes  which indicates that the filtering step also removed some true variant sites from the raw data (Table ). The filtering step had almost no effect on the proportion of Mendelian inconsistencies detected in the nine sire-son pairs (Table ). We used the  software to refine the primary genotype calls and infer missing genotypes in the raw and filtered datasets. Following imputation  the quality of the sequence variant genotypes increased for all evaluated tools particularly for the individuals that had a sequencing coverage less than 12-fold (Fig. ). The largest increase in the concordance metrics was observed for the sequence variants that were obtained using  (Tables  and ). Following imputation  the variants identified using  had a significantly higher quality (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) for eight out of the ten metrics evaluated. Accuracy and sensitivity of sequence variant genotyping at different sequencing depths. Genotype concordance  non-reference sensitivity and non-reference discrepancy were calculated for 49 Original Braunvieh cattle considering either raw (red) or filtered and imputed (blue) sequence variant genotypes. The grey points represent overlays of the results from the other methods The quality of the sequence variant genotypes  particularly before  genotype phasing and imputation  was influenced by the variable depth of coverage for the 49 sequenced samples of our study (Fig. ). When we restricted the evaluations to 31 samples that had an average sequencing depth above 12-fold  the three tools performed almost identically (see Additional file ). However  the performance of  was significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) higher for 12 (out of the total 20) metrics than either that of  or . When 18 samples with an average sequencing depth lower than 12-fold were considered  the differences observed in the three metrics were more pronounced between the three tools. In samples with a low sequencing coverage   performed significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) better than either  or  for all concordance metrics both before and after filtering and  imputation  except for the non-reference sensitivity. The multi-sample sequence variant genotyping pipelines that were implemented using either  or  were run separately for each chromosome in a single-threading mode. The  module took between 3.07 and 11.4 CPU hours and required between 0.12 and 0.25 gigabytes (GB) peak random-access memory (RAM) per chromosome. To genotype 20 668 459 sequence variants in 49 animals   mpileup required 192 CPU hours (Fig. ). Computing time required to genotype all autosomal sequence variants in 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. The runtime of  and  is shown for the different steps (see Fig.  for more details) For   we submitted 1421 parallel jobs of the  module (i.e.  one job for each animal and chromosome) that required between 3.9 and 12.3 GB RAM and between 0.36 and 11 CPU hours to complete. To process 29 chromosomes in 49 samples  the  module required 2428 CPU hours. Subsequently  we ran the  module  which required between 7.98 and 20.88 GB RAM and between 2.81 and 19.31 CPU hours per chromosome.  required between 4.33 and 17.32 GB of RAM and between 1.81 and 14.01 h per chromosome. To genotype 21 140 196 polymorphic sequence variants in 49 animals  the  pipeline required 2792 CPU hours (Fig. ). The  pipeline including construction of the variation graph and genotyping of sequence variants was run in parallel for 2538 non-overlapping segments of 1 million bp as recommended by Eggertson et al. []. The peak RAM required by  was between 1 and 3 GB per segment. Twelve segments  for which  either ran out of memory or did not finish within the allocated time  were subdivided into smaller segments of 10 kb and subsequently re-run (Additional file ). The genotyping of 20 262 913 polymorphic sites in 49 animals using our implementation of the  pipeline required 1066 CPU hours (Fig. ). The computing resources required by  and  increased linearly with chromosome length. The computing time required to genotype sequence variants was highly heterogeneous along the genome using . The CPU time for a 1-Mb segment ranged from 0.196 to 10.11 h  with an average CPU time of 0.42 h. We suspected that flaws in the reference genome might increase the complexity of the variation-aware graph and that the construction of the graph might benefit from an improved assembly. To test this hypothesis  we re-mapped the sequencing reads to the recently released new bovine reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2  ) and repeated the graph-based sequence variant discovery. Indeed  we did observe a decrease in the computing time required to genotype polymorphic sites (particularly at chromosomes 12  27 and 29) and a more uniform runtime along the genome  which possibly indicates that graph-based variant discovery in cattle will be faster and more accurate with highly contiguous reference sequences (Fig. ).

Each dot represents an interval of 1 million bp. Blue and red colours represent values for the UMD3.1 and ARS-UCD1.2 versions of the bovine assembly  respectively We used either     or  to discover and genotype polymorphic sequence variants in whole-genome sequencing data of 49 Original Braunvieh cattle that were sequenced at between 6 and 38-fold genome coverage. Whereas  and  discover variants from a linear reference genome   locally realigns reads to a variation-aware reference graph that incorporates cohort-specific sequence variants []. Our graph-based variant discovery pipeline that is implemented by using the  software used the existing bovine reference sequence to construct the genome graph. Subsequently  the graph was augmented with variants that were detected from linear alignments of the 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. The use of more sophisticated genome graph-based approaches that have been developed very recently facilitates the mapping of raw sequencing reads directly against a genome graph without the need to first align reads towards a linear reference genome []. Whereas genome graph-based variant discovery has been explored recently in mammalian-sized genomes [      ]  our work is the first to apply graph-based sequence variant genotyping in cattle. In order to evaluate graph-based variant discovery in cattle  we compared accuracy and sensitivity of  to   and    i.e.  two state-of-the-art methods on linear reference genomes that have been evaluated thoroughly in many species including cattle [  ]. We ran each tool with default parameters for variant discovery and applied commonly used or recommended filtration criteria. However  our evaluation of the software tools may suffer from ascertainment bias because we relied on SNPs that are included in bovine SNP arrays  i.e.  they are located predominantly at genomic regions where variants are easy to identify [    ]. Thus  the global accuracy and sensitivity of sequence variant discovery might be overestimated in our study. However  this ascertainment bias is unlikely to affect the relative performance of the methods evaluated. In 49 Original Braunvieh cattle  sequence variant genotyping was more accurate using  than either  or  Differences in accuracy are small between the three tools  particularly when samples are sequenced at an average coverage higher than 12-fold (see Additional file ). Yet   performed significantly better than  and  for samples sequenced at medium (><U+2009>12-fold) or low (<<U+2009>12-fold) coverage indicating that genome graph-based variant discovery in cattle is accurate across a wide range of sequencing depths.  might perform better than observed in our study  when the VQSR module is applied to train the variant filtration algorithm on true and false variants []. However  to the best of our knowledge  the required sets of true and false variants are not available in cattle. An intersection of variants detected by different sequence variant genotyping software may be considered as a truth set (e.g.  []) and compiling such a set is possible using the 49 samples from our study. However  a truth set that has been constructed from the data that are used for evaluation is likely to be depleted for variants that are difficult to discover in the target data set  thus preventing an unbiased evaluation of variant calling []. Variants from the 1000 Bull Genomes project [  ] could potentially serve as a truth/training set. However  variants from the 1000 Bull Genomes project were detected from short read sequencing data using either  or   i.e.  technologies and software that are part of our evaluation  thus precluding an unbiased comparison of variant discovery between     and  []. Vander Jagt et al. [] showed in a subset of samples from the 1000 Bull Genomes project that  VQSR does not notably improve the concordance between sequence-derived and microarray-called genotypes compared to  hard filtering. Interestingly  the proportion of opposing homozygous genotypes in sire/offspring pairs was slightly higher in their study using  VQSR than  hard-filtering as used by the 1000 Bull Genomes project []. Applying  VQSR to the variants of our dataset corroborates the findings of Vander Jagt et al. [] (see Additional file ). Considering that the quality of the truth/training sets has a strong impact on the capabilities of VQSR (Additional file ) and that high-confidence variants are currently not publicly available for cattle  we report  results using the recommended filtering parameters when VQSR is not possible. Regardless of the method evaluated  we observed heterozygous under-calling in animals that are sequenced at low coverage  i.e.  heterozygous variants were erroneously genotyped as homozygous due to an insufficient number of sequencing reads supporting the heterozygous genotype [    ]. In agreement with previous studies [  ]   imputation improved genotype concordance and reduced heterozygous under-calling particularly in individuals that are sequenced at low coverage. After the imputation step  the genotype concordance  non-reference sensitivity  and non-reference discrepancy of the three tools were almost identical  which indicates that genotyping sequence variants from samples with a medium genome coverage is possible at high accuracy (at least for common variants in more accessible regions of the genome) using any of the three tools evaluated and subsequent  error correction. While such conclusions have been drawn previously for  and  [  ]  our findings demonstrate that the genotype likelihoods estimated from the  software are also compatible with and benefit from the imputation algorithm implemented in the  software. Considering that sequence data are enriched for rare variants that are more difficult to impute than common variants from SNP microarrays []  the benefits from  error correction might be overestimated in our study. An integration of phasing and imputation of missing genotypes directly in a graph-based variant genotyping approach would simplify sequence variant genotyping from variation-aware graphs [    ]. Using  for variant genotyping and  for genotype refinement enabled us to genotype sequence variants in 49 Original Braunvieh cattle at a genotypic concordance of 99.52%  i.e.  higher than previously achieved using either  or  for variant calling in cattle that are sequenced at a similar genome coverage [       ]; this indicates that graph-based variant discovery might improve sequence variant genotyping. However  applying the filtering criteria that are recommended for  [] removed more variants from the  (12.75%) than from either  (6.52%) or  (8.69%) datasets. It should be mentioned that  VQSR would remove considerably more variants from the  dataset than  hard filtering as applied in our study (see Additional file ). Fine-tuning of the variant filtering parameters is necessary to further increase the accuracy and sensitivity of sequencing variant genotyping  particularly for  [  ]. Moreover  the accuracy and sensitivity of graph-based variant discovery may be higher when known variants are considered for the initial construction of the variation graph []. Indeed  we observed a slight increase in genotype concordance (see Additional file ) when we used  to genotype sequence variants from a variation-aware genome-graph that incorporated bovine variants listed in dbSNP 150. However  additional research is required to prioritize a set of variants to augment bovine genome graphs for different cattle breeds []. Using microarray-derived genotypes as a truth set may overestimate the accuracy of sequence variant discovery particularly at variants that are rare or located in less accessible regions of the genome. Moreover  it does not allow assessment of the accuracy and sensitivity of indel discovery because variants other than SNPs are currently not routinely genotyped with commercially available microarrays. Estimating the proportion of opposing homozygous genotypes between parent–offspring pairs may be a useful diagnostic metric to detect sequencing artefacts or flawed genotypes at indels []. Our results show that genotypes at indels are more accurate using  than either  or  because  produced less opposing homozygous genotypes at indels in nine sire-son pairs than the other methods both in the raw and filtered datasets. These findings are in line with those reported by Eggertsson et al. []  who showed that the mapping of the sequencing reads to a variation-aware graph could improve read alignment nearby indels  thus enabling highly accurate sequence variant genotyping also for variants other than SNPs. Recently  Garrison et al. [] showed that graph-based variant discovery may also mitigate reference allele bias. An assessment of reference allele bias was  however  not possible in our study because the sequencing depth was too low for most samples. In our study   required less computing time than  to genotype sequence variants for 49 individuals.  required the least computing resources  probably because the implemented  algorithm produces genotypes from the aligned reads without performing the computationally intensive local realignment of the reads. However  with an increasing number of samples  the multi-sample variant genotyping implementation of the  module seems to be more efficient than  because variant discovery within samples can be separated from the joint genotyping across samples [  ]. A highly parallelized graph-based variant discovery pipeline also offers a computationally feasible and scalable framework for variant discovery in thousands of samples []. However  the computing time necessary for graph-based variant genotyping might be high in genomic regions where the nucleotide diversity is high or the assembly is flawed [  ]. In our study  the algorithm implemented in the  software failed to finish within the allocated time for 12 1-Mb segments including a segment on chromosome 12 that contains a large segmental duplication [    ] possibly because many mis-mapped reads increased graph complexity. The region on chromosome 12 contains an unusually large number of sequence variants and has been shown to suffer from low accuracy of imputation [].  also failed to finish within the allocated time for a region on chromosome 23 that encompasses the bovine major histocompatibility complex  which is known to have a high level of diversity. Our results show that  may also produce genotypes for problematic segments when they are split and processed in smaller parts. Moreover  most of these problems disappeared when we considered the latest assembly of the bovine genome  which possibly corroborates that more complete and contiguous genome assemblies may facilitate more reliable genotyping from variation-aware graphs [  ]. Genome graphs facilitate sequence variant discovery from non-linear reference genomes. Sequence variant genotyping from a variation-aware graph is possible in cattle using . Sequence variant genotyping at both SNPs and indels is more accurate and sensitive using  than either  or . The proportion of Mendelian inconsistencies at both SNPs and indels is low using   which indicates that sequence variant genotyping from a variation-aware genome graph facilitates accurate variant discovery at different types of genetic variation. Considering highly informative variation-aware genome graphs that have been constructed from multiple breed-specific de-novo assemblies and high-confidence sequence variants may facilitate more accurate  sensitive and unbiased sequence variant genotyping in cattle.

Cattle is one of the most important domestic animals in human history. Both breeding programs and genetic studies in cattle depend largely on the availability of a reliable cattle reference genome [] and reference populations []. In addition  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified valuable links between genetic variants and variations in complex traits [  ]. For example  numerous GWAS have been conducted in cattle to investigate production traits such as milk yield [  ]  milk composition []  and mastitis [  ]. However  GWAS alone cannot distinguish causative variants from variants which are in perfect  or near-perfect  linkage disequilibrium (LD) with them. To address this problem  additional information from independent sources are needed. For example  gene expression data have facilitated the identification of candidate genes from GWAS data []  and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data [  ] have helped map causative variants within regulatory regions. More recently  Brown et al. [] proposed a ‘causal-variant evidence mapping using nonparametric resampling’ (CaVEMaN) method to pinpoint causative mutations in eQTL studies. By integrating eQTL data with results from GWAS  genes with expression levels that are associated with complex traits due to pleiotropic effects (e.g.  when both gene expression and trait variation are affected) can be identified []. However  large-scale eQTL studies can be expensive because they require generation of RNAseq data specific to the population under study  especially in the case of livestock species for which initiatives such as the GTEx [] project in humans do not exist. Due to many reasons  such as LD  inaccuracy of imputation  random sampling errors  etc.  the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may not be the causative one []. Using additional information to prioritize variants within the QTL interval has become a popular strategy []. It was recently demonstrated that the use of a variant annotation tool [] and its evolutionary conservation score [] can help prioritize variants. In particular  variant annotation can be used across different studies without being tissue- or trait-specific. The power to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes may be further improved by using functional annotation information [  ]. For example  Sveinbjornsson et al. [] reported an increase in power for the detection of associations when an annotation enrichment-based weighted Bonferroni adjustment was used to correct for family-wise error rate (FWER). In this study  we implemented a previously proposed  category-based Bonferroni adjustment based on the enrichment (the probability of a causal variant being from a category divided by the probability of a non-causal variant being from the same category) of variant annotations observed for association signals [] that were obtained from a GWAS conducted in Nordic Holstein cattle. This adjustment is based on the hypothesis that different types of variants have varying probabilities of being causal mutations  which means the enriched categories of variants could have lower thresholds estimated from their enrichment. The GWAS results for 17 quantitative traits were used to extract the lead SNP along with other significant SNPs showing LD (r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.2) with the lead SNPs  as potential causal variants to estimate the enrichment of each of the annotated variants’ categories. We make the hypothesis that the category-based significance threshold will increase the power of a GWAS study. We tested this hypothesis by performing an association study on stature in cattle and comparing the results with those of a previously reported large meta-analysis in cattle stature and genes reported for human height. Since  no animal experiments were performed in this study  approval from an ethics committee was not required. Phenotypic records on 17 traits/indices for Nordic Holstein cattle were obtained from a central national database (Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation (NAV)  ). For details on the genetic evaluations performed for these 17 traits/indices in Nordic countries  see . The phenotypic values used in the association analysis included de-regressed proofs that were derived for animals based on the effective daughter contributions of sires and maternal grandsires [  ]  which were obtained from the NAV routine genetic evaluations by using the MiX99 software []. De-regressed proofs were available for 5373 sires (the total number of animals varying according to trait). A short description of the 17 traits/indices is presented in Additional file : Table S1. An association study was performed by using imputed WGS data  as previously described by Iso-Touru et al. [] and Wu et al. []. A total of 4921 bulls were genotyped with versions 1 or 2 of the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (54 k) system (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). The 54 k genotypes were imputed to the WGS level by using a 2-step approach []. First  all the animals were imputed to a high-density (HD) level  by using IMPUTE2 v2.3.1 and a multi-breed reference of 3383 animals (1222 Holsteins  1326 Nordic Red Dairy Cattle  and 835 Danish Jerseys)  which had previously been genotyped with the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip []. The distribution of imputation accuracies according to minor allele frequency is described in []. These imputed HD genotypes were imputed with Minimac2 [] to the WGS level by using a multi-breed reference of a total of 1228 animals that included 1148 animals from  of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project [] (288 Holstein  56 Nordic Red Dairy cattle  61 Jersey cattle  and 743 cattle from other breeds [])  and 80 animals from Aarhus University (23 Holsteins  30 Nordic Red Dairy cattle  and 27 Danish Jerseys). The 1000 Bull Genome Project data are described in Daetwyler et al. [] and the whole-genome sequence data from Aarhus University are described in Brøndum et al. []. A total of 22 751 039 bi-allelic variants were present in these imputed sequence data. After excluding SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 1%  and SNPs that deviate from Hardy–Weinberg proportions (P<U+2009><<U+2009>1.0)  16 503 508 SNPs on 29 autosomes in Nordic Holstein cattle were retained for association analyses. We performed a GWAS according to a previously described approach []. First  a single SNP GWAS analysis was performed by using GCTA [] for each chromosome as the first round. Next  SNPs were ranked based on their -<U+2009>log (P) values. The SNP with the highest -<U+2009>log (P) value  referred to as the lead SNP  was identified for each chromosome. If the -<U+2009>log (P) value of the lead SNP exceeded 8.5 (a threshold value representing a 0.05 type I error-rate after Bonferroni correction for 16 503 508 simultaneous tests  e.g.  -<U+2009>log (P)<U+2009>˜<U+2009>8.5)  the SNP genotype dosage was fitted as a covariate  and rerun in association analyses for the same chromosome as a second round. If the result of this second round detected another SNP with a -<U+2009>log (P) value exceeding 8.5  and this SNP was also significant in the first round (e.g.  -<U+2009>log (P)<U+2009>><U+2009>8.5)  we fitted it as another covariate  and then scanned the chromosome in a third round. This same procedure was repeated for each chromosome until no additional SNPs remained significant. A list of the lead SNPs identified in each round was compiled. In each round  we checked whether the lead SNP was the only significant SNP identified within<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 Mb of flanking region. If it was  the SNP was not considered as a lead SNP since it could represent a false positive or be mapped to a wrong location in the genome. Details regarding the 17 traits and the GWAS results are in Additional file : Table S1. Stature in cattle is measured from the top of the spine between the hips to the ground. In Denmark  this trait is measured in cm. We performed a GWAS for stature according to the method described above. However  first we removed extreme phenotypic records according to Tukey’s rules of quartiles<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.5<U+2009>× interquartile range. The remaining 4832 phenotypic records were associated with 15 535 049 imputed SNPs. The number of markers used for association with stature differs from that used in the GWAS conducted for the 17 traits (described above) since the set of sires was not exactly the same in both analyses. PLINK was used to estimate pairwise LD (r) between lead SNPs and all the other SNPs on the same chromosome. All SNPs that had an r with the lead SNPs higher than 0.2 were extracted. The SNPs that were not significant in the association study were discarded in order to generate a list of possible causal variants. These SNPs were annotated with the variants effect predictor (VEP) (version 92.0) software []. The variants were subsequently classified into annotation categories according to the impact for the consequence type predicted by VEP. When a SNP had multiple annotations  the annotation with the highest impact predicted by VEP was retained. Information on transposase-accessible chromatin  i.e. ATAC-seq peaks []  as well as histone modifications  i.e. H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 peaks []  were retrieved from previously published studies. The locations of the UTR regions were obtained from Ensembl []. The locations of predicted regulatory elements (RE) were also obtained from a previous study []  while the locations of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were retrieved from the RNAcentral database []. Methods to assess the enrichment of each category  the enrichment confidence intervals  and weighted Bonferroni corrections were previously described []. We classified all the variants based on the VEP annotation: (1) high impact variants (e.g.  stop_gained  stop_lost  start_lost  frameshift  splice_acceptor  and splice_donor variants)  (2) moderate impact variants (missense_variants)  (3) low impact variants (synonymous  stop_retained  upstream_gene  downstream_gene and splice_region variants)  and (4) other variants (including SNPs with a consequence predicted as “modifier”). In addition  we further classified other variants (annotated by VEP as “modifier”) using open chromatin (OC) information to two categories  which resulted in a total of five categories: (1) high impact variants  (2) moderate impact variants  (3) low impact variants  (4.1) OC variants (annotated by VEP as “modifer” and located at ATAC-seq peaks [] or H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 peaks [])  and (4.2) variants with no known function i.e. NKF variants (including SNPs with a consequence predicted as “modifier”  which were not located in OC). Finally  we further classified the NKF variants (category-4.2 above) into four categories leading to a total of eight categories. The four NKF categories were: (4.2.1) variants located within 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR)  (4.2.2) variants located in predicted RE according to a recently proposed algorithm based on conservation among mammals []  (4.2.3) variants located within ncRNAs retrieved from the RNAcentral database []  and (4.2.4) variants with no known information (NKI) predicted as “modifier” and not located in any of these first three types of sequence. First  we considered UTR  since these regions mediate the initiation and termination of translation. Next  we considered the experimental datasets of accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) [] and active motifs (H3K27Ac and H3K4me3) []. Second  we considered RE for two reasons: (1) because promoters and transcription factor binding sites are near transcription start sites [  ]  and regions proximal to genes tend to exhibit greater enrichment of significantly associated variants in GWAS []; and (2) predicted RE can potentially help identify causal mutations []. ncRNAs play a major role in gene expression regulation []  although their specific functions are largely unknown []. The detailed classification of variants is in Additional file : Table S2. According to Sveinbjornsson et al. []  we estimated the probability of a causal variant being a particular annotation type (according to the five or eight categories that we established in this study) by using a maximum likelihood method. Accordingly  the enrichment of an annotation category was estimated based on the probability of a causal variant being from a class  divided by its genomic frequency. The significance threshold for each annotation category was then estimated based on a category-based Bonferroni correction threshold that was established based on enrichment of the annotation class. For example  for a total number of sequence variants tested ()  the number of variants in an annotation category  ()  and enrichment of category  ()   is the category to which the th sequence variant belongs with enrichment   and the weight for the th sequence variant is []: where  and  are weighted significance thresholds for the  variant and Bonferroni corrected FWER  respectively. Association signals (QTL) were resampled 100 times with replacement. For each resample  we estimated enrichment for annotation categories and calculated the averages and 95% confidence intervals. The code for bootstrapping procedure is included in the R code provided in Additional file  together with the code for enrichment estimation. A total of 5373 animals with 16 503 508 imputed SNPs were subjected to GWAS for 17 traits. A previously described pipeline [] was used to detect the ‘lead’ variants that showed the highest association for each association signal. A total of 261 QTL (see Additional file : Table S1) were detected with a genome-wide association significance threshold of -<U+2009>log()<U+2009>><U+2009>8.5. Significant associations were observed for 16 of the 17 traits examined (see Additional file : Table S1). Due to long-range LD in the bovine genome []  sequence variants that were in LD with the lead SNPs (r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.2) and genome-wide significant were identified as possibly causal. In total  78 593 possibly causal variants on 29 autosomes were selected for further analysis. The variant effect predictor (VEP) software (version 92.0) [] was used to predict the maximal consequence of the variants on the nearest genes (e.g.  within 5-kb flanking regions). A summary of the annotations obtained is in Fig. . Most of the annotated variants are intergenic variants or intron variants (Fig. a). Among the coding sequences  the most abundant variants are synonymous variants and missense variants (Fig. b). We also examined the distribution of annotations among the possible causal variants and the lead variants. The total number of variants in these two sets were equal to 78 593 and 261  respectively. The overall distributions of the annotations for these two groups (Fig. c–f  respectively) were similar to that of the entire set of variants (Fig. a  b). We also observed that no high impact variants (e.g.  “stop gained” or “start lost” variants) were present among the lead SNPs identified. VEP annotations for the variants examined in this study.  Overall distribution of VEP annotations for all variants.  Annotation distribution for the variants present in coding sequences of all variants ()  for possible causal variants from the LD analysis   for possible causal variants in coding sequences from the LD analysis   for lead variants  and  for lead variants in coding sequences Based on the VEP-derived annotations  we classified all the annotation types obtained into four categories: (1) high impact variants  (2) moderate impact variants  (3) low impact variants  and (4) other variants. The other variants included SNPs that were annotated by VEP as intergenic variants  and those with a consequence predicted as “modifier”. A plot of category enrichment is in Fig. . In contrast with the results of previous GWAS that involved quantitative and binary phenotypes in humans []  low impact variants were the most enriched (245-fold enrichment) category instead of the high impact variants (Table ). The next most enriched category was the moderate impact variants  and these exhibited a fivefold enrichment (Table ). We did not observe enrichment for high impact variants and ‘other variants’. Enrichment of VEP and OC annotations for the four-category annotation system. Relative enrichments for four categories of variants. The error bars indicate the standard errors derived by bootstrapping. Enrichment is shown on the y-axis on a logarithmic scale While an extensive dataset of DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS) is available for the human genome []  such data are much more limited for the bovine genome. However  an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with a high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) dataset for cattle was recently generated to explore accessible chromatin regions in the bovine genome []. In addition  a histone modification dataset (for H3K27Ac and H3K4me3) was created to mark active motifs across the bovine genome []. Therefore  in combination with VEP-derived annotations  we classified all the annotation types obtained into five categories: (1) high impact variants  (2) moderate impact variants  (3) low impact variants  (4) open chromatin (OC) variants  and (5) variants with no known function (NKF). The latter included variants that are not known to affect biological processes  including SNPs annotated by VEP as intergenic variants  and those with a consequence predicted as “modifier” which were not located within OC regions. A plot of category enrichment is in Fig. . In contrast with the results of a previous GWAS that involved quantitative and binary phenotypes in humans []  low impact variants were the most enriched (405-fold enrichment) category instead of the high impact variants. Moreover  in spite of a large variance in the interval of enrichment for the low impact variants  the lower boundary still represented a high level of enrichment (Table ). The next most enriched category was the moderate impact variants  and these exhibited a fivefold enrichment  followed by the high impact variants that exhibited a fourfold enrichment. The lower boundary of the high impact variants was not enriched and this category included only 19 variants (Table ). Furthermore  enrichment was observed only for 2 of 100 replicates (with values of 177-fold and 133-fold  respectively; (see Additional file : Table S3). Therefore  we did not consider that these high impact variants were true positives. Finally  the OC category exhibited a 2.5-fold enrichment. Based on these enrichment values  a category-based significance threshold was calculated for each variant category (Table ). Enrichment of VEP and OC annotations for the five-category annotation system. Relative enrichments for four categories of variants. The error bars indicate the standard errors derived by bootstrapping. Enrichment is shown on the y-axis on a logarithmic scale The enrichment observed for each of these eight categories (including sub-categories from ‘modifiers’) is provided in Table  and represented in Fig. . The most enriched variants were high impact variants (33.69-fold enrichment)  which is similar to the enrichment profile of human variants reported in []. The moderate impact variants exhibited a 17.16-fold enrichment and the low impact variants exhibited a 7.30-fold enrichment. The ncRNA category exhibited a 22.70-fold enrichment  the UTR category exhibited a 16.64-fold enrichment  and the OC and RE categories exhibited 3.59-fold and 2.53-fold enrichments  respectively. Enrichment of VEP annotations and further classification of NKF variants into UTR  RE  and ncRNA in an eight-category annotation system. Relative enrichments for seven categories of variants are presented. Error bars indicate standard error values derived from bootstrapping. Enrichment is shown on the y-axis according to a logarithmic scale To assess the power of using annotation category-based significance thresholds  we applied this approach to a GWAS conducted for stature in cattle and identified 35 QTL on 21 chromosomes (see Additional file : Figure S1 and Additional file : Table S4). The number of significant variants within each of the four  five and eight categories of classified annotations (as described above) are in Tables    and   respectively. When adjusted thresholds based on the four-category classifications were used in comparison with a flat Bonferroni multiple-testing correction across the tested variants  the total number of significant variants increased from 58 539 to 58 992 (Table ). Then  when we checked whether the additional genes that were identified with the category-based thresholds had been previously identified as candidate genes in a meta-analysis study on bovine stature []  we found that  and  were identified by the new significant variants (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>453). Subsequently  when we checked for overlap between the newly identified genes and those from a previous study on human height []  we detected five overlapping genes i.e.         and  that may be associated with cattle stature and human height. When adjusted thresholds based on the five-category classifications were used versus a flat Bonferroni multiple-testing correction across the tested variants  the total number of significant variants increased from 58 539 to 58 993 (Table ). The list of identified genes is similar to that obtained with the four-category classification threshold  except that one additional gene  was included. When adjusted thresholds based on the eight-category classifications were used versus a flat Bonferroni multiple-testing correction across the tested variants  the total number of significant variants increased from 58 539 to 61 191 (Table ) and the newly identified variants (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2652) included  and   as obtained by using the four- or five-category classification thresholds. When we checked for overlap between these newly identified genes with the previous study on human height []  in this case  we detected more genes i.e.                   and  that may be potentially relevant for cattle stature and human height. The goal of this study was to investigate whether categories of variants with different probabilities of being functional can be identified based on enrichment values obtained from categorization of GWAS results. When we classified all the variants on the basis of VEP annotation only  we observed a greater enrichment of “low impact” variants and a limited enrichment of “moderate impact” variants (Table ). When we classified all the variants into five categories based on: (1) their impact predicted by VEP  (2) an ATAC-seq dataset indicating accessible chromatin regions []  and (3) a histone modification dataset (involving H3K27Ac and H3K4me3) []  we observed a greater enrichment of “low impact” variants and limited enrichment of “high impact”  “moderate impact”  and OC variants (Table ). In contrast  when we classified the original GWAS variants into eight categories  a more than tenfold enrichment was observed for the “high impact”  “moderate impact”  UTR  and ncRNA categories (Table )  whereas “low impact” variants  OC  and RE categories exhibited a limited enrichment. This variant enrichment profile differs from that reported in a study on human data []  for which the enrichments observed were in line with the magnitude of the predicted consequences of the variants. Thus  the variants with consequences that were predicted to be more severe displayed a greater enrichment. One reason for this difference in results may be the inclusion of both quantitative traits (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>96) and binary (disease) phenotypes (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>123) in the human study [] versus the use of only quantitative traits (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>17) in the bovine study. For complex disease traits  a loss-of-function variant can induce a disease state. Consequently  such variants have a higher probability of being causal for complex disease phenotypes. Economic traits in dairy cattle are generally quantitative traits that are affected by genetic variants in many genes  each gene having a small effect. Furthermore  in addition to loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations  most of the causal mutations that underlie economic traits are likely to belong to regulatory variants which control the up- or down-regulation of genes. Among the categories of enriched variants that we identified in our study  most of them had a link with the regulation of gene expression  such as cis-regulatory elements (e.g.  upstream gene variants  downstream gene variants  and UTR) [] and ncRNAs []. These variants can alter translation efficiency  particularly the synonymous variants []  UTR []  and ncRNAs []. In addition  they can affect transcript splicing  particularly the ncRNAs [] and splice region variants. As a result  these variants can alter the functions of encoded proteins. A previous study demonstrated that regulatory elements are a major source of quantitative trait variation []. We go one step further and suggest that variants that affect both gene expression and protein translation (including translation efficiency and protein product stability) could be the source of quantitative trait variation. Data from GWAS on stature in cattle were also used to check if an approach using an annotation category-based significance threshold can identify more associations than the use of a uniform Bonferroni multiple-testing correction threshold. A recent meta-analysis conducted in cattle [] proposed a list of candidate genes that affect bovine stature. With the three annotation classification approaches that we used here  we identified two additional candidate genes   and . Furthermore  comparison between the new list of genes reported here and that from a previous GWAS conducted on human height [] revealed five additional genes with the four-category enrichment method  six additional genes with the five-category enrichment method  and ten additional genes with the eight-category enrichment method. Several reasons can explain why our approaches detected only a fraction of the candidate genes reported in previous studies [  ]: (1) loss of power for NKF and NKI categories  since we mixed variants with different probabilities due to lack of information for most variants; in this case  the enrichment estimation for NKF  NKI and unannotated variants that belong to another annotation category will be affected; (2) some of the causal variants reported in the meta-analysis study on bovine stature [] and in the GWAS study on human height [] do not segregate in the Nordic Holstein population; and (3) the relatively poor annotation of the bovine genome compared with the human genome. Nevertheless  our findings demonstrated that implementation of an annotation category-based significance threshold approach results in a larger number of high confidence candidate genes that include significant SNPs than the use of a flat Bonferroni multiple-testing significance threshold. In this study  we observed distinct enrichments when two variant classification systems were used (e.g.  5 vs. 8 categories of classification) although the same number of potential causal variants was present in each system. There are two possible explanations for this observation: (1) the number of traits included in the analysis was small  thereby resulting in the detection of a limited number of QTL  e.g. there were only 19 high impact potential causal variants; with resampling  the number of high impact potential causal variants can fluctuate between extremes  as observed for the different replicates (see Additional file : Table S3); and (2) the number of annotation categories that were considered  and the underlying genetic architecture of the traits  may be contributing factors  e.g. a larger distribution of the enrichment level was observed across the categories established in this study when the variants were categorized into eight classes instead of five (see Additional file : Table S5). In our study  we achieved slightly higher power with the classification of variants into categories based on annotations (Table  vs. Table  vs. Table ). Further improvements are expected as the knowledge on the function of different genomic features in cattle increases. There are more and more studies that report the functions of non-coding sequences. For example  long ncRNAs have been identified as key regulators of chromatin states []  microRNAs have been shown to play key roles in animal development and physiology []  and  regulatory elements may be located in 5' or 3' UTR. In combination with trans-regulatory elements  these elements regulate the level of gene transcription [  ]. In a human study []  NKF variants were categorized according to the presence or absence of overlap with DHS. The group of variants that overlapped with DHS was more enriched with GWAS hits than the group of variants that did not overlap with DHS. These results provide support for future efforts to classify NKF variants  especially in cattle for which this information is not currently available. In our study  an ATAC-seq dataset [] of accessible chromatin and a histone modification dataset (H3K27Ac and H3K4me3) [] provided additional genomic information. In spite of these additional data  the OC variant category was only moderately enriched (Tables   ) but these datasets were each generated from a single tissue from a few individuals  which could have introduced errors. Alternatively  predicted regulatory elements could be used  although they may introduce noise and reduce the estimated degree of enrichment. In our study  the NKF variants were divided into five categories according to their relation to UTR  OC  predicted RE []  ncRNAs []  and NKI variants. We anticipate that as the functional annotation of dairy cattle genomes improves  the power of this approach will increase. Analysis of the results from GWAS conducted on 17 quantitative traits in dairy cattle revealed high levels of enrichment for “high impact” variants  “moderate impact” variants  “low impact” variants  variants located in 3' and 5' UTR  and variants located in potential ncRNA regions. By setting category-based genome-wide significance thresholds based on these annotation enrichment data  we were able to identify new candidate genes that affect stature in cattle. We anticipate that future improvements in the annotation of the bovine genome  will optimize the usefulness of this approach even more.

Moreover  examination of the inferred curve of the causal effect enabled us to estimate the effect of a calf’s initial weight at arbitrary times during growth  which could provide suitable information for decision-making when shifting the time of slaughter  building models for genetic evaluation  and selecting calves for market. Fitting curves to longitudinal phenotypic data is a common methodology that is used in animal and plant genetics to gain insights into individual growth patterns. Research on growth curves has a long history  and to date a number of curves have been used to model growth  including logistic []  Richards []  Gompertz []  von Bertalanffy []  and Brody [] curves. These curves include three to four parameters that are often regarded as new traits and are subjected to various genetic analyses  such as the estimation of genetic parameters or mapping of quantitative trait loci [    ]  to better understand the genetic architecture of growth patterns. Regarding growth curve analysis  it is important to understand the impact of initial measures on subsequent growth and the duration of this impact. For example  birth weight is affected by various factors such as maternal effects and the environment  which can have causal effects on subsequent growth. For beef cattle production in Japan  calves are usually born on farms that specialize in reproduction  and then at about 9 months of age they are moved to other farms for fattening to achieve their market value at around 30 months of age. However  although the phenotypes of the calves when they enter the fattening farms are known to influence their growth patterns during the fattening phase  the duration of this impact is unclear. The causal effect of a phenotype such as initial weight will interfere with growth curve analyses if it is affected by factors that are not considered in the growth curves  such as maternal effects. Therefore  to address this issue  we developed a growth curve model that considers the causal effect of initial weight by combining a structural equation for causality inference with growth curves in a Bayesian framework. In quantitative genetics  structural equations are often used to infer causal relationships between phenotypes in multivariate mixed models [  ]. In the current study  we applied structural equation modeling to longitudinal data and inferred the causal effect of the initial phenotypic value as a curve over time by using B-splines. We fitted this structural growth curve (SGC) model to real data on weight from a beef cattle population in Japan to reveal the causal effect of calf weight at entry to the fattening farms. The Livestock Improvement Association of Japan  Inc. (LIAJ) measured the weight of 3831 Japanese black cattle  a major beef cattle breed in Japan  as part of their progeny-testing program (see Table  for a data summary). These animals comprised 1600 heifers and 2231 steers born between 2006 and 2013 on 1845 farms  which were moved to three experimental stations for fattening at a mean (±<U+2009>SD) age of 251.5 (±<U+2009>20.4) d. After fattening  these animals were slaughtered at a mean age of 886.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>46.7 d. The weight of each animal was measured on the day of entry to the station and several times during fattening and before shipment for slaughter (weight at slaughter). One to six weight records were available per animal during the fattening period (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.7). It should be noted that the frequency and age of measurement differed between stations and years  which resulted in a dispersed distribution of weight records after entry to the stations (Fig. ). All animals were reared and slaughtered according to the Japanese rules and regulations for animal care. Distribution of weights in Japanese black heifers and steers. The day of entry to the experimental station (the day of the first measurement) was set as the initial day (day 0) In the SGC model  the phenotypes of the trait of interest are chronologically measured at time   and the phenotypic values at  have a causal effect on the phenotypes at subsequent times. The SGC model for individual  can be represented by the following two-equation system: where  and  are the phenotypic values at times  and   respectively;  is the incidence row vector;  is the vector of fixed effects;  is the additive genetic effect;  is a random effect  such as a maternal effect;  is the number of random effects other than the additive genetic effect;  and  are the residuals;  is the magnitude of the causal effect of  at time ; and  is the function of the growth curve with parameters    and . In this study   included sex  birth year  and birth season (winter  spring  summer  and fall)  as well as age  which was standardized and added as a covariate. The maternal effect and the effects of the reproductive farms were added as  and   respectively. The Gompertz function was used for : where  represents the asymptotic value at    is a scaling parameter that shifts the curves back and forth  and  represents the maximum growth speed (i.e.  maturing rate). These growth curve parameters have a hierarchical structure: where  represents the incidence row vector;     and  are the vectors of fixed effects;     and  are the additive genetic effects; and     and  are the random residual effects. In this study   included sex and station. The additive genetic effects       and  for   where  is the number of animals  follow a multivariate normal distribution: where  is the 4<U+2009>×<U+2009>4 genetic covariance   represents the Kronecker product  and  is the additive genetic relationship matrix. The random effect  for  also follows a multivariate normal distribution: where  is the variance component and  is the matrix defining the covariance structure among individuals  which can be the additive genetic relationship or the identity matrix. In this study  we used a numerator relationship matrix for  and  (i.e.  relationship matrices for the animal and maternal effects) that was generated by using pedigree records that went back five generations (involving 24 284 animals) and an identity matrix for  (matrix for the reproductive farm effect). The residuals were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution or normal distributions: The function  was modeled using a B-spline  as developed in a previous study []  and can be written as: where  is the number of splines   is the weight of the -th spline  and  represents the cubic spline. We determined the number of splines and the positions of knots based on previously used methods []. Briefly  we set  to 8 (indicating 12 knots) and set the first and last four knots at  and   respectively  where  is the time point of the last measurement. These knots were repeated to constrain the span of B-splines []. The remaining knots were set at    and   respectively. The likelihood of the SGC model was derived based on a method that was previously used in structural equation modeling []. Equations () and () can be written as: Then  the left-hand side of each of these equations can be combined in the matrix form: Because the residuals  and  are assumed to be independent (Eqs.  and )  the density of  for  can be expressed as: Then  the density of  can be obtained by transforming  to . Because the determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation (i.e.  ) is 1  the likelihood of the SGC model is also given by Eq. (). Note that because the time points of the measurements of the animals included in our study can vary between animals   and  were indexed by  (i.e.   and   respectively). Also note that  is the greatest value among all . The prior distributions of the fixed effects were assumed to be proportional to constant values. For     and   a non-informative scaled inverse Chi squared distribution was applied: . For  and   inverse Wishart distributions were applied:  and   respectively  where  and  were set to 6  and  and  were determined as described in the next section (Comparison of models). For the weights of B-splines    we assumed normal distributions: The variances of  and  were multiplied by an arbitrary value of 1000 to make the prior distributions vague  and  was applied to the prior distribution of . We compared the SGC model with the ordinal growth curve model  which does not consider causal effects. This model can be described by: The hierarchical structure of this model is the same as that of the SGC model except that: where  is the 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 genetic covariance. We assumed that   where  was equal to 5  and  was determined as outlined below. This model is similar to those used in previous studies [  ]. When fitting the SGC model to the data  the day of entry to the experimental stations was set as the initial day (). When fitting the ordinal growth curve model to the data  either the day of entry or the day of birth was set as the initial day [referred to as the growth curve model fitted to the entry day data (GC_A) and birth day data (GC_B)  respectively]. The unit of time was d in each model. We compared these models using the mean log-likelihood  the deviance information criterion (DIC) []  and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) []. First  we fitted the GC_B model to the data using the scaling parameters  and   which were arbitrarily determined as: In the final analyses    and  were set following the posterior means of the preliminary analysis. In addition  we fitted a linear mixed-effect model  which was the same as Eq.  in the SGC model  to the entry day weight using airemlf90 ver. 1.103 []  with the default value of 1e-10 as the convergence criterion.  was determined from the estimates provided by these two preliminary analyses (the GC_B and linear mixed models for the weight on entry day). The off-diagonal elements in  that corresponded to the covariances between  and     and  were determined as the empirical covariances of these random effects obtained from the two preliminary analyses. The parameters in the SGC  GC_A  and GC_B models were estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Gibbs sampling could be applied to all of the parameters except       and .       and  had normal posterior distributions  whereas   and       and  had multivariate normal posterior distributions. The posterior distributions of           and  could be derived by considering the growth curve parameters (   and ) as response variables.       and  had scaled inverse Chi squared posterior distributions  while     and  had inverse Wishart posterior distributions  all of which were derived following a previous study []. Since the posterior distributions of       and  were not closed form expressions  Metropolis–Hastings sampling was applied by adopting a random-walk algorithm. The number of iterations for the SGC model was 2.5 million with the first 2 million being discarded. By contrast  there were 1 million iterations for both the GC_A and GC_B models  with the first 0.6 million being discarded. The sampling interval was 10 for each model. We ran three chains with different initial values and checked the convergence of MCMC  as described previously []. To evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation of the SGC model  parametric bootstrapping was conducted. The weight at slaughter of each animal was simulated using the estimates of the variance components  the fixed effects  and the causal effect generated by the SGC model. A single-trait animal model that included sex and experimental station as fixed effects and age as a covariate was then fitted to the simulated weights to estimate the heritability at slaughter. This procedure was repeated 1000 times and the heritability that was estimated from the simulated data was compared with that estimated from the real data. The  statistics of the convergence diagnosis [] were calculated for the log-likelihood values and the parameters for each model. The  statistics decreased to 1.0 as the MCMC chains converged. The statistics for the log-likelihood values were 1.047  1.060  and 1.029 for the SGC  GC_A  and GC_B models  respectively; these values were lower than 1.1  which was previously suggested to be a rough threshold []. Most  statistics for the parameters were also lower than the threshold  with the exception of a few parameters in the SGC model  including  (1.153)   (1.185)  and  (1.148)  which are the weights of splines  and the additive genetic variances for parameters  (1.122) and  (1.127). However  the statistics for these parameters are close to 1.1  indicating that the MCMC chains for each model converged to stationary distributions. The SGC model took more than three times as many iterations as the other models to reach convergence (2 million vs. 0.6 million)  which may be due to the model complexity. The mean log-likelihood and two information criteria (DIC and WAIC) were calculated for each model (Table ). The mean log-likelihood was much higher and the information criteria were much lower for the SGC and GC_A models  in which the entry day was set as the initial day  than for the GC_B model  in which the day of birth was set as the initial day. Thus  it appears that setting the entry day as the initial day provides a better description of the patterns of weight change. This result was expected because the GC_B model covered the growth periods on both the reproduction and fattening farms without considering the transition between the two  while the SGC and GC_A models circumvented this issue by setting the entry day as the initial day. In addition  the mean log-likelihood was higher and the information criteria were lower for the SGC model than for the GC_A model (Table )  which suggests that the initial weight had a causal effect on subsequent growth that was effectively considered in the SGC model. The curve of the causal effect of the initial weight    that was inferred by the SGC model is shown in Fig. .  remained at approximately 0.8 for 200 d after the calves had entered in the stations  then it exhibited a linear decrease until it disappeared at about day 620 after entry. Although many animals (1685 of the 3831 animals) were slaughtered before this time point  the causal effect on slaughter age was only 0.064<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.058  which suggests that approximately 0.4% of the phenotypic variance of slaughter weight was explained by the variance of the initial weight (derived as the square of the average magnitude). Estimated causal effect of the initial weight on the weight of Japanese black cattle during the fattening period. The -axis denotes the magnitude of the causal effect. The day of entry to the experimental station was set as the initial day (day 0). Solid line: posterior mean; dotted line: 95% highest posterior density interval The causal effect of initial measures estimated as  can provide valuable information when building models for genetic evaluation in progeny-testing programs: if the causal effect of the initial weight is high  the reproduction farm and maternal effects will be significant at the time of slaughter  because these effects represented a certain proportion of the variances of the initial weight (Table ). Consequently  the reproduction farm and maternal effects need to be included in the evaluation model. The evaluation model for carcass traits of the Japanese black cattle breed that is currently used by LIAJ includes the effects of sex  fattening farm  birth month and year  and age as fixed effects but does not consider reproduction farm and maternal effects. Our results justify the use of such a model for the evaluation of carcass traits in this breed because the causal effect of the initial weight is not significant. Although this can be assessed by fitting ordinal mixed models to data obtained during the period of interest (e.g.  between 200 and 300 d after entry)  a key strength of the SGC model is that the length of the period that may affect the inference does not need to be determined. Several animals showed a relatively high causal effect of the initial weight at the time of slaughter because of their (probably unintended) early slaughter. For example  14 animals had coefficients of causal effect that were higher than 0.316  which indicates that about 10% of the phenotypic variance at slaughter was explained by the variance of initial weight. Consequently  since approximately 21% of the variance of initial weight could be explained by the reproduction farm effect (Table )  about 2.1% of the variance of slaughter weight of these 14 animals could be explained by the effect of reproduction farm  which is not considered in the current model for genetic evaluation. Consequently  since these animals may affect the results  they should be eliminated from the genetic evaluation. The estimated curve suggests that if slaughter of calves is planned at approximately 620 d after purchase  their growth can be recovered on the fattening farm if it was less than optimal on the reproduction farm. However  if animals are slaughtered earlier than 620 d  e.g.  to reduce feeding costs  the causal effect of the initial weight will linearly increase as the slaughter age decreases (Fig. ). For example  if the animal is slaughtered 440 d after purchase (approximately half a year earlier than 620 d)  the effect of the initial phenotype increases to 0.405  suggesting that 16.4% of the phenotypic variance at slaughter is explained by the variance of initial weight. Thus  growth on reproduction farms should be considered with caution when selecting calves at market. This is the first report on the causal effect of an initial phenotype on subsequent growth. However  rough estimates of this effect have been reported using multivariate analyses. For example  Meyer et al. [] used four-variate analyses consisting of the birth  weaning (120–300 d after birth)  yearling (301–500 d)  and final (501–700 d) weights to estimate maternal genetic correlations in Hereford cattle and in a synthetic breed  and found that the correlations between weaning and yearling weights were 0.97 and 0.99 in Hereford and the synthetic breed  respectively  while those between weaning and final weights were 0.92 and 0.88  respectively. Similarly  Eler et al. [] found that the maternal genetic correlation between weaning and yearling weights was 0.84 in Nelore cattle. In these studies  the maternal effects during the post-weaning periods were considered as a carry-over of those on the weaning weight. However  if the weaning weight is regarded as the initial phenotype  these correlations can be regarded as estimates of the causal effect. The causal effect that was estimated by the SGC model (Fig. ) was lower than these estimates  which is likely due to differences in breeds and management conditions such as the type of feed. Estimates of the heritability and genetic correlations of the growth curve parameters (    and ) are in Table . High heritability estimates were obtained for each parameter in all three models. By contrast  Takeda et al. [] obtained much lower estimates i.e.  0.61  0.08  and 0.17 for     and   respectively  in a population of Japanese black cattle. Two factors may explain this discrepancy: (1) the inference approach that was used  i.e.  Takeda et al. [] estimated the growth curve parameters and variance components for the parameters separately (two-step approach)  whereas we estimated these simultaneously in our models; the two-step approach was previously shown to underestimate heritability because uncertainty in the growth curve parameter estimation is added to the residual variance in the subsequent variance component estimation for the growth curve parameters []; and (2) the number of records per animal  i.e.  in []  eight weight records per animal were available  whereas an average of 4.4 records were available for each animal in our study. A smaller number of records per animal may lead to an overestimation of the heritability because the growth curve parameters would tend to approach the prior means [i.e.      and  in Eqs. ()  ()  and ()]  resulting in decreased residuals (    and ). To investigate the possibility that we overestimated the heritability  we conducted parametric bootstrapping  whereby the weights at slaughter were simulated with the parameter values estimated by the SGC model and the heritability was estimated using an animal model. We found that the mean heritability was 0.89 (±<U+2009>0.09)  compared to 0.73 for the heritability estimated from real records  which suggests that overestimation was an issue. Nevertheless  since the observed heritability estimate was higher than the lower 5% quantile of the simulated values (0.71)  we consider that the heritability estimates generated in our study did not deviate substantially from the true values. Because heritabilities of body weight of Japanese Black cattle are often relatively high (e.g.  0.61 [] and 0.56 [] for carcass weight)  high heritabilities for growth curve parameters would be plausible. However  we also admit that the heritabilities estimated in this study are higher than expected  and thus  further investigations are required to verify this issue. The genetic correlations between growth curve parameters differed according to the model that was used. The correlations between  and  were positive in the SGC and GC_A models but negative in the GC_B model  whereas the correlations between  and  were negative in the SGC and GC_A models but positive in the GC_B model. These opposite tendencies may be due to the day of entry in the stations being set as the initial day in the SGC and GC_A models  although the actual age of the calves’ at entry differed (251.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>20.4 d). Because parameter  shifts the growth curve back and forth  setting the entry day as the initial day would affect the estimates of  and its correlation with the other parameters. Similar contrasting results in genetic correlations were also found in two independent pig studies: Koivula et al. [] reported strong negative genetic correlations between  and  (-<U+2009>0.80) and between  and  (-0.80) but a positive correlation between  and  (0.88)  whereas Coyne et al. [] reported negative correlations between  and  (-<U+2009>0.69) and between  and  (-<U+2009>0.78) but a positive correlation between  and  (0.76). Although the estimates in the latter study [] differed depending on the method used for estimation  a negative correlation between  and  was consistently observed. Interestingly  Koivula et al. [] used test age  starting from when the body weight was approximately 30 kg  which may have affected the estimation of the genetic correlation  as observed in our study. It will be difficult to determine which day (birth or entry) is most valid as the initial day  and this may depend on the data. However  these findings indicate that genetic correlations between the parameters must be interpreted with caution. The interpretation of genetic correlations is also complicated by compensation between the parameters. For example   which increases the maximum growth speed  also increases the mature weight controlled by . Therefore  when fitting a curve to a measured value of mature weight   should decrease as  increases  and vice versa  resulting in a negative correlation between the two. This may explain why a negative correlation was consistently observed between these parameters in previous studies [  ] and the present study. Thus  the biological interpretation of the genetic correlation between growth curve parameters may be controversial. By fitting our newly developed SGC model to data on weight of beef cattle  we were able to estimate the causal effect of the initial weight (weight on the day of entry to the stations) on growth. Because all of the evaluated criteria supported the proposed model  we suggest that the SGC model can provide more accurate estimates of the genetic effects on growth  particularly for the cattle cohort that was assessed in this study. Moreover  our data suggest that the inferred curve of the causal effect can provide valuable information for planning the time of slaughter  building models for genetic evaluation  and selecting calves at markets.

Multiple-trait selection will reduce emissions  while improving economic performance  if the cost of feed in the breeding objective is high. If it is low  greater growth will be favoured  leading to an increase in GHG emissions that may be undesirable. Concern about global warming has focussed attention on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farm animals [  ]  particularly in beef cattle [  ]. An important aim of animal breeding is to improve the economic productivity of animals. In the absence of improvements in feed efficiency  productivity gains are often associated with increases in feed intake  which are associated with increased overall GHG emissions [] and GHG emissions per unit of product []. Many studies have shown that a reduction in GHG emissions can be achieved via breeding [  ]. Wall et al. [] examined strategies that can be applied in UK livestock. Quinton et al. [] reported that decreases in total GHG emissions and GHG emissions per unit of product accompanied increases in productivity in beef cattle. Many of the GHG emission studies described in the literature have limitations  i.e. they use breeding objectives that inadequately specify feed intake  assess the consequences of breeding for a particular trait only  or examine the effect of productivity improvement on emissions for only part of the production chain. In this article  we present multiple-trait selection strategies for reducing GHG emissions in beef cattle for the whole production chain from weaning to slaughter. We focus on reducing GHG emissions that are associated with feed intake  since criteria for reducing emissions independently of feed intake (referred to as residual GHG emissions) are still under development. We evaluate the outcomes and consequences of reducing emissions at the level of both the individual animal and the production system  by incorporating different levels of carbon price in the breeding objective. We also examine the consequences at different levels of feed cost  since this was shown earlier to be a major factor affecting the ranking of beef cattle for economic merit []. Animal breeding is principally concerned with improving breeding value for net merit  which is usually expressed in economic terms. Commonly  the selection criterion is an index of estimated breeding values (EBV)  that are available for an industry [  ]. The genetic variance–covariance matrix for deriving the index has partitions  for variances and covariances among EBV in the index   for variances and covariances among traits in the breeding objective  and  for covariances between the EBV criteria and the traits of the objective []. Values for the breeding objective traits for animal i are estimated as  []. When the index is linear  weights for the EBV of the index are derived as   where  are economic values of the breeding objective traits. The index is commonly derived as   but it can be equally derived as . The commercial production system that underlies the breeding objective in beef cattle can be pasture-based or grain-based  or it can include a mix of both systems post-weaning. In the example taken for this article  pasture-raised steers and surplus heifers are finished on grain for 100d and slaughtered at 22 months of age (Table ). In grazing systems  there are two types of annual feed period—i.e. a period when the available feed is limited  meaning any increase in feed requirement will require additional feed to be supplied  and a period when additional feed is not needed because the available feed in that period is surplus to the animal’s needs. In the latter case  we consider that the cost of feed is zero since no additional feed is needed. In all other cases  the feed cost is considered non-zero. The breeding objective examined here is net return per cow (i.e. returns net of all feed and management costs)  which was assessed over the period from weaning to sale of the finished animal. Traits in the breeding objective are those that directly influence commercial production profitability. In this study  these are weaning weight (direct and maternal)  residual feed intake (RFI) at pasture when pasture is limited  RFI at pasture when the feed available is surplus to the animal’s needs  feedlot entry liveweight  RFI in the feedlot  sale liveweight  dressing percentage  saleable meat percentage  fat depth (on the rump)  marbling score  cow liveweight  cow condition score  calving ease (direct and maternal) and cow weaning rate. The economic importance of these traits is illustrated in Fig.  for the example beef cattle production system taken in our study. The economic importance of traits is calculated as: where  are the trait economic values and  are the genetic standard deviations for the th trait of the breeding objective []. Economic importance for each trait is expressed as a percentage of the sum of the absolute values of the product for all traits []. Economic importance encompasses both the economic value of traits and the genetic variation that is available for each trait in the production system. The cost of the additional feed needed for a change in these traits is included in the economic values of the traits that influence feed requirement. Changes in feed requirement are assessed using the equation systems of Freer et al. (see Chapter 1 of []). Residual feed intake traits describe differences in feed intake that occur at the same weight and weight gain of animal. Economic importance of breeding objective traits for the example of beef cattle production system in Table . (Units are the value of a standard deviation of trait change relative to the value of a standard deviation of change in all breeding objective traits []  Carbon priced at $20/ton CO-e  GHG emissions are assumed associated with RFI traits) The possible pathways to changes in emissions for a production system are in Fig. . Emissions commonly change when a trait in the breeding objective is improved  including when there is a change in either the residual GHG traits or the RFI traits. The cost of the increased carbon in the emissions is incorporated in the economic values of the breeding objective traits. Residual GHG traits are not considered in the described example because criteria for these are not yet available. Most reports suggest that GHG emissions decrease when RFI traits decrease [  ]. However  Herd et al. [] suggests that GHG emissions could increase when RFI decreases if  for example  the digestibility of the diet also increases. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this aspect  we present results with and without an assumed association between changes in RFI traits and GHG emission. Pathways to a change in GHG emission from improvement in a breeding objective trait. Results are presented with and without an assumed association between GHG and residual feed intake (RFI) traits When decreasing GHG emissions is part of the breeding objective  the cost of increasing emissions is included in the economic value determined for each breeding objective trait  according to the following steps: Estimation of the change in feed needed as a consequence of change in the breeding objective trait. Estimation of the change in methane emissions associated with the change in feed  and augmentation of this to account for the increase in non-methane GHG emissions for any period during which cattle are in feedlots. Conversion of the augmented change in methane to CO-e. Application of the nominated price of carbon to the CO-e change. Feed-associated GHG emissions are predicted from the feed intake of the production system. For animals at pasture  the phenotypic relationship of Charmley et al. [] was used  i.e.: where MP is the production of methane in g/day and DMI is the dry matter intake in kg/day. This suggests that 0.0207 kg of methane is associated with an increase in feed intake of 1 kg. Then  the recommended global warming constant for methane (28; i.e. a measure of how much heat methane traps in the atmosphere over a specific time horizon relative to carbon dioxide) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change []) is used to determine that 0.5796 kg of CO-e is associated with 1 kg of feed intake. Equation 7 of Johnson et al. [] is used to predict GHG emissions when animals are in the feedlot  i.e.: where  is % methane  expressed as a fraction of the animal’s diet gross energy intake   is the level of feed  expressed relative to the energy required for maintenance  and  is % diet digestible energy. Average daily  of steers in the feedlot for the example of this article is equal to 2.32. The predicted % methane is used with feed intake (MJ/d) and the quality of feedlot feed (MJ/kg DM) to derive the amount of methane in kg generated in the feedlot. Emissions in the feedlot period are augmented by 11% to account for non-methane GHG emissions (e.g. nitrous oxide) that occur especially under feedlot conditions []. The augmented amount of methane is converted to CO-e for assessing the cost of the CO-e associated with each breeding objective trait. Residual GHG emission traits are not included in the example described in this paper because criteria for these are not available and there is little knowledge on their association with other traits. Excluding residual GHG emission traits will not affect results if they are not correlated with other traits  at least until criteria for these traits are available. If the production system has no feedlot phase  residual GHG emissions in the feedlot are not part of the breeding objective. The price used for estimating the cost of feed in the breeding objective has a major impact on the ranking of beef cattle for economic merit []. This price can differ between young animals and cows  and for feed of different qualities (MJ/kg DM). If the production system is able to provide the additional feed needed for genetic improvement  the price of feed is a nominated $/ton for each quality of feed. If the production system is not able to provide the additional feed  the price of feed used is an implied price that reflects the way the production system would need to change to meet the increased feed requirement. In the case in which stocking rate would need to be reduced by reducing cow numbers  for example  the implied price is the production system’s net return per cow ($) divided by the feed intake per cow (MJ). When reducing GHG emissions is part of the breeding objective  the cost of the CO-e associated with feed intake change is an additional cost in the calculation of the economic values of the breeding objective traits. In the example of this article  the production system is assumed to be able to supply the additional feed needed  and the same price was used for estimating the costs of the additional feed needed when RFI traits change. The cost of the carbon associated with change in the breeding objective traits is an additional cost to the production system. The carbon price (per ton CO-e) used should take any consensus on this that is reached into account. The most relevant EBV to include in selection indexes are those that are routinely available to industry. In Australia  the EBV that are available to industry (listed here together with % accuracy levels that typically occur for active sires of the Angus breed) are: 200d weight in kg (91)  200d weight maternal in kg (79)  400d weight in kg (90)  600d weight in kg (90)  net feed intake-post-weaning (NFI-p) in kg/d (62)  net feed intake-feedlot (NFI-f) in kg/d (63)  carcass eye muscle area in cm (78)  carcass rump fat depth in mm (79)  carcass retail beef % (74)  carcass intra-muscular fat % (75)  mature cow weight in kg (85)  birth weight in kg (94)  calving ease (direct) % (75)  calving ease (maternal) % (62)  days to calving in d (58)  and scrotal size in cm (86) (see [] for a complete description). The NFI-p and NFI-f EBV are net feed intake EBV for the residual feed intake traits RFI-p and RFI-f. Currently  EBV for residual GHG emission traits are not available. The genetic variance–covariance matrix for deriving selection indexes includes the partitions    and  described above. These partitions may overlap. The matrix used for the example in this article relates to  breeds and is similar to that used by Barwick et al. []. Details can be obtained from the authors on request. Changes in individual traits due to selection are calculated with standard software. For the example in this article  the MTIndex software of J. van der Werf was used. The information that is assumed available for each EBV aligns with the above-mentioned accuracies of the EBV of active Angus sires of the Australian industry. In cases in which changes in individual traits need to be estimated and the accuracies of the EBV differ between individuals  the procedure described by Barwick et al. [] is used. Changes in the breeding objective traits that result from selection can change the feed needs of animals and hence the resulting CO-e. The changes in total GHG emissions  total product  total feed and $ net return for the production system are estimated by summation over the breeding objective traits  as shown in Table . For young animals  these total sums can be for animals at pasture  in the feedlot  or overall. Similarly  the total for cows is summed over the breeding objective traits for cows. If increased feed is needed for cows to be in acceptable joining condition  this is also added. Further summing over young animals and cows gives the total sums for the production system (Table ). Reductions in GHG emissions per unit of product and per unit of feed are achieved by reducing total GHG emissions or by increasing the productivity or feed intake of the production system. The change in percentage for each of these (Fig. ) is based on the total sums before and after selection (Table ). Effect of carbon price on individual trait responses to selection for the example beef cattle production system in Table . (For a single generation of selection with selection intensity <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  1<U+2009>=<U+2009>$0/ton CO-e; 2<U+2009>=<U+2009>$10/ton CO-e; 3<U+2009>=<U+2009>$20/ton CO-e; 4<U+2009>=<U+2009>$30/ton CO-e; 5<U+2009>=<U+2009>$40/ton CO-e  blue colour bars include GHG association with residual feed; green colour bars exclude GHG association with residual feed  Response in carcass marbling score was 0.02 of a score for all levels of carbon price) Changes in product per unit of feed and in $ net return per unit of product  feed or methane measure the effects of selection on the biological and economic efficiency of the production system. The change in percentage for each of these is based on the total sums before and after selection (Table ). Key characteristics for the example beef cattle production system analysed here  in which animals are sold for slaughter after 100d of feedlot finishing  are in Table . We chose this production system as an example because of the importance of pasture-grain systems to beef production globally  and because pasture-grain systems have not previously been described in the literature on breeding objectives. Tables  and  show how GHG emissions are accumulated across traits regardless of the production system. Tables  and  show how this occurs for the example in this paper. Calculations are in Additional file . In production systems in which the cost of feed for the breeding objective is expensive (e.g. Table )  selection is able to simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and increase economic performance. For the example in Table   total GHG emissions decreased by 1.1  1.6  2.1  and 2.6% per generation (relative to when carbon was not costed) when carbon in the breeding objective was priced at $10  $20  $30 and $40/ton CO-e  respectively (Fig. c). Trends in responses for individual traits (Fig. )  and for the production system (Fig. )  did not differ markedly when no association was assumed between changes in RFI traits and GHG emissions. Emissions per unit of product and per unit of feed also decreased (Fig. f and g). When the costs of GHG emissions were not included (i.e. when carbon was priced at $0/ton CO-e)  reductions in total feed of the production system (0.8%) (Fig. b) and in total GHG emissions (0.5%) were small (Fig. c)  and GHG emissions per unit of feed (0.4%) increased slightly (Fig. g). Selection was able to reduce total GHG emissions of the production system without appreciably affecting net returns for the production system (Fig. d). Selection was able to improve virtually all the traits  and most traits were not affected by carbon price. The traits that were most affected by carbon price were cow weight  which decreased by up to 14 kg as carbon price increased  and sale weight  which decreased by up to 6 kg (Fig. ).

When the costs of GHG emissions were not included  total GHG emissions increased by 4.4% in one generation (Fig. c)  or by<U+2009>~<U+2009>8.8% in 10 years. GHG emissions per unit of product and per unit of feed both decreased as carbon price increased  although each remained greater than when feed was expensive (Figs.  and ). Total GHG emissions increased and these increases were sizeable for all but the highest level of carbon price considered (Fig. c). Net returns to the production system increased as carbon price increased (Fig. d). Again  trends were not very different regardless of whether or not GHG emissions were assumed to be related to change in RFI traits (Figs.  and ).

The increase in cow weight became negative at a carbon price of just less than $20/ton CO-e (Fig. j). The increase in sale weight became negative at a carbon price between $60 and $80/ton CO-e (Fig. f). The price at which a production system can produce or purchase feed is the main factor that determines the cost of feed for the breeding objective. Our results show that the ability of selection to reduce GHG emissions depends on this. When feed for the breeding objective is at least moderately expensive  multiple-trait selection can reduce total GHG emissions and simultaneously increase economic performance (Figs.  and ). The reduction in GHG emissions (Fig. c) is of the order of 3 to 5% in 10 years. Larger reductions are possible when reducing GHG emissions is the only objective of breeding []  but this ignores that breeding usually aims at increasing economic performance. When the cost of feed for the breeding objective is inexpensive  selection can only reduce GHG emissions if the carbon price used in the breeding objective is high. The carbon price at which GHG emissions decreased in the current example was about $80/ton CO-e (Fig. c). The carbon price at which sale weight decreased was between $60 and $80/ton CO-e (Fig. f). The resulting<U+2009>~<U+2009>8.8% increase in GHG emissions over 10 years emphasises the importance of fully costing feed for selection decisions  and this is more critical when there is a need to also reduce GHG emissions. It shows that the management that is modelled for the development of breeding objectives needs to be close to optimal. Societal and political pressures to reduce GHG emissions may make production systems that underuse available feed  or which underestimate the cost of feed  unsustainable. To date  the actual cost of feed for beef production has not been examined in the literature and needs to be estimated for different types of beef systems. Feed for intensive systems is often thought to be expensive  while that for grazing systems is considered less expensive. Table  lists several possible relationships between some characteristics of the commercial production system and whether the feed needed to improve breeding objective traits is expensive or inexpensive. Use of this type of classification  together with better information on the costs of feed  could assist selection in beef cattle. Feed intake and GHG emissions are related  and thus the recording of either one can provide information on the other that is useful in selection. For example  Robinson and Oddy [] suggest that methane measurements could be used for predicting feed intake. The phenotypic relation between feed intake and GHG emission is strong when animals are forage-fed  but less strong when they are feedlot-fed. Only about half as much variation in GHG emissions is explained by feed intake under feedlot conditions []. This has ramifications for determining which measures are best for reducing livestock emissions [  ]. Measures that are independent of feed intake  such as measures of residual GHG  are likely to be more useful for intensive systems than for grazing systems. Moreover  reductions in total GHG emissions may be greater than those described here when production is entirely feedlot-based and when residual GHG emissions can be measured. Other modelling of the example of production system in our study was conducted to simulate production entirely from pasture or entirely from grain [see Additional file ]. The results showed that GHG emissions increased when production was from pasture and GHG emission costs were ignored  and they decreased when production was from grain. Although feed intake is known to be not as accurately predicted when feed intake is from grain []  this also emphasises that the capacity to decrease GHG emissions depends on the way feed cost is modelled. A comment is also warranted on two practical situations that can be encountered. Beef cattle selection is sometimes implemented without any consideration of the cost of feed. Our results suggest that this would increase total GHG emission for the production system by 6.2% per generation  or by<U+2009>~<U+2009>12.4% in 10 years  and decrease net return for the production system by 1.7% per generation. Selection also sometimes occurs for animals that have only records on growth as against records for the range of traits that affect the breeding objective. Selection against growth in this circumstance would increase net returns by a small amount  but any advantage from this would be reduced when selection is not for a defined breeding objective because selection for a defined breeding objective takes all changes into account. In the example of production system in this study  selection reduced GHG emissions per unit of feed and the size of this reduction changed with the price of carbon (Figs. g and g). This shows that the relation between GHG emissions and feed intake is not constant and that it may change under selection when a carbon price is applied. Thus  the phenotypic association between feed intake and GHG emission may need to be adjusted periodically  in accordance with the carbon price used in the breeding objective  when the aim is to reduce GHG emissions. The literature is not clear on how GHG emissions vary when stocking rates change [  ]. In the absence of genetic selection  Clarke et al. [] showed that GHG emissions per unit of feed increased when stocking rate increased. Our results show that selection reduced GHG emissions per unit of feed when feed was expensive (Table )  which might align with a situation where stocking rates are high. Hristov et al. [] have reviewed management options for reducing GHG emissions from livestock. Other methods for reducing GHG emissions in cattle include supplementation with red algae from seaweed  for which sizeable reductions in emissions have been achieved []. If societal pressures continue to focus on reduction in GHG emissions from beef cattle  all available technologies may be needed. Our results show that genetic selection will be an important part of any strategy to reduce GHG emissions  and this can be achieved using a low price of carbon when feed is otherwise expensive. When feed is inexpensive  greater growth will be favoured  leading to increased GHG emissions that may not be desirable. When the cost of feed in the breeding objective is high  multiple-trait selection can reduce total GHG emissions while increasing the economic performance of beef cattle using a low price for carbon. In the example of this article  total GHG emissions were reduced at a carbon price of less than $10/ton CO-e. Both total GHG emissions and GHG emissions per unit of product were reduced. When the cost of feed in the breeding objective is low  selection can reduce total GHG emissions only if the price of carbon is high (about $80/ton CO-e). Selection needs to be included in any strategy to reduce GHG emissions in beef cattle. When the cost of feed for the breeding objective is inexpensive  beef cattle selection that ignores emission costs will substantially increase GHG emissions.

In terms of quantity produced   (Hamilton) is the sixth most important finfish aquaculture species  with approximately 2.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 tons produced globally in 2015 []. It is primarily grown in South Asia  often on a small scale in polyculture with other species [  ]. In spite of its economic importance  in a number of countries  including Bangladesh  the quality of catla seed produced in hatcheries has historically suffered from high levels of inbreeding  uncontrolled interspecific hybridisation and negative selection [  ]. In an effort to address these issues  in 2012  fertilised spawn was collected from the Halda  Jamuna and Padma (Ganges) rivers  as part of a project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to restock Bangladeshi catla hatcheries with genetically diverse and non-inbred broodstock []. The collection of these fish was subsequently recognised as an opportunity to establish a breeding population for the long-term genetic improvement of the species. The aims of this study were to (1) develop and describe a panel of catla DArTseq-based silicoDArT and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers; (2) determine the extent of genetic relationships between  and assign putative sibship to  ‘candidate founders’ of the breeding population; and (3) examine molecular genetic variability among and within catla sampled from the three river systems. Fertilised spawn were collected in 2012 from the Halda  Jamuna and Padma rivers as part of a program to replace inbred broodstock in Bangladeshi hatcheries []. Fish from each river were reared separately by two commercial hatcheries in the case of the Halda and Padma  and by one hatchery in the case of the Jamuna. At 1 year of age  approximately three hundred catla individuals were randomly selected from each river as candidate founders of a breeding population. These fish were fin-clipped and samples were archived in 2015  as part of the routine husbandry of the breeding population. Fin-clips were obtained from fish that were anesthetized with clove oil by removing an approximately 2-mm-wide sample from the extremities of the dorsal fin. Subsequently  fish were placed in tanks for monitoring and released back into ponds once they had satisfactorily recovered from anaesthesia. All fish in the breeding population are managed in accordance with the Guiding Principles of the Animal Care  Welfare and Ethics Policy of the WorldFish Center []. For the purpose of the current study  in 2016  archived fin-clip samples were genotyped. Genotyping was conducted using the DArTseq platform [] according to the laboratory procedures and analytical pipelines outlined in Lind et al. []  except that the complexity reduction method involved a combination of PstI and SphI enzymes (SphI replacing HpaII used in Lind et al. []). Raw DArTseq data are available at  []. Quality control procedures were implemented to ensure that only high-quality and informative SNPs  in approximate linkage equilibrium  were retained for analysis. First  SNPs with an observed minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05 or a rate of missing observations higher than 0.05 were excluded. Second  only one randomly-selected SNP was retained from each unique DNA fragment. Third  as a measure of linkage disequilibrium (LD)  pairwise squared Pearson’s correlations (r) of genotypic allele counts were computed  and then a random SNP from the pair with the highest r was excluded iteratively until all pairwise r values were lower than 0.2. Finally  SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were filtered out. To achieve this  a preliminary analysis (method outlined below) was undertaken to identify and remove close relatives  and thus reduce the risk of false identification of SNPs with genotyping problems (see []). Then  data were converted to a ‘genind’ object using the ‘df2genind’ function (‘adegenet’ package  version 2.1.1 []) and the deviation from HWE for each SNP and sampled population was tested using the ‘hw.test’ function (‘pegas’ package  version 0.10 []). All the SNPs that significantly deviated from HWE in any sampled population were excluded (classical <U+03C7> test; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 after Dunn–Šidák correction). To construct genomic relationship matrices ()  the method of VanRaden [] was implemented using the code from Gondro [] that was modified to replace missing observations in SNP data with the average of the observed allele frequency. The  matrix was constructed separately for individuals from each river. Clustering of genomic relationships using the ‘Ward2’ algorithm was implemented using the ‘hclust’ function []. Individuals were reordered according to clustering and heatmaps of genomic relationships between individuals were generated. These heatmaps revealed the presence of full-sibling and half-sibling relationships between the sampled individuals from each of the three river populations. To account for sibship in subsequent analyses and produce a pedigree for genetic analyses of the breeding population  sibship was assigned to individuals. Sibship was initially assigned using the program COLONY (version 2.0.6.4 []). For the COLONY analyses: (1) only SNPs with a MAF higher than 0.2 were retained  i.e. 571 from Halda  569 from Jamuna  518 from Padma; (2) individuals from different rivers were assumed to be unrelated; and (3) SNPs were assumed to be on separate chromosomes (i.e. unlinked). COLONY inputs were generated by means of the ‘write_colony’ function (‘radiator’ package version 0.0.11 [])  using the default settings except that ‘update allele frequency’ was set to true []. Errors noted in the COLONY inputs generated by ‘write_colony’ were manually corrected. Comparison of the  matrices with the pedigree-based additive (i.e. numerator) relationship matrices () []  derived from COLONY sibship assignments  revealed that a large number of putatively full sibling relationships in the  matrices were assigned as half-siblings by COLONY  particularly in the case of the Padma river fish. This disparity was attributed to COLONY falsely splitting large full-sibship groups into multiple full-sibship groups [    ]. However  by using the COLONY sibship assignments  putatively unrelated individuals were identified. For each river  these individuals were identified by (1) generating the  matrix (‘makeA’ function; ‘nadiv’ package version 2.16.0.0 []); (2) listing individuals that were unrelated (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0) to other individuals in  and then removing these individuals from ; (3) appending to the list that was generated in step (2) the individual remaining in  with the lowest average relationship with the other individuals and then removing this individual and its relatives (a<U+2009>><U+2009>0) from ; and (4) iteratively repeating step (3) until no individuals remained in . Then  allele frequencies using data from the listed individuals only were taken as estimates of allele frequencies in the sampled river populations. These allele frequencies were provided as inputs to regenerate the  for each river. These  matrices were then used to manually assign sibship and dummy parents. This was achieved by (1) visually identifying groups of individuals with genomic relationships of approximately 0.5 and assigning these to full-sibling groups  and (2) visually identifying genomic relationships between these full-sibling groups of approximately 0.25 and defining these as half-siblings. Data from putatively unrelated individuals only were used for the analysis of the genetic architecture of the river populations [  ]. Observed (H) and expected (H) heterozygosities were estimated by SNP and river of origin (‘summary’ function of ‘adegenet’). The significance of pairwise river of origin differences in mean H were estimated (‘Hs.test’ function with n.sim<U+2009>=<U+2009>999; ‘adegenet’ package) as was the difference between H and H within rivers (paired t-tests). Allelic richness and private allelic richness among rivers were compared visually using the rarefaction method implemented in ADZE []. After data conversion (‘tidy_genomic_data’ function; ‘radiator’ package)  pairwise overall Wright’s [] F values between river populations []  and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals derived from 2000 iterations  were computed (‘fst_WC84’ function default settings; ‘assigner’ package version 0.5.0 []). For the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)  data were converted to genclone format with river of origin defined as the only stratum (‘as.genclone’ function; ‘poppr’ package version 2.7.1 []). Analysis of molecular variance was conducted using the ‘poppr.amova’ function (‘poppr’ package); implementing the default settings except that (1) variances within individuals were not calculated (i.e. within<U+2009>=<U+2009>FALSE)  (2) the Hamming distance matrix was computed (i.e. dist<U+2009>=<U+2009>bitwise.dist(x))  and (3) the missing data threshold was set at 10% (i.e. cutoff<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1). To investigate the possibility that a population structure other than that due to river of origin might fit the data better  unsupervised (K-means) clustering (‘find.clusters’ function; ‘adegenet’ package) was implemented using output from principal component analyses (PCA; ‘glPca’ function default settings with 500 principal components retained). In the implementation of the ‘find.clusters’ function  the maximum number of clusters was constrained to 20 and the number of randomly chosen starting centroids to be used in each run of the K-means algorithm was set at 1000. Then  the optimum number of clusters was identified as the level of K with the minimum Bayesian information criterion (BIC) []. In total  3048 SNPs and 4726 silicoDArT markers were identified from 2630 and 4720 DArTseq-generated sequences (i.e. fragments)  respectively (see Additional file : Table S1). Of the 3048 SNPs  1347 SNPs remained after removal of the SNPs with more than 0.05 missing values and a MAF lower than 0.05  1261 SNPs remained after removal of all but one SNP per fragment  1034 SNPs remained after applying the constraint that all pairwise estimates of r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.2  and ultimately 978 SNPs remained after removal of those that were not in putative HWE. Only 47 (18.4%) and 23 (8.0%) individuals with no putative parents in common were identified from the Jamuna and Padma fish  respectively  in contrast with 140 (46.8%) from the Halda. The  matrices that were generated using allele frequencies derived from individuals with no parents in common clarified the putative half- and full-sibling relationships between individuals (Figs.    and )  particularly in the case of the Padma river (Fig. ). For this river  genomic relationships between individuals in small groups of closely-related individuals (i.e. putative full-sib groups) tended to be greater than those in large groups  when they were computed by using observed allele frequencies in all individuals (Fig. a). This trend was in accordance with the hypothesis that such estimates of allele frequencies in river populations were biased  due to the presence of large groups of closely-related individuals  and it was not found for genomic relationships computed by using observed allele frequencies in individuals with no putative parents in common (Fig. c). Notably  in the case of fish sourced from the Halda and Padma rivers  putative siblings were sourced from both hatcheries in which fish were reared  and thus replacement or inadvertent mixing of river-sourced fish with regular hatchery fish cannot explain the high degree of sibship observed.

Insets of  and  contain histograms of observed genomic relationships More loci  for which the minor allele was absent prior to SNP quality control  were present in the dataset for Jamuna and Padma fish than in that for Halda fish (see Additional file : Figure S1); this is likely an artefact of the relatively small number of unrelated individuals sampled from these rivers. No significant differences (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.082) between river populations in mean expected heterozygosities were detected  with values of 0.337 for the Halda  0.337 for the Jamuna and 0.333 for the Padma river. Although significantly different from zero (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  the difference between mean H and H was very small for all rivers (Halda mean H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.324; Jamuna mean H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.332; and Padma mean H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.325). Furthermore  differences between river populations in allelic richness and private allelic richness were not substantive (see Additional file : Figure S2). Analyses failed to reveal evidence of substantive genetic structure within or among the sampled populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that variation among populations represented a very small (<<U+2009>0.02) proportion of the total molecular marker variance  albeit significantly different from zero (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). In addition  overall multi-locus pairwise estimates of Wright’s F [] were low [=<U+2009>0.013; (see Additional file : Table S2)] and K-means clustering indicated the optimum number of clusters to be one (see Additional file : Figure S3). The degree of sibship among Jamuna and Padma fish was higher than anticipated  and indicated that catla sampled from rivers as fertilised spawn are not necessarily representative of river populations. This has implications for the interpretation of past population genetics studies  the sampling strategies to be adopted in future studies  the management of broodstock sourced as river spawn in commercial hatcheries  and for pedigree-based genetic analyses and the management of inbreeding in the Bangladeshi catla breeding population. The high level of sibship observed among the Padma river individuals (Fig. ) was particularly unexpected given that this is the largest of the three rivers sampled. However—due to the presence of a small number of spawning parents—a high degree of sibship might be expected  even in large river systems  if spawn is collected (1) at the tails of the spawning season  (2) from stretches of river in which the species is not common  or (3) from small river branches. Poor performance of hatchery-produced seed in Bangladesh has been attributed  in part  to inbreeding caused by uncontrolled mating among a limited number of parents over multiple generations in closed hatchery populations [  ]. Our study indicates that this phenomenon may have been exacerbated by the presence of siblings in hatchery founder populations that have been sourced as spawn from rivers. Sibship assignment and the generation of dummy parents were undertaken to improve pedigree-based analyses of breeding population data. These assignments were particularly problematic for the Jamuna river (Fig. )  possibly due to (1) the mating of closely-related parents in the river or (2) the imprecise estimation of allele frequencies in the river population—due to the small number of individuals with no parents in common. In spite of this  the pedigree derived from our study is likely to represent a closer approximation of reality than the default assumption that individuals are unrelated. Encouragingly  we identified 210 founders with no parents in common  which represents a sizable base population for breeding purposes []  in spite of a small number of putatively unrelated founders from two of the three rivers. Pairwise inter-river F estimates (<<U+2009>0.013)  using data from putatively unrelated individuals only  were generally lower than those previously published: Halda-Jamuna 0.014 []  0.014 []  0.017-0.034 [] and 0.082 []; Halda-Padma 0.032 []  0.017 [] and 0.052 []; and Jamuna-Padma 0.051 []  0.011 [] and 0.054 []. In these past studies  samples were obtained as fertilised spawn or newly-hatched fry  and thus may contain unaccounted for sibship relationships and corresponding upward bias in F estimates []. However  microsatellite or randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used in these studies and thus comparisons with our SNP-derived estimates must be interpreted with caution  as SNPs often result in lower F estimates than other markers []. The low molecular marker differentiation among rivers observed in our set of SNPs indicates a lack of genetic differentiation due to drift or adaptive selection and implies that there has been ongoing gene flow among the river systems. This was not unexpected in the case of the Padma and Jamuna rivers  since the Jamuna is a tributary of the Padma  but the Halda river is geographically and hydrologically isolated—although it is possible that natural gene flow between the Halda and other rivers has been exacerbated in recent history by translocation through restocking and aquaculture activities. In this study  (1) we have successfully developed and described a panel of catla DArTseq-based silicoDArT and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for future genomic studies []; (2) we revealed that catla individuals collected as spawn from rivers cannot be assumed to be unrelated; (3) we assigned sibship and dummy parents to the ‘candidate founders’ of a breeding population; and (4) we found that molecular marker differentiation among sampled rivers was low. Our findings have been applied to modify the pedigree of a Bangladeshi catla breeding population to improve the accuracy of genetic parameter and breeding value estimates  and to minimise future inbreeding. Furthermore  the lack of genetic structure observed in our study  is likely to simplify any future implementation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and/or genomic selection []. FAO.

Our findings indicate that international collaborations that facilitate access to multi-population datasets could be highly beneficial to the implementation of genomic selection for detailed milk composition traits. Milk contains various fatty acids (FA) that are grouped into different categories depending on the length of the carbon chains  degree of unsaturation and isomerization. Some groups of dietary FA are linked to cardiovascular disease risks  whereas others are suggested to be beneficial to human health [  ]. Such links have long triggered interests for the modification of the FA profile of bovine milk. Several studies have reported substantial genetic variation in bovine milk FA traits [  ]  which may provide the opportunity to modify milk FA composition through selective breeding. Genomic selection has become the main strategy in livestock selective breeding by allowing the selection of candidate bulls at younger ages []. However  prediction accuracy for traits that are difficult and expensive to measure is still limited because of the small size of reference populations. To date  genomic prediction accuracies have not been reported for milk FA composition traits  in spite of the growing interest to include these in the breeding goals of dairy cattle []. This is mainly due to the difficulty of large-scale recording of milk FA traits. Gas chromatography (GC)  the current method of choice for quantifying milk FA traits with high accuracy  requires expensive equipment and time-consuming techniques that challenge large-scale phenotyping. A strategy that is increasingly receiving attention in genomic prediction for numerically small breeds or difficult-to-measure traits is to combine datasets from different breeds/populations [  ]. The benefits of combining data for genetic analyses depend highly on the genetic distance between the populations that are used in different studies  and on marker density []. In this study  we combined samples for 16 FA traits that were measured by GC in the Chinese  Danish and Dutch Holstein populations that were genotyped using  or imputed to  high-density (HD) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays for genomic prediction. Given the common use of outstanding North American bulls in the Chinese  Danish and Dutch Holstein breeding populations  high genetic similarities are expected between these populations. Previous studies showed high consistency in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between the Danish and Chinese Holstein [  ] and between the Dutch  Danish and Chinese Holstein populations (Gebreyesus et al. personal communication). Although genomic prediction allows the use of all genome-wide markers without the need to map quantitative trait loci (QTL)  incorporation of biological information might improve furthermore the accuracy of genomic prediction for small-scale recorded traits. Methods have been suggested to weigh variants according to prior knowledge of their effect on the traits [  ]  and gains in prediction accuracies have been reported [  ]. For several years  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used as a powerful tool to investigate the genetic background of quantitative traits and diseases. Incorporation of GWAS results in genomic prediction models can improve genomic prediction accuracy []  especially when prediction accuracy is limited by reference size. However  a major hurdle in GWAS is that their power of detection depends on the size of the samples available for the analyses. Moreover  GWAS often result in the detection of large genomic regions  especially in cattle breeds  because of long range LD []. An option to deal with the limitation in sample size could be to combine several smaller datasets that are available across populations for joint GWA. Additional evidence from gene ontology and pathways analyses might also help refine GWAS detections. GWAS on milk FA traits have frequently reported significant associations in large regions on  chromosomes (BTA) 14  19 and 26 [   ]. Further studies on the characterization of these regions have also suggested that they have large effects on most milk FA traits [     ]. In addition  several other regions that explain relatively smaller proportions of the genetic variance in multiple FA traits have been reported across the bovine genome [  ]. Information on such major regions that underlie their genetic variation might improve accuracy of genomic prediction for the small-scale recorded milk FA traits. Traditionally  the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model [] is based on the implicit assumption that many QTL  each one explaining a small fraction of the genetic variance  underlie quantitative traits. In the implementation of GBLUP  genetic effects are estimated based on the realized relationship matrix that is computed from genome-wide markers []. Often  the contribution of genetic markers to the genomic relationship is not weighted according to the explained proportion of the genetic variance. Such an approach  in which each marker is assumed to contribute equally to the relationship matrix although the associations between genetic variants and traits differ  can cause a “dilution” of the effects of major regions. In this context  Sørensen et al. [] suggested an extension of the GBLUP model to allow the incorporation of available information about the biological mechanisms that underlie quantitative traits. To implement such an extension  Sørensen et al. [] suggested a genomic feature BLUP approach (GFBLUP)  in which variants are categorized according to biological information  such as chromosomes  genes or biological pathways  so that groups of SNPs are differentiated depending on the variance they explain and the size of their effects for genomic prediction. In this study  we implemented a GFBLUP approach in which regions that had been detected through GWAS on BTA14  19  26 were fitted as genomic features of interest to predict genomic breeding values (GBV) for the FA traits analyzed. Then  we compared these estimated prediction reliabilities to those estimated with the traditional GBLUP model. The objectives of this study were to (1) estimate and compare genomic prediction reliabilities for 16 milk FA traits in three Holstein populations; and (2) investigate gains in genomic prediction reliability from combining multi-population reference sets and incorporating biological information based on GWAS results. Milk samples were obtained from 784 Chinese (from 18 herds in China)  675 Danish (from 22 herds in Denmark) and 1566 Dutch Holstein (from 398 herds in the Netherlands) cows. Stages of lactation of the sampled cows ranged from 3 to 700 days in milk (DIM) in the Chinese population  9 to 481 DIM in the Danish population and 60 to 278 DIM in the Dutch Holstein population. To standardize the samples from these three countries  only cows at 60 DIM or more were considered for genomic prediction  which resulted in 700 Chinese  614 Danish and 1566 Dutch samples available for the analysis. The reason for restricting samples at lactation stages of 60 days or more is that the genetic determinism of milk fat composition traits may differ in the earlier stages of lactation. Indeed  there is evidence that the effects of genes in early and later lactation differ [] and excluding early lactation records should help eliminate this heterogeneity issue. All sampled cows in the Dutch Holstein population were at first parity  whereas cows in the Chinese and Danish populations were at parities 2 to 6 and parities 1 and 2  respectively. Gas chromatography was used to quantify 13 FA traits that were measured as weight proportion of total fat (% wt/wt) (see Table ) as described by Li et al. [] for the Chinese samples  Poulsen et al. [] for the Danish samples and Stoop et al. [] for the Dutch samples. Furthermore  desaturation indexes were calculated based on the FA measurements as: C14 index<U+2009>=<U+2009>C14:1/(C14:1<U+2009>+<U+2009>C14:0)<U+2009>×<U+2009>100; C16 index<U+2009>=<U+2009>C16:1/(C16:1<U+2009>+<U+2009>C16:0)<U+2009>×<U+2009>100 and C18 index<U+2009>=<U+2009>C18:1c9/(C18:1c9<U+2009>+<U+2009>C18:0)<U+2009>×<U+2009>100. Real or imputed high-density (HD) genotypes were available for all sampled cows. All the cows in the Chinese dataset were genotyped using the BovineSNP50 Beadchip (50 K  Illumina). A population of 96 Chinese Holstein bulls  which were genotyped using the BovineHD Beadchip (777 K)  was used as reference to impute the 50 K genotypes to HD. Of the 675 Danish cows  278 were genotyped using the BovineSNP50 Beadchip and 397 were genotyped using the BovineHD Beadchip  which were then used as reference to impute the 50 K genotypes of the first 278 Danish cows to HD as described in Gebreyesus et al. []. A custom 50 K SNP Beadchip was used to genotype cows in the Dutch dataset. A reference population consisting of 1333 Dutch Holstein cows and 55 bulls that were genotyped with the BovineHD Beadchip (777 K) was used to subsequently impute the 50 K genotypes of the Dutch samples to HD as described in Duchemin et al. []. Quality controls on SNPs were undertaken within each population. Accordingly  SNPs with minor allele frequencies (MAF) lower than 0.05 or with a count of one of the genotypes less than 10 in each population were excluded from both the population-specific as well as combined-population predictions. Finally  464 130 common SNPs were available for all the populations and scenarios. Traditional and “genomic features” GBLUP models were implemented to estimate genomic breeding values (GBV). GBLUP models were implemented using DMU [] in two scenarios: (1) population-specific reference sets within the Chinese  Danish and Dutch samples  and (2) a combined reference set of the three populations. The general model used for the traditional GBLUP  both population-specific as well as combined-population reference sets  was: where  is the phenotype of cow  in parity   and herd    is the fixed mean effect;  is the regression coefficient for th day of lactation    is the regression coefficient for the Wilmink adjustment () of DIM []   is a random residual effect assumed to be normally distributed with   where  is an identity matrix. Season of sampling was not modeled in the analyses because all the cows were sampled during the summer.  is the random additive genetic effect of cow  following a normal distribution  where  is the genomic relationship matrix between individuals and  is the genetic variance. The genomic relationship matrix used in the GBLUP models was calculated as described in the first method presented by VanRaden []. Homogeneity of residuals was assessed by plotting the residuals against predicted phenotypes from Model (1) based on the combined-population dataset with all available individuals. For some of the FA traits  especially for C18:2n6  C18:3n3 and CLA  residuals tend to increase with the mean  which indicates heterogeneity in the residual variance  thus records for these traits were log-transformed for the genomic prediction scenarios. A GFBLUP model was implemented using a combined-population reference set to estimate GBV for population-specific validation sets. In the traditional GBLUP model  a single random genetic effect based on the genomic relationship matrix that was constructed using all the SNPs was considered. In contrast  four random genetic effects were considered in the GFBLUP approach according to the following model: where  is the random additive genetic effect of cow  based on the genomic relationship matrix () constructed using only the SNPs on BTA14 and assuming a normal distribution with   where  is the genetic variation explained by the SNPs on BTA14. Similarly   and  are the random additive genetic effects of cow  based on the relationship matrices computed using the SNPs on BTA19 and 26  respectively  and assumed to follow normal distributions as for . Finally   is the random additive genetic effect of cow  based on the genomic relationship matrix that was constructed by using all remaining SNPs except those on BTA14  19 and 26  following a normal distribution . The SNPs used to calculate the relationship matrices include 13 033 SNPs on BTA14  12 603 SNPs on BTA19 and 9703 SNPs on BTA26. The different genomic relationship matrices for the GFBLUP model were computed following the first method of VanRaden []. The other components in Model (2) are as defined in Model (1). The total genomic value was calculated as: . The proportion of the genomic variance explained by each genetic component of the GFBLUP model was computed as: where  is  or  or   and  is the total additive genetic variance computed as: The proportions of genomic variance were estimated based on the combined-population dataset including all available individuals  i.e.  both the training and validation sets. To study the similarity of the LD structures of the bovine chromosomes taken as features in the three populations  pairwise LD was calculated between the SNPs within a 1-Mbp window on BTA14  19 and 26  with the r as a measure in the Plink program []. For all the scenarios  a resampling strategy was applied to create five validation sets of 100 cows for each population. The general principle was to avoid sibling and dam-progeny relationships between validation sets and with the reference population for each replicate. Table  shows the size of the reference populations used in the within- and the combined-population genomic prediction for each trait and population. For the Danish population  a subset of cows that had no siblings and whose dams are not within the dataset were first selected (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>197). For each analysis of resampled datasets  100 of these cows were randomly sampled for the validation set and the remaining cows were included back to the reference population. In the Dutch and Chinese populations  all the sampled cows had at least one half-sib in the dataset. In the Dutch dataset  all cows were in first parity and belonged to one of three sire-groups  whereas in the Chinese dataset  the majority of the cows were from five different sires. Hence  a sire-group (group of cows with common sire) was randomly selected for each validation set. Since each sire-group included more than 100 cows in both the Chinese and Dutch datasets  another random sampling of 100 cows was undertaken within the selected sire-groups and the remaining cows from the group were excluded from the reference population. The main reason for restricting the validation to 100 cows was to have comparable reference and validation group sizes in the three populations. For all models  prediction reliability for cows was computed as the squared correlation between estimated GBV and the phenotype corrected for fixed effects and scaled by dividing with the estimated heritabilities. Corrected phenotypes were computed based on single-population traditional GBLUP as in Model (1) and used for all scenarios. The heritability estimates used to scale the reliabilities were from the models in the respective scenario using all available individuals. Accordingly  heritability in the traditional GBLUP approaches was computed as: and the heritability for the GFBLUP model was computed as: where  is the summation of the variance explained by each genomic feature as given in Eq. (). For population-specific traditional GBLUP models  all available data from the respective populations were used to estimate heritabilities. For the combined-population analyses (both combined GBLUP and GFBLUP models)  the combined-population data including all available individuals was used to estimate heritabilities. Prediction accuracies reported for each scenario are average values of the five replicates (folds). Phenotypic means  coefficients of variation (%) and heritability estimates for the FA traits in the different populations and the combined dataset are in Table . Overall  phenotypic means were comparable between the Danish and Dutch datasets  whereas those for the Chinese dataset showed larger differences for some of the FA traits. Such differences between the Chinese data on the one hand and the Danish and Dutch on the other hand were observed  in particular  for C8:0  C18:2n6 and C18:1c9. Larger differences were also observed in the estimates of coefficients of variation between the populations for some of the studied traits. In the combined dataset  coefficients of variation ranged from 5.87% (C18 index) to 63.0% (C18:2n6). Similarly  some differences in the estimated heritabilities were observed  with estimates being generally higher for the Dutch dataset followed by those for the Danish dataset. The LD analysis on BTA14  19 and 26 indicates similar binwise pairwise LD (r) in the three populations within the regions considered for the genomic feature prediction model (Fig. ). Furthermore  the minimum and maximum average pairwise LD values for SNPs within bins of 1-Mbp sizes were similar between the populations on the three bovine chromosomes.

The y-axis is the mean binwise LD and the x-axis is the physical distance between pairwise SNPs in mega base pairs (Mbp) Table  presents prediction reliabilities for the FA traits studied in the three populations using the GBLUP model based on population-specific reference sets. Prediction reliabilities calculated by using reference populations separately were  in general  low across the FA traits and populations. Prediction reliabilities were especially low for the Chinese dataset followed by those for the Danish population. In the Chinese single-population genomic prediction  reliabilities were highest for C16:0 (0.19) and C18:0 (0.19)  followed by C18 Index (0.15). Prediction reliabilities were very low for the de novo synthesized FA in general  and particularly for C10:0  C12:0 and C14:0 in the Chinese validation. Similarly  genomic prediction using the Danish reference population separately resulted in low prediction reliabilities across traits. Prediction reliabilities were highest for CLA (0.14) followed by C14:0 (0.11) and lowest for C16:0 and C18:1c9. Moderate to low prediction reliabilities were computed in the Dutch single-population genomic prediction. Using the Dutch separate reference population  genomic prediction reliability was highest for C14 index (0.43) followed by C14:1 (0.39). Reliabilities of genomic predictions based on the combined-population reference were higher across traits and populations compared to those based on separate reference populations (Table ). Genomic prediction reliability based on the multi-population reference was on average 10% points higher for the Dutch validation population compared to single-population genomic prediction. Increases in prediction reliability were largest for C16 index (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.18)  C16:1 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.17) and C18:3n3 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.15)  and smallest for C18:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01). In the Danish validation  prediction reliability increased by 8% points on average after adding the Dutch and Chinese reference populations. Increases in prediction reliability were largest for C10:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23)  C8:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20) and C15:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.15). Sizable improvements in prediction reliability were also observed for C14 and C18 indexes. However  no improvement was obtained for C14:0 and prediction reliability even declined for C18:3n3 with the multi-population prediction compared to the Danish within-population analysis. With an average increase in prediction reliability of 1% point  little or no gain was observed from the combined-population analysis for most FA traits in the Chinese validation. In the Chinese validation  the greatest benefits of adding the Danish and Dutch reference populations were observed for C18:1c9 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.08)  followed by C10:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.07) and C14 index (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06). However  for some traits  prediction reliabilities were less good with the combined reference than with the single-population reference (Table ). Substantial increases in prediction reliability were obtained using the GFBLUP model for multi-population reference sets compared to the combined GBLUP model (Fig. ). Accordingly  an average gain in prediction reliability of 16% points was observed in the Dutch validation when the GFBLUP model was used compared to the traditional GBLUP with the combined reference population. Increases in prediction reliability were largest for C18:1c9 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.38)  C16:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.33) and C14:0 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.33) in the validation for the Dutch Holstein. Similarly  average gains in reliability of 9% points in the Danish validation and 2.3% points in the Chinese validation populations were achieved by using the GFBLUP model compared to the GBLUP with the same reference population sizes. For the Danish validation  prediction reliabilities increased highly for C16 index (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23)  C14 index (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.22)  C15:0 and C16:1 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.21). In the Chinese validation  the largest increase in prediction reliability obtained with the GFBLUP model was observed for C14 index (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13) followed by C14:1 (<U+2206><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06). Using the Dutch dataset as an example  we also studied the predictive ability of the GFBLUP model in a single-population reference setting (see Additional file )  and the results showed an average increase of 12% points in prediction reliability with the GFBLUP model compared to the traditional GBLUP. Genomic prediction accuracies using combined reference populations with traditional GBLUP and GFBLUP models in the Chinese  Danish and Dutch validation population Whereas the increases in prediction reliability from the GFBLUP model varied between populations  sizable improvements for specific FA traits were consistent across the populations. For example  for the C14 index  gains in prediction reliability were 23% points in the Dutch  22% points in the Danish and 13% points in the Chinese validation populations. In the combined-population analysis  the genomic features fitted in the GFBLUP model (BTA14  BTA19 and BTA26) collectively explained substantial proportions of the total genetic variance across the FA traits (Fig. ). For instance for the C14 index  57% of the genetic variance were explained by the genomic features  with BTA26 alone explaining 38.3% of the genetic variance. Similarly  sizable proportions of the total genetic variance for C14:0 (33.4%) and C10:0 (20%) were explained by BTA19 alone. Variants on BTA14 collectively explained 38.3 and 36.7% of the genetic variance for C16:0  and for C18:1n9 and C18:2n6  respectively. In contrast  for C18:0  BTA14 and 26 each explained 5% of the genetic variance. Proportion (%) of the genomic variance explained by genomic features fitted in the GFBLUP and the rest of genome-wide variants For most of the studied traits  the gain in prediction reliability obtained by using the GFBLUP model across the FA traits was related to the proportion of genomic variance explained by the fitted genomic features. Such trends were consistent across the validation populations especially for C18:0  CLA and C14 index. However  for C18:1c9 we observed no improvement in prediction reliability in the Danish population  and even a decline in the Chinese dataset  with the GFBLUP model in spite of the fact that a sizable proportion of the genetic variance was explained collectively by the fitted features (56.6%). The relationship between proportions of genetic variance explained by the genomic features and gains in prediction reliability from the GFBLUP model (vis-à-vis traditional GBLUP) is shown in Fig. . Scatterplots of the GBV that were predicted by using the GFBLUP model against the corrected phenotypes for all validation individuals from all replicates are in Additional files    and  (see Additional files     ) for the validations in the Chinese  Danish and Dutch populations  respectively. The slope of the regression of corrected phenotypes on predicted GBV varied according to trait and population studied. Regression slopes were close to 1 for all traits except C14 (1.40) and C18:3n3 (1.42) in the Dutch validation across all scenarios. However  the values for most traits deviated from 1 in the Danish and Chinese populations and this deviation was especially high for C16:0  C18:1c9  C18:2n6 and C18:3n3 in the Danish and C14:0  C15:0 and C16 index in the Chinese population. Relationship between the proportion of genetic variance explained by genomic features and gain in prediction reliability. Proportion of genetic variance explained by BTA14  19 and 26 summed together (dotted lines  with values on the right of the y-axis) and change in prediction reliability using the GFBLUP model (on the left of the y-axis) The prediction reliabilities reported here for each scenario are average values of five replicates. The differences in correlations between the corrected phenotypes and predicted GBV among the five replicates varied according to trait and population. The mean absolute deviation in the correlation values of the replicates from the reported average value ranged from 0.01 to 0.17 across traits in the different models for the Chinese validation  and from 0.03 to 0.10 in the Danish and from 0.04 to 0.21 in the Dutch validation. The population-specific genomic prediction for the FA traits studied  generally  resulted in low prediction reliabilities in the Chinese and Danish populations. For the Dutch validation  moderate prediction reliabilities were achieved for some of the FA traits. In general  the low prediction reliabilities with a population-specific reference reflect the well-established impact of a small reference population in genomic prediction reliability [  ]. However  prediction reliabilities were in general lower for the Chinese single-population prediction than for the Danish single-population prediction although the sizes of their reference populations were similar. This can be partially explained by the lower heritability estimates for the Chinese dataset for most of the FA traits than for the other datasets. The effect of a small reference population size is larger on low heritability traits for which a relatively large number of records will be required in the reference population to achieve high accuracies of GBV in unphenotyped animals []. Cows from a few sire-groups were used for the prediction in the Chinese and Dutch populations. Prediction accuracies obtained with such large half-sib groups might not be representative of those obtained with larger populations in which such a parental structure is less common. The distribution of haplotypes in a population comprising few sires will differ from that in a random population sample and the estimated SNP effects may be biased  to some extent  since they are conditioned on the haplotypes of the few sires represented in the reference population. Combining reference populations resulted in a relatively sizable improvement in prediction reliability in the Danish and Dutch validation. Previous studies using either simulated [] or real data [] suggested that pooling data from different populations is beneficial for the accuracy of genomic predictions. However  the genetic distance between the populations/breeds that are combined []  the marker density used  the genetic architecture of the traits []  and the inconsistencies in allele substitution effects [] might affect such advantages. A gain in prediction reliability of up to 9% points was obtained for some traits in the Chinese validation  whereas little or no increase was observed for some of the traits by adding the Dutch and Danish Holstein reference populations. This was unexpected given the genetic similarity and high consistency in genome-wide LD that exist between the populations combined [  ]. One possible reason for the limited benefits from combining the reference populations for the Chinese validation could be differences in SNP effects between the Chinese population  on the one hand  and the Dutch and Danish populations  on the other hand. Previously  in a joint GWAS using the same dataset  we (Gebreyesus et al. personal communication) found that effects of SNPs in the  and  genes on BTA14 and 26  respectively  were smaller in the Chinese dataset than in the Dutch and Chinese datasets. Polymorphisms in  and  underlie a substantial proportion of the genetic variation in most milk FA traits. Based on our previous GWAS results  we suggested that differences in feeding systems are the most likely source of significant differences in phenotypic means between the Chinese dataset  on the one hand  and the Dutch and Danish datasets  on the other hand. Fitting herd as a fixed effect accounts for differences due to management systems. However  such differences can introduce feed-by-genotype interactions that result in differences in the size of SNP effects. Inconsistencies in SNP effects have been shown to reduce the advantages from multi-population genomic prediction []. On the one hand  SNP effects estimated in a multi-population reference  which is dominated by Dutch Holstein cows (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1566) compared to the Danish (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>614) and Chinese (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>586) cows  are used to predict breeding values for the 100 Chinese validation animals. On the other hand  the corrected phenotypes from the single-population analysis for these validation animals reflect the SNP effects in the Chinese population. With such differences in the estimates of SNP effects for the Chinese population compared to the others  the correlations between breeding values estimated by using the multi-population reference sets and the corrected phenotypes  i.e.  prediction accuracies  are expected to be low. This also leads us to expect smaller contributions from the Chinese reference population for the gains in prediction reliability observed for the Dutch and Danish validations using the combined reference predictions. In this study  we also implemented a GFBLUP model that considered BTA14  19 and 26 as genomic features and allowed separate random genetic effect components for these regions. In general  implementation of this GFBLUP model resulted in further improvements in prediction accuracy for most of the traits across the validation populations. However  the level of improvement varied across the populations with the smallest improvement observed for the Chinese validation. The relative gain in prediction reliability with the GFBLUP model across the FA traits appears to be related to the proportion of genetic variance that is collectively explained by the features considered. For instance  the gain in prediction reliability from the GFBLUP model was highest for the C14 index  in all three populations  for which more than half of the genomic variance was explained by the genomic features collectively  i.e.  BTA14  19 and 26. Likewise  smaller increases in prediction reliability across the populations were computed for C18:0  which had the smallest proportion of variance explained by BTA14  19 and 26. However  this pattern is mainly limited to the Danish and Dutch validation since the gains in prediction reliability from the GFBLUP were generally low in the Chinese validation regardless of the proportion of variance explained by the features. Different methods have been suggested to incorporate biological information in genomic prediction models. For instance  MacLeod et al. [] introduced the Bayes RC model  an extension of the Bayes R model []  to incorporate biological information by defining classes of SNPs that are likely to be enriched for causal variants. Similarly  Brøndum et al. [] presented Bayesian prediction models based on genome-position specific priors  whereas Gebreyesus et al. [] introduced hierarchical Bayesian models based on the clustering of adjacent SNPs to exploit heterogeneous (co)variance patterns. However  with few exceptions (e.g. Zhang et al. [])  most of these models are implemented within a Bayesian framework that is computationally demanding. Hence  their applicability in routine evaluations is limited. GBLUP is straightforward to implement and estimated GBV are similar to those estimated in the BLUP approach [] since the method  i.e.  assumption of a normal distribution of QTL effects  is equivalent to the BLUP approach used in traditional breeding programs []. Thus  its simplicity and lower computational burden have made GBLUP a method of choice in routine genetic evaluations. Therefore  implementing biological information-augmented approaches in GBLUP models are closer to practical implementation in the breeding industry. Our findings show that improvement in prediction reliability from multi-population prediction using the GFBLUP model was substantial and consistent across populations for some of the traits analyzed. These include the C14 index and  to some extent  C14:1 and C16:1 FA. Saturated FA in milk  in particular C12:0  C14:0 and C16:0 are frequently associated with increases in serum cholesterol in humans  and this has been the basis for the development of the atherogenicity index: (C12<U+2009>+<U+2009>4·C14<U+2009>+<U+2009>C16)/(MUFA<U+2009>+<U+2009>n3 PUFA<U+2009>+<U+2009>n6 PUFA) []. We have shown that by pooling data and incorporating biological information  it is possible to predict genetic merits for the composition of such FA with accuracies as high as 0.79 in spite of the limited size of the reference populations used. These findings highlight the possibility of implementing selective breeding to modify the bovine milk FA composition  although large-scale phenotyping for these traits is still a challenge. Our findings also indicate that genomic prediction for small-scale recorded traits might benefit from international collaborations for access to data across populations. In this study  we compared the accuracies of genomic prediction for the detailed milk fat composition traits using a multi-population reference and a model incorporating GWAS findings with those obtained with traditional GBLUP models in a single population scenario. Our results indicate that pooling multi-population data and implementing prediction models augmented with biological information can enable prediction of genetic merits for the small-scale recorded bovine milk FA composition traits with reasonable accuracies. High prediction reliabilities were estimated for some of the FA traits using the multi-population reference and a GFBLUP model  e.g. 0.79 for the C14 index  0.69 for C14:0 and 0.64 for C18:1c9  which indicates that the modification of the milk fatty acid composition through selective breeding could be considered in spite of the current limitations in large-scale phenotyping.

Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant association between functional annotations related to the olfactory system and QTL that were suggestively associated with endo-parasite phenotypes. A number of novel genomic regions were suggestively associated with endo-parasite phenotypes across the bovine genome and two genomic regions on BTA21 and 25 were associated with antibody response to . Parasitic diseases are highly prevalent worldwide in cattle production systems [] and this prevalence is forecasted to increase further as a repercussion of the anticipated change in climate []. In Ireland  between 75.4% [] and 83% [] of the Irish dairy herds  show evidence of exposure to . In addition  parasitic diseases are associated with significant economic losses in both dairy and beef cattle [  ]. Details on endo-parasite diseases in cattle are in Sekiya et al. []. Using pedigree-based relationships between individuals  Twomey et al. [] documented the presence of genetic variation for two phenotypes due to  in cattle and proposed that selection and breeding animals resistant to  would complement current control strategies for  (i.e.  anthelmintic treatments; []). Genetic variability has also been documented for other endo-parasites in cattle such as  [  ] and  [  ]. Since genetic gain is a function of selection accuracy []  the accuracy of traditional genetic evaluations that exploit only pedigree relationships are hindered by the lack of available phenotypic data; this is especially true for low heritability traits. Although the study of Twomey et al. [] was limited by the low accuracy of the genetic evaluations  they reported a 6% unit difference in the prevalence of -damaged liver between cows with an estimated breeding value (EBV) for  in the top 10% versus the bottom 10%; the mean EBV reliability of those animals was 0.18. It is hypothesised that the inclusion of genomic information within these evaluations will improve the reliability of the EBV for  and thus improve the prediction of whether or not an animal will have -damaged liver. Few studies have attempted to locate genomic regions associated with endo-parasitic diseases in cattle. Using a genotyping panel of only 153 microsatellite markers  Coppieters et al. [] documented that  autosomes (BTA) 9 and 19 harboured quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nematode burden in 768 Dutch dairy cows that were selected to be in the top 10% and bottom 10% of their respective sire family (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12) for faecal egg count (FEC). Using 305 Aberdeen Angus calves genotyped for 190 microsatellite markers only  Kim et al. [] reported that regions on BTA8 and 12 were associated with FEC. To the best of our knowledge  Kim et al. [] is the only available study that used dense genome-wide SNP genotypes (31 165 SNPs after edits) to map genomic regions associated with endo-parasitic diseases in cattle; they reported that 12 regions in the bovine genome contributed to significant genetic variation in FEC. The objective of our study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with three endo-parasitic diseases in cattle using imputed whole-genome sequence data in a large multi-breed population. Results from this study will improve our understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms of resistance in cattle to parasitic diseases. This could contribute to enhance the development of further control strategies for parasitic diseases  such as vaccine development  and to improve diagnostics of parasitic diseases. In addition  our results provide information that would be useful in future studies that attempt to increase the accuracy of genetic evaluations  through the exploration of targeted genomic regions. The phenotypic data analysed in this study originated from two sources: (1) national abattoir cattle data containing records for -damaged liver  and (2) serological testing of individual cows in 68 dairy herds for endo-parasites. Individual animal records for -damaged liver were available from dairy and beef cattle that were slaughtered in 18 Irish abattoirs between February 2012 and February 2018. Cattle livers were diagnosed as either “liver exhibits  damage and live  observed in the liver” or “liver exhibits  damage without the identifiable presence of live ”. Animals were considered to have no -damaged liver if none of the above diagnostic elements were detected and were slaughtered in the same abattoir and at the same date than an animal diagnosed with a -damaged liver. Twomey et al. [] described in detail the processes to generate -damaged liver phenotypes  and also the procedures and criteria imposed to maximise the likelihood that only animals exposed to the parasite were included in the analysis based on -damaged liver information available from their herd-mates. In summary  only animals with no herd movement after 90 days of age were retained. Animals were considered as exposed if they had resided in a herd 100 days prior to the slaughter of a herd-mate with live  present in the liver. If the slaughtered herd-mate had a -damaged liver with no observable live   an additional criterion was imposed  i.e. as well as having resided in the herd 100 days prior to the slaughter of the slaughtered herd-mate  animals also had to be born within 100 days of the birth of the slaughtered herd-mate  to be considered as exposed. For the purposes of our study  liver damage caused by  was dichotomized; animals were considered either infected (i.e.  observation of  damage in the liver) or not infected with  (i.e.  liver did not exhibit  damage). The final dataset consisted of 187 584 animals with a -damaged liver record  either positive or negative. Breeding values and associated reliabilities for the binary trait of -damaged liver were estimated with an animal linear mixed model in the MIX99 genetic evaluation software suite []. The model and variance components specified in the genetic evaluations were those previously documented for the genetic evaluation of -damaged liver []. Fixed effects in the model were parity/age group  stage of lactation  heterosis and recombination coefficients  animal gender  herd-level contemporary group  and date-by-abattoir of slaughter. The random effects were the direct additive genetic effects  where  with  representing the additive variance and  representing the numerator relationships matrix  and a residual effect  where  with  representing the residual variance and  representing an identity matrix. The pedigree of each animal was traced back to the founder population  which was allocated to 11 genetic groups based on breed (i.e.  Holstein  Friesian  Belgian Blue  Hereford  Aberdeen Angus  Simmental Limousin  Charolais  several other French breeds not listed  and other breeds not listed and unknown); the pedigree consisted of 865 173 animals. The genetic and the residual variances were equal to 0.001 and 0.115  respectively  as estimated by Twomey et al. [] in a large subset of animals used in the present study. Only EBV for animals that had both a genotype and an EBV reliability higher than 0.01 were considered for further analyses. Moreover  16 196 animals were retained if they had a record themselves for -damaged liver (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 837) or were sires that had at least one progeny record for -damaged liver (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5359). The effective record contribution (ERC) for each animal was estimated and used as the weighting factor for the deregression of EBV. Deregression was undertaken using the Secant method in the MiX99 software []. Deregressed EBV for animals (i.e.  a combination of animals with a record themselves and sires with at least one progeny record) with an ERC lower than 1 were not considered further; finally  3702 animals remained for the analyses. Blood samples were collected in autumn 2016 from 10 879 dairy cows as part of a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of 68 Irish dairy herds. All blood samples were tested separately for the presence of antibodies to  using the Svanovir -Ab ELISA kit  to  using the Svanovir -Ab ELISA kit  and to  using the Svanovir Neospora-Ab ELISA kit (Boehringer Ingelheim Svanova  Uppsala  Sweden). ELISA tests for all blood samples were carried out by the same commercial laboratory (FarmLab Diagnostics  Co. Roscommon  Ireland). Antibody responses to  and  were expressed as optical density ratio (ODR)  and antibody response to  was expressed as percent positivity (PP). Data edits were as described by Twomey et al. []. In summary  the positively skewed ODR for  was transformed using the natural logarithm to approximate a normally distributed variable  whereas a reciprocal transformation was used to normalize the positively skewed PP for . Records were removed if  at blood sampling  the cow resided in a herd different to that in which it had been present at 90 days of age. Only animals with a record for antibody response to  were retained if they resided in a herd that had at least five cows positive for antibody response to  (i.e.  an ODR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4 was previously shown to lead to production losses [] and  thus  this cut-off was regarded as the positive threshold for antibody response to  in the current study) and a within-herd prevalence higher than 5% with a positive antibody response to  on the day of the blood test. Since the majority of grazing cattle are exposed to  [  ] and since cows in our study were known to graze grass for most of the year  all cows were considered as exposed to . For antibody response to  we retained only the records as positive for cows that resided in a herd with a within-herd cow prevalence of more than 1% (i.e.  ELISA test manufacturer stated that a PP<U+2009>=<U+2009>20 indicates a positive result for  and was thus treated as such in our study) for antibody response to . In addition  the likelihood that progeny from a cow infected with  will also be infected with  [] is high  thus  we discarded progeny from dams that had a positive result for  (86 cows were discarded). The final dataset consisted of 6892 records for antibody response to   9260 records for antibody response to  and 5289 records for antibody response to . Each observed animal phenotype for the continuous traits for antibody response to    and  was adjusted for non-genetic effects. Genetic and non-genetic effects for antibody response to each of the three parasites were estimated using the MIX99 software suite []. The statistical model was as previously described by Twomey et al. []. Fixed effects for antibody response to each of the three parasites were parity  age relative to parity median  stage of lactation  heterosis and recombination coefficients  and contemporary group; random effects were the direct additive genetic effects  where  with  representing the additive variance and  representing the numerator relationships matrix  and a residual effect  where  with  representing the residual variance and  representing an identity matrix. The pedigree of each animal was traced back to the founder population  which was allocated to 11 genetic groups based on breed (i.e.  Holstein  Friesian  Belgian Blue  Hereford  Aberdeen Angus  Simmental Limousin  Charolais  several other French breeds not listed  and other breeds not listed and unknown). Variance components were as previously described by Twomey et al. [] for the current dataset; the fitted genetic variance was 0.095 for antibody response to   0.003 for antibody response to  and 0.001 for antibody response to   while the residual variance was 0.734 for   0.034 for  and 0.010 for   which resulted in heritability values of 0.12  0.08 and 0.09  respectively. For each cow  phenotypes for the three parasites were adjusted for fixed effects (estimated with the linear mixed model) from the cow’s respective phenotype. Only animals that had both an adjusted phenotype and an available genotype were retained for further analysis; 6388 animals remained for   8334 animals remained for  and 4597 animals remained for . Genotypes were available from six different genotyping panels  and the number of animals genotyped per panel is in Additional file : Table S1. In the dataset of deregressed EBV for -damaged liver  87% of the animals were genotyped using either the Illumina bovine High-Density BeadChip (HD; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>777 962 SNPs; 20% of animals) or the International Dairy and Beef version 1 (IDBv1; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>17 137 SNPs; 10% of animals)  version 2 (IDBv2; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>18 004 SNPs; 32% of animals) or version 3 (IDBv3; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>53 450 SNPs; 25% of animals) genotyping panels. In the dataset of adjusted phenotypes for antibody response to the three different phenotypes  most of the animals were genotyped on the IDBv1 (2% of animals)  IDBv2 (76% of animals) or IDBv3 (14% of animals) genotyping panel. All animals had a call rate higher than 90% and only autosomal SNPs  SNPs with a reported chromosomal position  and SNPs with a call rate higher than 90% were retained for each panel. All animals were imputed to HD using a two-step approach with the FImpute2 software []; first  the IDB genotyped animals were imputed to the Bovine SNP50 density (50 k) and subsequently all resulting genotypes (including the Bovine SNP50 genotypes) were imputed to HD using a multi-breed reference population of 5504 HD genotyped animals. Second  imputation to whole-genome sequence (WGS) was undertaken using a multi-breed reference population of 2333  animals from Run6.0 of the 1000 Bulls Genomes Project. All variants in the reference population were called using SAMtools  and genotype calls were improved using the Beagle software to provide a consensus SNP density across all animals. Details of the alignment to the UMD 3.1  assembly  variant calling and quality controls that were completed within the multi-breed sequence reference population are as described by Daetwyler et al. []. In total  41.39 million SNPs in Run6.0 were identified across the genome and the average coverage (standard deviation) was 12.85 (6.94)X. Imputation of the HD genotypes to WGS was then completed by first phasing all HD genotypes using Eagle ([]; version 2.3.2) and subsequently imputing to WGS using minimac3 []. Regions with poor WGS imputation accuracy  perhaps due to local mis-assemblies or mis-orientated contigs  were identified by using a larger dataset of 147 309 verified parent-progeny relationships. Mendelian errors  defined as the proportion of opposing homozygotes in a parent-progeny pair  were estimated for each relationship and the subsequent Mendelian error rate per SNP was calculated. To accurately identify genomic regions with poor imputation  the R package GenWin [] which fits a ß-spline to the data to find likely inflection points  was used to determine the breakpoints of genomic regions with high Mendelian errors. Windows were analysed using an initial window size of 5 kb and Genwin pooled windows for which the SNP Mendelian error rates were similar. The average SNP Mendelian error rate per window was estimated and all variants within windows in which the mean SNP Mendelian error rate was higher than 0.02 were removed (i.e. 687 137 SNPs were removed). Further quality control edits were also imposed on the imputed sequence genotypes  including the removal of SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.002 and of SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equation (P<U+2009><<U+2009>6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). After these edits  14 190 141 SNPs remained for animals with a deregressed EBV for -damaged liver  whereas 16 603 644 SNPs remained for cows with an antibody response to a parasitic disease. The final dataset of animals with both a deregressed EBV for -damaged and an imputed sequence genotype contained 3702 animals. The mean breed composition of the animals in the dataset of -damaged liver was 38% Holstein–Friesian  17% Limousin  11% Charolais  11% Aberdeen Angus and the remaining 23% was another breed (Fig. ). The final dataset of animals with both an adjusted phenotype for antibody response and an imputed sequence genotype contained 6388 animals for   8334 animals for  and 4597 animals for . In the dataset of antibody response to the three parasitic diseases  the mean breed composition of the cows was 84% Holstein–Friesian  9% Jersey with the remaining 7% from another breed. The mean breed composition of animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3702) in the dataset for -damaged liver for Aberdeen Angus (AA)  Belgian Blue (BB)  Charolais (CH)  Hereford (HE)  Holstein–Friesian (HO/FR)  Jersey (JE)  Limousin (LM)  Parthenaise (PT)  Simmental (SI)  all other known breeds (OTH) and unknown breed (UNK) A genomic relationship matrix was calculated separately for each of the traits using Method I of VanRaden [] as: where  is an incidence matrix for the HD genotypes  centred by allele frequencies  and  and  are the dominant and recessive allele  respectively. For all the traits in this study  SNP effects were estimated using linear mixed models in the WOMBAT software []. For each of the dependent variables  animal was included as a random effect with relationships between animals accounted for via the genomic relationship matrix. When the dependent variable was a deregressed EBV for -damaged liver  the phenotype was weighted based on the information available. The weight was calculated as []: where  is the weighting factor of the th deregressed EBV   is the heritability estimate for -damaged liver   is the reliability of the th deregressed EBV  and  is the proportion of genetic variance not accounted for by the SNPs and was set at 0.9. Purfield et al. [] tested various values of  (i.e.  0.1  0.2  0.8 and 0.9) and reported that all had a minimal impact on the results. The proportions of Holstein–Friesian  Limousin  Charolais  Simmental  Aberdeen Angus  Belgian Blue  Parthenaise  Jersey and other breeds were fitted as covariates in the model for -damaged liver; a constraint was imposed by setting the effect of the Hereford breed to zero to avoid linear dependencies. The genomic inflation was estimated for each association analysis and all  estimates were less than 1.1  i.e. 1.004 for -damaged liver  1.0002 for antibody response to   1.0133 for antibody response to  and 1.0320 for antibody response to . Multiple-testing correction was applied to each analysis by transforming the p values into their corresponding q values assuming a false discovery rate of 5% []. Therefore  SNPs with a q value lower than 0.05 were regarded as significant for the purpose of this study. Suggestive SNPs were defined as SNPs with a p value lower than 10. Using PLINK []  QTL regions were defined around each SNP of interest  based on the flanking LD pattern. For each significant or suggestive SNP  its squared correlation () with all the other SNPs within 5 Mb upstream and 5 Mb downstream was calculated. Using a threshold of 0.5 for   the start of the QTL region was defined as the position of the SNP that was furthest upstream from the significant or suggestive SNP with an  higher than 0.5; the end of the QTL region was defined as the position of the SNP that was furthest downstream with an  with the suggestive or significant SNP higher than 0.5. For QTL regions that overlapped  QTL regions were combined into a single QTL region and maximum and minimum positions were set as start and end boundaries. Gene search using Ensembl () on the UMD 3.1 genome build was carried out by focusing on the defined QTL regions. In addition  protein-coding genes  which were identified either as overlapping with or located within QTL regions  were subject to enrichment analysis on The Database for Annotation  Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v. 6.8. Functional annotations (Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process  GO Cellular Component  GO Molecular Function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome Pathways) were assigned to genes using the functional annotation tool. P values were calculated by EASE (an adoption of the Fisher Exact test to measure the gene-enrichment in annotation terms) to identify functional annotations that were associated with traits of interest. The mean effective record contribution (ERC) was equal to 4.53 (ranging from 1.01 to 277.69) in the dataset of -damaged liver (Fig. ). Distribution of effective record contributions (ERC) of animals in the dataset of deregressed -damaged liver EBV The associations between each SNP and -damaged liver are shown on the Manhattan plot in Fig. . We found no SNP with a q value lower than 0.05 for -damaged liver. Details of the most strongly associated SNPs (with a p value<U+2009><<U+2009>10) in each QTL region for -damaged liver are in Table . Six SNPs  located on BTA1  8  11  16  17 and 18  had a p value lower than 10 (Table ); five of these six SNPs were classified as intronic variants in one of each of the   or  genes. The sixth SNP for -damaged liver was classified as an intergenic variant on BTA1. SNP rs384464701 on BTA18 was the most strongly associated with -damaged liver (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.92<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and was classified as an intronic variant located in the  gene. The frequency of the favourable allele for each of the six SNPs with a p value lower than 10 ranged from 0.002 to 0.998 (Table ). In total  121 suggestive SNPs were identified (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>10) and were located across 23 chromosomes.

The blue line is the threshold for suggestive SNPs Forty-eight QTL regions were suggestively associated with -damaged liver (see Additional file : Table S2). On BTA7  21 SNPs were suggestively associated with -damaged liver in a single QTL region that spanned from 65.23 to 67.30 Mb and this region included three protein-coding genes ( and ); the SNP with the strongest association in this region was rs475893299 (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.23<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). In the QTL region between 93.61 and 93.79 Mb on BTA11  18 SNPs were suggestively associated with -damaged liver; all the genes located in this region encoded olfactory receptors ( and ); in addition  the only QTL region associated with antibody response to  that overlapped with a QTL associated with -damaged liver was on BTA11 between 93.74 and 93.89 Mb. The associations between each SNP and antibody response to    and  are shown on the Manhattan plots in Fig. . Details of the most strongly associated SNPs (with a p value<U+2009><<U+2009>10) in each QTL region for antibody response to    and  are in Tables    and   respectively. Manhattan plot showing -<U+2009>log(p values) of the association between the effect of each single nucleotide polymorphism and antibody response to        . The blue line is the threshold for suggestive SNPs We did not detect any SNP that was significantly associated (q value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) with antibody response to . Fifty-seven SNPs had a p value lower than 10 and were located on BTA6 (1 SNP)  BTA14 (1 SNP)  BTA15 (43 SNPs)  BTA18 (1 SNP) and BTA20 (11 SNPs). The most highly associated SNP was rs801151638 (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.02<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  which was classified as an intergenic variant on BTA14 (Table ). The frequency of the favourable allele ranged from 0.003 to 0.988 for the 57 SNPs with a p value lower than 10. In total  226 SNPs were detected as suggestively associated with antibody response to  (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>10) and 37 QTL regions were identified for antibody response to  the largest QTL was 7 593 750 bp long (between 25.26 and 32.86 Mb) on BTA19; (see Additional file : Table S3). Some suggestive SNPs were not in linkage disequilibrium (LD; r<U+2009><<U+2009>0.5) with flanking SNPs  thus nine of the 37 detected QTL regions harboured only one SNP. Fifty SNPs were suggestively associated with antibody response to  in the QTL region between 80.81 and 81.30 Mb on BTA16  which contained 4268 tested SNPs (average LD between 50 suggestive SNPs was 0.99); SNP rs434571591 had the strongest association with antibody response to  (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>3.28<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Five protein-coding genes were located between 80.8 and 81.30 Mb on BTA16  namely         and . In the QTL region between 23.52 and 23.58 Mb on BTA15  43 of the 709 tested SNPs were detected as suggestively associated with antibody response to ; no gene was identified in  or overlapped with  this QTL region. We found no SNP significantly associated with antibody response to  (q value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  but nine SNPs were detected for antibody response to  with a p value lower than 10 (Table ). Of these nine SNPs  seven had a frequency of the favourable allele lower than 0.1  and one SNP was classified as an intronic variant in the  gene and the remaining eight as intergenic variants. Forty-two QTL were identified as suggestively associated with antibody response to  (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>10; see Additional file : Table S4). In total  134 SNPs were identified as suggestively associated with antibody response to  The QTL region between 94.02 and 98.01 Mb on BTA12 harboured 21 SNPs suggestively associated with antibody response to ; no gene was located in this region. Five SNPs with a q value lower than 0.05 for antibody response to  were located on BTA21 (2 SNPs) and 25 (3 SNPs)  respectively. In the QTL region between 13.04 and 14.10 Mb on BTA25  one of the three SNPs was classified as an intronic variant in the  gene and the other two as downstream variants on the micro-RNA gene  ---. SNP rs133449464  that was classified as an intronic variant in the  gene  was the most strongly associated (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.56<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) with antibody response to  (Table ). The frequency of the favourable allele at SNP rs133449464 was only 0.005 and none of the cows included in the dataset was homozygous for the favourable allele. The two SNPs on BTA21 with a q value lower than 0.05 were located within the QTL between 55.07 and 56.27 Mb and classified as intronic variants in the genes  and ; one of these two SNPs was also classified as a downstream variant in the gene . In total  248 suggestive and significant SNPs were associated with antibody response to ; only five of these 248 SNPs had a MAF higher than 0.1. Forty-one QTL were identified as associated with antibody response to   of which eight contained only one SNP  since the suggestive SNP was not in LD (r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.5) with any other SNP in the flanking region of 5 Mb; the largest of the 41 QTL regions was 6 332 498 bp long (between 106.93 and 113.26 Mb) on BTA1 (see Additional file : Table S5). Almost half of the suggestive SNPs associated with antibody response to  were located in only three QTL regions  between 45.13 and 49.15 Mb on BTA1 (24 SNPs)  between 106.93 and 113.26 Mb on BTA1 (66 SNPs) and between 57.83 and 58.95 Mb on BTA14 (30 SNPs). Of the 102 protein-coding genes  which either overlapped with  or were within QTL regions of suggestive SNPs for -damaged liver  DAVID identified 97 for the gene set enrichment analysis. The most strongly associated pathways and gene ontology (GO) sets with -damaged liver are in Additional file : Table S6. Three pathways and 11 GO sets were identified with a p value lower than 0.05. The pathway R-BTA-381753 had the strongest association with -damaged liver and included 11 genes from the gene set. The GO set with the strongest association (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.50<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) with -damaged liver was the biological process of ion transmembrane transport  which included four genes from the gene set. Gene sets submitted to DAVID consisted of 324 genes for antibody response to   333 genes for antibody response to   and 429 genes for antibody response to . In total  DAVID recognised 307  289  and 373 genes for antibody response to    and   respectively. The top five ranked pathways for antibody response to    and  are in Additional file : Table S7 and the five GO sets that were most highly associated with antibody response to    and  are in Additional file : Table S8. Five pathways and 28 GO sets were significantly (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) associated with antibody response to . The top ranked pathway and GO set for antibody response to  was R-BTA-2142712 (which included three genes from the gene set; see Additional file : Table S7) and lipoxygenase pathway (included six genes from the gene set; see Additional file : Table S8)  respectively. For antibody response to   we found 14 pathways and 28 GO sets with a p value lower than 0.05. A strong association was identified between the pathway olfactory transduction (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and antibody response to ; 60 genes were included in this pathway and were also identified in QTL regions associated with antibody response to  (see Additional file : Table S7). The GO biological process of G-protein coupled receptor signalling pathway was strongly associated with antibody response to  (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.40<U+2009>×<U+2009>10; see Additional file : Table S8). In the gene set enrichment analysis of antibody response to   19 pathways and 23 GO sets were identified as significant (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). The alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathway was associated with antibody response to  with a p value lower than 2.70<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (see Additional file : Table S7). The GO metabolic function  phospholipase A2 activity  had the strongest association with antibody response to  (p value<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.90<U+2009>×<U+2009>10; see Additional file : Table S8). The globally widespread prevalence of endo-parasites in dairy and beef cattle is of major concern []  since parasitic infection is associated with reduced overall animal performance and compromised animal health and welfare [  ]. Although there are many shortcomings of using anthelmintic treatments  a single annual anthelmintic treatment is still the mainstay control strategy for  and  in cattle [  ]. For the prevention of  infection  herd biosecurity is the major control strategy adopted in herds []. Since several studies have shown that    and  display genetic diversity  genetic selection for resistant cattle could be a complementary approach to current control strategies [    ]. In addition  the existence of large genetic variation for endo-parasites in cattle suggests the presence of variability at the genome level  which governs inter-animal variability in susceptibility to endo-parasites. Information at the genome-level  pertaining to the ability of cattle to resist to parasitic infection  could help develop novel pharmaceuticals and diagnostic tests and implement genome-enabled selection. Consequently  knowledge of the biology that underlies such resistance to parasitic infection could help reduce the prevalence of endo-parasites in cattle  and at the same time reduce the reliance on anthelmintic treatments. Therefore  the objective of our study was to locate genomic regions that contribute to the ability of cattle to resist infection to  and . It is important to note that our analyses were done on imputed sequence data  which may contain errors []  and thus to alleviate this issue  rare variants with a MAF lower than 0.2%  SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (in a larger population to more conclusively identify genotyping errors and abnormalities)  and SNPs in regions with a high Mendelian error rate were removed  as described in the Methods section. To evaluate the benefit of using (imputed) whole-genome sequence in association analyses in cattle  we carried out an additional analysis in which only 50 k and HD SNPs were used (see Additional file : Figure S1). When the associations that we detected were limited to only SNPs on either the 50 k or HD panels  no SNP was identified with a p value lower than 10 for any of the parasite phenotypes investigated. In addition  only 4 and 2% of the QTL detected for antibody response to  and   respectively  and no QTL for -damaged liver and antibody response to  would have been identified if only 50 k SNPs were used instead of the imputed whole-genome sequence data. Furthermore  if we had used only the HD SNPs instead of the imputed whole-sequence data  only 4% of QTL reported here would have been detected for -damaged liver and only 11  5 and 0% of QTL would have been detected for antibody response to    and   respectively. Therefore  the majority of the causal SNPs or SNPs in LD with causal SNPs for parasitic diseases in cattle are absent on the 50 k and HD panels  which highlights the benefit of using whole-sequence data to identify more precisely the regions of the genome associated with specific traits. It should also be noted  that our study included multiple breeds  which may not be a representative dataset of other studies. A limited number of previous studies have attempted to locate genomic regions associated with endo-parasitic diseases in cattle  but none used antibody response or liver damage phenotypes to identify regions of the bovine genome associated with parasitic diseases. In their analysis of 768 Dutch dairy cows using 153 microsatellite markers  Coppieters et al. [] documented that FEC was associated with the QTL between 22.96 and 25.23 Mb on BTA19 and concluded that the gene located in this region    was involved in the immune response to parasitic diseases. Although  in our study  the QTL between 22.96 and 25.23 Mb on BTA19 did not include any suggestive SNPs  a nearby region  located between 25.26 and 32.86 Mb  contained six suggestive SNPs for antibody response to  (p values ranging from 6.59<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to 8.09<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Thus  one or more QTL regions on BTA19 may be associated with resistance to parasitic diseases. In a study on 584 Angus cattle  Kim et al. [] reported that 12 regions on the bovine genome contributed to significant genetic variation in FEC; to our knowledge  this is the only previous study that used dense genome-wide SNP genotypes (31 165 SNPs after edits) to map genomic regions associated with endo-parasitic diseases in cattle. In our study  the QTL between 65.23 and 67.30 Mb on BTA7 contained the most suggestive SNPs (21 SNPs) associated with -damaged liver  and this region overlaps with one of the QTL (64.19 to 66.89 Mb) identified by Kim et al. []. One of the genes that we detected in this region  i.e.   was previously reported to be associated with ovulation rate in 639 Japanese Black cattle []. However  Cushman et al. [] reported that  had no influence on ovulation rate in a study of 139 crossbred beef cows. In humans   has been linked to the neurological disease schizophrenia [  ]  asparaginase hypersensitivity []  and migraines []. In our study  we found that  was involved in two pathways  which were over-represented for -damaged liver and are linked to the neurology of the animal  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Although ectopic  infection has been reported to cause neurological diseases in humans [  ]  there are no clinical reports of neurological diseases in cattle associated with lesions in the central nervous system. Kim et al. [] also documented a QTL region  located between 48.67 and 66.21 Mb on BTA6  which was suggestively associated with FEC in 584 Aberdeen Angus cattle. In our study  we detected a QTL region (containing 18 suggestive SNPs) on BTA6 associated with antibody response to  within the region previously reported by Kim et al. []. We found four protein-coding genes (       and ) and one RNA gene () that were located within this region on BTA6. The  gene likely plays a role in the determination of the antibody response to   since it is involved in the activation of mast cells  which are known to increase in numbers in response to  infection []. There was no overlap between the associations identified by Kim et al. [] with FEC and those identified here for antibody response to either  or . In a study based on only four sheep that were experimentally infected with   Alvarez Rojas et al. [] identified the lipoxygenase pathway with an over-representation of genes that were both up-regulated and down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  2 weeks after infection. These results are supported by our findings on the association of the lipoxygenase pathway and other pathways linked to arachidonic acid with antibody response to . This was expected since arachidonic acid  which is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid  is documented as suppressing the Th1 immune response in mice [  ] that decreases during  infection []. Furthermore  studies comparing cows supplemented or not with a range of polyunsaturated fatty acids showed that those that were supplemented had higher levels of T-helper cells  T-cytotoxic cells  cells that expressed IL-2 receptors  and CD62 adhesion molecules []  as well as a higher mean lymphocyte proliferation and higher titers of anti-OVA IgG []. In our study  we also expected that there would be very little overlap between QTL regions associated to the two phenotypes for   since Twomey et al. [] found only a weak genetic relationship between -damaged liver and antibody response to  (0.37; SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.28). To date  the significant regions associated with antibody response to  on BTA21 and 25 had not been reported to be associated with endo-parasitic diseases in cattle. The favourable alleles for the most significant SNP on BTA21 and 25 had a frequency of only 0.003 and 0.005  respectively  which suggests that  if this frequency increased  more genetic gain is potentially possible. However  when we analysed exclusively the 3038 purebred Holstein–Friesians in our study  the allele frequency of the most significant SNP on BTA21 and 25 dropped to 0.002 and 0.001  respectively and these SNPs were not associated with antibody response to  (p value<U+2009>><U+2009>0.06). Nevertheless  the most significant SNP on BTA25 in the multi-breed analysis was an intronic variant located in the  gene  which encodes an enzyme (PARN) that has a role in early foetal development []. In cows  the gene  has been linked to embryo loss  since the level of  mRNA was lower in persistent follicles (‘ageing’ follicles associated with embryo loss) than in growing follicles [].  infection in females can result in abortion or embryo loss [] and in reduced reproductive performance []  thus the association that we observed between PARN and antibody response to  is supported by the association between  and embryo loss. We identified that SNP rs384464701  an intronic variant in the  gene on BTA18  was associated with -damaged liver but the frequency of its favourable allele (0.988) was very high  thus  the potential gains for phenotypic improvement in resistance are very limited; in fact  the allele is fixed in the two British breeds of the 301 purebred Aberdeen Angus and 164 purebred Herefords included in our study. Analysis of the 1248 purebred Holstein–Friesians (i.e. <U+2009>=<U+2009>87.5% Holstein–Friesian) in our study revealed that this SNP rs384464701 had a p value of 3.91<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and the frequency of its favourable allele was 0.003.  is known to have a strong association with human obesity []. Bravard et al. [] suggested that  has a role in the metabolic regulation of the liver. In cattle  variants of the  gene have previously been associated with both growth and carcass traits [  ] as well as with fat and protein yield in milk []; taken together  these results suggest that  may be involved in energy homeostasis. However  Twomey et al. [] reported that -damage liver had little or no genetic association with milk production and carcass merit in cattle. Regarding the antibody response to  we detected a SNP at 1 746 600 bp located on BTA3 in the  gene that was associated with a p value of 7.74<U+2009>×<U+2009>10; there were 17 other suggestive SNPs identified in this region between 0.95 and 6.39 Mb on BTA3. Although  the frequency of the favourable allele (<<U+2009>0.004) was low for all these suggestive SNPs   is a likely candidate gene associated with antibody response to . Indeed  in a study on mice  Williams et al. [] reported that  was important for the intestinal barrier function  and thus it may have a role in the defence of gastrointestinal nematodes such as . Research on animal resistance to disease focuses mainly on the immune response [  ]. Nevertheless  the coevolution of animals and parasites has led to the development of animal behavioural strategies  including an avoidance strategy  to minimize parasite infection []. One such avoidance strategy is avoiding faecal areas caused by an odour cue  since the majority of parasites will be located in areas near (or within) faecal material []. In a study on 16 Aberdeen Angus steers  Smith et al. [] observed that cattle avoided grazing areas contaminated by faeces  with the exception of rabbit faecal material. In a study on 20 sheep  Hutchings et al. [] reported that ewes classified as genetically resistant to parasitic diseases displayed a different grazing behaviour compared to ewes classified as genetically susceptible to parasitic diseases; ewes that were considered as genetically resistant did not graze areas contaminated by faeces. As suggested by Twomey et al. []  avoidance strategies may contribute to the genetic differences observed among cattle for different parasite phenotypes. Although  avoidance techniques by livestock may depend on visual clues  odour clues are most likely also involved. Our findings suggest that cattle use odour cues as part of an avoidance strategy for the three endo-parasites studied here  since at least one pathway and GO set involved in the olfactory system were significant (p value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) for each of the parasite phenotypes. In addition  the only region on the bovine genome  that contained QTL that were suggestively associated to -damaged liver and antibody response to   included a large number of olfactory receptor genes. This suggests that a proportion of the genetic variation observed for parasitic diseases may be linked to the ability of cattle to avoid infective larvae. Nevertheless  since genes in these suggestive regions were used in the gene set enrichment analysis  further research is needed to support the concept that cattle avoid infection through odour cues. We identified a large number of QTL regions that were associated with the endo-parasite phenotypes investigated in our study. We observed strong associations between genomic regions on BTA21 and 25 with antibody response to ; the associated favourable alleles had a low frequency in the studied population  which suggests that large genetic gain could be achieved.

In the short term  selection against carriers is a possible alternative to genome editing when variants are recessive. Our results suggest that  in the future  there is the potential to use RAGE against deleterious load in animal breeding. Deleterious load is an unavoidable fact of genetics that has a sizeable impact on the fitness of populations []. Most individuals have de novo deleterious mutations due to errors in DNA replication [  ] and inherit many more from their ancestors. Reducing the number of deleterious variants in livestock populations could improve fitness traits  with subsequent benefits for animal welfare and profitability. In this paper  we use simulation of deleterious variants in an animal breeding program to evaluate the efficiency of genome editing and selection against carriers for improving fitness traits in livestock. Deleterious variants can have large or small effects. Recessive lethal variants are the most obvious symptoms of large-effect deleterious mutations [       ]. However  estimated distributions of the effects of deleterious mutations from several species indicate that most of the deleterious load is due to many variants each with a small effect [   ]. In practice  large-effect variants that cause recessive lethality are easier to identify and manage. However  this raises the question: what can be done about polygenic deleterious load? Deleterious variants of large and small effect can be identified by bioinformatics screening methods that use sequence conservation and biological prior information about protein function [    ]. Such approaches have been applied to whole-genome sequence data to detect deleterious variants in crop plants [  ]  livestock [  ]  and humans [  ]. With the decreasing cost of genome sequencing  and the large initiatives to sequence livestock animals  we can anticipate that screening of sequence variants will become a routine part of animal breeding. Once deleterious variants are discovered  there are two obvious ways to incorporate them into breeding programs: genome editing or selection. Genome editing is a suite of methods to modify the genomic DNA of an organism that allows not just insertion and deletion but replacement of sequences with a higher efficiency than previous methods  which involved difficult procedures such as microinjecting DNA into the nucleus of zygotes that produces engineered embryonic stem cells for implantation into chimeric embryos (reviewed by [  ]). Genome editing has shown theoretical promise for improving breeding progress by promoting favorable alleles [  ]  and for managing recessive lethal variants []. Selection against carriers is the strategy of choice for removing monogenic recessive deleterious variants from animal breeding populations [  ]. Analogously  one could select against deleterious alleles at many loci by avoiding selection candidates with a high deleterious load. We regard this as a natural extension of avoiding sires that carry alleles for monogenic defects. The aim of this paper was to compare the efficiency of genome editing and selection against carriers for decreasing deleterious load in an animal breeding program. We simulated polygenic deleterious load that is subject to natural selection in a simulation of a closed animal breeding population that is artificially selected for a quantitative performance trait representing the breeding goal. We compared removal of alleles by genome editing (RAGE) to selection against carriers using genotypes at deleterious variants. We compared strategies for prioritizing variants for editing and individuals for selection based on deleterious allele and genotype frequencies  and evaluated how they improved the fitness of the population. We used simulations to compare genome editing and selection against carriers using genotypes at deleterious variants. The population was similar  in terms of its size and pedigree structure  to a single breeding line of pigs. We simulated artificial selection for a quantitative trait representing the breeding goal  and natural selection for a fitness trait representing reduced probability of survival due to deleterious variants. The fitness trait was polygenic with multiplicative fitness effects and an effect size distribution that was inspired by estimates of the distribution of deleterious effects in human populations []. In summary  the simulations consisted of 50 replicates of: coalescent process simulation to create ancestral haplotypes; setting up a quantitative trait and a fitness trait; 15 generations of natural selection against deleterious variants  the first five using 1000 random matings per generation and the following 10 using 500 random matings per generation; 20 generations of historical breeding with natural selection and simultaneous selection on true breeding value for the breeding goal trait; and finally 10 generations of future breeding  where we evaluated scenarios with genome editing or selection against carriers. Figure  shows an overview of this workflow. We also tested a longer (25 generations) historical breeding phase  and a shorter historical breeding phase (10 generations of natural selection instead of 15  followed by 5 generations of historical breeding). Flow chart with an overview of the simulations We used the Markovian coalescent simulator [] to generate ancestral haplotypes. We modelled a genome consisting of 10 chromosomes each one Morgan long with 6.75<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 bp. The chromosomes were simulated using a mutation rate of 1.6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 per site  and an effective population size that changed over time to reach a final size of 100. The effective population size was set to be 10 at 190 000 generations ago  100 000 at 100 000 generations ago  and 100 at current time  with linear decreases (on the 4<U+2009>×<U+2009>N<U+2009>×<U+2009>time scale) in between. We also tested the simulation of founder haplotypes by using a constant effective population size of 100 individuals. To capture artificial selection for the breeding goal and natural selection against deleterious variants simultaneously  we modelled a quantitative breeding goal trait and a fitness trait. The breeding goal trait was a polygenic quantitative trait with additive effects. We randomly assigned 10 000 segregating sites (1000 per chromosome) as quantitative trait variants for the breeding goal trait with additive effects drawn from a normal distribution. We also tested drawing the additive effects from a gamma distribution  and then randomly choosing a sign with equal probability of a positive and a negative effect. We used a shape parameter of 11  based on the estimate for pigs from []. Fitness was a polygenic multiplicative trait that represented probability of survival prior to artificial selection. We randomly assigned 10 000 segregating sites as fitness variants (again 1000 per chromosome)  choosing variants that had allele frequencies lower than 0.01 in scenarios in which variants were codominant  and 0.1 in scenarios in which variants were recessive. The fitness variants were chosen independently of the quantitative trait variants. The deleterious effect size was expressed as a selection coefficient  against the mutant allele  ranging from 0 (no deleterious effect) to 1 (a lethal allele). The fitness of each genotype was 1 for the homozygous wildtype   for the heterozygote  and  for the mutant homozygote  where  is a dominance coefficient. Dominance coefficients were either 0 for recessive variants or 0.5 codominant variants. We assumed multiplicative effects  so that the fitness of an individual was the product of the contribution of each fitness variant. The effect sizes were drawn from a mixture of three uniform distributions with one-third of the variants being small (0<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>10)  one-third intermediate (10<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>0.1)  and one-third large (0.1<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>1). These proportions were chosen based on the estimated distribution of deleterious effects in humans []. Deleterious mutations occurred randomly during natural selection and historical breeding with a mutation rate of 10 per locus  to give a deleterious mutation rate of 1 per individual and genome. This is a conservative estimate for the deleterious mutation rate in mammals. No back-mutation was allowed  meaning that only wild type alleles could mutate. Quantitative trait variants for the breeding goal trait did not mutate  except during the initial coalescent simulation to create ancestral haplotypes. At each generation during the historical and future breeding  we first applied natural selection for fitness  then artificial selection for the breeding goal trait on the remaining individuals. For natural selection  we drew a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 for each individual. If the number was larger than the fitness value for that individual  the individual was removed from the population before selection. For artificial selection  we selected 25 sires and a variable number of dams based on true breeding value for the breeding goal trait. Mating between sires and dams was random. Each dam had 10 progeny. We selected the number of dams required to reach a population of 5000 individuals at the average level of deleterious load at the start of historical breeding. To simulate the discovery of deleterious variants  we selected a random fraction of the deleterious variants that segregated at the end of historical breeding and assumed them to be discovered. We used a discovery rate of 0.75 for the main scenarios  but also tested discovery rates of 0.1  0.5 and 1. To simulate imperfect detection of deleterious variants  we chose neutral segregating variants as false positives at random. We added false positives so that the total number of variants detected was equal to the number of segregating deleterious variants  and if discovery rate was   a fraction 1<U+2009>-<U+2009> were false positives. These discovered variants were allowed to be edited or used for selection against carriers subsequently. For the future breeding scenarios that used removal of alleles by genome editing  we simulated editing of discovered deleterious variants in selected sires. That is  first we selected sires on the breeding goal trait  and then applied genome editing for the fitness trait to all the 25 sires. For variants for which a sire was not already homozygous wild type  we edited the genotype to homozygous wild type  until a set number of variants had been edited. We assumed that editing was accurate  such that it always produced wild type homozygotes  and had no deleterious off-target effects. We edited 1  5  or 20 variants per sire. We only edited variants that were segregating in the population. To simulate mortality during genome editing  we randomly removed edited sires  according to a given mortality rate  and replaced them with lower-ranked candidate sires from the population. The replacement sires were not genome-edited. We applied no mortality rate for the main scenarios  but also tested mortality rates of 0.1  0.25  and 0.5. The mortality rate parameter represents both direct mortality during the editing process  and also failures of editing that would introduce unwanted  presumably deleterious  alleles and lead to culling the sire. During future breeding  we removed alleles by genome editing at discovered deleterious variants in selected sires. We used five strategies for prioritizing variants for editing. These strategies were based on information that would be available from genotyping the sires at discovered deleterious variants  namely the deleterious allele and genotype frequencies. We assumed that the deleterious effect size was unknown. The strategies were: Based on high frequency  removing variants in decreasing order of deleterious allele frequency. The rationale for this strategy was that recessive deleterious variants cause more damage when they are common  and therefore removing high-frequency variants  first  might be beneficial. Based on low frequency  removing variants in increasing order of deleterious allele frequency. The rationale for this strategy was that since deleterious variants are removed by natural selection  low-frequency variants are more likely to be damaging. Based on lack of homozygotes  removing variants in decreasing order of the difference between observed and expected deleterious allele homozygotes. The rationale for this strategy was that scanning for a deficit of homozygotes is a way to detect recessive lethal individuals []  and might therefore help identify variants that are more damaging. Based on intermediate frequency  removing variants in decreasing order of deleterious allele frequency after applying a threshold to exclude variants with an allele frequency higher than 0.25. The rationale for this strategy was to remove recessive variants that are common  while filtering out variants with allele frequencies that are too high to have large negative effects. Random  in random order  using the same random order for all sires. The rationale for this strategy was to serve as a control. For comparison  we also ran a baseline scenario without genome editing  starting from the same initial populations after historical breeding. During future breeding  we performed selection against carriers in sires by identifying carriers with a high deleterious load and removing them before selection. We avoided the 100  250  or 500 individuals with the highest load when selecting sires. We used three strategies for selecting carriers. These strategies were based on information that would be available from genotyping the sires at discovered deleterious variants  namely the deleterious allele frequencies  genotype frequencies  and individual numbers of deleterious alleles. The strategies were: Total load  avoiding individuals that carry the largest number of deleterious alleles  summing over the discovered variants. The rationale for this strategy was to use all the available information for selection. Heterozygous load  avoiding individuals that carry the largest number of deleterious alleles in the heterozygous state. The rationale for this strategy was that focusing on heterozygotes might be beneficial  because large-effect deleterious variants are rarely homozygous. Homozygous load  avoiding individuals that carry the largest number of deleterious alleles in the homozygous state. The rationale for this strategy was to serve as a control. For comparison  we also ran a baseline scenario without selection against carriers  starting from the same initial populations after historical breeding. We evaluated the simulated scenarios by the improvement in average fitness of the individuals in the population. By an individual’s fitness  we mean the genetic value for the fitness trait. We calculated the average change in fitness from the first to the tenth generation of future breeding  and compared it to the change in fitness in a baseline condition without genome editing and selection against carriers  reporting mean and standard error of the mean. We evaluated the effect of total number of fitness variants in the genome and their dominance coefficients on the number of segregating variants  the frequencies of deleterious alleles  and the deleterious load. By number of segregating variants  we mean the number of fitness variants that remained variable in the population after natural selection and historical breeding. By deleterious load  we mean the number of deleterious alleles that are carried by an individual. When considered separately  heterozygous load means the number of deleterious alleles that are carried in the heterozygous state  and homozygous load means the number of deleterious alleles that are carried in the homozygous state. We performed simulations using AlphaSimR which was modified to allow for fitness traits. AlphaSimR runs on the R statistical environment []  and uses Rcpp and Armadillo [  ]. We calculated summary statistics in the R statistical environment  and made graphs with ggplot2 []. The simulation scripts are available from . We simulated a closed animal breeding population under selection for a breeding goal trait  which was affected simultaneously by deleterious load consisting of either codominant or recessive variants. Our results show that both genome editing of deleterious alleles and selection against carriers can reduce deleterious load in some cases  but is inefficient at reducing it in other cases. The efficiency of genome editing and selection against carriers  and which variant prioritization strategy is the most efficient  depend on whether the deleterious variants are codominant or recessive. The simulated populations had on average 4444 (standard deviation SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>217) segregating deleterious variants in the codominant case  and 3634 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>177) in the recessive case. Each individual carried on average a load of 52 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.6) deleterious alleles in the codominant case and 89 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.7) deleterious alleles in the recessive case. Figure  shows violin plots of the deleterious load carried by individuals at both levels of dominance. The distribution of deleterious alleles was affected by dominance. The scatterplots in Fig.  show the relationship between effect size and frequency of deleterious alleles after historical breeding. When deleterious variants were codominant  most deleterious variants were rare. When deleterious variants were recessive  there were more deleterious alleles that included even large-effect variants at intermediate frequencies  which are candidates for removal by genome editing. Deleterious allele frequencies and load in simulated populations when deleterious variants are either codominant or recessive. The violin plot shows individual deleterious load broken down into heterozygous and homozygous load with codominant or recessive variants. The scatterplots show the relationship between deleterious allele frequency and deleterious effect size. The effect size ranges from 0 to 1  where an effect size of 0 means a harmless variant  and of 1 a lethal variant (see “”) We also tested varying population parameters to assess the sensitivity to assumptions. We varied the total number of fitness variants in the genome  tested a breeding goal trait with gamma-distributed effects rather than normally-distributed effects  and varied the length of the historical breeding phase. The resulting average fitness and the distribution of deleterious allele frequencies and load were broadly similar (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Figure S1 and Additional file : Figure S2). The exception was in the case of a shorter historical breeding  which resulted in lower deleterious allele frequencies and load. The difference in the distribution of deleterious allele frequencies induced by codominant and recessive variants translates to differences in the efficiency of RAGE and selection against carriers. Figure  shows a comparison of genome editing using the best-performing variant prioritization strategy  and selection against carriers using total deleterious load. When deleterious variants were codominant  the best-performing strategy prioritized low-frequency variants for removal by editing  and selection against carriers was inefficient. When deleterious variants were recessive  the best-performing strategy prioritized variants with an intermediate frequency for removal by editing  and selection against carriers was comparable to genome editing of one variant per sire. However  multiplex editing of five variants per sire outperformed selection against carriers. Figure  shows the change in fitness under different scenarios after 10 generations of future breeding  compared to the baseline case of breeding without genome editing or selection against carriers. In summary  selection against carriers was effective only against recessive deleterious variants  whereas genome editing could be effective at both levels of dominance  but with different variant prioritization strategies performing the best. Comparison of the effect on average fitness of genome editing and selection against carriers  using the best-performing editing strategies for each dominance level. The baseline condition is selection for the breeding goal trait with no effort to reduce deleterious load. The discovery rate was 0.75  meaning that 75% of the deleterious variants that segregated after historical breeding were discovered and could be edited. The lines show averages across 50 replicates Effect on fitness of removal of deleterious alleles by genome editing and selection against carriers. The points show the mean change in fitness over ten generations compared to the baseline case of breeding without editing or selection  varying the number of edits per sire or the number of males avoided  and the strategy for variant prioritization or selection. The error bars are 2 standard errors of the mean RAGE tended to improve or have no effect on the genetic gain of the breeding goal trait  whereas selection against carriers decreased genetic gain of the breeding goal trait. In scenarios in which deleterious load was alleviated  genetic gain of the breeding goal trait increased up to 4% with RAGE  and in scenarios with selection against carriers  genetic gain in the breeding goal trait decreased by up to 5%. Figure  shows the relative change in genetic gain of the breeding goal trait compared to the baseline scenario of no editing or selection against carriers. Our model allowed population size to fluctuate with deleterious load  and scenarios using selection against carriers reduced the male population even more by excluding individuals with a high deleterious load. Thus  genome editing makes it possible to improve fitness traits without sacrificing selection intensity of the breeding goal. Effect on the breeding goal trait of removal of deleterious alleles by genome editing and selection against carriers. The points show the mean relative change in the breeding goal trait over ten generations compared to the baseline case of breeding without editing or selection  expressed as the fraction of increase without genome editing or selection against carriers. The error bars are 2 standard errors of the mean In the next paragraphs  we present first the effects of different variant prioritization strategies on RAGE  then the effect of selection strategies on selection against carriers  and finally the impact of the ability to detect deleterious variants accurately. The efficiency of genome editing for improving fitness was affected by the number of variants edited per sire  and the strategy for prioritizing variants for editing. Figure  shows trajectories of fitness across generations of genome editing  by varying the number of variants edited  and by prioritizing variants at low frequency  variants at high frequency  or randomly chosen deleterious variants for editing. Figure  shows the trajectories of fitness during future breeding using variant prioritization strategies that were devised for recessive variants: prioritizing variants with an intermediate frequency by applying an allele frequency threshold of 0.25  and editing variants based on their deficit of homozygotes. For both levels of dominance  fitness improved more by prioritizing low-frequency variants for editing than by editing in random order  or prioritizing high-frequency variants. When variants were recessive  fitness was most improved by prioritizing variants with an intermediate allele frequency. Prioritizing variants with a deficit of homozygotes did not improve efficiency compared to prioritizing variants with an intermediate allele frequency. Effect of genome editing on fitness. Average fitness over ten generations of future breeding with different editing strategies  and editing of 1  5  or 20 variants per sire. The discovery rate was 0.75. The lines show averages across 50 replicates Effect of prioritizing variants with intermediate allele frequency  and in order of their deviation from expected homozygosity. Average fitness over ten generations of future breeding with 10 000 recessive deleterious variants  editing 1  5  or 20 variants per sire. The discovery rate was 0.75. The lines show averages across 50 replicates The variant prioritization strategies also differed in how many distinct variants were edited. Table  shows the average number of distinct variants edited during 10 generations of future breeding with genome editing. Prioritizing low-frequency variants for editing resulted in the largest number of distinct variants being edited  using random order and intermediate allele frequency strategies resulted in an intermediate number of distinct variants being edited  and prioritizing high-frequency variants for editing led to the smallest number of distinct variants being edited. Thus  when variants were codominant  the greatest improvement in fitness came from editing rare large-effect variants carried by few individuals  but when variants were recessive  the greatest improvement came from removing a relatively smaller number of deleterious variants with an intermediate frequency. The efficiency of selection strategies against carriers also varied with the number of males that were avoided  selection strategy  and dominance (see Additional file : Figure S3). When deleterious variants were codominant  selection against carriers was inefficient regardless of the strategy. When deleterious variants were recessive  selection on total load was the most efficient selection strategy. In no case was selection on only heterozygous or homozygous load better. The efficiency of genome editing and the relative performance of variant prioritization strategies was affected by the discovery rate. Figure  shows fitness trajectories by varying how many of the deleterious variants could be discovered and edited. Concentrating on the best-performing strategies  when deleterious variants were codominant and low-frequency variants were prioritized  fitness improvement increased with discovery rate. When deleterious variants were recessive and variants with an intermediate frequency were prioritized  editing was inefficient when discovery rate was low (0.1)  but there was little difference between a discovery rate of 0.5 and 0.75. Thus  RAGE was susceptible to false positives  but when variants were recessive  whether the false positives made up 25% or 50% of the detected variants had less impact. Effect of discovery rate. Average fitness over ten generations of future breeding with 10 000 deleterious variants  5 edited variants per sire  and discovery rates of 0.1  0.5  0.75  and 1. The lines show averages across 50 replicates. The baseline scenario is with no editing When variants were recessive  a high discovery rate changed the relative ranking of variant prioritization strategies  making the high-frequency strategy more efficient than the intermediate-frequency strategy  which was not the case at lower discovery rates. To illustrate this  Fig.  shows fitness trajectories when all segregating deleterious variants were discovered with no false positives (i.e.  a discovery rate of 1). Taken together  this means that the presence of false positives affects the strategies that use allele frequency information for variant prioritization  differently. Relative efficiency of genome editing strategies against recessive deleterious variants when variant discovery is perfect (discovery rate is 1). The lines show averages across 50 replicates The effect of additional mortality during editing on fitness improvement was also affected by dominance. Figure  shows fitness trajectories by varying mortality rate during editing. When deleterious variants were codominant and low-frequency variants were prioritized  fitness improvement decreased with mortality. However  when deleterious variants were recessive and variants with an intermediate frequency were prioritized  there was little effect of additional mortality on the fitness improvement. Effect of mortality due to editing on fitness. Average fitness over ten generations of future breeding with 10 000 deleterious variants  5 edited variants per sire  a discovery rate of 0.75  and mortality rates of 0  0.1  0.25  and 0.5. The lines show averages across 50 replicates. The baseline scenario is with no editing In this paper  we simulated deleterious load in an animal breeding program  and compared the efficiency of genome editing and selection for decreasing it. We found that both removal of alleles by genome editing and selection against carriers can reduce deleterious load in some scenarios. Dominance of deleterious variants affects the efficiency of genome editing and selection against carriers  and determines which variant prioritization and selection strategy are the most efficient. In the light of these results  we discuss (1) deleterious load in animal breeding populations  (2) the efficiency of different variant prioritization and selection strategies  (3) the factors that improve the efficiency of genome editing of deleterious variants  (4) the assumptions that underlie the simulations  and (5) the implications for applications of RAGE and selection against carriers in breeding. The deleterious loads in the simulated populations were comparable to the observed loads of putative loss-of-function variants in mammals  but they were much smaller than the numbers of deleterious single nucleotide variants predicted with sequence bioinformatics-based methods. Humans are estimated to carry an average load of around 100 [  ] or 150 [] putative loss-of-function variants in protein-coding genes. The average load of loss-of-function variants observed in cattle is 65 []. The load of deleterious variants in our simulations (around 90 deleterious alleles per individual when variants were recessive) was comparable to these numbers. However  observed loads of deleterious nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants that are predicted by bioinformatics methods are much larger: i.e. ranging from 300 to 800 in humans [  ]  and ~<U+2009>656 in a pig population []. This suggests that our assumptions about the distribution of the size of the effect of deleterious variants or genomic deleterious mutation rate may be conservative  and the actual deleterious load may be larger. Dominance of deleterious variants affected the distribution of allele frequencies of deleterious alleles  and therefore determined which variant prioritization strategy and selection strategy was the most efficient. When deleterious variants were codominant  large-effect deleterious variants were rare. Because codominant deleterious alleles are expressed even if they are in the heterozygous state  they are more exposed to purifying selection and their frequency decreases more quickly than that of recessive variants (which is consistent with results from deterministic single-locus population genetic models []). Therefore  the best variant prioritization strategy was to prioritize low-frequency variants for editing. In contrast  when deleterious variants were recessive  there were substantial numbers of large-effect variants at intermediate frequencies. This happens because of the inefficiency of natural selection against recessive variants. Because recessive deleterious variants are expressed only if they are in the homozygous state  the more common they are the more likely they are to cause damage. In spite of this  in the presence of false positives  the best variant prioritization strategy was to prioritize variants with an intermediate frequency for editing. Because false positives are neutral variants  on average they will have higher frequencies than genuine deleterious variants. Therefore  the high-frequency variant prioritization strategy is especially susceptible to false positives. Prioritizing variants with an intermediate frequency for editing balances these effects  at least when the number of edits per sire is small. On the one hand  it avoids false positives by excluding variants at frequencies that are implausibly high for large-effect deleterious variants. On the other hand  among the remaining variants  it prioritizes high-frequency variants  which  when variants are recessive  cause more damage. Another benefit of prioritizing intermediate-frequency variants  or randomly selected variants  for editing is that this strategy requires fewer distinct variants to be edited  and therefore fewer proven editing constructs to be developed and tested  compared to prioritizing low-frequency variants. Our simulations showed no benefit from prioritizing recessive variants for editing based on a deficit of homozygotes. The strategy was inspired by the method of VanRaden et al. [] to discover recessive lethal haplotypes  who compared the number of observed and expected homozygotes. This and related methods have been successfully used to detect recessive lethal haplotypes in livestock. Its failure as a variant prioritization method may be because the simulated deleterious variants had variable effects  most of these having each a small effect or because many variants were rare and thus led to small numbers of expected homozygotes. Furthermore  the extremely widespread use of a few sires in cattle populations [] may give more power to detect deficits in homozygosity. In real populations  we should expect deleterious variants that persist to be at least partially recessive  as suggested by studies of model organisms [  ]  and the ubiquity of inbreeding depression and heterosis [  ]. Therefore  our results suggest that we should prioritize the editing of deleterious variants with intermediate frequencies  or avoid carrier males based on their total deleterious load. According to our simulations  the most important factor for increasing the efficiency of the removal of deleterious alleles by genome editing is the ability to edit multiple variants per individual. Currently  it is not possible to produce germline-edited livestock with multiple alleles edited  but genome editing technologies are progressing rapidly. Multiplex genome editing has been performed in cells and model organisms [    ]. The ability to accurately discover deleterious variants is also important. Methods for detecting deleterious variants predict variant consequences (e.g.  stop codons and frame shifts) based on the genetic code [  ]  or measure evolutionary conservation or constraint in multiple sequence alignments [    ]  or train statistical models to classify variants based on known deleterious variants and various predictors  possibly including variant consequences and evolutionary constraint  or functional genomic and protein structure data [        ]. We expect the latter approach to become more accurate as machine-learning methods improve and as access to continually larger datasets of genetic variants and genomic data increases  and thus  it will be possible to train models on livestock rather than human data. Additional mortality during editing decreased the efficiency of RAGE when deleterious variants were codominant  but  perhaps unexpectedly  had little impact on fitness improvement when deleterious variants were recessive. The explanation is that when a sire to be edited is lost and replaced  the replacement sire is unlikely to be also a carrier for the deleterious variant in question. However  since it will be necessary to fall back on sires with lower breeding values  genetic gain will decrease and there will be potentially be some time lag. Across 10 generations  a 50% mortality rate would lead to the cumulative loss of 125 sires  on average. Given that editing would be done in vitro  this number includes discarded embryos that carry failed genome edits  which means that this would not actually amount to the culling of that many sires with potentially impaired welfare  but high mortality rate would still be costly and problematic. The development of methods to safely and efficiently perform multiplex editing of embryos will be important for future implementation in practice. Our simulations assumed that there was no information on the effect size of the predicted deleterious variants. This is a conservative assumption because  in fact  it may be possible to stratify predicted deleterious variants by predicted impact. For example  protein-coding variants are likely to have larger effect sizes than non-coding variants [  ]  and loss-of-function variants are likely to have larger effect sizes than nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants. Recombination rate variation may also impact variant prioritization. In regions of low recombination rate  such as pericentromeric regions and sex chromosomes  selection against deleterious variants is less efficient due to Hill–Robertson interference []. This phenomenon may lead both to accumulation of deleterious variants and reduced selection for beneficial variants that are located there. Therefore  it may also be beneficial to prioritize variants in regions of low recombination rate for genome editing [  ]. Assumptions about the genetic architecture of deleterious load in these simulations include: the number of fitness variants in the genome  independent genetic architectures of the breeding goal trait and fitness  a genomic deleterious mutation rate of 1  and equal dominance coefficients for all variants. In real genomes  we expect that many more than 10 000 sites can give rise to deleterious mutations  but since the number of segregating variants was little affected by the total number of fitness variants in the genome  this assumption seems to have little impact on the resulting distribution of fitness  load  and deleterious allele frequencies. Similarly  using a gamma distribution for the breeding goal trait  thus allowing for quantitative trait loci with larger effects  did not have a major effect on the distribution of deleterious variants. However  shortening the historical breeding period led to lower frequencies of recessive deleterious variants  since the variants have less time to drift to intermediate frequencies. We simulated fitness as independent of the selected performance trait. In real populations  we expect that fitness is  to some extent  already part of the breeding goal in the form of survival  fecundity  and health traits. The level of correlation between fitness traits and the breeding goal will depend on both the genetic architecture of fitness traits and the purpose of the breeding line. This might affect the level of load within populations  but also means that it will be possible to validate deleterious variants by phenotypic means  and to include them in genomic selection models []. We assumed a genomic deleterious mutation rate of 1  but this is a conservative estimate  given that deleterious mutation rates for humans are often estimated to be higher (e.g.  1.6–3) [  ]. We assumed equal dominance coefficients for all variants: either 0.5 (codominant) or 0 (recessive). In real populations  there could be a range of dominance coefficients  but recessive variants are expected to persist longer in the population. We assumed that it was possible to apply genome editing to sires after selection  so that we could select and edit only the top sires  and have the edits be transmitted to their offspring. As discussed by Bastiaansen et al. []  this may be achieved through cloning the top sires  or by a procedure that combines genome editing with in vitro genomic selection as considered by Visscher et al. []  and by Goddard and Hayes []. One alternative that was modelled by Bastiaansen et al. []  is to apply editing to all the offspring of elite individuals. In that case  the number of edits needed would be multiplied by the average number of offspring per sire. In any case  RAGE will require the development of advanced reproductive techniques  and it will be necessary to evaluate their use with empirical data from both the economic  ethical and animal welfare perspectives. We found that genome editing of deleterious alleles reduced deleterious load  but that when variants were recessive  simultaneous editing of multiple deleterious variants in the same sire was necessary for the approach to be competitive with selection against carriers. When accurate multiplex genome editing becomes available  RAGE will have the potential to improve fitness to levels that are impossible to attain by selection against carriers. This is a formidable undertaking  but a possible long-term goal. The long-term benefits of genome editing to remove deleterious variants over selection against carriers include both the possibility of higher gains in fitness  and the ability to improve fitness without sacrificing selection intensity for the breeding goal trait. In the short-term  selection against carriers based on their total deleterious load is a possible alternative to genome editing. It is ineffective against codominant variants  but when variants are recessive  it is more effective at alleviating deleterious load than editing one variant per sire  but it is less effective than multiplex editing. The cost of multiplex genome editing is unknown  but it is assumed high. Therefore  it appears that selection against carriers will remain superior for some time. The downside of selection against carriers is that the number of sires available for selection is reduced  with associated risks of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation. Van Eenennaam and Kinghorn [] and Cole [  ] have extended mate selection schemes to penalize the use of carrier animals or to prevent matings between carriers. It is possible that such methods could be extended to use genome-wide deleterious load while maintaining diversity in other parts of the genome and maximizing the response to selection for production traits. To perform selection against carriers in practice  it will be necessary to include deleterious load in the selection index and to give it an economic weight to balance it with the breeding goal  and make sure that selection against deleterious load does not affect other traits unfavorably. Unfavorable correlations between estimated deleterious load and estimated breeding values for traits could arise either from false positives  pleiotropy  or linkage disequilibrium. Deleterious variant prediction methods may mistakenly classify beneficial variants as deleterious because they change protein function. In fact  they may have been even deleterious in the wild  but beneficial in a modern farm environment  such as the loss-of-function mutations in  [] that cause double muscling in beef cattle breeds. Deleterious variants may also have pleiotropic effects  as is the case with several recessive lethal haplotypes that are found at unexpectedly high frequencies in cattle breeds [  ]. In all these cases  it may be possible to use marker estimates from genomic selection models to prune the set of deleterious variants associated with large beneficial effects on other traits before calculating deleterious load. When accurate multiplex genome editing becomes available  removal of alleles by genome editing has the potential to improve fitness to levels that are impossible by selection against carriers. This is a formidable undertaking  but a possible long-term goal. RAGE requires simultaneous editing of multiple deleterious variants in the same sire to be effective. Priorities in the development of RAGE should be safe and accurate multiplex genome editing  and gathering large whole-genome sequencing datasets to estimate deleterious allele frequencies  deleterious load  and the correlations of deleterious load with traits under selection. Our results suggest that  in the future  there is potential to use RAGE against deleterious load to improve fitness traits in animal breeding populations. Haldane JBS.

The underlying determinants of these correlations are largely unknown. Our findings show that the use of indicator ratio traits to assess individual feed efficiency in Atlantic salmon has great prospects in selection programs. Given that large quantities of feeds with contrasting isotope profiles of carbon and/or nitrogen can be produced cost-effectively  the use of stable isotopes to monitor nitrogen and carbon metabolism in various tissues has potential for large-scale recording of individual feed efficiency traits  without requiring individual feed intake to be recorded. The steadily growing human population increases the demand for protein resources from both the livestock and aquaculture industries. In 2050  the number of mouths to feed is expected to reach<U+2009>~<U+2009>9 billion []. In the near future  livestock and aquaculture production will be in competition with direct human consumption for many of the same protein resources and  therefore  efficiency must be increased. Selective breeding is  and has for several decades  been an important tool to improve feed efficiency in both livestock and farmed fish [    ]. Feed efficiency can be defined as feed conversion ratio (FCR)  which is the amount of feed consumed per unit growth  or alternatively  by its inverse  the feed efficiency ratio (FER)  i.e.  growth per unit of feed consumed []. Selective breeding for improved feed efficiency assumes that both individual growth and individual feed intake can be routinely recorded on a large number of individuals. In aquaculture  recording of individual growth rate is easily attainable  and it has been the major trait in breeding schemes of Atlantic salmon since the 1970s []. Various methods for recording individual feed intake have been proposed such as X-radiography  where generally radio-opaque ballotini glass beads are mixed into the feed  fish are X-rayed  and the number of pellets eaten is counted [   ]. Video recording is another method for feed intake recording [  ]  with manual feeding of pellets one by one and retrospective identification of individual fish from video analysis. However  since sib-testing of Atlantic salmon is carried out in large sea-cage units and since fish are communally fed with feed dispersed into the water  large-scale recording of individual feed intake with these methods is difficult to implement in selective breeding programs of Atlantic salmon. Hence  the first option in selective breeding for improved FCR has been to rely on selection for traits such as growth rate [  ]  which has been shown to improve feed retention ratio and FCR [     ] because of the generally accepted high genetic correlation between FCR and growth rate  ranging from 0.63 to 0.99 in rainbow trout () []. The effect of increased growth rate on feed efficiency is through reducing maintenance requirements per unit of growth produced  mainly by reducing time to slaughter. Kause et al. [] proposed to add information from indicator traits such as the percentage of muscle lipid to enhance the genetic progress in feed efficiency  which could be an alternative to recording feed intake. In our study  we examined the potential use of stable isotopes to assess feed efficiency traits in Atlantic salmon  with the objective to establish indicator phenotypes that explain more of the genetic variation in feed efficiency than growth alone. McCarthy et al. [] identified individual variation in protein metabolism  with feed efficient fish having a lower protein degradation for the same level of feed eaten than inefficient fish. The potential use of feeding stable isotope such as N to fish to assess individual protein metabolism was investigated in a previous study []. In this study  fish were fed a standard diet (low in N) followed by a N-enriched diet with various inclusion levels  which resulted in isotope profile changes of body nitrogen (protein metabolism)  which is closely related to body growth. Using protein-bound N enrichment  significant correlations between relative weight gain and protein metabolism were found in muscle (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.31–0.98) and in liver (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.59–0.94) []. This study also found that not all individual variation in protein metabolism was explained by growth. Isotope profiles can be recorded individually  in contrast to the challenge of recording feed intake and feed efficiency at the individual level. If feed efficiency can be accurately predicted by atom percentages (atom%) of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes  individual isotope profiles could be used for more direct selection for improved feed efficiency. However  first it is necessary to validate the method in an experiment in which both isotope profiles and feed efficiency are recorded and estimate associated genetic parameters  i.e.  in family material. This requires a large-scale experiment  in which families are kept in separate (replicate) tanks  and feed consumption and growth are monitored at the tank level. Dvergedal et al. [] reported a curvilinear increase in the level of isotopes in tissue over time  with the atom% reaching an asymptote when fish were fed until saturation  i.e.  all fish will eventually approach equilibrium isotopic levels  reflecting that of the feed. This implies that length of the experiment is crucial for recording individual variation in metabolism  since individual variation in nitrogen and carbon metabolism can be detected only prior to the point when the fish are expected to be in equilibrium with the isotopic level in the feed. In this paper  we report the results of a large-scale experiment  in which families were kept separate in replicate tanks  growth and isotope profiles were recorded at the individual level  and feed consumption and FCR were recorded at the tank level. Feed was labelled with both N and C stable isotopes. One objective was to examine whether the atom% of stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon can explain more of the variation in FCR than growth alone  i.e. to explore the potential of using indicator traits in selective breeding for improved feed efficiency in Atlantic salmon. Another objective was to estimate the heritabilities of and genetic correlations between feed efficiency  growth and indicator traits  as functions of nitrogen and carbon metabolism in various tissues. The experiment included 23 full-sib families (offspring of 23 dams and 22 sires) of Atlantic salmon () from AquaGen’s breeding population. To ensure clearly contrasted family groups with respect to growth potential and  potentially  feed efficiency  the parents of the families were selected for high/low estimated breeding values for growth in seawater  although the experiment was conducted in freshwater. From the eyed egg stage until the start of the experiment  all families were communally reared in a single tank. Before pit-tagging  15 fish were individually weighed to establish whether they were ready for tagging. The fish were pit-tagged with a 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>12 mm unique glass tag (RFID Solutions  Hafrsfjord  Norway) and a fin-clip was collected for genotyping. All fish were genotyped using AquaGen’s custom AxiomSNP genotyping array from Thermo Fisher Scientific (San Diego  CA  USA)  which includes 56 177 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Prior to the experiment  the parentage of each individual fish was established using genomic relationship likelihood for parentage assignment []. Based on parentage assignment  100 family members were identified for each of the 23 families used in the experiment. These fish were randomly allocated to family tanks with 50 fish per tank and two tanks per family  except for nine tanks in which the number of fish varied between 42 and 54  due to some mortality prior to the start of the experiment and to a larger number in one tank because of a counting mistake. A single fish was allocated to an incorrect family tank but it was later identified. In total  2281 fish were included in the experiment. The tanks  each with a 270-L capacity  were supplied with recirculated fresh water  at a flow rate of 7 to 8 L.min  and the fish were kept under 24 h light regime  with an average temperature of 14.5 °C. Dissolved oxygen was measured daily and maintained above 8 mg.L in the outlet water (Handy Delta  OxyGuard AS  Farum  Denmark). A labelled diet with the stable isotopes N and C  with inclusion levels of 2% and 1% respectively  was fed during the experimental period of 12 days. Due to the large variation in growth rate and thus in the rate of inclusion of new nutrients among families  a pre-defined period of 12 days was set to feed the labelled feed  such that an equilibrium was not reached in any of the families. Termination of the experiment and tissue sampling were done over a 5-day period with different tanks being sampled each day  i.e.  the dietary switch was done according to the pre-defined termination day of the tank. The formulation and analysed chemical composition of the diet are in Table . The diet was produced at the feed laboratory of the Norwegian University of Life Sciences  Aas  Norway  as explained by Dvergedal et al. []. The fish were fed twice daily (07:00 and 15:00) for a period of 1 h  by automatic belt feeders. The feeding level equalled 10% in excess  based on the level of uneaten feed. Registrations of uneaten feed and calculations of feed intake were performed according to Helland et al. []. The daily feed intake per tank was calculated by first collecting the waste feed on a wedge wire screen [] and correcting the total waste feed for leasing losses. As explained by Shomorin et al. []  the wedge wire is placed at an inclined position in the outlet water column of the tank. The design of the screen ensures efficient drainage so that uneaten feed that is trapped on the screen is exposed minimally to water. Then  the difference between total fed feed and total uneaten feed was calculated as g dry matter intake  after drying the uneaten feed at 105 °C overnight. Sampling was carried out over 5 days  about 10 tanks were sampled each day  i.e.<U+2009>~<U+2009>500 fish daily. Fish were anesthetized with metacaine (MS-222TM; 1 g.L water) and killed with a sharp blow to the head prior to dissection. Whole body weight and length were recorded for all fish  and tissue samples from muscle  liver  and adipose were collected in a cryotube  snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -<U+2009>20 °C until stable isotope analysis. Tissue sampling was standardized; muscle was sampled in the front area of the dorsal fin (1<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 cm cube)  the liver was divided into four small pieces  and adipose tissue was sampled from the fat that was deposited around the gut between the pyloric ceca and the distal intestine. The feed was dried and ground prior to analysis  and analyses were performed in duplicate for dry matter by drying to a constant weight at 104 °C  for ash by combustion at 550 °C  for crude protein by Kjeldahl nitrogen<U+2009>×<U+2009>6.25 according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009  and for starch as described in McCleary et al. []. Lipid was determined after extraction with petroleum ether and acetone (70/30) on an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE 200) (Dionex Corp  Sunnyvale  CA  USA)  while gross energy was established with a PARR 1281 Adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Parr Instruments  Moline  IL  USA) according to ISO 9831. Amino acids were analysed according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009  for all amino acids except tryptophan  on a Biochrom 30 amino acid analyser (Biochrom Ltd . Cambridge  UK). Tryptophan was analysed according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009 with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex Softron GmbH  Germering  Germany) and a Shimadzu RF-535 fluorescence detector (Shimadzu Corporation  Kyoto  Japan). Tissue samples were freeze-dried and homogenized  and samples of approximately 1 mg were weighed into small tin capsules (8 x 5 mm  Elemental Microanalysis  Devon  UK). Samples were analysed for N- and C-isotope compositions using a Nu Horizon isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (Nu Instruments  Wrexham  UK) coupled to a Eurovector element analyser (EA) 3028 (Eurovector S.p.A  Redavalle  Italy) at the Institute for Energy Technology (Kjeller  Norway). Analysed contents of N and C in the diet are in Table . Isotopic signatures were reported as  values  and Atom% was calculated as follows (taking N as an example) []: where  () and  ) are the proportion of N divided by the proportion of N in the sample and in the reference standard (air for nitrogen; <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003676 []  and Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite for carbon (VPDB); <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0112372 []). The atom% N and C in excess (APE) after feeding with enriched feed is proportional to the fraction of newly deposited amino acids in the tissue  resulting from both tissue growth and replacement of previously deposited nitrogen and carbon  denoted as metabolism. Atom% N (C) in excess is the total atom% N (C) in the sample adjusted for the initial isotope percentage in the sample (IA%). Initial isotope profile was accounted for in the calculations of individual feed conversion ratio (IFCR) and of individual feed efficiency ratio (IFER) (described in the next paragraph). Prior to the experiment IA% was assessed by using 20 randomly sampled fish from the experimental population. The N average and standard deviations were 0.370<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0001 in muscle and 0.370<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0003 in liver. Corresponding values for C in muscle  liver  and adipose tissue were 1.087<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0005  1.086<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0007 and 1.082<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0003  respectively. Calibration of N and C was performed against international certified reference materials and internal standards. The internal standard IFE Trout and USGS-41 were analysed as unknowns  and certified standards such as USGS-41 (certified value)  IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) N-1  USGS-24  Isolife P10501 and IAEA 311 were used to define the calibration curve. Three calibration standards (USGS-41  USGS-24  and Isolife P10501) were analysed in each sequence  with<U+2009>~<U+2009>60 samples per sequence. In addition  IAEA 303B ( C: 466<U+2009>±<U+2009>3) was analysed on multiple occasions to verify the linearity of  C measurements above the Isolife P10501 standard. The  N composition of IFE trout was calibrated using a two-point calibration curve using IAEA 311 and IAEA-N-1 standards. The  C composition of IFE trout was calibrated against the USGS-24 standard. The average  N in IFE trout was 11.60‰ with a standard deviation of 0.20 and  correspondingly  for  C the average was - 20.22‰ with a standard deviation of 0.19. The corresponding  N values for samples analysed according to IAEA 311 were 4693<U+2009>±<U+2009><<U+2009>5.0‰  and for  C values according to USGS-24 the values were <U+2009>- 16.05<U+2009>±<U+2009><<U+2009>0.25‰. When entering the tank  the initial weight of each fish  (  g) was recorded. After the experiment  i.e. at sampling  final weight (  g) was recorded. From these two variables  individual weight gain () and relative weight gain () were calculated as follows: A total of 32 fish (1.4% of the total) were set to missing for these two variables  with four fish having either missing initial or final weights. Furthermore  missing was imposed for fish with an extremely low growth rate (<U+2009>=<U+2009>21) (relative weight gain less than 6.4%  corresponding to a growth rate of less than 1.3 g) or an extremely high growth rate (<U+2009>=<U+2009>7) (relative weight gain higher than 49%  not accompanied by a corresponding change in the isotope profile)  indicating abnormal development and phenotyping error  respectively. From the tissue samples  the following Atom% variables were available at the individual level: Atom% for C in muscle (AMC)  N in muscle (AMN)  C in liver (ALC)  N in liver (ALN) and C in adipose tissue (AAC). Lack of tissue sample resulted in nine fish with missing records for Atom% variables; AAC (5)  AMC (1)  AMN (1)  ALC (1) and ALN (1). From feed recording at the tank level (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1…46)  tank feed intake (  g dry matter) was obtained  as well as the feed conversion ratio ()  which calculated as follows: where  is the total  in tank . As mentioned above  32 fish had missing phenotypes for weight gain and thus were not included in the FCR calculation. Some of these fish had a low or even negative growth indicating that their contribution to the total tank feed intake was likely rather small. In any case  the fraction of fish that lacked growth records was low (<<U+2009>1.4%)  which implies that the potential bias in FCR is limited. From the individual levels of Atom% C () and Atom% N () in muscle  individual isotope-based indicator ratio traits for feed conversion ratio () and feed efficiency ratio ();       and   were defined as follows (taking N as an example): where  with  equal to 0.370% for N and 1.087% for C. After diet switching  the APE of a stable isotope in muscle tissue is expected to be proportional to the fraction of newly synthesized nutrients in the muscle  and the product of APE and final weight is expected to be proportional to the mass of new nutrients in body tissue. Because the  ratio is expected to be proportional to the amount of newly deposited body nutrients per g increase in body weight  fish that exchange a larger fraction of the body mass per unit of growth will be less feed-efficient. Exchange of body tissue is traceable with stable-isotope profiling and is related to the feed intake of the individual  while the denominator of the ratio is the weight gain  and the ratio between these two variables is equal to  or  alternatively  the inverse is equal to . At the tank level  first we examined to what degree tank averages for  and   in addition to the tank average isotope content  could explain variation in  between tanks by using the following multiple regression model: where  is the observed FCR in tank  on sampling-day   the latter taking values 1 to 5 and was included as a covariate  since this gave better predictive ability   is the corresponding regression coefficient   is the covariate value for tank  based on one of the following covariates at a time:              and    is the corresponding regression coefficient  and  is the tank residual. The final model was chosen by including the covariates:            and  () simultaneously using the following model: Backward elimination with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to identify the model with the lowest predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS). The analyses were conducted using PROC REG in SAS. For all regression models  the bias of the model was calculated as the average difference between the observed phenotypes and predicted values obtained by PROC GLM in SAS. Moreover  the coefficient of determination of prediction was computed as: where  and  is the predicted  phenotype for tank   using data from all other tanks in the analysis and  is the total sums of squares. The  is an estimate of the fraction of variance in  explained by the model in the prediction of missing observations. Genetic analysis of traits was performed using the ASReml4 software package []. Bivariate analyses were conducted between  and  and of  and  with each of the following traits:                    and . For each bivariate analysis  the model was: where  is a vector of tank level phenotypes for  or    is a vector of (tank) phenotypes for one of the other traits;                    and    and  are vectors of fixed effects  including trait-specific intercepts and effects of sampling day   is a vector of random additive genetic tank effects for the two traits   is a vector of random tank residuals for the two traits. The  and  matrices are appropriate incidence matrices   is an additive genetic (co)variance matrix between traits at the tank level   is an (46<U+2009>×<U+2009>46) additive genetic relationship matrix that describes the average genomic relationships between fish in different tanks and  is the tank residual (co)variance matrix  which was diagonal. Matrix  was calculated based on a subset of 51 543 SNPs of high genotype quality  covering all chromosomes and is defined as: where element  in  (tank   locus ) is:    is the genotype of individual  within tank  at locus    is the allele frequency at locus   and  is the number of individuals in tank . Finally  the elements of  were scaled such that the average of the diagonal elements in  equalled 1.0. Narrow-sense heritability cannot be estimated for traits that are modelled at the tank level  i.e.  and . Instead   which quantifies the fraction of the between-tank variance explained by genetics  was estimated as   where   are the estimates at the tank level of additive genetic and residual variance  respectively  of the trait. The individual phenotypes for                     and  were also analysed using bivariate models. For each bivariate analysis  the model was: where  is a vector of individual phenotypes for the two traits analysed   and  are vectors of fixed effects for the two traits as described above   is a vector of random additive genetic effects for the two traits   is a vector of random tank effects for the two traits  and  is a vector of random residuals. The  and  matrices are corresponding incidence matrices   is an additive genetic (co)variance matrix   is the genomic relationship matrix   is the tank (co)variance matrix  and  is the residual (co)variance matrix. The genomic relationship matrix was generated according to VanRaden’s first method [] and was used to account for stratification of the individuals by selection of families based on fast and slow growth rates (in seawater). Matrix  was calculated based on the same subset of SNPs as defined for  above. Heritabilities of individual traits were estimated as:   where    are the estimates of the individual additive genetic  tank environmental  and individual residual variance  respectively  of the trait. The fraction of variance explained by tank was estimated as: . Significance of the genetic effect was tested using a likelihood-ratio () test-statistic  comparing a single-trait model with genetic effects () to a model without genetic effects () with the  matrices ( and   respectively) in : The genetic effect was considered significant if . The diet was formulated for increased N and C isotope levels  by using 2% and 1% of N- and C-labelled spirulina  respectively  which resulted in an Atom% of 2.7 and 2.0 of N and C  respectively  in the diet (Table ). All fish were healthy throughout the experiment and tanks were fed the diet at 10% in excess of uneaten feed. Table  shows the descriptive statistics of the data. The mean Atom% of N and C in muscle  liver  and adipose tissue ranged from 1.01 to 1.64% and from 1.17 to 1.59%  respectively. These results confirm that none of the tissues was in equilibrium with the diet that contained 2.7 and 2.0% N and C  respectively. Thus  variation in the Atom % of N and C could be determined between individuals. For the individually recorded traits  large differences in WG and RG were observed between families (Fig. a  b). However  for the tank-recorded traits  i.e. FI and FCR  larger differences were observed between families for FI than for FCR (Fig. c  d)  which was reflected in the larger coefficient of variation for FI than for FCR (Table ). This is logical because the coefficient of variation for FCR contains the standard deviation for WG  which was calculated from individual observations. Figure a–e show the Atom% of N and C in muscle  liver  and adipose tissue for all families  showing considerable differences between families. Averages per family for  weight gain (WG)   relative weight gain (RG)   feed intake (FI)  and  feed conversion ratio (FCR<U+2009>=<U+2009>FI/WG) Averages per family for  Atom% N in muscle (AMN)   Atom% N in liver (ALN)   Atom% C in muscle (AMC)   Atom% C in liver (ALC)  and  Atom% C in adipose tissue (AAC) Table  shows that  explained the largest fraction of variance in FCR as a single variable (in addition to day) (<U+2009>=<U+2009>62% and <U+2009>=<U+2009>55%)  followed by  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>57% and <U+2009>=<U+2009>52%) and  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>53% and <U+2009>=<U+2009>46%). When simultaneously regressing all the explanatory variables on FCR and using backward elimination  the preferred model with the lowest PRESS value had an  of 79% (Table ). This implies that the variables included in the model explained a major part of the variation between tanks with respect to FCR. The variables retained were Day       and . Using leave-one-out cross-validation  the coefficient of determination of the predicted tank averages was <U+2009>=<U+2009>73%  i.e.  even when predicting missing observations  the model explained most of the tank variation in FCR  while the bias was negligible. Moreover  when including interactions between indicator variables in the backward elimination process (data not shown)  PRESS was reduced to 0.0118 in the preferred model  which had an  of 88%  while  was 77% under prediction. The results obtained for traits recorded at the tank level and analysed with model (1) showed that genetic background (family) explained 52 and 92% of the between-tank variation for FCR (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0002) and FI (<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.3<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  respectively (Table )  i.e.  the corresponding correlations between the average family phenotypes in different tanks were 0.72 and 0.96 for FCR and FI  respectively. For the individually recorded traits  significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) heritabilities were estimated for all traits. The estimated heritability for WG was high (0.45)  whereas heritabilities were moderate for RG  AMC  AMN  ALC  ALN and AAC (0.28  0.18  0.28  0.15  0.26 and 0.18  respectively)  and relatively low for IFCR_AMC  IFCR_AMN  IFER_AMC and IFER_AMN (0.09  0.06  0.11 and 0.08  respectively). Non-genetic tank effects were generally low and explained 2 to 13% of the total phenotypic variance for individual traits. Genetic correlations between FCR/FI and all the other traits were estimated with model (1) and those between the remaining traits were estimated with model (2) (Table ). Generally  estimates of the genetic correlation between FCR  measured at the tank level  with each other trait were negative  while those for the IFCR were positive  as expected. This means that FI  growth (WG and RG)  and the indicator traits (i.e. the fraction of newly deposited tissue) all had favourable genetically correlations with FCR. For the indicator traits measured directly (excluding the indicator ratio traits)  the closest genetic correlation with FCR was estimated for ALC (-<U+2009>0.90<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11)  followed by RG (-<U+2009>0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.10)  WG (-<U+2009>0.74<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.17)  AMN (-<U+2009>0.73<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.14)  AMC (-<U+2009>0.69<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.17)  ALN (-<U+2009>0.63<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.19)  FI (-<U+2009>0.61<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.21)  and AAC (-<U+2009>0.43<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.28). In addition  a perfect genetic correlation was estimated between the indicator ratio traits IFCR_AMC  IFCR_AMN and IFER_AMN and FCR (1.0  1.0 and -<U+2009>1.0)  except for IFER_AMC  which had a lower genetic correlation estimate with FCR (-<U+2009>0.63<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.30)  albeit not significantly different from 1. Internally  IFCR and IFER variables had high estimated genetic correlations (-<U+2009>0.71 to -<U+2009>0.99). In general  estimated genetic correlations of the isotope content of the various tissues with growth (in particular RG) and FI were positive. Among the indicator traits  ALC had the lowest genetic correlation with the other isotope indicator traits (0.04–0.38) and with RG (0.12). AMN and ALN were closely genetically correlated to each other (0.89)  which indicates that nitrogen metabolism in liver and in muscle are largely the same genetic trait. Estimates of the genetic correlation of AMN and ALN with RG were high (0.98 and 0.89  respectively). Likewise  AMC and AAC were closely genetically correlated with each other (0.73)  with ALN and AMN (0.69 to 0.96) and with RG (0.78 to 0.92). FI was also closely genetically correlated with WG (0.98). For individual traits  phenotypic and genetic correlations were generally similar. Among the traits evaluated  ALC  IFCR (for both nitrogen and carbon) and IFER (for nitrogen) stood out as individual indicator traits for FCR. Estimates of the genetic correlation of ALC with the indicator ratio traits IFCR and IFER were low for both nitrogen and carbon (-<U+2009>0.27 to 0.11). In aquaculture  feed constitutes about half of the total production costs in the grow-out phase at sea []. Genetic improvement of feed efficiency will reduce production costs and  at the same time  have a favourable environmental impact by maximizing resource utilization and reducing nutrient load (e.g.  nitrogen) to the environment. Protein metabolism is a major determinant of the conversion of feed into growth. Consequently  minimizing the energetic cost of protein metabolism is a strategic goal for enhancing fish growth and feed efficiency. Because Atom% of nitrogen and carbon  and functions thereof  can be individually recorded  these traits could be used as indicator traits for individual feed conversion ratio in growing fish. The observed between-family difference in nitrogen and carbon metabolism (Fig. a–e) have the potential to affect feed efficiency. To evaluate whether N and C stable isotopes can be used to capture variation in feed efficiency in Atlantic salmon  the observed tank level FCR was best predicted using a multiple regression model that included      and  as covariates  in addition to sampling day. This prediction model explained 73% of the variation in masked FCR records (Table ; ). The single most important isotope variable for prediction was   which together with sampling day explained 57% () of the variation in FCR (Table ). In comparison  for similar models using  or   the proportions of variance in FCR explained were 53 and 62%  respectively (Table ). Hence  by including information on isotope profiles  prediction of FCR data was substantially improved  compared to what was obtained by growth data alone (Table ). This indicates that stable isotopes can be used to improve the prediction of individual FCR  which is of considerable value to fish breeding. The regression analyses revealed that  after adjusting for growth  improved feed efficiency was associated with reduced metabolism of nitrogen in muscle (AMN  ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.31<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.17  results not shown) and reduced carbon metabolism in adipose tissue (AAC  ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.90<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.41)  but with elevated carbon metabolism in liver (ALC  ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.75<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.18). In fish  the main source of nitrogen in both liver and muscle is protein []. Similarly  the main sources of carbon in muscle is protein  but in liver the main sources are protein  fat and glycogen []. In adipose tissue  the main source of carbon is lipids  but they can originate from lipid biosynthesis from protein through oxidative degradation and deamination of amino acids  or from carbohydrates through acetyl-CoA formed in the mitochondria []. Fish are highly efficient in converting dietary protein into body protein []. This requires regulation of the flux of amino acids into metabolic fates such as oxidation  gluconeogenesis  and lipogenesis. Because salmonids are carnivores  they depend highly on glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate sources. The surplus of amino acids has a major role in energy metabolism as oxidative substrates in many tissues. Fish with efficient growth seem to use a low-protein metabolism strategy [    ]. It has also been reported that a reduced capacity for body lipid deposition is favourably associated with high protein growth efficiency []. Furthermore  low proteasome activity  i.e.  reduced proteolysis in the liver has been linked to higher growth efficiency []. In this experiment  adjusted for growth  efficient fish were characterized by older nitrogen (i.e. protein) profiles of muscle tissues  which confirms earlier findings  since reduced proteolysis of body protein will preserve more of the old protein. These results suggest that efficient fish had newer liver carbon profiles (i.e.  glycogen  fat  and protein  combined)  which might be linked to the origin of the glycogen in the liver; efficient fish possibly synthesize relatively more of their glycogen through gluconeogenesis or lipogenesis in the liver and thus from nutrients that come directly from digestion of feed (new nutrients) and relatively less from proteolysis of older body protein. Our findings indicate that fast growth combined with reduced degradation rates of existing body tissues  especially in the muscle  is favourable  and that individual differences in these traits can be captured by nitrogen and carbon isotope profiling of the various tissues. The underlying biological mechanisms are likely complex and further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying factors relevant to feed efficiency. The prediction equation for individual feed efficiency shows that indicator traits add information to the prediction of feed efficiency beyond growth. The limitation of the prediction equation developed is that all variables are averages at the tank level because FCR was only recorded per tank. If this prediction equation was to be used to predict individual FCR  this would imply that the phenotypic and genetic correlations are assumed to be the same at both the individual and group levels  which may not be realistic. In addition  the prediction equation was estimated in freshwater during a phase of high growth and needs to be validated or re-estimated for larger fish in seawater  but this would require recording of feed intake in the sea. A prediction equation estimated during the freshwater phase may not predict the feed efficiency performance in the grow-out phase in the sea very well. During grow-out  other metabolic pathways such as lipid metabolism may explain more of the variation in feed efficiency in Atlantic salmon  since the relative weight gain decreases  which may leave more room for other factors than growth to contribute to feed efficiency  as previously demonstrated for large rainbow trout []. Hence  it is considered more effective to use individually measured phenotypes that are highly genetically correlated to feed efficiency to improve the feed efficiency indirectly. Indicator traits that are more highly correlated to feed efficiency in later life-stages could  therefore  be of high value. Estimates of genetic correlations (Table ) revealed  as expected  that fast growth (WG and RG) is favourably associated with improved feed efficiency (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.74 and -0.82  respectively). The indicator traits AMN  AMC  and ALN were estimated to be highly genetically correlated with the growth traits and feed efficiency  as expected  since body growth depends on the deposition of new nutrients from enriched feed  which increased isotope levels in tissues. The estimate of the genetic correlation of carbon metabolism in adipose tissue with FCR (-<U+2009>0.43) was moderate. The link between lipid deposition and FCR should  however  not be disregarded  since it is known to affect feed efficiency later in the life cycle of salmonids because lipid deposition is at its maximum first during the grow-out phase in the sea []. ALC had the closest estimated genetic correlation with FCR (-<U+2009>0.90)  but had lower genetic correlation estimates with the other indicator traits  which suggests that ALC might explain additional variation in the feed efficiency complex among the indicator traits considered here. As explained above  protein is likely the main source of nitrogen and carbon in muscle and nitrogen (but not necessarily carbon) in liver. This might explain the high genetic and phenotypic correlations of nitrogen and carbon metabolism in the muscle and nitrogen metabolism in the liver  since they all likely reflect protein metabolism. Compared with muscle  carbon metabolism in the liver (ALC) is affected by fat and glycogen to a larger extent and  thus  is expected to relate less to the other indicator traits. The IFCR and IFER variables for nitrogen and carbon in muscle are expected to be proportional to the mass of newly deposited nutrients in muscle and  as such  relate directly to the efficiency complex. Buchheister and Latour [] proposed a ratio between specific growth rate and total metabolism  estimated from isotope profiling  as an indicator trait. A preliminary analysis showed that the trait definition of Buchheister and Latour was close to perfectly genetically correlated with the IFER indicators used in this study (results not shown). In our study  the estimate of the genetic correlation of IFCR with the observed FCR was very high  to the extent that the estimate was fixed at the border of the parameter space () for both nitrogen and carbon metabolism in muscle  with a phenotypic (tank-level) correlation with observed FCR of 0.72 and 0.58  respectively. The IFER_AMN variable  being the inverse of IFCR_AMN  and correspondingly IFER_AMC were estimated with  respectively a highly negative genetic correlation (-<U+2009>1.0) and a moderately negative  albeit highly uncertain  genetic correlation (-<U+2009>0.63<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.30) to FCR. These results indicate that the mass of new nutrients in the muscle is closely genetically associated with FCR at the tank level. Since the indicator ratio traits (IFCR/IFER) can be measured on individual fish  they are promising indicator traits for individual phenotyping of feed efficiency. However  the estimates of heritability of the indicator ratio traits were lower (0.06 to 0.11) than the estimates of heritability for the remaining traits. In addition  estimates of the genetic correlation of the indicator ratio traits IFCR_AMC  IFCR_AMN  IFER_AMC  and IFER_AMN with ALC were low. However  estimates of the genetic correlation of ALC and the indicator ratio traits with tank-FCR were high  which indicates that ALC explained individual variation in feed efficiency that was not explained by growth. The indicator ratio traits IFCR and IFER are intuitively appealing and can be easily interpreted biologically  compared to ALC  for which the underlying determinants are largely unknown. The efficiency of metabolization and allocation of nutrients for growth is closely related to the feed efficiency complex; using body tissue as fuel for  e.g.  maintenance  is less efficient than using nutrients absorbed and metabolized from feed directly. However  there is some variation between individuals in the extent to which body tissues are used for maintenance [    ]. A lower exchange of body tissue components would result in more efficient use of protein and thus reduced feed costs []. The IFCR and IFER variables allow for direct measurement of nitrogen and carbon fluxes by using stable-isotope profiling to trace the contribution and allocation of nutrients from feed to growth in animal tissue [  ] and are expected to have a universal relationship with FCR and could be useful independently of life-stage and species. The standard errors of the estimates of the genetic correlations were rather low in spite of the limited number of families in the study. However  the standard errors of the genetic correlations between our traits and FCR could be made smaller by increasing the size of the family dataset and could thus be used to validate our approach. Our experimental design made it possible to keep all individuals in one common environment until the start of the experiment  which strengthens our results by reducing the environmental variation between families. Our results indicate that the total variation between tanks was  to a large extent  explained by genetics  52% for FCR and 92% for feed intake. Phenotyping of stable isotopes at the individual level requires liver and muscle samples  which normally implies that the fish are sacrificed. However  the isotope profile in muscle can be obtained from a muscle biopsy on live animals  which would allow these indicator ratio traits to be recorded even on selection candidates. Alternatively  if test fish have to be sacrificed through sib-testing  information on the full-sibs can be used to predict breeding values on the untested selection candidates. Genomic selection methods that use individual phenotypes and genotypes on training animals for selection among genotyped candidates are expected to be much more effective than traditional pedigree-based selection methods [  ]. Hence  individual phenotyping is still very important  even for traits that cannot be recorded on the selection candidates. Thus  in full-sib testing an indicator trait is efficient if the estimated breeding value for the indicator ratio trait is estimated with high accuracy (which requires a considerable number of full-sibs)  the indicator trait has a high genetic correlation with feed efficiency (as estimated for the IFCR phenotype)  and feed efficiency has significant genetic variance (considered considerable  with 3% point standard deviation for FCR). A slaughter test using full-sibs of the breeding candidates is currently part of the breeding program and  thus  implementation of the indicator ratio traits can be carried out in the existing test under field conditions. Given that isotope-enriched feed can be produced at an acceptable cost  this study presents indicator ratio traits for individual FCR that might be recorded on a massive scale and used for selection  without requiring individual feed intake recording. This requires that the indicator ratio traits  IFCR and IFER  which have a strong genetic relationship to FCR (as reported here in freshwater) are also shown to have such a genetic relationship in the grow-out phase.

In addition  in several other species including mammals  the existence of other dominant gain-of-function structural modifications that are localized upstream of the  coding sequences has been reported  which supports our hypothesis that repressors in the 5' region of  are absent in the -2/ mutant. The pigmentation of hair in mammals and of feathers in birds is mainly determined by the relative distribution of two types of melanin  i.e. eumelanin (black/brown) and pheomelanin (yellow/red). The  () gene codes for the agouti-signaling protein (ASIP)  which is an antagonist of the a-MSH hormone (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) for the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and leads to decreased eumelanin synthesis in favor of pheomelanin synthesis in melanocytes []. In general  (recessive) loss-of-function mutations in the  gene  which either impair protein function or reduce its transcription  lead to increased production of eumelanin and to darker coat color as observed in mice []  rabbits [] or quails []. Conversely  (dominant) gain-of-function mutations that display ubiquitous and constitutive expression of   such as the  allele in mice  cause a yellow pigmentation []. Several studies have shown that structural modifications in the  gene are responsible for lighter coat colors in various species: (1) a large deletion in the  allele in mice [  ]  (2) an insertion in the  allele in Normande cattle [] and in the  allele in mice [  ]  (3) a tandem duplication in the dominant | allele in sheep []  (4) an inverted duplication in the  gene in mice []  and (5) an insertion or an inverted duplication in the  allele in Alpaca []. An allelic series of variants at the autosomal  () locus  which involves the  gene on quail chromosome 20  has been identified in Japanese quail (): recessive  and  alleles  three alleles (  -2 and ) that result in three similar phenotypes and the - allele () []. The aim of our work was to characterize precisely the molecular basis of two of these variants that cause light plumage colours:  [] and -2/ [  ]. The  allele is dominant over the - allele  and homozygous carriers for the  allele are lethal. Heterozygotes have wheat-straw yellow-coloured feathers []. In the literature  the genetic basis of the yellow phenotype is described as a large genomic deletion that spans almost the entire coding sequence of the  and  genes upstream of  and that probably causes the lethality observed in homozygous individuals. Thus  this deletion places the expression of  under the control of the promoter of  and leads to the expression of a fusion transcript []. As a result  ASIP mRNA expression is upregulated in many tissues in heterozygous yellow animals compared to wild-type individuals  although no clearly significant differences were reported in skin samples between these animals [  ]. However  the alterations in feather colour are hardly visible and represent only a very small portion of the complex yellow phenotype []. The -2/ allele is part of a group of alleles responsible for very similar phenotypes that were independently described:   -2 and . In Japanese quail  Nichols et al. [] reported in 1988 a first fawn dilution phenotype with a light/buff coloration and some darker spots. This  allele was identified as incompletely dominant to - and co-dominant to  []. Later in 1996  Tsudzuki et al. [] described a similar fawn-2 phenotype in a population of Japanese quail that had been established at Gifu University from French commercial eggs. In 2003  a beige phenotype similar to fawn-2 was found in a French commercial line of Japanese quail []. Both - and  alleles are dominant to - [  ] and correspond probably to the same allele. At birth  individuals are characterized by a light yellow plumage with three dark bands on the back (but not on the head) []. Adults have a lighter coat color and display a more pronounced sexual dimorphism than wild-type individuals [  ] and (see Additional file : Figure S1). Although these studies have contributed to the understanding of the functional activity of  in the yellow and the fawn-2/beige phenotypes  a fine genomic characterization of the causative variants is still lacking. The aims of this study were to characterize the large deletion that causes the yellow phenotype and to describe the -2/ mutation  which we hypothesized to be due to a structural modification representing a single allele. Thus  we sequenced four individuals i.e. one homozygous beige  one homozygous fawn-2 and two yellow  and compared the data with the recently available C 2.0 quail annotated reference genome. Then  the molecular consequences of the - mutation were evaluated. All animals were produced and maintained at the Inra PEAT experimental unit (Pôle d’Expérimentation Avicole de Tours  authorization # D37–175–1  2017) in Nouzilly (France) in compliance with the European Union Guidelines for animal care  and with an approval by the local ethical committee in animal experimentation (Val de Loire) and the French Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (authorization # 02411.02). For sequencing  we sampled two heterozygous yellow quails from a line established at Gifu University (Japan) [] and maintained in Nouzilly  and one homozygous beige and one homozygous fawn-2 individual. DNA was extracted from blood and fragmented in order to build libraries with fragments of ~<U+2009>350 bp. Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was done following the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free protocol and using an Illumina Hiseq 3000 instrument. Sequence reads were aligned with BWA-MEM [] to the  2.0 quail reference genome (NCBI assembly accession GCA_001577835.1; BioProject accession PRJNA314147)  which consists of 32 chromosomes or linkage groups and 1095 un-localised scaffolds []. We used the Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV) software  to visualize the alignment on the reference genome and to check for compatibility of distance and orientation between read-pairs with the size selection that was set for the construction of the libraries. IGV was also used to evaluate read depth. Close examination of such alignments in IGV can be very informative to characterise deletions or duplications  for details (see Additional file ). Twenty-five beige and 25 wild-type plumage quail eggs were incubated during 15 days before harvesting the embryos. DNA was extracted from muscle  and after sex determination [] five skin samples of each sex were obtained for each phenotype for further RNA analyses. Quantitative PCR were performed on the ABI 7900HT (Sequence Detection System 7900HT) in one 384-well plate. Since efficiency levels were similar for all the genes measured (including the reference genes  and )  results were expressed as 2 × 1000 in arbitrary units. For a complete description (see Additional file  and Additional file : Table S1). We used the newly annotated  2.0 reference genome to improve the characterization of the region that carries the  gene.  was on the same strand as  and   while  and  were on the other strand (Fig. a). In the reference sequence   and  each harboured only one described transcription start site (TSS) in their unique untranslated exon 1 (5'UTR). The  gene was correctly annotated for its three well described coding exons Ce1  Ce2 and Ce3 as previously reported []. In chicken   has at least three possible upstream promoters with three TSS  i.e. TSS-1  TSS-2 and TSS-3 (Fig. b). Recent studies [  ] showed that three other possible TSS (not reported to date in chicken) exist in quail  namely TSS-7  TSS-8 and TSS-9 (Fig. b).  locus in quail.  Schematic representation of the  locus in quail. Each gene is represented with a specific color: the coding exons are schematized by dark rectangles while the 5' UTR exons are represented in a lighter shade. The 5' UTR exons with potential transcription start sites are symbolized by a rectangle with an arrow.  Presentation of the  gene and ASIP transcripts. We expect nine types of transcripts encoding the same ASIP protein. For the exons  we used the names proposed by Gluckman and Mundy []. The coding exons are Ce1  Ce2 and Ce3. We did not consider the ASIP transcript-6 as proposed by []  because the sequence of the 5' UTR exon relative to this transcript (novel6) was not included in this region of quail chromosome 20. The double pink arrow shows the 21.4-kb region highlighted in this study (see also Fig. ) Paired-end reads obtained from two heterozygous yellow individuals (SRA biosamples SRR8224502 and SRR8224503) were analysed with IGV within the region including  on quail chromosome 20. We found two paired-end reads that potentially detected a large deletion (see Additional file : Figure S2) as expected from previous studies []. The breakpoint upstream from the putative deletion was named 5'BKPT- (for the 5' breakpoint)  the downstream breakpoint 3'BKPT-  and the junction point JUNCT- (Fig. a). Among the reads that map to these two breakpoint regions  several split reads were observed (see Additional file : Figure S2). After individual mapping with BLAST []  these reads did not appear to be segmented around the deletion as expected for a simple deletion (see Additional file : Figure S2): the first segment was located upstream or downstream of the deletion but the second segment did not map to this chromosome  which suggested a more complex event. To better understand the rearrangement  the three regions (3' and 5' BKPT-  and JUNCT-) were amplified from two yellow heterozygous individuals. For the 3' and 5' BKPT-  amplified fragments had the expected size  but for JUNCT- the amplified fragment was longer than expected and  thus  was sequenced (GenBank MK135881). BLAST alignment on the quail reference genome revealed that the JUNCT- sequence comprised three fragments: the 5' end mapped upstream to the 5'BKPT- and the 3' end mapped downstream of the 3'BKPT-  which was consistent with a 141 162-bp deletion (Fig. a) (NC-029535 [1 463 709–1 604 872])  while the third fragment aligned with an unexpected internal fragment of 241 bp (Fig. a). BLAST and BWA-MEM were not able to propose a unique position for this 241-bp fragment on the quail reference genome  but showed that it was present within the 141 162-bp deletion. The fact that this 241-bp sequence was present at multiple locations in the genome probably explains why we found only two paired-end reads (2×150 bp) encompassing the 141 162-bp deletion  i.e. most of the reads from this region probably mapped to various sites (see Additional file : Figure S2). After sequencing  no microhomology (identity of a short nucleotide sequence in two non-complementary DNA strands) was observed at the borders of the deletion. We used the 3'BKPT- and JUNCT- fragments to genotype the deletion in 50 wild-type or fawn-2/beige quails and two quails heterozygous for the  mutation. As expected (Fig. a)  3'BKPT- (i.e. the positive PCR control) was found in all animals and JUNCT- was found only in animals carrying the y mutation (Table ). Characterization of the  and -2/ mutations.  Schematic characterization of the genomic region in quail carrying the  deletion. The breakpoint upstream from the deletion was named 5'BKPT- (for 5' breakpoint)  the downstream breakpoint was named 3'BKPT-  and the junction point was named JUNCT-. The colored arrows represent the different primer pairs used to validate the variant with a deletion. The fragment JUNCT- was sequenced and includes an insertion of 241 bp of unknown origin (represented in purple).  Schematic characterization of the genomic region in quail carrying the -2/ tandem duplication. The breakpoints upstream and downstream from the duplication were named 5'BKPT-- and 3'BKPT--  respectively  and the junction point was named JUNCT--2. The colored arrows represent the different primer pairs used to validate the variants with a deletion. The fragment JUNCT--2 was sequenced and is represented in brown By examining the alignments of paired-ends obtained from the fawn-2 (SRA biosample SRR8224504) and beige individuals (SRR8224505)  we found several paired-ends that had reads in opposite orientations (tail to tail) and that were separated by a large distance from each other in both individuals (see Additional file : Figure S3). This suggests a tandem duplication in the  region. The increase in read depth for this region is in favour of a simple tandem duplication [the possibility of three or four copies of this region was excluded  (see Additional file : Figure S3)]. The breakpoints that were located upstream and downstream of the duplication were named 5'BKPT-- and 3'BKPT--  respectively and the junction point was named JUNCT--2 (Fig. b). These three regions were amplified from one homozygous fawn-2 and one homozygous beige individual and sequenced  and a 3-bp (TTG) microhomology was detected in each of these three regions (Fig. b). We used the 3'BKPT-- and JUNCT--2 fragments to validate the presence of the duplication in fawn-2 and beige animals (Table ). Based on our findings  we can conclude that - and  are the same allele  and that it is caused by a 70 895-bp tandem duplication. The breakpoints of this 70 895-bp tandem duplication (NC-029535 [1 371 395(or 98)–1 442 295 (or 98)]) are located downstream of the  exon 1 and upstream of the  exon e4 (5' UTR) (Fig. ). The 70 895 bp of the duplicated region include the entire  gene on one strand  and parts of the  and  genes on the other strand. Thus  in this rearrangement  complete copies of the original genes remain. Indeed  animals that carry this duplication have one normal copy and an extra portion of the  gene [two 5' UTR exons (e4 and e5) and three coding exons]  which are inserted just downstream of the  non-coding exon 1 (5'UTR) (Fig. )  thus forming an - fusion gene. This fusion gene has several possible TSS:  exon-1  -TSS-2 and -TSS-3 (Figs.   ).  locus in yellow and fawn-2/beige quail genomes. The deletion characterized in yellow and the tandem duplication identified in fawn-2/beige quails concern the same region. The gene organization on the reference genome is drawn in the middle. The two structural events both lead to the formation of a fusion gene. As on Fig.   5' UTR exons that could be the starting site of a transcript are symbolized by a rectangle with an arrow. In animals  heterozygous for the  allele  the fusion gene - can produce a fusion transcript [] coding for a normal ASIP protein. In animals carrying the -2/ allele  the fusion gene - can produce three possible transcripts coding for the ASIP protein from the three exons including a TSS In 2008  Hiragaki et al. [] analyzed the expression of  in the skin of neonatal chicks  but in the current study  we sampled embryonic skin to study the phenotypic consequences of the - mutation at an earlier stage  since they are already visible at hatch. All possible transcripts from this region were sequenced from 15-day embryo skin samples. The fusion gene has three possible TSS  i.e. in the first exon (5'UTR) of  and the TSS-containing  exons e4 (TSS2) and e5 (TSS3) (Figs.   ). Transcripts of the fusion gene from the TSS-containing  exons e4 and e5 (ASIP-tr2 and ASIP-tr3) could not be distinguished from those of the normal  copy because there was no sequence difference. RT-PCR with primers that are located respectively in the 5'UTR of  and in the coding exons of  and sequencing of the products showed that the fusion transcript includes  exon 1 and the three  coding exons but not the  exons e4 and e5. Since the 5'UTR exon 1 of  does not contain a start codon  no fusion protein is expected from this fusion transcript  which supports our hypothesis that the protein produced from the - fusion gene is a normal ASIP protein. We also performed quantitative PCR to evaluate the expression level of each ASIP transcript and the impact of the fusion gene on the amount of transcripts coding for the ASIP protein. We designed primers to selectively amplify three types of ASIP transcripts: the fusion transcript ITCH-ASIP  which can be transcribed only from the - fusion gene  and ASIP-tr2 and ASIP-tr3  which can be transcribed from both the  gene and the - fusion gene. In addition  we used a primer pair to evaluate the overall amount of all ASIP-coding transcripts (see Additional file  and Additional file : Table S1). The differences in amounts of AHCY or ITCH transcripts were not significant between wild-type and fawn-2/beige animals (Fig. a  b). Although the fawn-2/beige animals carried two copies of the  gene because of the duplication  there was no difference in the expression level of  in the skin of embryos. Quantitative expression of the transcripts from the  region in fawn-2/beige versus wild-type quails 15-days embryos (skin). Blue: wild-type embryos [n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10  excepted for ASIP-tr2 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6) and ASIP-tr3 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8)]. Brown: embryos homozygous for the -2/ mutation (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>9  except for ASIP-tr2 and ASIP-tr3 where n<U+2009>=<U+2009>7). The abundance of transcripts is expressed in arbitrary units (AU)  values are mean ± standard deviation. ***Significant difference with  value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001. The different graphs represent the transcription from:  ;  ;  the - fused gene;  ASIP-tr2 and  ASIP-tr3 representing alternative transcripts from the  and - fused genes;  overall amount of all ASIP-coding transcripts Similar to Hiragaki et al. []  we observed a statistically significant difference in ASIP-coding transcripts between wild type quails and fawn-2/beige quails (Fig. f) and  as expected  the ITCH-ASIP fusion transcript was detected only in the fawn-2/beige quails (Fig. c). It should be noted that qPCR does not allow the comparison of the expression of two genes  and   which means that we were not able to determine if there was a difference in expression level between the fusion transcript ITCH-ASIP and the ASIP or ITCH transcripts. Nevertheless  we compared their expression between individuals (see Table ) and found no significant difference in the amounts of ASIP-tr2 (Fig. d) or ASIP-tr3 transcripts (Fig. e) between wild-type and fawn-2/beige animals  but ASIP-coding transcripts were significantly more abundant in fawn-2/beige than in wild-type animals (Fig. f)  which can be attributed to the ITCH-ASIP fusion transcript. Our findings agree with those reported by Hiragaki et al. [] (see Table ) and show that the difference in the amount of ASIP-coding transcripts between fawn-2/beige and wild-type animals was much larger than expected with a simple gene duplication. They also indicate that this high expression of the ITCH-ASIP fusion transcript could explain the large excess in coding transcripts for the ASIP protein in skin samples. The 141 162-bp deletion that we identified for the  mutation confirms previous results []. It leads to the creation of a - fusion gene and deletion of the  gene. The strong similarity between the  mutation in mouse [  ] and the  mutation in quail  as previously suspected by Nadeau et al. []  is confirmed at the genomic level. However  our study reveals that the deletion is also combined with a 241-bp insertion  which is mainly composed of repeated sequences that do not originate from this region. Nadeau et al. (2008) showed that this structural modification preserves the coding structure of the  gene but affects the regulatory 5' region  and results in the production of transcripts from the - fusion gene []. However the expression of the transcripts coding for ASIP is disorganized with no over-expression in the skin [  ]. The transcription of the fusion gene depends on the promoter of the  gene but its 5' region may also contain alternative regulatory sequences. In addition  we cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of the 5' region of the  gene has additional impacts. Concerning the -2/ mutation  a first conclusion is that -2 and  share the same allele at the  locus  and precedence should be given to the name -2 for these variations. No conclusion can be drawn for the other  allele since no molecular data is available for this phenotype. We identified a 71 895-bp duplication (Fig. ) and although this leads to a full duplication of  its expression remains unchanged. In contrast  an increased transcription of  is described as responsible for the fawn-2/beige phenotype []. We show that the fawn-2/beige animals studied here carry two copies of   one normal and one truncated (Fig. ) just upstream of the TSS-2 (-TSS-2)  which generates a fusion gene between the 5'UTR exon 1 of  and the three coding exons of  (Fig. ). Thus  there is an increased production of ASIP-coding transcripts in the skin  which partly explains the lighter colour of their feathers. However  we also show that the increase in the amount of ASIP transcripts is higher than would be expected from a simple duplication of  (Table )  and we suggest that the 5' region of the fusion gene has a higher transcription rate than that of  alone. We found that the  promoter is active for the fusion gene  but we were not able to compare the efficiency of the transcription of  and the transcription of the fusion gene. Nevertheless  we cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of the 5' region of the  gene itself  putatively containing repressor sequences  could have additional impacts. The  region is particularly well conserved in birds and in mammals  both in terms of gene order and orientation. In Merino sheep  Norris and Whan [] showed that a duplication with breakpoints located downstream from the -exon-1 and upstream from the  coding exons and resulting in an - fusion transcript causes the dominant white|tan phenotype. This rearrangement is very similar to that of the allele we identified in the fawn-2/beige quails  except that  in the dominant white|tan sheep phenotype  the  gene from the original segment appears to be inactivated. We found no evidence of such an effect in the fawn-2/beige quails. In addition  Norris and Whan [] detected a SINE-type repeat element at the 5' and 3' breakpoints of their duplication and found that the genome of white|tan sheep contained several repetitions of this segment. For the fawn-2/beige quail  we identified only a micro-homology (Fig. b) between 5'BKPT-- and 3'BKPT--. Such events occur very often in duplicated regions and result from the mechanism involved in the duplication process []. The similarities between the  mutations in mice and quails and between the -2/ mutation in quails and the dominant | mutation in sheep  raise the question of whether two independent deletion/duplication events in the same region can occur by chance or whether the presence of some conserved genomic features make this region prone to deletion/duplication events. The early/late feathering phenotype  which is due to a large duplication ( mutation) in chicken [  ]  and to a 5-bp frameshift deletion in turkey []  is another example of such events. Several other mutations involving the  gene have been described in other species. In the white Alpaca  a promoter from another gene () was identified upstream of the  coding exons  which could originate from an inverted duplication such as that characterized in agouti mice []  without any other duplication or deletion []. In Normande cattle that carry the  allele  a full-length L1-B1 element inserted in the 5' UTR sequence of  was identified as responsible for the over-expression of  []. The  mutation in mouse is due to the insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) type retrotransposon into the promoter region of the  []. Although numerous structural genomic modifications in the 5' UTR region of  are known  we list only those that are not neutral. All of these (/mouse  /Normande cattle  /alpaca  |/sheep  /mouse) are dominant gain-of-function mutations  which support the hypothesis that the 5' region of  could contain negative regulatory sequences that are active in the skin. This is an additional argument in favour of the loss of repressor sequences in the genome fawn-2/beige quails  which could have an impact on the expression of the fusion gene in addition to the effects brought by the 5' region of  itself. The loss of a 141-kb region in yellow quails (NC-029535 [1 463 709–1 604 872]) leads to a much diluted feather colour phenotype compared to fawn-2/beige quails. The 5' region of the - fusion gene could also result from a 71-kb deletion (NC-029535 [1 371 395 (or 98)–1 442 295 (or 98)]). Our study suggests that the 21.4-kb region in quail (NC-029535 [1 442 295–1 463 709]  indicated by a double pink arrow on Figs. b  )  which contains the  5'UTR e1  e2  Ne9 and e3 exons (Fig. b)  could include these repressor sequences. We hope that  in the near future  the improved annotation of livestock genomes resulting from the efforts of the FAANG consortium []  will allow us to examine the hypothesis of repressor sequences in the 21.4-kb region. We have refined the characterization of a 141-kb long deletion in heterozygous quails for the  allele and identified a 71-kb long tandem duplication in the  region in fawn-2/beige quails. We conclude that -2 and  are the same allele  and due to precedence  these should now both be given the name -2. We have shown that the loss () or the pseudo-loss (-2/) of two distinct regions upstream of the coding exons of  leads to the formation of a fusion gene that result in the production of the ASIP transcript  and especially for - allele  at a higher rate. Although the fusion gene benefits from a new promoter and a new 5' region that may contain alternative up-regulatory sequences  we cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of the 5' region of  itself has additional impacts. Indeed  the hypothesis of the loss of repressor sequences within  should also be considered  since several structural modifications localized upstream of the  coding sequences have been reported in mouse  alpaca  cattle  sheep and now quail  which all cause dominant gain-of-function phenotypes.

Results from different genome-wide association studies and gene expression analyses are not always consistent. The aim of this research was to use machine learning to identify genes associated with feed efficiency (FE) using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data from pigs that are phenotypically extreme for RFI.MethodsRFI was computed by considering within-sex regression on mean metabolic body weight  average daily gain  and average backfat gain. RNA-Seq analyses were performed on liver and duodenum tissue from 32 high and 33 low RFI pigs collected at 153 d of age. Machine-learning algorithms were used to predict RFI class based on gene expression levels in liver and duodenum after adjusting for batch effects. Genes were ranked according to their contribution to the classification using the permutation accuracy importance score in an unbiased random forest (RF) algorithm based on conditional inference. Support vector machine  RF  elastic net (ENET) and nearest shrunken centroid algorithms were tested using different subsets of the top rank genes. Nested resampling for hyperparameter tuning was implemented with tenfold cross-validation in the outer and inner loops.ResultsThe best classification was obtained with ENET using the expression of 200 genes in liver [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.85; accuracy: 0.78] and 100 genes in duodenum (AUROC: 0.76; accuracy: 0.69). Canonical pathways and candidate genes that were previously reported as associated with FE in several species were identified. The most remarkable pathways and genes identified were NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells  the        genes in duodenum  and melatonin degradation II  PPARa/RXRa activation  and GPCR-mediated nutrient sensing in enteroendocrine cells and        and  genes in liver.ConclusionsML algorithms and RNA-Seq expression data were found to provide good performance for classifying pigs into high or low RFI groups.

Results from different genome-wide association studies and gene expression analyses are not always consistent. The aim of this research was to use machine learning to identify genes associated with feed efficiency (FE) using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data from pigs that are phenotypically extreme for RFI. RFI was computed by considering within-sex regression on mean metabolic body weight  average daily gain  and average backfat gain. RNA-Seq analyses were performed on liver and duodenum tissue from 32 high and 33 low RFI pigs collected at 153 d of age. Machine-learning algorithms were used to predict RFI class based on gene expression levels in liver and duodenum after adjusting for batch effects. Genes were ranked according to their contribution to the classification using the permutation accuracy importance score in an unbiased random forest (RF) algorithm based on conditional inference. Support vector machine  RF  elastic net (ENET) and nearest shrunken centroid algorithms were tested using different subsets of the top rank genes. Nested resampling for hyperparameter tuning was implemented with tenfold cross-validation in the outer and inner loops. The best classification was obtained with ENET using the expression of 200 genes in liver [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.85; accuracy: 0.78] and 100 genes in duodenum (AUROC: 0.76; accuracy: 0.69). Canonical pathways and candidate genes that were previously reported as associated with FE in several species were identified. The most remarkable pathways and genes identified were NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells  the        genes in duodenum  and melatonin degradation II  PPARa/RXRa activation  and GPCR-mediated nutrient sensing in enteroendocrine cells and        and  genes in liver. ML algorithms and RNA-Seq expression data were found to provide good performance for classifying pigs into high or low RFI groups. Classification was better with gene expression data from liver than from duodenum. Genes associated with FE in liver and duodenum tissue that can be used as predictive biomarkers for this trait were identified. Improving feed efficiency (FE) is a priority for most livestock species because it is a key component of profitability  productivity and sustainability for the meat production industry. Genetic selection has proven to be a successful strategy for this purpose in pigs [  ] and other livestock species such as cattle []  poultry [] or rabbits []. The most widely used measures of FE are: feed conversion ratio  residual feed intake (RFI)  residual gain  and the more recently proposed residual intake and weight gain []  which is an index that combines the latter two measurements. Regardless of which FE indicator is used as selection criterion  individual recording of at least feed intake and body weight gain is required  which is expensive and time-consuming. Thus  obtaining reliable and accurate predictive genetic markers for FE is of paramount interest. Molecular mechanisms that underlie RFI in pigs are still unknown. Several genome-wide association studies [] and gene expression analyses based on microarrays [  ] or RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) [] have been performed  in an attempt to unravel the genetic architecture of this complex trait. However  results from such studies are not always consistent. In this context  the use of alternative methods that are able to provide a good assessment of the generalizability of the results is of great interest. Machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied to a resampling strategy to predict or classify outputs such as RFI class  can be used for this purpose. In recent years  ML algorithms have been used for the analysis of high-throughput deep sequencing data due to their computational efficiency in finding generalizable patterns from high-dimensional data obtained from a small number of samples. Our aims were to identify candidate genes associated with FE in pigs and to assess the ability of different ML algorithms to predict the RFI class (high or low) of pigs using transcriptomic information from liver and duodenum tissue. Animal material came from an experiment performed within the framework of the ECO-FCE project (“A whole-systems approach to optimise feed efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of monogastrics”). Twenty-five sows were inseminated with four Hermitage Maxgro boars. Two hundred and forty-four animals (123 entire males and 121 females) were randomly selected from 25 litters from the same batch and raised in the Hermitage sow herd of GePORK. The trial was conducted during a 4-month period (December 2014-March 2015) on the IRTA Pig Experimental Farm (Monells  Spain). Animals entered the trial when they had a body weight (BW) of 25 kg and remained until slaughter at a BW of<U+2009>~<U+2009>105 kg (69<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 and 153<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 days old at the beginning and at the end of the trial  respectively). They were housed in pens of 10 to 12 randomly distributed individuals. Pigs were randomly assigned to one of the following feeding protocols: (1) a conventional two-phase feeding plan  which provided a standard grower diet used until week 6 of the trial followed by a finisher diet until slaughter; (2) a five-phase feeding plan  in which diet specifications changed at<U+2009>~<U+2009>3-week intervals  applied to pens with pigs of heterogeneous BW; (3) a five-phase feeding plan  similar to the former plan but applied to pens with pigs of homogeneous BW; and (4) an eight- to nine-phase precision-feeding plan applied to pens with pigs of homogeneous BW with non-simultaneous dietary changes that were implemented according to the animals’ BW at<U+2009>~<U+2009>2-week intervals. Throughout all these protocols  animals were fed ad libitum by means of electronic feeders placed in each pen (IVO-station feeder; INSENTEC). Feed composition was similar for all treatments at the beginning and at the end of the trial  but in the multi-phase protocols  different diet specifications were implemented according to either the pen’s average BW (T2 and T3) or the pig’s own BW (T4). Pigs were weighed individually at the start of the trial  then every 3 weeks (weeks 3  6  9 and 12)  and at the end of the study (week 14 to 15). Back fat thickness was also measured every 3 weeks. Average daily gain (ADG) was computed as the difference in BW at the end and the beginning of the trial divided by time elapsed in days. Daily back fat thickness gain (BFG) was computed as the difference in back fat thickness at the end and the beginning of the trial. Individual feed intake (FI) was recorded by the electronic feeders (IVO-station feeder; INSENTEC). Animal care and procedures were performed according to Spanish and European regulations about the protection of animals used in experimentation  following national and institutional guidelines for the Good Experimental Practices  and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Agriculture and Food Research and Technology (IRTA). Upper and lower extreme animals for FE were identified using the RFI criterion  which considered within-sex regression coefficients and was computed by the following formula: where  is the residual feed intake of individual   of sex  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and 2)  and fed the  feeding protocol (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to 4);  is the daily feed intake of individual  during the analysed period;  is the effect of sex  on FI;    and  are the metabolic body weight  the ADG  and the BFG of individual   respectively;    and  are the corresponding partial regressions coefficients (within sex ). At the end of the trial  the five pigs with the lowest  medium  and highest RFI within each combination of sex*feeding strategy were selected; three of these animals were culled because of health problems. After 12 h fasting  the 117 pigs were slaughtered in totally controlled conditions at IRTA’s experimental slaughterhouse at Monells (Girona  Spain)  where tissue sampling was performed. For this research  only data from high and low RFI animals were used  and several tissue samples were discarded due to low-quality RNA. Finally  samples from four animals within each sex*treatment*RFI-class combination were retained (five in one case). Thus  the final dataset for the transcriptomic analyses included 65 individuals  32 high RFI and 33 low RFI pigs from both sexes (16 females and males within each RFI class but for low-RFI males  there were 17 individuals)  equally distributed across the four feeding protocols. The four sires were represented in both the high and low RFI groups  with 7  4  2  and 7 progeny  respectively  for sires 1  2  3  and 4 in the high RFI group and 5  4  6  and 6 in the low RFI group. In order to assess the magnitude of the difference between groups in RFI  a linear model was fitted to the data using the lm() function of R []. The initial model included the following factors: FE class (two levels: high and low RFI)  feeding protocol (four levels)  sex  and the interactions between all these factors. An ANOVA F-test was performed in order to statistically test the significance of the effects of each factor. Samples of approximately 1 mg from liver and duodenum were collected after slaughter  immediately submerged in RNA-later and stored at -<U+2009>80 °C after 24 h. Total mRNA from biological samples was extracted with the RiboPure™ Isolation of High Quality Total RNA kit (Ambion  Austin  TX) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The isolated mRNA was quantified with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop products; Wilmington  USA) and checked for purity and integrity with a Bioanalyzer-2100 (Agilent Technologies  Inc.; Santa Clara CA  USA). Libraries of the 130 RNA samples (65 from duodenum and 65 from liver) were generated using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc)  according to protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Each library was paired-end sequenced (2<U+2009>×<U+2009>75 bp)  using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS  on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at  (CNAG; Barcelona  Spain). The generated raw reads were quality-checked by FASTQC (Babraham Bioinformatics; ). Reads were mapped to the reference pig genome Sscrofa 10.2 and the annotation database Ensembl Genes 86 () by using STAR v. 2.5.2a []. The resulting aligned sequences were merged with Samtools [] and quantification of the total number of genome-mapped reads to a gene was performed with HTSeq. 0.6.1p2 []. Subsequently the RNA-Seq expression data were normalized using the edgeR package []. Gene expression levels were used as the only information (i.e. predictor variables or features) to classify animals into an RFI class (i.e. animals having either a low or high RFI). The quality of this classification can be considered as a measure of the degree to which RFI differences are explained by differences in gene expression (assuming that the classification algorithm is appropriate). Therefore  we considered that the genes with a more informative expression level for classification for RFI were those that were involved in determining the FE of the animal or  at least  to be highly correlated with them. Before performing the animal classification by ML  the existence of potential batch effects on gene expression data was tested and adjusted for  and feature selection of the most informative genes was performed. Then  classifications with different ML techniques and features sets were performed using a nested resampling strategy. The methods used in each of these steps are described below. One common issue with RNA-Seq data is the presence of batch effects that can arise  for instance  from laboratory conditions  day of processing  or technician differences. Data normalization does not remove these effects that can affect subsets of genes in a different way. Detection and removal of these batch effects are necessary since they can potentially lead to incorrect conclusions and reduce the accuracy of the analyses. Batch effects have been reported in several published high-throughput studies [] but few methods have been developed to detect them in high-dimensional expression datasets []. Among these  principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly [] used for data reduction through linear combinations of the dataset that better explain data variation []. In this study  a PCA of RNA-Seq expression data was computed and components that correlated with biological or technical variables (e.g. sex  feeding system  and date of pre-processing) were identified. Since the number of genes was large (><U+2009>12 000)  it is advisable to perform a dimensionality reduction for more stable results with the PCA. Thus  only the 500 most variable genes based on their within-tissue expression level were used in the PCA analysis. Then  RNA-Seq data were adjusted for the first two principal components (PC) using a linear regression analysis. One of the main objectives of our work was to identify the smallest number of genes that yielded the highest possible classification quality. There are three main approaches in ML to perform dimensionality reduction: filter  wrapper  and embedded approaches  for which a good review is in []. In this study  the filter approach was chosen because of its computational speed  scalability  and independence from the specific ML technique used for classification []. Features were ranked using their importance measure in an unbiased random forest (RF) algorithm based on conditional inference []. This nonlinear and non-parametric method can be applied to a wide range of problems  even if they are nonlinear and involve complex interaction effects  and if the number of data is much smaller than the number of predictors. The “cforest” function for conditional inference trees in the “party” R package was used for these analyses. It performs sampling without replacement (instead of bootstrap sampling)  which is the only approach that guarantees reliable variable selection and produces unbiased variable importance measures  even in situations in which the predictor variables have different scales of measurement or different numbers of categories []. The tuned hyper-parameter for this ML algorithm was the number of input variables that were randomly sampled as candidates at each node  the testing value ranging from 5 to the square root of the number of inputs. The number of trees was fixed to 1000. Variable importance can be measured in different ways []. In this study  we used conditional permutation importance for correlated predictors [] to rank the genes because of the existence of co-expression patterns among them. In this method  permutation is performed within groups of observations that are defined by the values of the remaining predictor variables; its advantage  compared to univariate screening methods  is that it accounts for the impact of each predictor variable in multivariate interactions with other predictor variables. Machine-learning algorithms were tested with different subsets of data that contained an increasing number (50  75  100 and 125) of the most informative genes according to this criterion. As a reference  we also tested the quality of the classification using the expression data of all genes. The classification of animals for RFI level (low or high) using gene expression levels as predictor variables was performed using the four ML methods described in the following: support vector machines (SVM)  random forest (RF)  elastic net (ENET)  and prediction analysis for microarrays  also known as nearest shrunken centroids (PAM). These ML algorithms were implemented using the R package “mlr” []  which is an interface for a large number of classification and regression techniques that allows results from different ML algorithms to be compared under the same conditions and to find the most suitable hyper-parameters for each ML method automatically  ensuring that results are reliable and not biased. Support vector machine [  ] is a very well-known ML technique that has been used in several domains with good results in most cases. In fact  SVM and RF are considered state-of-the-art ML algorithms. The main objective of SVM is to find the hyperplane that best separates the samples into high and low RFI  while maximizing the distance between samples and the hyperplane  thus finding the best possible generalization hyperplane []. An important element of this algorithm is the kernel and one of the most used kernels is the Gaussian radial basis (RBF) because almost every surface can be obtained with it []. One of the main parameters in a SVM is the “cost parameter” (“C”)  which is a trade-off between the classification error and the simplicity of the hyperplane decision surface. The other hyper-parameter of SVM regarding the Gaussian function inside the RBF kernel is “gamma”. Performance of SVM is very sensitive to changes in this parameter. Both hyper-parameters were tuned by testing values in powers of two between -<U+2009>12 and 12. The”e1071” R package was used for the analyses. Random forest [] combines several classification trees  which are fitted to subsamples of the original sample-set using randomly selected subsets of predictor variables. From the complete “forest”  a single global prediction is obtained as an average (in case of regression) or majority vote (in case of classification) of the prediction of all trees. The advantages of this method are: (1) it is simple and results are easy to interpret in the case of few predictors; and (2) it can be applied to many problems  even if there are high-order interaction effects or non-linear relationships between the variables. The “randomForest” R package was used for the analysis. Elastic net [] is a regression method that combines the penalty approach of ridge regression () and the penalty approach of lasso () in a mixture of the two (the elastic net penalty is   with  and the ’s being the regression coefficients of the multiple regression). When the number of predictors is much larger than the number of data ()  EL allows more than  predictor variables to be selected out of  candidates. In addition  it can select groups of correlated variables  as in the case of genes sharing the same biological pathway  whereas Lasso tends to select only one variable from a group of correlated variables. The function “cv.glmnet” from the “glmnet” R package was used. The value of  and the coefficient  for the EL penalty were tuned by testing values ranging from 0 (Lasso) to 1 (ridge regression) for  (0  0.15  0.25  0.35  0.5  0.65  0.75  0.85 and 1)  while the optimal  parameter was internally found by cross-validation. Variable importance was estimated as the sum of the regression coefficients of each predictor variable in the different fitted models. Prediction analysis for microarrays or nearest shrunken centroids [] is based on the “nearest centroid” method  which computes the standardized centroid for each class and shrinks it towards the overall centroid for all classes by an amount named “threshold”  which is tuned. The predicted class assigned to a new sample is the class for which the centroid is closest in terms of squared distance. A gene that is shrunk to zero for all classes is eliminated from the classification rule and genes with a stable expression within samples of the same class receive a higher weight than genes with a more variable expression. Therefore  this algorithm automatically performs gene selection and can improve classification accuracy by reducing the effect of non-informative genes. The “pamr” package of R was used for the analysis. The hyper-parameters “threshold” (defined above) and “threshold.scale” (a class –dependent scaling factor for the within-class standard deviation) were tuned in order to find the optimal values. Nested resampling [] was performed in order to obtain reliable performance estimates for the learners and to quantify the generalization ability of the generated classifier model. It consists of two nested resampling loops. In the outer resampling loop  a tenfold cross-validation was performed by randomly dividing the dataset in 10 groups of equal size  taking into account the fact that data were slightly unbalanced. Thus  the subsets were stratified in order to keep a similar number of the less frequent class in each subset. One group was used as an outer validation set and the remaining nine groups were used as outer training set. The process was repeated 10 times  with a different group of data used as a validation set each time  resulting in 10 pairs of training/validation sets. Parameter tuning was done for each outer training set by executing the inner resampling loop  which also consisted of a tenfold cross-validation  resulting in one set of selected hyper-parameters for each outer training set. The learner was fitted on each outer training set using the corresponding selected hyper-parameters (from a grid of possible values) and its performance was evaluated on the corresponding outer validation set. The “mlr” [] package makes it easy to perform all the necessary tasks and to aggregate results obtained from each ML algorithm  comparing them under exactly the same conditions. All analyses were performed using the BioCAI HPC cluster facility at the University of A Coruña. Several performance measures are available for a classification problem: the mean misclassification error  accuracy  and measures based on ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis. In this work  the area under the ROC (AUROC) was used to guide the search process  since this measure is not conditioned by the number of samples [] and is independent of the threshold used for classification. Sensitivity (i.e. the proportion of actual positives that are predicted as positive) and specificity (i.e. the proportion of actual negatives that are predicted as negative) were also computed. From the point of view of selection to improve FE in an animal population  specificity would be the most important performance measurement given that low RFI (i.e. more efficient) was considered to be the negative class. Gene function classification and pathway analyses were performed for the genes that were selected in both tissues as the best predictive set for FE. Before performing the functional analysis  the orthologous human gene names of the pig Ensembl gene ID were retrieved from the Ensembl Genes 89 Database using the Biomart software []. Gene ontologies (GO)  canonical pathways  and biological functions that were significantly (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) enriched in the list of genes  each selected as contributor to the classification  were determined using the ClueGO V2.1.7 plug-in of Cytoscape V [] and the Core Analysis function included in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA; Ingenuity Systems). Raw means for RFI were 0.002 and 0.158 kg for male and female pigs  respectively. Since the feeding strategy had no significant effect on RFI  it was not included in the final model of analysis. Figure  shows the 95% confidence intervals for the least square means of RFI for the different levels of FE class and sex. Differences between FE classes were larger in females than males. Differences  in absolute value  between low and high RFI groups were equal to 0.56<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 kg (which corresponds to 3.5 standard deviation units) in females and 0.31<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 kg (1.9 standard deviation units) in males. Least square means and confidence intervals for residual feed intake (RFI) by sex and RFI class (low and high) To assess the presence of batch effects in the RNA-Seq data  we performed a PCA of gene expression data from liver (Fig. ) and duodenum (Fig. ) tissue using the 500 most variable genes within each tissue. Whereas no differences between samples associated to any known factor were identified in duodenum (Fig. a)  a batch effect associated with sex was identified in the liver dataset  for which the second PC clearly separated samples according to this factor (Fig. a). The association between sex and expression in liver was removed after adjusting RNA-Seq data by PC1 (Fig. b)  which explained 33% of the variation  while PC2 only explained 14%. Finally  it is worth noting that gene expression levels did not differ between the feeding protocols and that the interactions of feeding protocol with other factors in the model were not significant. Thus  these interactions were ignored in subsequent analyses of the RNA-Seq data.

VarExp: percentage of total variance explained by the principal component In a first step of the classification process  genes were ranked according to their importance measure using an unbiased RF algorithm based on conditional inference []. Then  four subsets with increasing numbers (50  75  100 and 125) of the most informative genes were obtained for both the liver and the duodenum gene expression datasets. Those subsets of RNA-Seq data  with or without adjustment for batch effects  were used as predictors of the RFI class in a second step. The classification performance of four ML techniques was measured and compared in terms of the AUROC of 10 test sets from the tenfold outer cross-validation analysis with the best model parameters for each dataset and ML algorithm. Results corresponding to liver and duodenum datasets are presented separately below. We observed clear improvement in classification performance of all ML algorithms when classification was based on PC1 and liver gene expression data that were pre-corrected for PC1 compared to the performance obtained with the original datasets. In addition  the stability of the results tended to increase when using pre-corrected data  as shown in the lower interquartile range for the AUROC results (Fig. ). This indicates that the bias due to batch effects was removed with this correction. No further improvement in the classification performance was obtained by adjusting for PC2 or for both PC (results not shown). Boxplot of AUROC of the classification of pigs on RFI in 10 test sets (from tenfold cross-validations). Classification was based on liver RNA-Seq expression data corresponding to different subsets of genes (50  75  100 and 125)  either raw or pre-corrected by batch effects (suffix “pcs”)  and was performed using support vector machine (SVM)  elastic net (ENET)  nearest shrunken centroids (PAM) and random forest (RF) algorithms The ML algorithm that led to the best performance for all pre-corrected datasets was ENET (cross-validated lambda). The “one-standard-error” rule for selecting the best model was used  as recommended by [] and previously proposed by []. The best classification was obtained with 125 genes  which corresponded to a mean AUROC value of 0.79 when the positive class was high RFI (Fig. ). The highest stability of results  measured in terms of dispersion of AUROC  was observed when only the expression levels of the 100 most informative genes were used as predictors (interquartile interval<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.008)  followed by using 125 genes (interquartile interval<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021). Since the best performance was obtained with the subset that had the largest number of genes (i.e. 125 genes)  we performed a new classification task increasing the number of genes in the subsets up to 400 genes after adjustment for PC1 (i.e. 50  75  100  125  150  200  250  300  350 and 400 genes in each subset). In this new analysis  all processes were repeated 5 times to better assess the stability of the results. In terms of AUROC (Fig. )  the SVM and ENET algorithms performed similarly when the number of genes was less than 200 (Fig. )  but ENET had the best classification when the number of genes was 200 or more  while the PAM algorithm performed the worst in all cases. ENET also showed a greater stability of results in most cases  since the interquartile range was smaller. Combining accuracy [see Additional file : Figure S1] and stability  the best performance was obtained with ENET using the subset with the 200 most important genes as predictors. Boxplot of AUROC of the classification of pigs on RFI in 10 test sets (from tenfold cross-validations). Classification was based on liver RNA-Seq expression data corresponding to different subsets of genes (50  75  100  125  150  200  250  300  350 and 400)  pre-corrected by batch effects  and was performed using support vector machine (SVM)  elastic net (ENET)  nearest shrunken centroids (PAM) and random forest (RF) algorithms A further increase in the number of genes used for classification did not improve its quality in any case  on the contrary it led to a decrease in AUROC (Fig. ) and accuracy [see Additional file : Figure S2]. The performance of RF and PAM algorithms was less affected by non-informative genes than ENET or SVM  being SVM the most affected algorithm. Thus  when the number of genes increased from 200 to 400  the mean AUROC decreased by 0.03 points of the maximum for both SVM and ENET (Fig. ). As a reference  classification based on all sequenced genes (i.e. 12 560 genes) after correction for batch effects using the ENET algorithm resulted in mean values for AUROC  accuracy  sensitivity  and specificity of 0.46  0.50  0.90  and 0.09  respectively  indicating no ability to classify pigs for RFI based on gene expression in liver samples when using all genes. Elastic net performs an internal selection of the predictor variables (i.e. candidate genes). See Additional file : Table S1 lists the genes selected  the differential expression between the two groups of animals for each gene  the number of times that a particular gene was selected (votes)  and the cumulated value of the coefficients of the linear regression equations as a measure of the importance of each gene across all classification processes (“sumbetas”). Since a tenfold cross-validation was repeated 50 times in the outer loop  the maximum number of times that a particular gene could be selected (number of “votes”) across all classification processes is 500 (5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Each of the 200 selected genes was selected 500 times  which means that they all contributed to the classification. Figure a shows the importance of the 40 top contributing genes to the classification of pigs into the high or low RFI class based on gene expression in liver samples. Figure  and see Additional file : Figure S3 show the results from the classification of pigs for RFI based on duodenum RNA-Seq expression data with the four ML algorithms by applying the best model parameters for each algorithm. When duodenum RNA-Seq expression data were used  correction of the data by PC slightly improved the quality of the classification in most of the analyses regardless of the method and subset of genes used. However  correction for batch effects had less impact on the quality of the classification than for the liver gene expression data (Fig. ). For example  when the duodenum RNA-Seq data was corrected by PC1  the mean AUROC of the classification with ENET increased by only 0.05 to 0.06  depending on the number of genes in the prediction dataset. Boxplot of AUROC of the classification of pigs on RFI in 10 test sets (from tenfold cross validations). Classification was based on duodenum RNA-Seq expression data corresponding to different subsets of genes (50  75  100 and 125)  either raw or pre-corrected by batch effects (suffix “pcs”)  and was performed using support vector machine (SVM)  elastic net (ENET)  nearest shrunken centroids (PAM) and random forest (RF) algorithms In general  the quality of the classification with the duodenum dataset was worse than that obtained with the liver dataset. The best classification in terms of AUROC was obtained when the ENET algorithm was used with the expression data from the 100 most informative genes after correction for PC (mean AUROC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.76); accuracy  specificity  and sensitivity of this classification were 0.69  0.66  and 0.71  respectively [see Additional file : Figures S3]. Increasing the number of genes used for classification did not lead to an improvement in AUROC for any ML algorithm. In the case of duodenum  each of the 100 selected genes was selected as contributor to the classification task across all the classification processes. See Additional file : Table S2 shows the genes  the differential expression between the high and low RFI groups of animals for each gene  the number of times they were selected in the validation process (“votes”)  and the importance measure defined above (“sumbetas”). Figure b shows the importance of the 40 top contributing genes to the classification of pigs into the high or low RFI class based on the duodenum gene expression data. Importance of the 40 top genes contributing to the classification of samples into the high or low RFI class.  Liver.  Duodenum We carried out a functional characterization of the genes for which the expression level allowed the best classification of pigs regarding RFI. Of the genes selected for each tissue based on their contribution to the classification  only those that had an orthologous human gene were used in this functional analysis  resulting in 180 and 86 candidate genes [see Additional file : Table S3] that were submitted to IPA for the liver and duodenum data analyses  respectively. The most significant networks identified by IPA are listed in Table . For liver  the second most represented network was associated with carbohydrate metabolism  cellular growth and proliferation  and organismal development functions  while networks associated with cellular development  cellular assembly  and cellular organization were found for both tissues [see Additional file : Figure S4]. For liver  the following canonical pathways were found to be significantly enriched in genes that were selected in liver as the best predictive set for FE: melatonin degradation II  tryptophan degradation X (mammalian  via tryptamine)  sirtuin signaling pathway  PPARa/RXRa activation  GPCR-mediated nutrient sensing in enteroendocrine cells  and xenobiotic metabolism signalling  among others [see Additional file : Table S4]. Among others  the         and  genes are involved in these overrepresented pathways and they were among the top genes that contributed to the classification (Fig. a). The  and  genes  which are related with carbohydrate transmembrane transporter activity  and the  and  genes  which are related with the glycolytic process  were also in the list of selected genes for liver tissue. In duodenum  among the identified canonical pathways  it is worth mentioning: NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response  role of pattern recognition receptors in the recognition of bacteria and viruses  aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells  production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages  cholecystokinin/gastrin-mediated signalling  unfolded protein response  protein ubiquitination pathway  and IL-8 signalling among others [see Additional file : Table S4]. Some of the genes of these canonical pathways were        and . Feed efficiency is one of the most economically important traits in animal production and its improvement is an on-going topic of research in different areas such as nutrition and genetics. Genetic selection on FE was demonstrated to be efficient in several experiments on pigs and thus is a key strategy to improve FE [  ]. However  its implementation is difficult due to the high cost and difficulty to obtain phenotypic records for this trait. Thus  finding reliable and accurate predictive genetic markers that are associated with FE has particular relevance for genetic selection  since they would help increase selection accuracy and provide predictions of FE early in life  thus reducing the generation interval in selected lines. The goodness of a classification procedure relies on achieving a good generalization performance (i.e. high accuracy of the classification or prediction in a testing subset of data) and uniqueness (i.e. stability) of the results. In spite of the demonstrated good performance of ML techniques in different areas of research such as industry or medicine  few applications of these methods have been reported in animal and plant breeding. Non-parametric methods  such as some of those used in our study  allow making predictions of complex traits  such as FE  without imposing a specific structure to the association between trait phenotype and predictor variables (e.g. expression levels  genotypes). This is especially relevant for the study of traits that have a complex genetic architecture []. In this study  we evaluated gene expression levels between male and female pigs with high or low extreme RFI. The difference in RFI between high and low groups of animals was clear and was larger in females than in males. In a study based exclusively on records from females  Ramayo-Caldas et al. [] found differences between high and low RFI groups of animals for other measures of FE such as feed conversion ratio and residual intake and weight gain. Analysis of these alternative FE traits in the complete dataset (results not shown) led to results that were consistent with those of Ramayo-Caldas et al. [] in females. In our study  animals were exposed to different feeding protocols  thus an interaction between genotype and feeding protocol was expected. However  our results did not show any significant effect of the feeding regimen and/or its interaction with other factors of the model for FE or gene expression data. Since all animals were slaughtered under the same conditions  we expect that expression profiles may reflect differences between high and low RFI groups. Sex had an important effect on gene expression levels in liver but not in duodenum tissue. Previous studies have reported sexual dimorphism at the gene expression level in relevant metabolic tissues such as liver  muscle  and/or adipose tissue in pigs [  ]  cows []  humans  rat  and mouse [  ]. Sexually dimorphic genes have also been observed in the small intestine of rat and mouse species [  ]. Van Nas et al. [] observed a sex-specific regulation that was affected by gonadal hormones at the hepatic gene expression level  which included metabolism of steroid hormones and drugs and control of fatty acid homeostasis among the principal cellular functions affected by sex [    ]. In pigs  the liver regulates the whole-body energetic homeostasis involved in different lipid metabolism functions  whereas absorption of food takes place in the small bowel. Our results indicate a sex effect on gene expression in the liver but not in the duodenum  and this may be related with the specific biological functions that the 500 most variable genes in liver and duodenum tissues are involved in. Accordingly  the overrepresented biological processes and KEGG pathways among the 500 most variable genes included steroid metabolic process  drug and xenobiotics metabolism  and oxidative phosphorylation and lipid-related biological functions in the liver  and generation of precursor metabolites and energy  fat digestion  absorption of lipids and minerals  and immune response-related functions in the duodenum. Differential expression analysis was performed in several consecutive steps. In a first step  RNA-Seq data were adjusted by potential group effects due to sex  differences in environmental conditions at different dates of sample processing  or some other unnoticed factors  which could affect the RNA-Seq data and lead to incorrect conclusions if they were correlated with the outcome of interest []. While the effect of sex was strongly correlated with PC2  which explained 14% of the variation in RNA-Seq data in liver  no other known potential factor of variation (e.g. feeding plan) was identified. In general  after correction of RNA-Seq data by PC1 (which explained 33 and 24% of the variance in expression levels in liver and duodenum  respectively)  classification quality was clearly improved for most of the ML methods and subsets of genes  especially in the liver dataset. However  no additional improvement was obtained by including a correction for PC2  which suggests that the effect of un-modelled factors could be more important than the effects of sex on the gene expression data. Some studies have shown the importance of feature selection methods [] for selecting informative genes prior to classification []. Feature selection methods remove irrelevant and redundant features to improve the classification accuracy. In a second step of our analyses  the predictor variable importance was assessed by using an unbiased RF algorithm based on conditional inference []. Its advantage over univariate screening methods is that it takes interactions between predictor variables into account. This method was demonstrated to produce unbiased variable importance measures even when the predictor variables have different scales of measurement or different numbers of categories []. “Conditional permutation importance” was used as the variable importance measure because of the high correlation between predictors. After ranking gene expression variables according to this criterion  four ML algorithms (SVM  ENET  PAM and RF) were evaluated for their performance to classify extreme animals on RFI using gene datasets that included an increasing number of the most informative genes. The evaluated algorithms were chosen because of their proven good performance for classification in many studies. Our findings demonstrate the negative effect of non-informative genes on the classification  and the need for feature selection. Using RNA-Seq data of all 12 560 genes from liver did not enable ML algorithms to classify extreme animals on RFI (mean AUROC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.45 and mean accuracy<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.50 with ENET). In contrast  performance was quite good when information for classification was limited to the 200 most informative genes (mean AUROC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.85 and mean accuracy<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.78 with ENET). With the RF and PAM algorithms  the performance decreased slightly when more  less or non-informative predictors  were included due to the built-in feature selection. In spite of the regularization  the parametrically structured model ENET was slightly more affected by those predictors than the RF and PAM algorithms  maybe because of the excess of parameters added to the model that could lead to overfitting. The SVM algorithm was most affected by including more  less or non-informative predictor variables. Similar results have been reported by Kuhn and Johnson []. Stability of the performance of a classifier  as measured by dispersion parameters of the performance measures  reflects the reliability and uniqueness of the results. In 50 runs of tenfold cross-validation analysis  the interquartile intervals of AUROC ranged from 0.01 to 0.02 across methods when 200 genes were used and from 0.01 to 0.03 otherwise. This indicates a good stability of the results regardless of the method and subset of genes used. We have found a list of genes in liver and duodenum that allow the classification of extreme animals on RFI. Remarkably  several of these genes are components of canonical pathways that were previously associated with FE traits in different species [     ]  which highlights the relevance of these genes and pathways in the genetic determination of FE. For example  in the duodenum dataset  it is worth mentioning the      and  genes  which are involved in pathways such as the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and the aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells. These pathways have been identified in several transcriptome analyses that were carried out on animals with divergent FE phenotypes. In spite of differences depending on the tissue and species analyzed  it is generally admitted that the more efficient pigs have a lower production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and less oxidative stress [     ]. In chickens  the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response was higher in high FE individuals []. In a previous study of our group [] in which a different approach (weighted gene co-expression analysis; WGCNA) was used to identify functionally-related modules of co-expressed genes associated with FE traits  genes encoding heat shock proteins and DNAJ were also identified. In addition  heat shock genes were also found to be associated with variation in weight gain and feed intake in beef steers [  ]. DNAJC6 and DNAJC1 are components of the conserved DNAJ/HSP40 family of proteins  which play a central role in protein homeostasis and are essential for normal growth and development [  ]. The  and  genes encode serine/threonine-protein kinases of the MAP kinase and protein kinase D families  respectively  which are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. Recently  the  gene  which is part of the IL-8 signalling canonical pathway []  was shown to be differentially expressed in the muscle transcriptome of pigs that had divergent feed efficiencies and product qualities. In our study  both the  and  genes were also identified as components of the IL-8 signalling canonical pathway. Another pathway in which these genes are involved is the cholecystokinin/gastrin-mediated signalling pathway  which is linked with the GPCR-mediated nutrient sensing in enteroendocrine cells in liver. Among the canonical pathways that were most significantly enriched by the set of informative genes in liver  we identified melatonin degradation II. Different studies have associated the melatonin degradation pathway with FE traits in beef cattle [  ]. Melatonin is a hormone that plays a major role in the regulation of metabolic processes  internal circadian temporal organization  and control of body weight []. In rats that were exposed to continuous light  a decrease in melatonin levels was associated with lower food intake  but with an increase in FE and visceral adiposity compared to animals exposed to continuous dark or to a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle []. The  and  genes were identified as components of this pathway. In addition  the  gene was identified as a relevant gene in the liver as a component of the sirtuin signalling and PPARa/RXRa activation pathways. The protein encoded by  is a transcriptional activator that regulates circadian rhythms. It should be noted that one of the chronobiological actions of melatonin is the circadian synchronization of hepatic metabolism []  which indicates a tight relationship among these overrepresented pathways. The  and  genes are components of the GPCR-mediated nutrient sensing in enteroendocrine cells. The protein encoded by  is one of the regulatory subunits of the protein kinase A (PKA) and is involved in regulation of energy balance and adiposity []. CCK is a neuropeptide and a gut hormone that acts as a satiety signal for regulating food intake []; the  gene was recently shown to be associated with FE in laying ducks []. In addition  in combination with    has been associated with response to food and regulation of appetite GO biological processes. Finally  some canonical pathways associated with FE that overlapped between liver and duodenum ( aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells and protein ubiquitination pathway) were also identified  although the genes that were identified to be associated with FE differed between liver and duodenum. In a recent study  Ramayo-Caldas et al. [] also identified an overlap of functions but not of genes associated with FE traits between tissues  which suggests tissue-specific regulation of genes in liver and duodenum tissues or lack of power to identify specific genes. Our findings allow us to conclude that the use of RNA-Seq expression data has predictive ability for classifying pigs into high or low RFI groups. Moreover  we demonstrate the good performance of ML techniques for making predictions on complex traits such as FE  in this case based on transcriptomic information. Among the ML algorithms tested  ENET performed the best in all analyses with different tissue transcriptome data and sets of genes used for prediction. Gene expression data from liver resulted in better classification of animals on RFI than expression data from duodenum  and reached a performance of 0.85 in terms of AUROC. We also identified several candidate genes associated with FE  which could be used as predictive biomarkers for this FE. Among the identified most predictive genes were those involved in melatonin degradation II  PPARa/RXRa activation  and GPCR-mediated nutrient sensing in enteroendocrine cells pathways (       and  genes in liver)  and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and aldosterone signalling in epithelial cells (       genes in duodenum).

In this paper  we searched for haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles in 132 725 genotyped Irish beef cattle from five breeds: Aberdeen Angus  Charolais  Hereford  Limousin  and Simmental. We phased the genotypes in sliding windows along the genome and used five tests to identify haplotypes with absence of or reduced homozygosity. Then  we associated the identified haplotypes with 44 351 insemination records that indicated early embryonic death  and postnatal survival records. Finally  we assessed haplotype pleiotropy by estimating substitution effects on estimates of breeding value for 15 economically important traits in beef production. We found support for one haplotype that carries a putatively recessive lethal (chromosome 16 in Simmental) and two haplotypes that carry semi-lethal alleles (chromosome 14 in Aberdeen Angus and chromosome 19 in Charolais)  with population frequencies of 8.8  15.2  and 14.4%  respectively. These three haplotypes showed pleiotropic effects on economically important traits for beef production. Their allele substitution effects are €2.30  €3.42  and €1.47 for the terminal index and €1.03  -<U+2009>€3.11  and -<U+2009>€0.88 for the replacement index  where the standard deviations for the terminal index are €22.52  €18.65  and €22.70 and for the replacement index they are €31.35  €29.82  and €35.79. We identified  as the candidate gene for semi-lethality in Aberdeen Angus  several candidate genes for the lethal Simmental haplotype  and no candidate genes for the semi-lethal Charolais haplotype. We analysed genotype  reproduction  survival  and production data to detect haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles in Irish beef cattle and identified one lethal and two semi-lethal haplotypes  which have pleiotropic effects on economically important traits in beef production. Reproduction inefficiency has a major negative effect on profitability in cattle farming [   ]. Over the last few decades  reproduction has deteriorated in both dairy and beef cattle in many countries  due to strong selection on production traits and their antagonistic relationship with reproduction [  ]  and probably also to inbreeding. In recent years  this trend has begun to be readdressed in many countries by emphasising reproduction traits in animal recording and breeding goals [  ]. Furthermore  the advent of affordable high-density genotyping has enabled genomic selection jointly for production and reproduction traits [  ] and screening for recessive lethal alleles [    ]. Recessive lethal alleles are one of the genetic causes of reproduction inefficiency  because they result in embryonic death when an embryo is homozygous. They can also reduce viability of embryos and liveborn animals when their effect is not fully expressed (incomplete penetrance). Death is an easy phenotype to score but reduced viability is not as easy to identify. However  in some cases  it is observed as reduced conception rates  longer calving intervals  or lower survival for live born animals. Such alleles tend to be rare  but if their frequency increases  the number of affected (homozygous) embryos increases and so does the economic loss. Recessive lethal alleles may increase in frequency in a population because of genetic drift  linkage with favourable alleles  and heterozygote advantage. For example  a recessive lethal allele shows heterozygote advantage if it has a positive pleiotropic effect on production traits thereby conferring an advantage to heterozygous carriers  but not to affected (homozygous) embryos []. This would lead to the selection of heterozygous carriers as parents of the next generation  propagate the recessive lethal allele across the population  and in turn significantly affect reproduction []. The availability of high-density genotype data has enabled screening of livestock populations for recessive lethal alleles. There are reported successes in dairy cattle [   ]  beef cattle []  and pigs [  ]. The screening is based on the detection of the absence of homozygotes  either in whole populations or within carrier families. Several recessive haplotypes that show pleiotropic effects on yield  longevity and fertility in dairy cattle have been reported []. Recently  the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) has initiated large-scale genotyping of commercial beef cattle in Ireland []. To date  more than 1.3 million purebred and crossbred animals have been genotyped. These data will enable genomic selection to increase the productivity and reduce the environmental footprint of Irish cattle []. It can also be a powerful resource for biological discovery  including detection of recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles  should they exist. The objectives of our study were to discover haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles in the most numerous Irish beef cattle breeds  and to quantify their pleiotropic effects on traits under selection. We phased the genotypes in sliding windows along the genome for 132 725 purebred animals from five breeds and used five tests to identify haplotypes with absence or reduced homozygosity. We corroborated the identified haplotypes with reproduction and postnatal survival records. We found support for one haplotype that carries a putatively recessive lethal allele and two haplotypes that carry putatively recessive semi-lethal alleles. Substitution analysis showed that these haplotypes had pleiotropic effects on economically important traits in Irish beef cattle. In this paper  we analysed genotype  reproduction  survival  and production data to identify and validate haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles in Irish beef cattle. Briefly  our approach consisted of: Genotype filtering  imputation  and phasing  Identification of haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles  Reproduction and survival analysis to corroborate the identified haplotypes  Pleiotropy analysis to estimate haplotype effects on production traits  Identification of candidate genes. We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data from the ICBF for purebred Aberdeen Angus  Charolais  Hereford  Limousin  and Simmental animals. The animals were genotyped with four different  but overlapping  Illumina SNP arrays (HD  IDBv1  IDBv2  and IDBv3; see Table )  with most of the animals genotyped on the IDBv3 array (><U+2009>64%). We filtered the genotype data on autosomal chromosomes  missing information  and heterozygosity. We excluded SNPs with a low genotype call rate (<<U+2009>0.90)  and animals with a low genotype call rate (<<U+2009>0.90) or high heterozygosity (><U+2009>6 standard deviations from mean heterozygosity). After filtering  132 725 animals were available: 22 836 Aberdeen Angus; 39 472 Charolais; 12 678 Hereford; 45 965 Limousin; and 11 774 Simmental animals (Table ). Finally  we reduced the SNPs to those that were present on the IDBv3 array and had a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05 within each breed. This decreased the number of SNPs to 40 146 for Aberdeen Angus; 41 366 for Charolais; 40 368 for Hereford; 40 951 for Limousin; and 39 907 for Simmental. We imputed missing genotypes in these reduced sets with AlphaImpute version 1.9.1 []  and then they were phased with AlphaPhase version 1.9.1 [] (using a core and tail length of 320 SNPs) into 20 SNP haplotypes in sliding windows. This means that the genotypes at each locus were phased 20 times in sliding windows  with the start of each window being moved along by one SNP at a time. To identify haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles  the phased haplotypes from 132 725 animals were analysed for complete absence or a reduced level of homozygosity within the analysed breed (see Table ). We used five different tests that were grouped into three categories: (i) population  (ii) carrier mating  and (iii) semi-lethality. The first and second categories are based on the probability of observing complete absence of recessive homozygous animals in the whole population or in the progeny from carrier matings. Thus  they assume that recessive lethal alleles are completely penetrant. The third category tests the null hypothesis that observed and expected numbers of recessive homozygous animals are equal. Thus  it is able to detect recessive semi-lethal alleles  with some homozygotes not suffering from deleterious effects or some haplotypes that imperfectly tag a recessive lethal allele. From this point on  we will use  to denote wild type homozygotes   to denote heterozygotes  and  to denote homozygotes for a haplotype that carries putatively recessive lethal alleles. The first test identifies haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal alleles based on their population frequency. The probability of observing no  animals () depends on the  frequency () and the number of genotyped animals (): =<U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>/4). The number of expected  animals () under these conditions is equal to: =<U+2009>(/4)·. This test is the same as that used by VanRaden et al. []. The second category consists of two tests that identify haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal alleles based on the expected number of  progeny from ×<U+2009> matings. We analysed both sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam and sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>maternal grand-sire ×<U+2009> matings. The probability of observing no  animals follows a Bernoulli process and can be calculated as =<U+2009>0.75 for  sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam ×<U+2009> matings and =<U+2009>0.875 for  sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>maternal grand-sire ×<U+2009> matings. The expected number of  progeny was calculated as /4 for sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam ×<U+2009> matings and /8 for sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>maternal grand-sire ×<U+2009> matings. These tests are partially the same as that used by VanRaden et al. []. The third category tests the null hypothesis that the observed and expected number of  animals do not differ based on sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam ×<U+2009> or sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>maternal grand-sire ×<U+2009> matings. From the number of observed and expected  ( and )   ( and )  and  ( and ) progeny  we calculated a one-way Chi square test statistic: <U+2009>=<U+2009>(<U+2009>-<U+2009>)/+<U+2009>(<U+2009>-<U+2009>)/. The test statistic has one degree of freedom. Haplotypes that show absence or a reduced level of homozygosity at <<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (-log><U+2009>7.30) were considered as candidates for carrying putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles that cause early embryonic death or reduced postnatal survival. In order to decrease the false discovery rate  only 1 Mb long regions with at least nine haplotype tests with <<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 were considered. From each of these regions  only the most significant haplotype test from each of the three test categories was selected. We analysed the effect of each of these haplotypes on cow reproduction and progeny survival to corroborate lethality and on production traits to evaluate pleiotropy. We used routine cow reproduction and progeny survival records from the ICBF database. We tracked 44 351 insemination records that pertain to purebred Aberdeen Angus  Charolais  Hereford  Limousin  or Simmental cattle  for which both the cow and the AI sire that it is mated to  were genotyped. There were 7540 records for Aberdeen Angus  11 520 for Charolais  5566 for Hereford  15 404 for Limousin  and 4321 for Simmental. Altogether these inseminations resulted in 21 196 progeny. Each resulting calf had records for its date of birth and  if deceased  its date of death and the cause of death (natural death or slaughtered). All the new born calves were followed from birth until November 2017. If they were still alive at the end of data collection their records were treated as censored. To quantify the effect of identified haplotypes on reproduction  we determined the insemination success rate based on the number of days between a recorded insemination and the subsequent calving date. Insemination success rate was calculated as a ratio between the number of born progeny and the number of inseminations. These statistics were reported for the three mating types: (1) ×<U+2009>  (2) ×<U+2009>  and (3) ×<U+2009>. The interval between insemination and calving was calculated from 40 769 records for which the date of the corresponding calving was known. In order to accommodate shorter or longer than average gestation length  a window of 7  14  or 21 days was allowed on either side of the breed average gestation length  calculated as the average gestation length for the set of individuals recorded for that breed. If a calving occurred outside of the window  the insemination was deemed to be unsuccessful. If a haplotype harbours recessive lethal alleles  ×<U+2009> matings are expected to have a 25% lower insemination success since there will be 25%  progeny and an interval between insemination and calving longer than 21 days  which is the average time between each standing oestrus in cattle. To quantify the effect of identified haplotypes on postnatal survival  we used survival analysis with the Cox proportional-hazard model. We compared hazard ratios between the progeny from: (1) ×<U+2009>  (2) ×<U+2009>  and (3) ×<U+2009> matings. If a haplotype affects postnatal survival  we would expect  progeny from ×<U+2009> matings to have a higher hazard ratio. Since two causes of death were reported (natural death and slaughtered)  we analysed data in two ways: (1) we treated records from slaughtered animals as censored  and (2) we treated their records as uncensored. We analysed estimated breeding values to investigate pleiotropic effects of the identified haplotypes on economically important traits in beef production. Estimated breeding values for 15 traits (feed intake  live weight  cull cow weight  carcass weight  carcass confirmation  carcass fat  docility  gestation length  age at first calving  calving interval  calving difficulty due to the sire  maternal calving difficulty  mortality at calving  maternal weaning weight  and cow survival) for all genotyped individuals in this study were available from the May 2017 routine genetic evaluation carried out by the ICBF. These 15 traits are included in two indexes with different economic weights and trait emphasis (shown in parentheses). The economic weights were calculated based on the costs of inputs and the value of final products []. We used the same economic weights and trait emphasis as used currently by ICBF. The terminal index consists of: calving difficulty due to sire (-<U+2009>€4.65  18%)  gestation length (-<U+2009>€2.25  4%)  mortality (-<U+2009>€5.34  3%)  docility (€17.03  2%)  feed intake (-€0.10  16%)  carcass weight (€3.14  41%)  carcass conformation (€14.77  11%)  and carcass fat (-<U+2009>€7.86  5%). The replacement index consists of eight cow traits: maternal calving difficulty (-<U+2009>€4.98  6%)  age at first calving (-<U+2009>€0.99  6%)  calving interval (-<U+2009>€5.07  9%)  cow survival (€8.86  8%)  maternal weaning weight (€5.58  18%)  cow live weight (-<U+2009>€1.31  13%)  cow docility (€77.27  4%)  cull cow weight (€0.91  7%); and eight calf traits: calving difficulty due to sire (-<U+2009>€5.12  7%)  gestation length (-<U+2009>€2.48  2%)  mortality (-<U+2009>€5.87  1%)  calf docility (€14.72  1%)  feed intake (-<U+2009>€0.07  4%)  carcass weight (€2.10  10%)  carcass conformation (€10.22  3%)  and carcass fat (-<U+2009>€5.44  1%). For every identified haplotype  we estimated its substitution effect on the estimated breeding values for each of the 15 traits and two indexes. Only estimated breeding values with at least 25% reliability on the trait of interest were used  which amounted to between 1515 and 43 963 records being used of which between 29.4 and 87.0% were from sires with progeny and between 0.8 and 92.4% were from animals with their own phenotypes. The substitution effect was estimated by linear regression of estimated breeding values on the number of haplotype copies that an animal carries. Trait-specific substitution effects were divided by the standard deviation of the estimated breeding values to present the effects on a comparable scale. For the estimation of economic impact of putative lethal or semi-lethal haplotypes on the whole Irish beef population  we built a simple economic model. This model was based on the number of purebred sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>purebred dam  purebred sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>crossbred dam  and crossbred sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>crossbred dam of Aberdeen Angus  Charolais  and Simmental animals  the expected number of progeny genotypes  haplotype frequencies  insemination success rate  number of days between the subsequent inseminations  daily costs for maintaining a cow  and substitution effects. We obtained these inputs from this study  the ICBF database  and the E-profit monitor—an online financial analysis tool []. We used Bioconductor version 3.7 with the BioMart database version Ensembl Genes 92 using the btaurus_gene_ensembl to find candidate genes within the regions of the identified haplotypes []. We used the UMD3.1 cattle reference genome []. We extracted the protein coding genes and searched for lethal effects observed with homologous genes with the same function in the Mouse Genome Informatics database []. Our results identified one haplotype that carries a putatively recessive lethal allele and two haplotypes that carry putatively recessive semi-lethal alleles  which were located on chromosome 16 in Simmental  chromosome 14 in Aberdeen Angus  and chromosome 19 in Charolais  respectively. These haplotypes showed pleiotropic effects on economically important beef production traits. We identified the - () gene as the potential causative gene for semi-lethality in Aberdeen Angus. In total  there were between 36 and 109 haplotypes with significant absence or reduced levels of homozygosity at <<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 in the five breeds. Table  shows the number of significant haplotypes by test and breed. The largest number of significant haplotypes was observed for Limousin (109) followed by Charolais (86)  Aberdeen Angus (69)  Hereford (57)  and Simmental (36). Among the different tests  the semi-lethality test on sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam matings had the largest number of significant haplotypes. The carrier mating test on sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam matings had the second largest number of significant haplotypes for Charolais  Hereford  and Simmental. Across all five breeds  there were 19 one-Mb long regions with at least nine haplotypes that showed significant absence or a reduced level of homozygosity. These were considered as candidate regions with haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles. Figure  shows the negative logarithm of all test p-values across the whole genome and the 19 candidate regions are listed in Additional file : Table S1  with five regions for Aberdeen Angus  two for Charolais  three for Hereford and Limousin  and six for Simmental. Some of the regions were in close proximity and appeared as a single region (see Fig. ). This was the case for three regions on chromosome 14 in Aberdeen Angus  two regions on chromosome 6 in Hereford  two regions on chromosome 23 in Limousin  and three regions on chromosome 13 and two regions on chromosome 16 in Simmental. The region between 48 and 49 Mb on chromosome 19 was detected in all the breeds. Genome-wide Manhattan plot for lack of homozygosity in  Aberdeen Angus   Charolais   Hereford   Limousin  and  Simmental breeds From the 19 candidate regions  we selected 22 haplotypes with the highest significance within each of the three category tests. Table  lists the 22 haplotypes and their characteristics. We named the haplotypes by using a code including the breed (AA for Aberdeen Angus  CH for Charolais  HE for Hereford  LI for Limousin and SI for Simmental)  the chromosome  and the haplotype number within the breed (H for haplotype). Except for HE19H3 and SI19H6  which were identified with tests from two categories (carrier mating test with sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam matings from the carrier mating tests and semi-lethality test with sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam matings from the semi-lethality tests)  all haplotypes were identified by tests from a single category. Two out of the 22 identified haplotypes  AA14H3 and SI16H5  were associated with decreased insemination success rate and a longer interval between insemination and calving. Table  shows the insemination success rate and the length of the interval between insemination and calving for the non-carrier<U+2009>×<U+2009>non-carrier (×<U+2009>  non-carrier<U+2009>×<U+2009>carrier (×<U+2009>  and carrier<U+2009>×<U+2009>carrier (×<U+2009> matings for the AA14H3 and SI16H5 haplotypes. AA14H3 was located on chromosome 14 (8 064 004–8 927 881 bp) in Aberdeen Angus and SI16A5 on chromosome 16 (51 811 400–53 434 159 bp) in Simmental. The insemination success rates for ×<U+2009> matings were 24.2  23.0  and 20.2% lower (AA14H3)  and 48.6  52.5  and 52.7% lower (SI16H5) compared to the ×<U+2009> matings for windows of 7  14  and 21 days on either side of the average gestation length for each breed  respectively. The insemination success rates were also lower in ×<U+2009> matings than in ×<U+2009> matings  but the differences were smaller. For both haplotypes (AA14H3 and SI16H5) the interval between insemination and calving was longer for ×<U+2009> matings than for ×<U+2009> matings  which was in turn longer than for ×<U+2009> matings. The interval between insemination and calving for ×<U+2009> matings was 30 days longer than for ×<U+2009> matings for both AA14H3 and SI16H5 haplotypes  and that for ×<U+2009> matings was longer than for ×<U+2009> matings by 4 days for AA14H3 and by 9 days for SI16H5. One of the identified haplotypes  CH19H2 was associated with a significantly (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) increased hazard ratio for postnatal survival (i.e. decreased survival) of progeny from ×<U+2009> matings. CH19H2 is located on chromosome 19 (48 874 999–48 902 319 bp) in Charolais. Additional file : Table S2 presents the hazard ratios for progeny from ×<U+2009> and ×<U+2009> matings compared to those for progeny from ×<U+2009> matings  for which records for culled progeny were treated as censored or complete. Progeny of individuals that carried the CH19H2 haplotype had a 36% higher probability of dying or being slaughtered during their life compared to the progeny of ×<U+2009> parents. All three haplotypes that carry putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles associated with decreased insemination success or reduced postnatal survival had high frequencies. Table  summarizes the statistics for the AA14A3  CH19A2  and SI16A5 haplotypes. Haplotype frequencies were 15.2% for AA14A3  14.4% for CH19A2  and 8.8% for SI16A5. Ninety-five recessive homozygous individuals were observed for AA14A3  83 for CH19A2  and none for SI16A5. This suggests that the SI16A5 haplotype carries a putatively recessive lethal allele  whereas AA14A3 and CH19A2 haplotypes carry putatively recessive semi-lethal alleles. Table  shows that the number of observed recessive homozygotes was always smaller than the expected number for different types of comparisons. SNP alleles present on the AA14A3  CH19A2  and SI16A5 haplotypes are in Additional file : Table S3. To investigate potential pleiotropic effects on traits under selection  we estimated the substitution effects of the AA14H3  CH19H2  and SI16H5 haplotypes. Figure  shows standardized substitution effects  presented in the units of a trait standard deviation  for 15 traits that are part of the terminal or replacement index. A significant substitution effect for the AA14H3 haplotype was observed for cull cow weight (0.37)  followed by live weight (0.34)  feed intake (0.31)  calving interval (0.30)  maternal calving difficulty (-<U+2009>0.25)  carcass weight (0.25)  carcass fat (-<U+2009>0.13)  age at first calving (-<U+2009>0.12)  calving difficulty (0.10)  cow survival (-<U+2009>0.10)  carcass conformation (-<U+2009>0.07)  gestation length (0.06)  and maternal weaning weight (-<U+2009>0.04). Collectively  one copy of the AA14H3 haplotype increased the terminal index by €3.42 where one standard deviation is €18.65  and decreases the replacement index by €3.11  where one standard deviation is €29.82. A significant substitution effect for the SI16H5 haplotype was observed for feed intake (-<U+2009>0.24)  followed by cow survival (0.17)  cull cow weight (0.15)  carcass fat (-<U+2009>0.11)  maternal calving difficulty (-<U+2009>0.09)  carcass conformation (0.09)  and live weight (0.09). Collectively  one copy of the SI16H5 haplotype increased the terminal index by €2.30 where one standard deviation is €22.52 and the replacement index by €1.03 where one standard deviation is €31.35. A significant substitution effect for the CH19H2 haplotype was observed for maternal weaning weight (-<U+2009>0.18)  maternal calving difficulty (0.13)  carcass conformation (0.12)  carcass fat (-<U+2009>0.11)  live weight (-<U+2009>0.10)  feed intake (-<U+2009>0.09)  age at first calving (-<U+2009>0.09)  gestation length (0.07)  calving difficulty (0.07)  mortality (0.04)  and carcass weight (0.04). Collectively  one copy of the CH19H2 haplotype increased the terminal index by €1.47 where one standard deviation is €22.70 and decreased the replacement index by €0.88 where one standard deviation is €35.79.

The annual losses due to decreased viability and decreased survival for each haplotype were estimated to reach ~<U+2009>€570 000 for AA14H3  ~<U+2009>€930 000 for CH19H2  and ~<U+2009>€210 000 for SI16H5. The annual gains due to positive associations with economically important traits were estimated to reach ~<U+2009>€110 000 for AA14H3  ~<U+2009>€70 000 for CH19H2  and ~<U+2009>€50 000 for SI16H5. Under the current population structure in Ireland  the estimated national annual net effects were negative: -<U+2009>€450 000 for AA14H3 -<U+2009>€860 000 for CH19H2  and -<U+2009>€160 000 for SI16H5. The large negative net effect of the CH19H2 haplotype is due to the larger purebred population in Charolais than in Aberdeen Angus and Simmental. The economic model shows that  under the current population structure  the maximum annual net effects would be achieved with haplotype frequencies of 0.02% for AA14H3 (+€7 000)  0.01% for CH19H2 (+€2 000)  and SI16H5 (+€4 000) [see Additional file : Figure S1]. We identified one protein coding gene in the region of AA14H3  none in the region of CH19H2  and several in the region of SI16H5. - () is the only protein coding gene located between 8 064 004 and 8 927 881 bp on chromosome 14 of the AA14A3 haplotype.  is associated with prenatal or perinatal lethality in the Mouse Informatics Database. Additional file : Table S5 lists the 64 protein coding genes located between 51 811 400 and 53 434 159 bp on chromosome 16 of the SI16H5 haplotype  among which five  i.e. - ()   ()  - ()   ()  and - ()) are associated with prenatal or perinatal lethality in mice. Our results reveal one haplotype that carries a putatively recessive lethal allele (SI16A5) and two haplotypes that carry putatively recessive semi-lethal alleles (AA14A3 and CH19A2) that are candidates for lethality or semi-lethality in homozygous state. These three haplotypes were identified by the haplotype analysis of 132 725 purebred animals of five beef cattle breeds from the ICBF database. The results also suggest pleiotropy  since these haplotypes include or are in strong linkage with variants that have substantial effects on economically important traits. In the light of these results  we discuss (1) the identification of haplotypes that carry putative recessive lethal and semi-lethal alleles  (2) the frequency of the identified haplotypes  (3) their economic impact  and (4) their potential genetic causes. We used five tests on sliding haplotypes and phenotypic information to search for haplotypes that carry recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles. We used haplotypes in a sliding window of 20 SNPs  which was previously shown to be a good compromise between haplotype diversity and detection of putative recessive lethal alleles with a moderate SNP density array []. The tests were based on the number of expected recessive homozygous individuals either in the whole population or from matings between carriers. Along with the tests for complete absence of recessive homozygotes  we also used a set of tests that allowed for some recessive homozygotes but tested whether their number was significantly smaller than expected. This allowed us to take possible incomplete penetrance  incomplete linkage between haplotype and putative recessive lethal alleles  structural variation  or genotyping  phasing  and imputation errors into account. In the following  we consider that all are semi-lethal. The top 22 candidates from the haplotype analysis were further corroborated with cow insemination and progeny survival analysis  and three haplotypes showed phenotypic evidence of lethality. Recessive lethal alleles are expected to decrease insemination success and extend the interval between insemination and calving. In the case of semi-lethality  some embryos are expected to survive  but these may have a decreased viability that will in turn affect their survival. Although there were many haplotypes with a significant absence or reduced level of homozygosity  which indicated that they carried putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles  only two haplotypes were supported by the reproduction analysis. In particular  there was a strong signal observed at the end of chromosome 19 for all five cattle breeds  which was supported by phenotypic data only in the Charolais breed. A highly significant departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed for SNPs that were located at the end of chromosome 19 with an excessive heterozygosity level (results not shown). This may indicate genotyping errors or structural variation in this region [] that could explain the strong signal observed. For our methods to detect a haplotype that carries putatively recessive lethal or semi-lethal alleles  we needed a relatively high haplotype frequency or many ×<U+2009> matings. Because most haplotypes are rare  this means that the methods we used had sufficient power for a very small proportion of the haplotypes. Following the probability calculations of the different tests and fixing the number of genotyped animals to the number available for this study  we were able to assess the minimum required haplotype frequency with a significance of <<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  i.e. 5.42% for Aberdeen Angus  4.14% for Charolais  7.29% for Hereford  3.83% for Limousin  and 7.56% for Simmental. The percentages of haplotypes with a frequency higher than these thresholds were very low: 0.98% for Aberdeen Angus  0.68% for Charolais  1.01% for Hereford  0.56% for Limousin  and 0.52% for Simmental. Similarly  reaching such significance with the carrier mating test would require at least 59 sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam carrier (×<U+2009>) matings and no homozygous progeny. The percentages of haplotypes reaching this threshold were even smaller than for the population test: 0.44% for Aberdeen Angus  0.23% for Charolais  0.37% for Hereford  0.20% for Limousin  and 0.16% for Simmental. Furthermore  reaching significance with the carrier mating test would require 126 sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>maternal grand-sire carrier (×<U+2009> matings and no homozygous progeny. The percentage of haplotypes reaching this threshold were even smaller than for the carrier mating test with sire<U+2009>×<U+2009>dam matings  i.e. 0.06% for Aberdeen Angus  0.04% for Charolais and Hereford  0.03% for Limousin  and 0.02% for Simmental. Finally  reaching significance with the semi-lethality test required that the Chi square test statistic be higher than 29.72. The percentages of haplotypes that reached this threshold in the current study was less than 0.01% for all the breeds. Since recessive lethal and semi-lethal alleles are usually rare and breed-specific  they are difficult to detect in a population  in particular for recent mutations since modern breeding programs try to avoid inbreeding to preserve genetic variation and maintain fitness. Thus  breeders are likely to indirectly avoid carrier matings because they avoid matings between close relatives. Still  there are some alleles that are propagated through the population via popular sires  have pleiotropic effects  or are in incomplete linkage with an allele that has a positive effect on a trait that was selected for in the past. A classic example of a recessive lethal allele propagated with a popular sire is the complex vertebral malformation (CVM) of calves in the Holstein breed. The causal mutation was propagated by the bull Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell that was incidentally also a carrier of the bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD) []. An example of a pleiotropic recessive lethal allele is a 660-kb deletion that causes embryonic death in Nordic Red cattle []. Since this deletion is positively associated with milk yield  it is quite common (13–32%) in the Nordic Red cattle population. Yet another example is the Weaver syndrome which is expressed postnatally between the age of 5 and 8 months []  with Weaver-carriers also producing more milk and fat  which have been strongly selected for in the past [  ]. High haplotype frequencies and substitution effects on traits under selection suggest that the frequency of the detected haplotypes in this study may have increased because of pleiotropy or linked selection. The observed frequencies are high compared to expected frequencies with mutation-selection equilibrium. We can use Nei’s [] formula to approximate the expectation and variance of the frequency of a recessive lethal allele in a finite population  where  is the mutation rate   the effective population size  and  the selection coefficient against the mutant lethal: With a high mutation rate of =<U+2009>10 and an  similar to that of some beef cattle populations of 300  e.g. [  ]  the expected equilibrium frequency is very low  regardless of whether the lethal allele is fully (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) or partially penetrant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.75):  and ˜<U+2009>0.0031 for a fully penetrant lethal allele  and  and ˜<U+2009>0.0036 for a partially penetrant lethal allele. This analysis clearly shows that there are other forces  i.e.  selection  that maintain the high frequency of the three haplotypes. Analysis of the economic impact of the three haplotypes on the whole Irish beef population supports the role of pleiotropy in maintaining high haplotype frequencies  which should be managed with appropriately optimised breeding programs. The economic impact could be increased if haplotype carriers are identified and mating between carriers is avoided. This is relatively easy to achieve when there is only one or a few haplotypes for which carrier matings are to be avoided. However  if there are many lethal haplotypes to select against  it will be much more difficult to achieve within pure breeds. Crossbreeding could overcome this issue for breed-specific haplotypes. We found one candidate gene for one haplotype that carries a putatively recessive lethal allele  no candidate genes for another  and several for the third one.  was the only protein coding gene that overlapped with the AA14H3 haplotype. ZFAT is a transcription factor involved in immune-regulation and apoptosis [  ] and plays a role in the development of the hematopoietic system []. The Mouse Genome Informatics database reported complete early embryonic lethality for a knock-out allele of .  is also known to be associated with human height [  ] and body size in horses []. This is consistent with our results  since we observed an insemination success rate that was 20.2 to 24.2% lower (based on different gestation window size) for the AA14H3 ×<U+2009> matings than for the HH<U+2009>×<U+2009>HH matings  and the haplotype was positively associated with weight-related traits and feed intake. Sixty-four protein coding genes overlapped with the SI16H5 haplotype  of which five       and  were associated with prenatal or perinatal lethality in the Mouse Genome Informatics database [    ]. This haplotype displays a positive association with feed conversion ratio  which may explain its high frequency in the population. There were no homozygous individuals for the SI16H5 haplotype  which suggests that the identified haplotype tags the putative recessive lethal allele(s). The existence of homozygous individuals for the AA14H3 and CH19H2 haplotypes suggests that there may be multiple underlying haplotypes with and without lethal allele(s)  but we are unable to distinguish them with the current genotyping data. Another possible reason is incomplete penetrance  resulting in some homozygotes not suffering from the deleterious effects of the allele. Fine-mapping these haplotypes with sequence data could potentially resolve the fine haplotype structure  and identify causal variants for lethality and pleiotropic effects on the selected traits. Efforts to identify such causative variants are ongoing. We identified three haplotypes  one that carries a putatively recessive lethal allele in Aberdeen Angus and two that carry semi-lethal alleles  one in Charolais and one in Simmental. Carrier matings in Aberdeen Angus and Simmental had a lower success of artificial insemination and a longer interval between insemination and calving. Progeny from carrier matings in Charolais had a higher probability of dying or culling. The haplotype in Aberdeen Angus was in a region that contains the  gene  which was previously shown to be lethal in mice. The haplotype in Simmental was in a region that contains several candidate genes that potentially cause prenatal or perinatal lethality. Substitution analysis indicated that the haplotypes had pleiotropic effects on the traits under selection. The substitution effects were positive for the terminal index and positive to negative for the replacement index. Further work is needed to identify the underlying causative variants that impact the traits under selection and fitness. Identification of haplotype carriers will improve the breeding success and fitness of beef cattle populations.  González-Recio O  Pérez-Cabal MA  Alenda R.

Heterozygosity at genetic markers is easier to measure and could potentially be used as an indicator of heterosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of heterozygosity on various maternal and production traits in purebred and crossbred pigs. The proportion of heterozygosity at genetic markers across the genome for each individual was included in the prediction model as a fixed regression across or within breeds.ResultsEstimates of regression coefficients of heterozygosity showed large effects for some traits. For maternal traits  regression coefficient estimates were always in a favourable direction  while for production  meat and slaughter quality traits  they were both favourable and unfavourable. Traits with the largest estimated effects of heterozygosity were total number born  litter weight at 3 weeks  weight at 150 days  and age at 40 kg. Estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity differed between breeds. Traits with the largest effect of heterozygosity also showed a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) increase in prediction accuracy when heterozygosity was included in the model compared to the model without heterozygosity.ConclusionsFor traits with the largest estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity  the inclusion of heterozygosity in the model improved prediction accuracy. Using models that include heterozygosity would result in selecting different animals for breeding  which has the potential to improve genetic gain for these traits.

Heterozygosity at genetic markers is easier to measure and could potentially be used as an indicator of heterosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of heterozygosity on various maternal and production traits in purebred and crossbred pigs. The proportion of heterozygosity at genetic markers across the genome for each individual was included in the prediction model as a fixed regression across or within breeds. Estimates of regression coefficients of heterozygosity showed large effects for some traits. For maternal traits  regression coefficient estimates were always in a favourable direction  while for production  meat and slaughter quality traits  they were both favourable and unfavourable. Traits with the largest estimated effects of heterozygosity were total number born  litter weight at 3 weeks  weight at 150 days  and age at 40 kg. Estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity differed between breeds. Traits with the largest effect of heterozygosity also showed a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) increase in prediction accuracy when heterozygosity was included in the model compared to the model without heterozygosity. For traits with the largest estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity  the inclusion of heterozygosity in the model improved prediction accuracy. Using models that include heterozygosity would result in selecting different animals for breeding  which has the potential to improve genetic gain for these traits. This is most beneficial when crossbreds or several breeds are included in the estimation of breeding values and is relevant to all species  not only pigs. Thus  our results show that including heterozygosity in the model is beneficial for some traits  likely due to dominant gene action. One of the main reasons for producing crossbreds (CB) in animal breeding programs is to take advantage of heterosis (“the difference between crossbred and inbred means” [])  but heterosis can be difficult to estimate. However  heterozygosity at genetic markers is much easier to measure (in genotyped individuals). Although heterozygosity is not the same as heterosis  heterozygosity may be a useful indicator when predicting the ability of purebreds (PB) to produce good CB offspring. Zhang et al. [] found a significant correlation between heterosis and individual heterozygosity for birth weight in an F1 cross of pigs  but not for average daily gain and feed conversion ratio in the same population. In addition  when dominant gene action  which results in differences between the genotypic value and the breeding value at a single locus []  is present  including heterozygosity in the model as an alternative to fitting a dominance model [] would be interesting because it is less computationally demanding. An alternative approach is to include inbreeding in the model  since it has the opposite effect of heterozygosity on phenotype(s) (e.g. if increased heterozygosity increases the phenotype  inbreeding would decrease it)  and Xiang et al. [] found that the predictive ability for total number born was improved when including (genomic) inbreeding in the model. The level of heterozygosity of an individual is very easy to obtain from genotypes and requires no knowledge of ancestry  in contrast to pedigree inbreeding. In general  the level of heterozygosity is expected to be higher in CB than in PB animals and individuals with higher heterozygosity are expected to have better fitness. An individual’s average heterozygosity across markers can be used as a measure of heterozygosity. An alternative would be to use standardized heterozygosity  for which a common divisor is used for each defined group of individuals []. In this case  animals from different breeds or that were genotyped on different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips could be compared by standardizing the heterozygosity  i.e. dividing the heterozygosity by the mean within the group. Against this background  the objective of our study was to investigate the effect of heterozygosity on various traits in PB and CB animals and determine whether inclusion of heterozygosity in models for the estimation of breeding values can increase prediction accuracy  both in CB and their PB parents. Three sets of data were available for this study (Table ): two were provided by Norsvin SA (Hamar  Norway  datasets 1 and 3) and one by Topigs Norsvin (Beuningen  the Netherlands  dataset 2). Dataset 1 included data from Norwegian Landrace  dataset 2 from Dutch Landrace (breed A)  Dutch Large White (breed B)  and their F1 cross (breed X)  and dataset 3 from a synthetic sire line that was composed of two synthetic sire lines (Lines 1 and 2) that have different genetic origins and have been under selection independently from each other. Dataset 3 contains animals of the two original lines  their F1 cross  and a backcross (Line 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>F1). Datasets 1 and 2 comprised maternal traits and dataset 3 comprised production  meat quality  and slaughter quality traits (and one maternal trait) (Table ). Not all animals had observations on all traits and only females had observations on maternal traits. Genotypes for the breeds were obtained from different SNP chips. Genotyping was performed at CIGENE (University of Life Sciences  Ås  Norway) or at GeneSeek (Lincoln  NE  USA)  using either the Illumina GeneSeek custom 80 K SNP chip (Lincoln  NE  USA)  the Illumina Porcine SNP60 Beadchip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA)  an Illumina GeneSeek custom 50 K SNP chip (Lincoln  NE  USA)  an Illumina GeneSeek custom 10 K SNP chip (Lincoln  NE  USA)  or the Illumina Porcine SNP9 Beadchip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA). Genome positions of the SNPs were based on the Sscrofa10.2 assembly of the reference genome []. Genotyping of Norwegian Landrace animals (dataset 1) was performed on the 80 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>11 239)  60 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>8188)  50 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2130)  and 9 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1043) SNP chips (as defined above). Before imputation  the SNPs were filtered within chip by excluding SNPs with a call rate lower than 0.85  a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.001  and strong deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P<U+2009><<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). The low MAF threshold of 0.001 was used to allow for investigation of SNPs with a low MAF  but a MAF threshold of 0.01 was used to build the genomic relationship matrix. Genotypes of animals that had missing genotypes for more than 30% of SNPs were excluded and  to avoid outliers due to admixing of biological samples  genotypes of animals with a heterozygosity that deviated more than 3 times the interquartile distance from the mean heterozygosity of the breed were also excluded. Only SNPs located on the 18 autosomal chromosomes and that were present on the Illumina Porcine SNP50 Beadchip were included in the imputation. Imputation was performed using AlphaImpute []  which combines a heuristic approach and a hidden Markov model [] and which imputes all missing genotypes. After imputation  genotypes on 37 206 SNPs were available. For the Dutch Landrace  Dutch Large White animals and their F1 cross (dataset 2)  both male and female PB were genotyped  but in the F1 population  only females were genotyped (same procedure as in []). All these animals were genotyped using the 60 K SNP chip (as defined above). Quality control was done separately for each breed and consisted of excluding SNPs with a GenCall lower than 0.15  a call rate lower than 0.95  a MAF lower than 0.01  and strong deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P<U+2009><<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). SNPs located on sex chromosomes and unmapped SNPs were also excluded. All genotyped animals had a frequency of missing genotypes lower than 0.05 and were therefore kept for further analyses. After quality control  the remaining missing genotypes were imputed using Fimpute V2.2 [] and SNPs that did not segregate in all breeds for dataset 2 were excluded  leaving 36 778 SNPs that were common to all breeds for further analysis. For the synthetic sire line (dataset 3)  genotyping was performed using the 80 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>8134)  60 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>6360)  50 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>3245) or 10 K (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1738) SNP chip (as defined above). Quality control consisted of excluding SNPs with a GenCall lower than 0.15 (Illumina Inc.  2005)  a call rate lower than 0.95  a MAF lower than 0.02  strong deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P<U+2009><<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  SNPs located on sex chromosomes  and unmapped SNPs. All genotyped animals had a frequency of missing genotypes lower than 0.05 and were therefore kept for further analyses. After quality control  the remaining missing genotypes of the animals genotyped with the 80 K SNP chip were imputed using Fimpute V2.2 [] and animals genotyped with the 60 K  50 K and 10 K SNP chips had their genotypes imputed to the 80 K SNP chip. The final dataset consisted of genotypes on 41 208 SNPs from the 80 K SNP chip. The reason for using different parameters  SNP densities  and imputation software was due to practical and historical reasons. The SNP data were taken directly from routine genomic evaluations for different breeds in Topigs Norsvin  and different quality checks and imputation pipelines were developed before the merge of Topigs and Norsvin International in 2014. Since the SNP data was part of industrial routine genomic evaluations and different research projects  parameters were well tuned and optimized within each breed to maximize genetic gain. We are confident that the different SNP densities and the use of two different software (Alphaimpute and Fimpute) for imputation did not compromise our results because it has been shown that a small number of SNPs (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2000) can reproduce results obtained from higher SNP densities (60 K) [] in a GBLUP context and that both software result in similar imputation accuracies []. Heterozygosity was measured as the proportion of heterozygous marker genotypes for each individual. Thus  only genotyped individuals had a heterozygosity observation. Heterozygosity was also modelled within breed  when appropriate. Expected heterosis was used for the synthetic sire line and was calculated from the available pedigree. PB animals (Lines 1 and 2) were given an expected heterosis of 0%  F1 animals have an expected heterosis of 100%  and backcrosses have an expected heterosis of 50%  etc. Four models were compared across datasets. Model 1 (base model) was the model used in routine evaluations in Norsvin and Topigs Norsvin for each trait (see Additional file : Tables S1  S2  and S3). The models used in routine evaluations do not consider heterosis or inbreeding  and are breed-specific  but for dataset 3 considers line composition. For Models 2  3 and 4  heterozygosity  heterozygosity within breed  or expected heterosis was added as a fixed regression in addition to the original base model (Table ). Table  gives an overview of which models were used for each dataset. Fixed regressions cannot have missing values  so only genotyped animals were included  and consequently the models were used with GBLUP in the MiXBLUP software []. Regression coefficients on heterozygosity (and other heterozygosity factors) were extracted from the  and  files from MiXBLUP using all data within each dataset for each model. Standard errors for regression coefficients are not available from MiXBLUP. Therefore  models were re-run in DMU4 []. Due to limited capacity in DMU  dataset 1 was analysed only with single-trait models and dataset 3 was analysed only with pedigree  with five  four and four traits included in multiple trait models (grouped in the same order as in Table ). Thus  the standard errors obtained are not exact for the regression coefficients from MiXBLUP and results should be interpreted with caution. For dataset 2  it was still possible to run a multiple trait model with genomic information in DMU. To estimate the effect of heterozygosity on each trait in comparison to other traits  the regression coefficients for heterozygosity were divided by the phenotypic standard deviation for the traits. Models were also compared based on rank correlations of animals according to their estimated breeding value (EBV) for each model. To determine whether different animals were selected with different models  the correlation between the rank of the top 100 (validation) animals for one model with the rank of the same 100 animals for a second model were estimated in pairwise comparisons between models  i.e. the top 100 animals from Model 1 are not necessarily the same as the top 100 animals from Model 3. Thus  the correlation was estimated twice for each pairwise model comparison. Comparisons of models were performed with correlations between yield deviations (YD) and EBV. Predictive ability was calculated as:   where  is the (mean) yield deviation of the animal as estimated by MiXBLUP [] by each model   is the heterozygosity factor multiplied by its estimated regression coefficient  and  is the genomic EBV. The  part of the equation was included to make models comparable to the base model because  for Models 2  3 and 4 (Table )  it is removed from both  and EBV  i.e. fixed  non-genetic random  and regression effects (including heterozygosity effects) are subtracted from the phenotype to estimate  for these models  as shown in the following: where  is the phenotype for an animal   are fixed effects and covariates   is as defined above   is the non-genetic random effect   is the genomic estimated breeding value  and  is the residual. The  part of the equation was not included in the base model because it did not include heterozygosity effects. The 5000 youngest animals with both genotypes and phenotypes were used for validation for datasets 1 and 3. Because dataset 2 was too small  instead  two validation sets were created for each of the PB  and one for the CB  with 1000 animals each. For the first validation set  the 1000 youngest animals were removed from the training set. For the second validation set  these were added back to the training set  and the next 1000 animals were removed. This was done separately for each breed (the other breeds were still in the dataset). For the crossbreds  only one validation set was used (1000 youngest animals) due to the limited number of available animals. To test whether the models differed significantly in predictive ability  we used a bootstrap procedure [] for the correlation between  (+ ) and  (+ ) for each model. A pairwise comparison of  from two models at a time was performed to determine which of the two models predicted its  best by randomly sampling data point quadruplets with replacement: the  and their predictions () using two models. A total of 10 000 bootstrap samples were constructed for each pairwise comparison. The size of the input data for the bootstrap procedure was the same as for the validation sets. For each bootstrap sample  we determined for which model the  yielded a greater correlation with the  of that model. By counting the number of times one model had a higher correlation than the other  the two models were considered as significantly different if one of the models had a higher correlation in at least 97.5% of the bootstrap samples (tests at a P value of 5% due to the two-sided nature of the test). This is similar to bootstrapping methods used by others [  ]. Please note that part of the results from this study were presented at the 2018 World Congress of Genetics Applied to Livestock Production in Auckland  New Zealand []. These were the estimated regression coefficients for datasets 1 and 2 and prediction accuracies without indications on significant differences. There was  however  an error in prediction accuracies  which has been corrected in this paper. Descriptive statistics for the traits for the three datasets are in Table . Separate means per breed/line for datasets 2 and 3 are in Tables S4 and S5 (see Additional file : Tables S4 and S5). As expected  CB animals had a greater mean heterozygosity than the PB animals (Table )  but there were also differences between PB populations  with the Norwegian Landrace having the lowest heterozygosity. This was also expected since this population has been closed for a longer time than the other breeds. In addition  ascertainment biases when choosing the SNP assays for the variety of SNP chips used may have affected the observed heterozygosity for some of the breeds. However  variation in heterozygosity within populations was small  and similar between breeds. Across all breeds  heterozygosity at an individual level ranged from 0.18 to 0.46. For Norwegian Landrace  estimates of the regression coefficient on heterozygosity were in a favourable direction for all traits (i.e. the direction that the traits are selected for in the breeding program  Table )  i.e. an increase in heterozygosity is expected to change each trait in a favourable direction relative to the breeding goal and production economy. Some regression coefficient estimates were also substantial. For example  a 2.5% increase in heterozygosity was estimated to result in 0.4 more piglets born and a 1.07 kg heavier litter at 3 weeks. When dividing the regression coefficient estimates by the phenotypic standard deviation for the trait  it is possible to get an indication of the importance of heterozygosity across traits. For Norwegian Landrace (Table )  this indicated that heterozygosity had the largest effect for total number born  litter weight at 3 weeks  and body condition score of the sow at weaning. However  regression coefficient estimates were significantly different from 0 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) only for total number born and litter weight at 3 weeks. For total number born  estimates of regression coefficients (Table ) on heterozygosity were smaller for Dutch Landrace  Large White  and their F1 cross (dataset 2) than for Norwegian Landrace but they were always in a favourable direction. Estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity within breed (Hetbreed) differed a lot between breeds  and the estimates for crossbreds were closer to those for breed B than breed A for total number born and live born  but closer to those for breed A than breed B for gestation length. When comparing estimates of regression coefficients divided by phenotypic standard deviations for dataset 2  the effect of heterozygosity was largest for number of live born and gestation length (Table ) but the trait with the largest estimated effect of heterozygosity differed between breeds. For both breed B and the CB  the effect of heterozygosity was largest for live born  but for breed A the largest effect was for gestation length. All regression coefficient estimates were significantly different from zero (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) for Model 2  but for Model 3  only the estimate for gestation length was significant for breed A and only the estimates for total number of born and live born were significant for breed B. None of the regression coefficient estimates for the F1 were significantly different from zero. The across-breed regression coefficient estimates from Model 2 varied more than the within-breed coefficient estimates from Model 3  which probably resulted in greater power to find statistically significant results for Model 2. For the synthetic sire line (Table )  estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity were not in a favourable direction (relative to the breeding goal) for all traits. For example  on the one hand  LD100  DP  IMF  PHL  and DRIP (see legend of Table  for abbreviations) had regression coefficient estimates that were in the opposite direction to what would be desired for the trait. However  only the estimate for PHL was significantly different from zero. On the other hand  8 out of 13 traits had regression coefficient estimates that were in a favourable direction. Regression coefficient estimates differed between lines (Model 3)  especially for traits with few observations  but were generally in the same direction for both pure lines. Regression coefficient estimates on expected heterosis (Model 4) were small. Few of the regression coefficients were significantly different from zero (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). These were: W21  W150  A40  DTP  TFI  PHL  and LB1 for Model 2; W150  A40  DTP  TFI  and LB1 for Model 3 for Line 1; W21  W150  A40  DTP  and TFI for Model 3 for Line 2; and only W21 for Model 3 for the F1. For the backcross (Model 3) and for Model 4  none of the regression coefficient estimates were significantly different from zero. For the synthetic line  the traits that had the largest effect of heterozygosity (based on standardised regression coefficients) were W150  A40  and DTP (see Additional file : Table S6). The same traits had the largest effect of heterozygosity for Line 1 and Line 2 (Model 3)  although the size of the effect was not equal for these two lines. For the F1 and the backcross (Line 1 × F1)  there were too few animals to draw conclusions. For Norwegian Landrace  predictive ability increased significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) from the Base model when including heterozygosity for total number born and litter weight at 3 weeks  but there was little change for the other traits (Table ). For Dutch Landrace  Large White  and their F1 cross  the model that yielded the highest predictive ability varied between traits and breeds (Table ). Crossbreds benefitted little from including heterozygosity in the model and there were no significant differences (in prediction accuracy) between models. For Dutch Landrace  gestation length benefitted from including heterozygosity  both for Models 2 and 3. For Large White  all three traits had significantly better predictive ability when including heterozygosity compared to the Base model. Predictive ability from including Hetbreed (Model 3) did not differ much from the model with heterozygosity fitted across breeds (Model 2)  although significant differences between Models 2 and 3 were found for gestation length in Dutch Landrace. The Hetbreed model had a significantly lower predictive ability than the Base model for total number of born in Dutch Landrace. For the synthetic line (dataset 3)  the predictive ability significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) increased for six out of 13 traits when heterozygosity was in the model (Model 2) compared to the Base model (Table )  although the estimate of the regression coefficient on heterozygosity did not significantly differ from zero for one of these traits  DP. For two traits  TFI and LB1  the model with heterozygosity had significantly lower predictive ability than the Base model. Predictive abilities for Models 3 and 4 were heavily confounded with line origin and are  therefore  presented separately for each line combination (Line 1  Line 2 and F1) (Table ). The results for the backcross are not presented  since there were too few animals for reliable predictions. For Line 1  Model 3 had a significantly lower predictive ability than the Base model for W150 and A40  while for Line 2  Model 3 had greater predictive ability than the Base model for DTP  TFI  LMP  DP  PHL  and DRIP  but this was significant only for TFI. Compared to the Base model  Model 4 (Line 1) had a significantly higher predictive ability for BF100 but was significantly worse for W150 and TFI. Compared to Model 2  Model 4 had significantly lower predictive ability for W150 and A40 in Line 1  but was not significantly different for any trait for Line 2. However  Model 4 had significantly lower predictive ability than the Base model for W21 and W150 in Line 2. In the F1 cross  Model 4 was not significantly better than the Base model for any trait but had significantly lower predictive ability for LD100  A40  and TFI. Rank correlations differed between models and traits. For Norwegian Landrace  rank correlations of the top 100 selection candidates ranged from 0.79 to 0.83 when comparing Models 1 and 2 (results not shown). The greatest re-ranking was for total number born  litter weight at 3 weeks  and body condition score of the sow at weaning. For Dutch Landrace  Dutch Large White  and their F1 cross (dataset 2)  rank correlations between Models 1 and 2 ranged from 0.96 to 0.98  with gestation length having the least re-ranking. Between the Base model and Hetbreed  rank correlations ranged from 0.93 to 0.97  and between Models 2 and 3  rank correlations were 0.98 for all traits. For the synthetic line (dataset 3)  there was no re-ranking between the Base model and Model 4 (expected heterosis). Between the Base model and Model 2  rank correlations ranged from 0.72 to 1.00  with TFI and DTP having the lowest rank correlation  and no re-ranking for DP. Between Models 2 and 3  rank correlations ranged from 0.83 to 1.00  with TFI having the lowest rank correlation. This study investigated the effect of heterozygosity on traits in purebreds  crossbreds  and a synthetic breed. Results show that regression coefficients were large for some traits and for these traits  including heterozygosity in the model led to an increase in the accuracy of genomic prediction of genetic values. Estimates of regression coefficients on heterozygosity were large for some traits  such as total number born  litter weight at 3 weeks  weight at 150 days  age at 40 kg  days from 40 to 120 kg  and total feed intake (per 80 kg live weight gain). Theory suggests that heterozygosity has a large effect if the genes show directional dominance (or inbreeding) effects []. However  all traits under selection in livestock species can be affected by inbreeding depression []. For the traits with a favourable direction of the regression coefficient  heterosis and/or dominance effects are usually reported [    ]. These traits are also expected to be negatively affected by inbreeding  since inbreeding increases homozygosity [  ]. However  one study found no correlation between heterozygosity and (pedigree) inbreeding coefficients []  but this study used few markers to estimate heterozygosity and there was little variation in the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients that were used. In addition  genomic inbreeding coefficients would be more realistic to use  since they are based on actual genotypes and reflect the actual level of heterozygosity in the genome. For traits with unfavourable regression coefficient estimates (e.g. LD100  DP  IMF  PHL  and DRIP)  the estimates were generally small relative to the phenotypic standard deviation of the trait [see Additional file : Table S6] and of these  only PHL had an estimate that was significantly different from zero. We did not find any reported effects of dominance  heterosis  or inbreeding depression in the literature for the traits with unfavourable regression coefficient estimates on heterozygosity. Of the traits that were most affected by heterozygosity in the current study  dominance or heterosis effects have been reported for average daily gain  weight at various ages  gestation length  and litter weight [          ]. Negative effects of inbreeding have also been reported for daily gain  weight at 90 d  and litter size (total number of born and live born) [    ]. However  heterosis and dominance have also been reported for traits for which heterozygosity did not have a large effect in our study  such as backfat []  although others did not identify heterosis for backfat []. This discrepancy in results between studies could be due to an inconsistent sign of the dominance effects across genes  i.e. dominance effects not being directional across loci []. The sign of the regression coefficient estimates was generally in agreement with the effect of heterosis in other studies. For example  a positive effect of heterosis on litter weight at 14 days and at weaning []  and individual weight at all ages [] have been reported  which is in agreement with the sign of the regression coefficient estimates for LW3  W21 and W150. In addition  positive heterosis effects have been reported for average daily gain from birth to weaning  for birth weight  and for 200-day weight in cattle  and for birth weight  weaning weight  and post-weaning ADG in pigs [  ]  which agrees with the sign of the regression coefficient estimates for the weight traits and DTP in this study. High heterozygosity reduced feed intake (TFI) in the current study  which is in agreement with some studies []  although others [] found no effect of heterosis on feed efficiency. Cassady et al. [] found that direct heterosis decreased gestation length  which is in agreement with the estimate of the regression coefficient on heterozygosity for gestation length in the current study. However  older studies found no effect of heterosis on gestation length []. The trait that was most affected by heterozygosity differed between breeds (dataset 2); for Large White and the crossbreds  number of piglets born alive was most affected by heterozygosity  while for Dutch Landrace gestation length had the largest effect of heterozygosity. For all traits  the estimate of the regression coefficient for CB was closer to the estimate for the parental breed with the largest regression coefficient for PB. This may be due to lack of segregation of the relevant allele(s) for the trait in one breed  such that the CB regression coefficients are closer to those of the breed in which the allele(s) is segregating. However  only the SNPs that segregated in all breeds were used in the analysis. In addition  if heterozygosity does not have the same effect for all breeds  it may not be reasonable to expect the regression coefficients for CB to be the mean of the parental breeds. For the one trait that was the same between datasets 1 and 2  total number of born  estimates of within-breed regression coefficients differed between breeds (Norwegian Landrace  Dutch Landrace  Large White and crossbreds of the latter two). This indicates that heterozygosity does not have the same effect in all breeds  which is in agreement with studies that have found breed differences in dominance [  ] and inbreeding effects []. This suggests that Model 3 may be more appropriate than Model 2 when analysing multiple breeds. The above discussion  comparing the results of studies on heterosis [        ] and heterozygosity (this study) implies that heterozygosity does not always lead to heterosis. This is logical  because an individual that is heterozygous at loci that do not show directional dominance would not have any advantage over a homozygous individual. Directional dominance is necessary for both heterosis and for non-zero regression coefficients on heterozygosity. Thus  including heterozygosity in the model is expected to improve prediction only for traits for which directional dominance is present. However  there could be dominance effects for a trait without seeing an effect of heterozygosity  because genome-wide heterozygosity may not be a good estimate of dominance effects for traits that are affected by few SNPs or when most animals are homozygous at the relevant loci for the trait. Across the datasets  including heterozygosity in the model generally increased predictive ability for traits that had large regression coefficient estimates  with some exceptions [TFI  LB1 (predictive ability decreased for both despite high regression coefficient)  and DP in the synthetic line (predictive ability increased in spite of a small and non-significant regression coefficient)]. These exceptions may be an indication that including heterozygosity in the model may cause noise that results in lower prediction accuracy  although this could also be a result of the complex structure of the datasets used in this study. For dataset 2  there was little difference in predictive ability between the model with heterozygosity across breeds (Model 2) and the model with heterozygosity within breed (Model 3)  although the regression coefficient estimates differed between these two models. This suggests that using within-breed instead of across-breed regression coefficients does not consistently improve prediction accuracy. However  each breed had relatively few animals  which makes estimates of regression coefficients less accurate. Since the breeds had quite similar levels of heterozygosity  combining them into a single analysis (Model 2) may result in more accurate regression coefficient estimates  and thus more accurate prediction than within-breed estimates (Model 3). For CB (dataset 2)  including heterozygosity in the model did not significantly improve predictive ability  in contrast to previous studies that found that including inbreeding depression in the model increased predictive ability for total number born in crossbreds []. The lack of change in predictive ability between models for CB in the current study may be due to the low variation in heterozygosity within CB animals  which has a direct effect on prediction accuracy. However  variances in heterozygosity were also low in the other breeds analysed and they showed an effect on predictive ability of including heterozygosity in the model. One potential problem with predicting the genetic value of CB  is that there were very few CB animals in the training population when CB animals were in the validation set and  thus  they were mainly predicted based on PB data. In addition  the PB parents of the CB were very homogeneous in heterozygosity  which would make the CB homogeneous in heterozygosity as well  which limits increases in prediction accuracy from including heterozygosity in the model. For the synthetic line (dataset 3)  the interpretation of the comparison between models is a little complicated. For the Base model and for the heterozygosity model (columns 1 and 2 of Table )  the predictive ability is based on all validation animals from all lines  while the remaining columns are based on animals that belong to each of the lines (or crosses). However  the pairwise comparisons of predictive ability (denoted with superscript letters in Table ) are based on the subset of animals that belong to each line. This means that not all pairwise comparisons are logical based on the correlations presented. For example  for W150  the predictive ability was highest for Model 2  followed by Model 1 and Model 3 (Line 1). However  in the pairwise comparisons  the predictive ability of Model 2 was not significantly different from that of Model 3 but the predictive ability of both Models 2 and 3 was significantly different from that of Model 1. This can be explained by the fact that the correlations for Models 1 and 2 were based on the entire validation set (across lines)  while the correlation for Model 3 (Line 1) was based on validation animals from only one line. Focusing on the subset of Line 1 animals only  Models 2 and 3 showed nearly identical predictive ability (results not shown)  while Model 1 had a slightly lower predictive ability. The same phenomenon as described above is observed also for the other pairwise comparisons within line in the table. A low rank correlation indicates more re-ranking of the top animals  which means that the choice of model affects which animals are selected  and indicates that there is an effect of heterozygosity for the trait. The traits with the most re-ranking between Models 1 and 2 across datasets were TNB  LW3  BCS  TFI  and DTP. These traits also had relatively high regression coefficients on heterozygosity. However  prediction accuracy for TFI decreased significantly when including heterozygosity  which suggests that the re-ranking is not necessarily a result of more accurate prediction. That is  re-ranking may occur also if the predictive ability of the “new” model that is being tested is significantly lower than the predictive ability of the existing model (e.g. Base model). For dataset 2  there was little re-ranking between Models 1 and 2. The rank correlations between Models 1 and 3 were somewhat lower than between Models 1 and 2  which indicates that Model 3 had a larger effect than Model 2 on the ranking of the animals when compared to Model 1. Since the predictive ability for Models 2 and 3 were not that different  this may suggest a larger effect of heterozygosity on variation in EBV within breed than between breeds  which leads to re-ranking of animals. However  this was not reflected by significant differences in predictive ability between the models for most traits. In general  re-ranking is only of interest if accuracy improves  as this can inform the decision on whether to implement a new model or not. A small increase in accuracy that does not result in selection of different animals (no re-ranking) may indicate that the gain from the new model is not large enough to justify implementation. Implementing the use of heterozygosity in the model when all animals are genotyped should be straightforward with GBLUP  SNP-BLUP and Bayes-type methods []. However  most commercial pig breeding companies use single-step (ss-)GBLUP in their breeding programs because not all animals are genotyped. It is more difficult to include heterozygosity in ssGBLUP  because heterozygosity is not available for ungenotyped animals and missing values are not permitted for fixed regressions. Thus  heterozygosity would need to be estimated for ungenotyped animals by segregation analysis []. Alternatively  inbreeding coefficients can be estimated from the diagonal of the -matrix  i.e. the combined genomic and pedigree relationship matrix []. Since genomic inbreeding is very closely related to heterozygosity  this would be an alternative measure to include in the model. In addition to including heterozygosity in the model for the estimation of breeding values (as investigated in this study)  heterozygosity also has the potential to be used in mate selection in order to maximize heterozygosity in the offspring []. This could be achieved by selecting parents that are opposite homozygotes for either as many loci as possible or for the relevant alleles for the trait of interest. This could increase performance of offspring for traits that show a positive effect of heterozygosity  such as litter weight  total number born  weight at 150 days and age at 40 kg. An alternative when producing crossbreds would be to select PB lines with different allele frequencies to maximize heterozygosity in the CB. Our findings should be applicable also to other species for traits that show dominance effects  since inbreeding depression is not specific to species  but rather to a population or a breed []. However  it is unlikely that inclusion of heterozygosity is useful for traits that do not show any dominance effects. In livestock production sectors that use crossbreeding  such as for pigs  poultry  and beef cattle  it is necessary to quantify the effect of heterozygosity in order to justify crossbreeding directed at increasing heterozygosity. Even without an effect of heterozygosity  breed complementarity is an important reason for crossbreeding. In addition  it is useful to know whether the effects of heterozygosity are breed-specific in order to direct breed choice in crossbreeding systems. For production sectors that generally do not use crossbreeding  such as dairy cattle and aquaculture  it would be useful to quantify the effect of heterozygosity in order to evaluate how much is gained by setting-up a systematic crossbreeding-based production system. Some traits showed large effects of heterozygosity on the phenotype  which is in agreement with other studies that have found heterosis and/or dominance effects for these traits. In addition  for maternal traits  the sign of the regression coefficients for heterozygosity indicated a favourable effect of heterozygosity for these traits  whereas for production  meat and slaughter quality traits  this pattern was less clear  possibly because of the complex data structure. Including heterozygosity in the model for genetic evaluation increased the prediction accuracy for traits that showed the largest effect of heterozygosity and  overall  maternal traits benefitted more than production  meat quality  and slaughter quality traits. Different animals would be selected if heterozygosity was included in the model for these traits. In conclusion  it is beneficial to include heterozygosity in the genomic prediction model for traits that show dominance. It is also possible to use heterozygosity for mate planning in order to benefit from more heterozygous offspring. Falconer DS  Mackay T. Introduction to quantitative genetics. 4th ed.

Quantifying differences in additive genetic variance within and among populations is of major biological interest in ecology  evolution  and animal and plant breeding. The proposed method allows to estimate such differences for subpopulations that form a connected set of populations  and may thus also be useful to study temporal or spatial variation of additive genetic variances. Quantifying the (causal) relationships between genes and observed phenotypic traits is a central task of empirical studies of adaptive evolution [  ] and of plant and animal breeding []. The  [  ] has become a popular statistical approach to disentangle genetic effects on a phenotype from other factors that may induce phenotypic similarities among relatives  such as shared environmental effects []  inbreeding []  or individual traits such as age or sex [  ]. Fundamental to the animal model is information on how animals are related to each other  information typically obtained from pedigree data [  ]  from genomic data (e.g.[  ])  or a combination of both []. Pedigrees are still the most commonly used source of relatedness information in animal models (e.g. [  ])  in part because the use of pedigrees leads to models that are computationally efficient. All pedigrees necessarily start with a founder generation of individuals with unknown parents  so-called ‘phantom parents’ []. The animal model assumes that all founder individuals stem from a single  genetically homogeneous baseline population  and that the model estimates additive genetic variance (denoted as ) of the respective base population. When the homogeneity assumption is violated  for example in the presence of immigrants from another population or in crossbred livestock breeds  estimates of  may be biased [  ]. To address this problem  animal breeders developed animal models with genetic groups  briefly denoted as  (e.g. [])  and these are now also receiving attention in evolutionary ecology [    ]. The main idea behind genetic group models is that accounting for differences in mean breeding values may reduce or eliminate the bias []. However  current genetic group models have an important key limitation: genetic groups are allowed to differ in mean breeding value  but are assumed to have the same additive genetic variance. This homogeneity assumption is violated in some animal breeding applications [  ]  and is likely also violated in many natural populations  where source populations of immigrants may differ in additive genetic variance  for example due to differences in effective population size (genetic drift) and selection regimes (e.g. [  ]). In fact  different populations or ecotypes within the same species have been found to differ in their additive genetic (co)variances in plants (e.g. [])  invertebrates (e.g. [])  and vertebrates (e.g. []). Because additive genetic variances determine the evolutionary potential of phenotypic traits [  ]  and because of the fundamental importance of understanding the processes that shape additive genetic variances  as well as the consequences that selection will have on the rate and direction of evolution within and across populations  it is essential to be able to estimate the additive genetic variance of each baseline population in the presence of interbreeding genetic groups. Aiming for better predictions of breeding values in crossbred populations  animal breeders have suggested approaches that account for heterogeneous additive genetic variances across genetic groups [    ]. One drawback of these models is that they rapidly become unfeasibly complex  because variability of the genetic values must now be split into components from the pure breeds  components due to segregation terms when breeds are mixed  which requires that the respective segregation variance terms enter the model. Segregation variance refers to the increase in variance caused by differences in allele combinations  average allelic effects  and linkage disequilibrium at and between loci underlying the phenotype in the mixing breeds  as in  and  generations of line crosses [  ]. The respective terms can be large in crossbreeding applications [  p. 11]. However  as we explain in detail below  we expect the segregation variance from crossing different genetic groups in wild study populations to be small for many traits of interest  so that omitting it from the animal model does not lead to significant bias. Thus  here we use the simplified models without segregation terms to derive genetic group models that allow for group-specific additive genetic variances. In order to properly consider each individual’s genetic contribution to the actual population  we additively split the breeding value of each individual into group-specific components  similar to the approach suggested by García-Cortes and Toro []. For each group  the components that stem from the same genetic group covary according to a group-specific relatedness matrix. The main challenge is to find these matrices. Instead of implementing a recursive procedure to calculate the inverse of the additive genetic covariance matrix [  ]  we propose to derive group-specific relatedness matrices by first decomposing the full relatedness matrix (disregarding genetic groups) via a generalized Cholesky decomposition (as described by [])  and then appropriately scaling the respective matrix components for each group. This procedure has the advantage that we can use the same mathematical approach that Henderson and Quaas developed to decompose a single population’s relationship matrix [  ]. Moreover  by incorporating multiple inverse relatedness matrices into a single mixed model  existing algorithms for the analysis of single populations can easily be extended to genetic group animal models with group-specific additive genetic variances. In the following  we first summarize the current state of genetic group models and then give a detailed description of the extension to heterogeneous group-specific additive genetic variances. We illustrate the performance of our method with a simulation study and an application to a meta-population of house sparrows () in Norway  where genetic groups are determined by geographical properties of the bird’s natal island population. By also fitting a model that includes a segregation term to the sparrow data  we illustrate that omitting segregation variances is unproblematic in such applications. We also provide a short tutorial including  code for the analysis  and discuss opportunities and limitations of our extended genetic group model. The basic animal model for a phenotypic measurement  of an individual  () is with population mean   environmental component  with environmental variance   and breeding values distributed as  with additive genetic variance  and additive genetic relatedness matrix  that represents the relatedness among individuals [  ]. Model () is often extended by fixed effects (such as sex or age) and by additional random effects that account for permanent environmental conditions (see e.g. []). In all cases  the underlying assumption is that all animals in the analysis derive from the same genetic population  and that the breeding values () encode for the deviation from the mean of this population and thus have a mean of zero. As noted by animal breeders a long time ago  these assumptions are frequently violated  for example in crossbred populations from genetically differentiated breeds. In such cases it is necessary to allow for differences in mean breeding values among animals with different genetic origins [  ]  as otherwise the prediction of breeding values or the estimates of the base populations’ additive genetic variances are biased. Let us denote by a founder population a set of animals with unknown true parents  whose phantom parents comprise the base population  and assume that  base populations exist  where each of them corresponds to a different genetic group. When animals from different genetic groups mate  their genetic contributions are propagated through the pedigree following the Mendelian rules of inheritance. Offspring in later generations thus inherit different proportions of the genome from the genetic groups. Denote by  the expected proportional contribution of base population  to the genome of individual . The respective values can be calculated from the pedigree and are typically written into a matrix  with  rows ( = number of animals) and  columns  such that  is the value in the th row and th column (see e.g. Fig. 3 in ref. []). Following the notation from Wolak and Reid []  and denoting by  the average genetic effect in group   the basic animal model () can be extended to where the total additive genetic effect of individual  is given as   that is  the weighted sum of genetic group-mean effects  plus the breeding value  of the individual that accounts for deviations from the weighted group mean. Note that in model () the  values play the role of known covariate values (they must be derived from the pedigree before the model is fitted)  and the group-specific means  are the parameters to be estimated. This model is over-parameterized because for each  the contributions from the  groups sum up to 1  that is  . Similar to ANOVA models or when categorical variables are included in regression models  the parameters become identifiable when one group is set as reference group (e.g. assuming )  or when additional constraints are added  such as . Let us illustrate the idea for two genetic groups. When using the convenient constraint   phenotypes of animals that have ancestors either only from group 1 (i.e. ) or only from group 2 (i.e. ) can be described by the following models Thus  members of genetic group 1 have a total additive genetic effect of  and members of genetic group 2 have   where  estimates the difference between the mean breeding values of the groups. Therefore  the respective  values are distributed around an overall mean of 0 and   respectively  but with the same  and relatedness matrix . Note that  while the main benefit of including group-specific means is that bias in the estimates of  is reduced  the estimated values (e.g. of ) may sometimes be of interest themselves  as was pointed out previously [  ]. The key limitation of the genetic group model () is that the base populations of all genetic groups are assumed to have the same additive genetic variance  and animal breeders have therefore suggested extensions that allow additive genetic variance to differ among groups  e.g. [    ]. However  these methods quickly become computationally demanding because the respective models include terms to account for the segregation variance between any two genetic groups  thus  segregation variances in the presence of  genetic groups. The magnitude of these variances may be considerable in artificial breeding scenarios  for example when crossing genetically differentiated pure-bred lines (see e.g. [  Table 3])  and if a trait is determined by one or only a few loci. To understand why  let us start by looking at a hypothetical trait that is determined by  loci. The segregation variance between two genetic groups (e.g. breeds) can be computed as: [  equation 9.15]  where  denotes the mean additive genetic difference between the groups due to locus . In an extreme example where only one locus determines a trait value  and where two populations or breeds differ in their mean breeding value by  say    the segregation variance expected in a cross between these breeds is then given as . However  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that complex (continuous) traits are mostly polygenic  thus the additive genetic component is not determined by a single locus (e.g. [   ]). In fact  it is a fundamental assumption of quantitative genetics that phenotypic traits are determined by many genes that each contribute a small effect to trait variation  known as the “infinitesimal model” [  ]. If  for example  100 loci each contribute the same proportion of 1/100 to the overall group difference of 1 in the above example  the segregation variance reduces to which is exactly 1/100 of the segregational variance for a single-locus trait. Thus for any number of loci   the segregation variance is 1 /  of what it would be for a single locus  given that each locus contributes the same proportion of the effect. Even when considering that the locus-specific effect sizes are typically heterogeneous  the most influential loci often only explain a small proportion of the phenotypic variance [  ]. Consequently  the segregation variance  for complex continuous traits is expected to be small compared to the total phenotypic variance in many study systems []. Thus  in the following extension of the animal model  we ignore the segregation variance  and illustrate in our application to the house sparrows that omitting it from the animal model is indeed not critical. To allow the animal model to account for potentially heterogeneous additive genetic variances of different base populations  we extend model () that accounts for group-specific means  by splitting the breeding value  of each individual  into group-specific contributions  similar to []  such that with  for all groups   where  is the additive genetic variance in group   and  is a group-specific relatedness matrix. We denote  as the   because it represents the contribution to the breeding value of individual  that is inherited from group . Consequently   contains the relatedness at the genes that have come from that group for each pair of individuals. We assume that the contributions  of the same individual  are independent of each other  because they differ in genetic origin. Importantly  while the proportion of founder genomes  are known quantities from the pedigree  the partial breeding values  are unknown and must be estimated  which is possible thanks to differences between the  matrices. In practice  model () may also include fixed effects  like sex or age. We note that the model could easily be extended further to allow for group- or birthplace-specific residual variances  or for group-specific dependencies of the phenotype on fixed effects  namely when the respective effects are expected to differ between environments or genetic groups. We illustrate the idea of model () by again using two genetic groups and assuming  for identifiability reasons. Animals in genetic group 1 (i.e. ) then have a total additive genetic effect  and animals in genetic group 2 (i.e. ) have   whereas the breeding values are distributed as While it is relatively straightforward to formulate such a model  it is less obvious what the group-specific relatedness matrices  are. It is  for example  not valid to use  for   because the within-group relatedness structure is different from the overall relatedness. In addition  the breeding values are now split into the sum   thus   and  equals  only if an animal has  for group . On the other hand   if the animal’s genome contains no contribution from the respective group  (thus if ). We now turn to the issue of how to obtain the  matrices.  To understand how to specify the group-specific relatedness matrices   we will first need to look a little bit deeper into the technical details of how (inverse) relatedness matrices can be efficiently computed. We recall the mathematical approach that Henderson and Quaas proposed to decompose a single population’s relationship matrix  [  ]  because by understanding the principle  we can derive the group-specific matrices. Henderson and Quaas suggested to decompose  by a  into where  is lower triangular matrix with transposed   and  is a diagonal matrix with entries . A useful property of the decomposition () is that the matrices  and  have elegant interpretations:  traces the flow of alleles from one generation to the other  and the diagonal entries of  scale the Mendelian sampling variance [  p. 27]. Let us illustrate these properties with an example that we adapted from Mrode [  Table 2.1]  starting without genetic groups. The pedigree is given in Fig. a  with a corresponding graphical representation of parent-offspring relations (Fig. b) and matrices    and  (Fig. c–e)  where the generalized Cholesky decomposition to obtain  and  was calculated with the function  that is available in the  package in  [  ]. In this example  animals 1  2 and 3 have phantom parents and are denoted as  of the population. Each off-diagonal entry in  corresponds to the relatedness coefficient (expected relatedness) of individuals with their direct descendants (i.e. children  grandchildren etc.)  where columns represent ancestors and rows descendants. For example  individual 1 is the parent of animals 4 and 5  thus the entries (4 1) and (5 1) in the matrix are 0.5. In addition  animal 6 is the offspring of animals 4 and 5  thus the relatedness of 1 with 6 is also 0.5. Finally  the relatedness of 1 and 7 is 0.25. These considerations can be repeated for each column in the matrix  where all diagonal elements are 1 and all elements below the diagonal in the respective column correspond to the  proportion of the genome that is transmitted from the respective ancestor to its direct descendants. Pedigree example  adapted from Table 2.1 in [] (). Graphical representation of the pedigree () with the corresponding relatedness matrix  (). The matrices from the decomposition  for the genetic groups described in the text are given in () and (). In the genetic group example  animals 1 and 2 are founders of genetic group 1  and animal 3 of genetic group 2 On the other hand  the diagonal entry  for animal  in  is calculated as where    and  are the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients of the known parent(s) [  p. 28]. We do not index the inbreeding coefficients with the animal identity () purely for notational simplicity. For later use we note that  in the absence of inbreeding  the diagonal entry is   with  corresponding to the proportion of ’s parental genome that is known. Possible values are  or 1 if no  one or two parents are known  respectively. This can be understood as follows: if  for example  one parent of an animal  is unknown  its predicted breeding value is 0.5 times the breeding value of the known parent  but the other half of its breeding value is unknown. The deviation from the predicted breeding value that could be obtained if both parents were known is absorbed by the Mendelian sampling deviation. The respective variance thus contains the Mendelian sampling variance  a variance that is due to the unknown parent []. The more parents are unknown  the larger is this variance.  In the presence of genetic groups  each phantom (i.e. unknown) parent of an observed animal is assigned to one of the groups  and expected proportions of individual’s genomes that originate from the respective genetic groups can be calculated from the pedigree [  ]. For simplicity  we again consider the case with two groups  and denote by  and  the respective relatedness matrices. These can be decomposed in the same way as  into: with matrices  and  describing the transmission of alleles through the generations  and Mendelian sampling variance matrices  and . The generalization to more than two groups is straightforward. Let us assume in the pedigree example of Fig.  that the phantom parents of founder animals 1 and 2 belong to genetic group 1  and the phantom parents of animal 3 to genetic group 2. This leads to proportional contributions of each genetic group to the genomes of the descending individuals as given by the matrix  (Fig. a)  with column vectors  and  that contain the respective proportions of genetic origin from groups 1 and 2 for each individual. The transmission of alleles within each group is represented by the matrices  (). They are designed such that animals with a certain proportion of genetic origin can only pass on the respective fraction of alleles. This means  for example  that an animal  with  passes only a proportion of 0.25 (and not 0.5) of alleles to its offspring as part of genetic group 1  while another expected proportion of 0.25 is passed on to its offspring within group 2. The matrices  are thus obtained by scaling the respective entries in  by the respective group-proportions. This is achieved by multiplying each row of  by  or  equivalently  by where  denotes a diagonal matrix with diagonal equal to . The matrices  and  for our example are given in Fig. b  c. Note that the diagonal of  corresponds to   which is the respective expected fraction of the genome that belongs to group   and all entries in the respective column are scaled (i.e. multiplied) with that same value. Animal 5  for example  has   thus the fifth column in  is multiplied by 0.5 to obtain the respective column in . Genetic group matrix  ()  and  matrices (  ) for the pedigree example. Group-specific proportions of the genome are stored in the  matrix. The columns of  can be used to derive the group-wise matrices  and  by appropriate multiplication with  Next  we need to find appropriate versions of  and . We noted in the previous subsection that  in the absence of inbreeding   with  representing the proportion of the ancestral genome that is known. To calculate the respective entries  and  in the group-specific matrices  we have to multiply  by the proportions of genetic origin  and   because the respective product then corresponds to the ancestral proportions that are known  the respective group. In the case where only one parent is known  multiplication must be with the genetic proportion of the known parent  denoted here as   because only this respective part of the ancestral genome within group  is then known. This leads to: Let us now also account for inbreeding  which may influence  for individuals with at least one parent known. Starting with animals that have both parents known  and rearranging the entries  in the original matrix   leads to The knowledge of  for each animal is useful to derive the entries  for group  in the presence of inbreeding. By scaling the effect of inbreeding with the group-specific proportions  of an animal’s genome  the entries are given as: where the third line is an algebraic simplification of the second line. The same calculation for animals with only one parent known  using  and solving for   leads to the same formula with  replaced by  from the known parent. Finally  if both parents are unknown (i.e. for )  the formula also leads to the correct value of . Applying formula () to the above pedigree example yields  and  (Fig. a  b). Group-specific matrices  and  for the example pedigree  derived using the approximation of Eq. () Formula () is simple and convenient. However  it provides only an approximation of the correct matrix entries  because in () we assumed that parental inbreeding can simply be scaled by the genetic group proportions  (for two known parents) or  (for one known parent). Instead  the theoretically correct way to deal with parental inbreeding coefficients to derive  would be to use the actual  (i.e. group-specific) parental inbreeding coefficients  denoted e.g. as  or  for parents  and . These group-specific inbreeding coefficients contain only the inbreeding that emerges due to inbreeding    that is  they measure the probability that an individual is identical by descent for an allele that descended from founders within group  []. The correct way to calculate  is thus given by: Obviously  this formula requires the calculation of group-specific inbreeding coefficients  which is computationally cumbersome. One way to obtain these coefficients is by first calculating -specific inbreeding coefficients that partition the total inbreeding coefficient  into the additive components  from each founder animal   as proposed by Lacy et al. []. Because partial contributions for all founders sum up to  (e.g. [  ])  we can sum only over founders from genetic group  to obtain group-specific inbreeding coefficients . Let us illustrate the difference between the approximate method suggested in Eq. () and the correct formula for  given in Eq. () for our example from Fig. . Animal 6 is the only parent in the pedigree with a non-zero inbreeding coefficient  which is . However  because animals 1 and 2 are founders of group 1 and animal 3 is a founder of group 2  the pedigree reveals that inbreeding originates only from matings within group 1. Therefore   is split into group-specific inbreeding coefficients as  and . By plugging these values into Eq. () to estimate the respective values for animal 7 (which is the only animal that is affected by this change)  we obtain  and   which are quite close to the approximate values  and  from Fig. a  b. Note that  in this paper  we will continue to use the convenient and computationally efficient approximation of Eq. () to scale the entries in   but we will illustrate the consequences of this approximation in Additional file .  Once the components  and  for each group  are known  a simple matrix multiplication yields the group-specific relatedness matrices . Remembering that    with entries derived from Eqs. () or ()  and that the product of diagonal matrices is obtained by component-wise multiplication of the diagonal entries  this expression can be simplified to with  representing the diagonal matrix with entries  for . Consequently  the population-specific  can be used for each group  and we only need to calculate the group-specific diagonal elements of  to derive  for each group . The  matrices for the two groups considered in our example are given in Fig. . An important aspect is that both  and  contain columns and rows with all variances and covariances equal to zero  namely for animals  without a contribution from group  (). While this is theoretically correct  because the respective breeding value is then   the resulting matrices are singular. When it comes to implementation  the problem can be solved by replacing zeros on the diagonal by very small values  for example  or even . The choice is not critical in our experience  but for deeper pedigrees we recommend smaller values  because the relatedness of the most distant relatives in the pedigree may then also become very small. In any case  it would be prudent to check the robustness of the results to different values. Group-specific relatedness matrices for the example pedigree with entries rounded to two digits  In practice  it is usually the inverse relatedness matrix  not   that is required to fit the models  thus  is typically calculated and stored directly from the pedigree. Consequently  we also need to derive the inverse group-specific matrices . From Eq. () it follows that the inverse of  can be decomposed into   where . Using Eq. ()  we see that thus it is sufficient to derive  and  directly from the pedigree  and to calculate  with diagonal entries  for each group (see Additional file  for a coded  example). Alternatively  if  is already known   and  can be obtained from a generalized Cholesky decomposition  although this might be computationally less convenient. Again  entries with  are replaced by very small values  e.g.   to avoid singularities. To illustrate the performance of genetic group models with group-specific additive genetic variances  we simulated data using the  function from the  package  []. The function allows the generation of pedigrees and phenotypes for a focal population (group 1) that receives a specified number of immigrants from another population in each generation (group 2). Group-specific mean breeding values and additive genetic variances can be set by the user  and breeding values for the founder animals of both genetic groups are sampled from the respective distributions. Offspring breeding values are calculated from the parental mean  plus a Mendelian sampling deviation that depends on the additive genetic variance of the resident population  but there is no additional term that induces a segregation variance (for more details see []). The simulation assumes random mating among individuals that currently live in the same population  thus offspring may inherit genetic components from both genetic groups due to immigration. The contributions  from group  for animal  were calculated with the  function from the  package. For data generated with group-specific mean breeding values and additive genetic variances  the appropriate underlying model for the analysis is: where we used the same notation as in Eq. () and fixed the focal group mean  for identifiability reasons [thus the term  is omitted from Eq. ()]. We simulated data according to three different scenarios  but always setting the population mean   group means     group-specific additive genetic variances  and  and residual variance . Each scenario encompassed 10 non-overlapping generations.  The carrying capacity of the population was set to 300 individuals. In each generation  100 mating pairs were created by random sampling with replacement from the adults  and each pair contributed 4 offspring to the next generation. In addition  30 immigrants were added to the focal population in each (except the first) generation. Finally  a subset of the offspring was randomly selected such that the population size always corresponded exactly to its carrying capacity.  This scenario was the same as scenario 1  except that only 5 (instead of 30) immigrants were allowed in each of the non-overlapping generations  so that animals of the immigrant group were rare.  In this scenario we used the same carrying capacity as above  20 immigrants per generation  but we only allowed for 5 breeding pairs per generation that produced 60 offspring each. While this scenario has an immigration rate that lies between scenarios 1 and 2  the small number of breeding pairs induces higher inbreeding levels. This scenario is therefore suitable to illustrate the consequence of using approximation () to scale the group-specific Mendelian sampling variance matrices   because the approximation affects the scaling of parental inbreeding coefficients and is thus most relevant in the presence of inbreeding. For each scenario  we generated 100 datasets  and each of them was analyzed with the genetic group animal model that accounted for heterogeneous additive genetic variances  and   as given in Eq. (). In addition  we compared the results to the outcome of the standard genetic groups model that allowed for different mean breeding values  but only a single (homogeneous) variance in both groups  given as: For scenario 3 we also investigated how close the group-specific Mendelian sampling variance approximations for  from Eq. () are in comparison to the correct version given in Eq. (). The group-specific inbreeding coefficients present in the correct formula were calculated with the software  [] (details are given in Additional file ). Correlation coefficients  between the (correct)  values from Eq. () and the approximated values from formula () were calculated  and all simulations were analyzed with both versions for comparison. Following the recommendation by He and Hodges []  we stored posterior modes (and not posterior means) of the variance components in each iteration. All models were fitted with integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA  version from June 20  2017) using the  interface   which provides a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC []  although it has so far only rarely been used for animal models (but see e.g. [  ]). All variance components were given penalized complexity (PC) priors []  which were suggested as robust alternatives to the popular but criticized gamma priors []. The  prior has an intuitive parameterization: The prior probability for the standard deviation  is given as  (with ). More information and plots that compare various gamma to PC priors can be found in Additional file . Here we used  priors for all variances (thus  )  but results were insensitive to this choice. All fixed effect parameters were assigned independent  priors. A short tutorial including  code to generate and analyze data using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and MCMCglmm [] for the models used here can be found in Additional file . Estimates from model () with correctly specified heterogeneous group variances were close to the variances used to generate the data in scenarios 1 and 3  while the model estimates in scenario 2 suffer from large uncertainty (Fig.   left). In particular the variance  of the underrepresented immigrant population in scenario 2 was difficult to identify and biased towards  (Fig. c). Thus  the results indicate that the genetic group model () is able to isolate approximately correct group-specific additive genetic variances  but that some caution is required if representatives of a genetic group are rare in the dataset. When the data were analyzed with the genetic group model () that included a single variance   the variance estimate usually laid between the two simulated group-specific variances (Fig.   right). In the presence of only few immigrants  the estimate tended to be close to  (scenario 2)  while more immigration (scenarios 1 and 3) caused the estimate of  to be intermediate between  and   although still closer to . This is as expected  and illustrates that genetic group models with a single  homogeneous variance will estimate a value in between the true group-specific additive genetic variances  with a tendency towards the variance of the more numerous group. These patterns were qualitatively similar when the additive genetic variances of the immigrant and resident population were switched  such that residents had larger additive genetic variance than immigrants (results not shown). Results from 100 iterations for simulation scenarios 1–3. The boxplots represent the distributions of estimated variances (posterior modes) from a model with genetic groups and heterogeneous additive genetic variances  and  (left panel)  compared to the results from a model that only allowed for a single homogeneous variance  (right panel). Dashed lines indicate the reference values that were used to generate the data (black:   red:   green: ) Simulation scenario 3 led to datasets with a mean inbreeding coefficient of . Interestingly  the comparison between the approximate versus the correct values in the  and  matrices shows that the approximation suggested in Eq. () leads to  values that are highly correlated with the correct values from Eq. (). As an example  we found correlation coefficients  in three randomly selected simulation runs. In addition  using the correct  matrices led to distributions of estimated variances that are indistinguishable from the results when the approximations were used (see Additional file : Figures S1 and S2 ). As a proof of concept  we applied our method to empirical data from a long-term study of an insular house sparrow meta-population off the Helgeland coast in northern Norway. The study has been running continuously since 1993  and is used as a model system to examine ecological and evolutionary processes in fragmented vertebrate populations  e.g. [  ]. The islands in the meta-population differ in characteristics related to environmental conditions  habitat type and population size  with considerably larger and more stable populations on the five islands that are located closer to the mainland (denoted as  islands) compared to the three islands located further away (denoted as  islands). The ten remaining islands are summarized as  islands (see in Additional file : Figure S4 for an overview of the island system). Small blood samples were collected from all captured birds on the eight inner and outer islands to provide DNA for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping on a 200K SNP array  see []. Only successfully genotyped birds that were also measured for body mass and/or wing length were included in our animal model analyses. For inner and other islands  the dataset included phenotypic measurements taken during the breeding seasons since 1993 and 1995  respectively. Due to strong population bottlenecks on the outer islands in 2000 []  only measurements taken since 2002 were used for the populations in the outer group. Details on how morphological measurements of wing length and body mass were obtained on adult birds are given by e.g. [  ]. Parentage analyses for the eight island populations in this study were carried out with the  package  []. Briefly  SNP genotype data of all adults recorded as present on any of the eight inner or outer islands during the years 1998-2013 (the inner group) or 2003-2013 (the outer group) were used in the parentage analyses. This resulted in a “meta-population pedigree” () spanning up to 14 generations (Niskanen et al.  personal communication)  where both parents were known for 52.7%  one parent was known for 25.0%  and no parent was known for 22.3% of the individuals. Since  introduces  to preserve known relationships  e.g. sibling relationships  even when parents are not genotyped  a higher percentage of individuals had “known” parentages (81.0%  5.5% and 13.5% with two  one or no parents known  respectively). The genetic group analysis that we carry out here requires that each unknown (i.e. phantom) parent must be assigned to one of the base populations  that is  we must attribute phantom parents to the    or  island group to determine their genetic origin. This was done here by first identifying the natal (hatch) island of all individuals  either from ecological data or  if unavailable  by using genetic assignment procedures based on the SNP genotype data (Saatoglu et al.  personal communication). Of all individuals in our dataset  2012  640  and 93 individuals were assigned to a natal island in the inner  outer and other group  respectively. This information was then used to assign phantom parents to the genetic group to which the hatch island of the respective individual belonged. As an example  if an individual with phantom parents is known to be born on one of the inner islands  the respective phantom parents were assumed to belong to the base population of the inner island group  and so on. The relatively high connectivity of the local pedigrees on the islands  with a total of 22.5% migrants between islands  and 8.9% migrants between the island groups (i.e. between inner  outer and other islands  Saatoglu et al.  personal communication)  helps minimizing bias due to common environment effects in our analyses. Finally  because inbreeding depression is known to occur in our study system []  we accounted for any inbreeding effects on body mass and wing length by including each individual’s genomic inbreeding coefficient  [  ] as a covariate in all models fitted here. With all phantom parents assigned to one of the genetic groups (    )  each individual  obtained expected proportions of genetic origin  from the three groups  by propagating the founder individual’s genome through the pedigree using the  function. Note that the different groups are very unequal in sample size  which can be seen from the summation of genetic proportions over all animals within a group   that is    which corresponds to equivalents of full animal genomes (Table ). This is not surprising given the smaller population sizes []  lower recapture rates []  and shorter time-series for populations in the outer island group  and considering that there were no systematic genotyping efforts on the other islands. Thus  we only see genomes from the other islands if they were introduced via immigration events to one of the inner or outer islands. For the two traits investigated here  mass (in g) and wing length (in mm)  we fitted separate models that accounted for sex (0 = males  1 = females)  inbreeding ()  month of measurement (numeric with values 5  6  7  and 8) and age (in years) as fixed effects that were stored in matrix . Furthermore  current island of residence where the measurement was taken ()  hatch year ()  animal () and an independent residual term () were included as random factors. An individual  was included in the model if it had at least one recorded observation  of the respective trait. The model with group-specific mean and variances of the breeding values is thus given as: where the total genetic contribution  is the sum of the weighted means  and the variability from the different genetic groups  as introduced in Eq. ()  and  is the vector of fixed effects. The three genetic groups    and  are encoded as groups 1  2 and 3  respectively  where the mean of the inner group was set to  for identifiability reasons. Thus  the estimates  and  reflect differences in group means with respect to the inner populations. The components    and  are distributed with mean zero and heterogeneous    and   with dependency structures given by the group-specific relatedness matrices    and  that were calculated as explained in the Methods section. The results from fitting model () were compared to the standard genetic group model that only accounts for differences in group means  but with homogeneous  and dependency structure defined through the relatedness matrix . Both models were fitted to the data using INLA. All variances were given  priors  and fixed effects parameters were assigned independent  priors. Interestingly  the results indicate that the outer group has a somewhat larger estimated additive genetic variance than the inner group for both traits (Table )  although the respective 95% credible intervals (CI) are large and overlap. We therefore also calculated the posterior distribution of the differences between these variances by relying on an  specific function  that allows to efficiently draw a large number of samples from the joint posterior distribution of a model. For body mass  the difference  between inner and outer additive genetic variances obtained from 100  000 samples had a mode of   with a 95% CI ranging from  to 0.22  whereas for wing length the mode was   with a 95% CI ranging from  to 0.27 (the full distributions of the differences are given in Additional file : Figure S5 ). Thus  there is some weak indication that the additive genetic variances for wing length and body mass might actually differ between the two island groups. While it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about group-specific differences in the additive genetic variances from the data at hand  the results could still indicate that animals living on distinct island groups differ in the level of variation in the genes that affect some phenotypic traits  e.g. due to different allele frequencies. Although additional shared environmental effects might also be confounded with estimates of group-specific additive genetic variances []  dispersal among local sparrow populations helps minimizing (yet cannot fully eliminate) such problems. In both cases  the additive genetic variance estimates from the homogeneous model are rather close to the estimates for the inner base population  which is expected because the latter is by far the largest genetic group. For comparison  we also calculated the observed phenotypic variance  of the two traits  where the respective group-specific phenotypic variances were only calculated using the pure-bred animals (i.e. those with ) in each group (Table ). In addition  the estimates for  indicate that animals on the outer islands have  on average  a lower additive genetic value  although the evidence is weak in the case of wing length (Table ). The direction of these effects is in agreement with earlier findings regarding the phenotype of the birds  which indicate that individuals on the outer islands are lighter and have shorter wings than individuals on the inner islands [  ]. The residual variance estimates are not of primary interest  and they are all very similar between the models with heterogeneous and homogeneous additive genetic variances. The respective results are therefore given in Additional file : Table S3 . All results presented here involved the approximate approach from formula () to scale the group-specific  matrices. To illustrate that this approximation is unproblematic  we repeated all calculations with the correct versions as given in Eq. ()  which again involved the gene dropping method provided by the  program. Details are given in Additional file   and all results remain essentially unchanged (see in Additional file : Figure S3 and Tables S1 and S2). Finally  it is worth reiterating that model () does not account for the three segregation variances that would occur between any pair of groups  because these are expected to be negligibly small  but also because estimating these three additional variances would impose unrealistic requirements on these data. To illustrate that ignoring segregation variances is not critical  we also fitted a model with a segregation term for the sparrow example with only two genetic groups (inner and outer). Details on how to estimate segregation variances are given in Additional file . Importantly  Table S4 confirms that the segregation term between these two groups is indeed very small (with posterior modes  for both traits)  and that its inclusion only leads to irrelevant changes in the results. We have introduced an extension of the animal model that allows for unequal additive genetic variances in the presence of multiple interbreeding genetic groups. Our method decomposes the breeding value  of each individual  into contributions  from each group . These so-called partial breeding values are assumed to covary according to group-specific relatedness matrices . To understand how the respective matrices are constructed  we rely on the Cholesky decomposition of the full relatedness matrix  into components  and  []  and show how simple algebraic scaling operations can be used to derive the group-specific versions  and   which are then again multiplied to obtain . We also discuss how  in practice  the inverses  can be derived using the same theoretical framework. The method is computationally efficient  in particular when an (accurate) approximation for the group-specific Mendelian sampling variance matrices  is used  and because we omit any segregation variance terms from the models. Although genetic group animal models have been used before  in particular in animal and plant breeding setups  modeling heterogeneous additive genetic variances has so far been considered unfeasible for natural study systems []. Therefore  while natural populations have previously (although still rarely) been analyzed with genetic group models that account for mean differences in additive genetic effects [  ]  to the best of our knowledge such populations have never been analyzed with animal models that account for heterogeneous variances. In principle  the variance estimates could also be used to assess group-specific versions of heritability [] or evolvability []  where  is replaced by the group-specific version . We have assumed that segregation variances are often negligible for polygenic traits. How often will this assumption hold? The segregation variance from formula () approximates zero whenever the   which underlies the animal model and which posits that traits are determined by a large number of genes with small effects  holds approximately. This is likely the case for many polygenic  complex traits []. Our estimates of the segregation variance in the empirical house sparrow dataset support the view that segregation variance may often be negligible. This result is mirrored in GWAS of the genetic architectures of body mass  wing length and other morphological traits in house sparrows and other passerines  which revealed a polygenic basis  where any significant genomic region explains only a very small proportion of the phenotypic variance [  ]. Taken together  these results suggest that segregation variances can often be neglected in genetic group models  provided the traits of interest are truly very polygenic. When focal traits have a genetic architecture with only few causal genes with a large effect  omitting the segregational variance may however introduce a non-negligible bias in the estimated additive genetic variances. In such a case  it is still possible to formulate a model that accounts for segregation variances  as explained in Additional file   although such models may quickly impose unrealistic demands on the data. Estimating and disentangling individual variance components is generally known to be difficult  and it is particularly challenging for genetic group models with group-specific additive genetic variances. The problem is that the group-specific covariance matrices  are the sole sources of information for the discrimination of the variance components  yet these matrices may be similar in the presence of many animals with mixed group ancestry. The results from the house sparrow example in Table  illustrate that group-specific variance estimates suffer from larger uncertainty than a single homogeneous variance  especially when group sizes are relatively small  as is the case for the  and  groups. On the other hand  computation remains feasible thanks to the small size of the groups and the total size of the pedigree. We thus face an intrinsic trade-off of many estimation procedures  where more data are needed to fit more complex models reliably  but the latter may in turn become computationally prohibitive. An obvious “objective” way to decide whether extending the animal model to heterogeneous additive genetic variances is needed might be via the use of information criteria  such as the deviance information criterion for Bayesian models []. However  we do not recommend to rely on the DIC (for some DIC criticism see e.g. [])  nor on any other “automatic” way to do model selection. A particular difficulty with model selection in our context is that the heterogeneous and homogeneous models are  []  that is  both models lead to the same marginal model and therefore to the same log-likelihood. Consequently  it is not possible to distinguish between model fits in a likelihood framework (e.g. using an AIC criterion)  and differences in DIC may simply stem from the estimation of the effective number of parameters  which depends on the priors. Therefore  the decision to model heterogeneous additive genetic variances should be based on biological knowledge  and in particular when interest explicitly centers around group-specific variances. Posteriors of the differences among additive genetic variances  which we have calculated for the sparrow application  may inform about the biological relevance of these differences. The reason why additive genetic variances of the sparrows’ body mass and wing length tend to be larger for the outer group compared to those for the inner group is not directly obvious  but assuming the pattern is real  one can speculate whether some kind of interaction between genetic drift and dispersal is involved. Low effective population size () is expected to increase the rate of genetic drift and reduce  []. Because populations in the outer group have lower  than populations in the inner group []  the outer populations could be expected to have a smaller additive genetic variance than the inner populations. However  two processes may have counteracted this loss of additive genetic variance due to genetic drift. First  the population bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding that occurred on the outer islands around 2000 may actually have increased additive genetic variance [] in the outer compared to the inner populations. And second  because the outer populations experience higher dispersal rates than the inner populations  outer populations consist of a larger proportion of immigrants from the inner populations than vice versa ([] and Saatoglu et al.  personal communication)  and dispersal among populations may increase additive genetic variance in the direction of divergence []  this could have resulted in a tendency for larger additive genetic variance in the outer group compared to the inner group. However  further studies are needed to tease apart these alternative explanations. A general limitation of genetic group models is that parent-offspring relations are needed to propagate genetic contributions from founder individuals through the pedigree to determine . Despite the optimism of letting genomic relatedness matrices take over for pedigrees []  these alone are unfortunately not sufficient to fit genetic group models. A combination of genomic and pedigree information  the latter possibly inferred from genetic data [  ]  may however provide a powerful basis to overcome this limitation. In addition  genomic data can provide valuable information about the ancestry of founder individuals  and enable (proportional) genetic assignment of these individuals to different genetic groups  e.g. [  ]. The proposed extension of genetic group models will be useful for any study population that is structured into subpopulations  given that sufficient information on dispersal or crossbreeding events is available. In particular  the fact that group-specific additive genetic variances can be estimated for subpopulations that are not completely isolated might also be useful when interest centers around the dependency of additive genetic variance on the effective population size  a relation that is of pivotal interest in evolutionary and conservation biology. Finally  the method may provide a starting point to assess temporal or spatial variation of additive genetic variance  for example by defining populations at certain time points as base populations.

We used genotypes and body weight measurements of PB and CB animals that have a common sire line. Our results showed that the  estimates depended on the relationship matrix used. Estimates were 5 to 25% larger with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models. Moreover   estimates were similar (max. 7% difference) regardless of whether the model considered breed-of-origin of alleles or not. Standard errors of  estimates were smaller with genotype-based than with pedigree-based methods  and smaller with models that ignored breed-of-origin than with models that considered breed-of-origin. We conclude that genotype-based models can be useful for estimating   even when the PB and CB animals that have phenotypes are closely related. Considering breed-of-origin of alleles did not yield different estimates of   probably because the parental breeds of the CB animals were distantly related. In pig and poultry breeding programs  the breeding goal is to improve crossbred (CB) performance  whereas selection in the purebred (PB) lines is often based on PB performance. Thus  response to selection in CB performance may be suboptimal  because the genetic correlation between PB and CB performance () is generally lower than 1 [  ]. An  lower than 1 can be caused by genotype-by-environment interactions [  ]  by genotype-by-genotype interactions in combination with allele frequency differences between the two parental breeds []  and by differences in trait definitions between PB and CB performance [  ]. With a low   the use of CB instead of PB data may improve response to selection for CB performance [    ]. Thus  accurate estimates of the  are needed  so that breeders can decide if they should collect data from CB animals.  is the additive genetic correlation between breeding values for PB and CB performance  and is defined as: where  is the additive genetic covariance between breeding values for PB and CB performance and  () is the additive genetic standard deviation in purebreds (crossbreds) [  ]. To estimate   phenotypic data from both PB and CB animals are needed. When these data are available   can be estimated with a pedigree-based animal or sire model []. Such models treat PB and CB performance as correlated traits and use a pedigree-based relationship matrix () to link PB and CB observations []. To estimate  with   pedigree data should be available for both PB and CB individuals  and provide a link between PB and CB individuals. When the CB individuals are paternal half-sibs of the PB individuals  the accuracy of  estimated with  depends on the number of common sires between the PB and CB animals  and the accuracy of the estimated breeding values of the sires []. However  in practice  pedigree information is often not recorded in CB populations and the number of sires that have both PB and CB offspring with phenotypes may be limited. These requirements for estimating  with pedigree information can be alleviated by replacing  with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix () [  ]. An advantage of this approach is that the  can then also be estimated when the PB and CB animals are more distantly related  or when pedigree information is not recorded. In addition  genomic relationships may be more accurate than pedigree relationships [  ]  which results in a smaller standard error of the estimate of  [  ]. Usually  the  between the CB and one of the PB parental lines is estimated. As such  genomic relationships between PB and CB animals should ideally be based on alleles that originate from that PB parental line only. However  the ordinary  is based on both alleles of an individual  which in the case of CB individuals  also include those originating from the other PB line. For example  when  is estimated between CB and its PB sire line  the ordinary  matrix is also based on alleles that originated from the dam line. An alternative for  is a genomic partial relationship matrix () that is based on the breed-of-origin of the alleles in the CB animals [  ]. Recently  a method to determine the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) based on phased genotypes was developed  allowing  to be constructed []. In   relationships between PB and CB animals are expected to be more accurate than in   because relationships in  are based on marker alleles that originated from the same breed. This approach was successfully applied to estimate variance components from data of three-way crossbred pigs  where 93% of the alleles of the crossbreds could be assigned a breed-of-origin [  ]. However  empirical studies in other species are lacking and  to date  no studies have compared  estimates and their standard errors from pedigree-based models to those from genotype-based models. In addition  it is not yet clear how  estimates and their standard errors are affected by the model used. Thus  our objective was to compare estimates of  and variance components obtained from pedigree-based and genotype-based models. In addition  we compared models that either consider or ignore breed-of-origin of alleles. We analysed body weight in broilers  using genotypes and measurements of PB and CB animals that have a common sire line. Data were collected on male and female broilers from a PB sire line (A) and on a three-way cross between this sire line and crossbred dams (BC)  where lines B and C are dam lines. The dam lines were selected on egg production and the sire line on male fertility  along with standard traits  i.e.  growth  yield  and feed efficiency. The three parental lines (A  B  and C) were genetically distant  as shown by the principal component analysis plot (Fig. ). PB and CB animals were weighed between 6 and 8 days of age (BW7) and between 33 and 36 days of age (BW35). We chose these phenotypes because they are easy to measure proxies for growth  which is an important trait for breeding companies (Cobb; 2018 personal communication). Phenotype recording was done in five consecutive trials of similar size  which each included both PB and CB animals. All animals were housed in the same environment  in a barn located in Herveld  The Netherlands. The distribution of animals across trials and pens is in Table . Each pen had an approximately equal number of males and females. Offspring of a given sire were housed mostly in the same pen but each pen had offspring of multiple sires. Pens mostly had either PB or CB animals. An outlier analysis was done separately for PB and CB animals and separately for each day of measurement. Observations with standard deviations more than 3.5 away from the mean were considered as outliers and removed  which resulted in 4687 PB and 10 585 CB records on BW7 and 4471 PB and 10 272 CB records on BW35 (Table ). The number of animals with observations ( for PB and  for CB animals) was smaller for BW35 than for BW7 because some animals did not survive until 35 days.

Between brackets is the variance explained by each principal component. Colours indicate genetic group All PB and CB animals with phenotypes were genotyped  as well as all their potential parents  and most of their potential grandparents. Markers with an unknown location  on sex chromosomes  on the mitochondrial genome  or with a call rate lower than 90% were removed. Marker positions were determined based on the  4.0 (galGal4) reference assembly. All genotyped animals had a call rate of at least 90%. Genotypes were used for parentage assignment  such that pedigree information was available for all animals with phenotypes  up to the generation of their grandparents. The PB and CB animals had 161 unique PB sires  of which 135 sires had both PB and CB offspring with phenotypes  seven sires had only PB offspring with phenotypes  and 21 sires had only CB offspring with phenotypes (Table ). The PB offspring had 628 unique dams  whereas the CB offspring had 1028 unique dams. Markers with more than 1% inconsistent genotypes between derived parent–offspring pairs were removed and any remaining inconsistencies were set to missing. All missing genotypes of PB and CB animals were imputed simultaneously with FImpute []. Genotypes of the parents and grandparents were used to assign the breed-of-origin of alleles in the CB animals but were not included in the trait analyses. After assigning breed-of-origin  we removed markers if they had a minor allele frequency lower than 0.005 in either the genotype file or in the breed-of-origin file. These edits resulted in 50 960 markers that were used in the trait analyses. The breed-of-origin of alleles in the A(BC) crossbreds was derived with the BOA approach [  ]. In short  the BOA approach consists of (1) simultaneously phasing genotypes of PB and CB animals with AlphaPhase 1.1 by using pedigree information []  (2) collecting a library of haplotypes for each line using phased haplotypes of the PB lines  and (3) assigning the breed-of-origin of alleles in the CB animals. With this approach  49.5% of the alleles were assigned to sire line A  which is close to the expected 50%. The full procedure and results are described in Calus et al. []. The BW7 and BW35 phenotypes were analysed separately with a bivariate model that treats PB and CB performance as separate but correlated traits. We compared four models that differed in the relationship matrix used. The general bivariate model can be written as [  ]: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is a vector of fixed effects (breed × trial × pen × sex × age at measurement)  with 85 (BW7) and 103 (BW35) levels   is the design matrix of fixed effects   is a vector of length equal to the total number of BC dams that contains (non-genetic) maternal effects with incidence matrix    is a vector of length  that contains additive genetic effects with incidence matrix   and  is a vector of random residuals. Subscripts denote whether the terms relate to PB or CB performance. The distribution of maternal effects was  where  () is the maternal variance in the PB (CB) animals  and  is an identity matrix. Note that these maternal effects are not genetic effects  but permanent environmental effects. The distribution of additive genetic effects for PB () and CB performance () was: where  () is the additive genetic variance in the PB (CB) animals   is the genetic covariance between PB and CB performance  and  is the relationship matrix between all animals  which differed between models. This parameterization yields additive genetic effects for both PB and CB performance of all animals. The distribution of residuals was   where  () is the residual variance in the PB (CB) animals. Concerning the fixed effects  we used the full interaction between effects (breed × trial × pen × sex × age at measurement)  because males and females (in PB and CB animals) may have different growth rates (breed × sex × age at measurement)  pens may have housed different groups of animals across trials (trial × pen)  and the number of degrees of freedom (maximum 103) needed was acceptable for the size of this dataset. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using the MTG2 software []. From the estimated variance components (indicated by ^)  the estimate of  was computed as: We compared estimates obtained from four models that use different relationship matrices  and we assessed model performance by comparing the standard errors and likelihoods of these models. We compared four models that use different relationship matrices (i.e.  that replace  in Eq. (): (1) based on pedigree (; PED)  (2) based on pedigree ignoring dams of CB animals (; PED_BOA)  (3) based on marker genotypes (; GEN)  and (4) based on marker alleles with sire origin (; GEN_BOA). We included PED_BOA because it only fits the additive genetic effects for CB performance that are contributed by the sire line. The  and  matrices were constructed from pedigree information  which was available for all animals with phenotypes  up to the generation of their grandparents. A single base population was assumed for all PB lines (i.e.  no genetic groups were included). With   the full pedigree was used  whereas with   the dams of CB animals were set to missing. In addition  we set all the self-relationships of CB animals in  equal to 0.5 []. As such  PED_BOA is the pedigree equivalent of GEN_BOA. The  matrix was constructed following the multi-breed genomic relationship matrix of Wientjes et al. []: where  () is a centred marker genotype matrix of PB (CB) animals  and  () is the allele frequency of marker  in PB (CB) animals. We used the line-specific allele frequencies to separately centre the genotype matrices  and . The -matrix was constructed following Sevillano et al. [] as: where  is a centred marker allele matrix of CB animals  with a value of  if the reference allele was inherited from the PB line  and a value of  if the alternative allele was inherited  where  is the frequency of the alternative allele at marker   which was calculated as the total number of alternative alleles in the PB and CB animals that were inherited from the PB line  divided by the total number of PB alleles in these animals. Note that the resulting  matrix is similar to the marker-based partial relationship matrix of Christensen et al. []  with a scaling factor of . The expected value of diagonal elements for CB animals in  and  is 0.5. The phenotypic variance of CB performance with PED_BOA and GEN_BOA was therefore computed as . With pedigree-based models  the population to which the variance components refer is the population of the founders of the pedigree. However  with genotype-based models  the reference population is  in most cases  the group of genotyped individuals  because  and  were constructed using the allele frequencies in the genotyped group. Thus  estimated variance components from pedigree- and genotype-based models are not directly comparable  because they refer to a different population []. To let the variance components from different models refer to the same (arbitrary) population  all relationship matrices were adjusted as: where  denotes relationships among the PB animals   denotes relationships among the CB animals  and  and  denote the relationships between PB and CB animals  as defined in Eqs. () and (). Scalar  () is the scaling factor of PB (CB) animals  which was defined as: where  is the mean of off-diagonals in  and  is the mean of all elements in . This scaling procedure is equivalent to multiplying estimated variance components from models with unscaled relationship matrices by the appropriate scaling factors  as proposed by Legarra []. For models that considered the breed-of-origin of alleles  the expected value of  was close to 0.5  so we used  instead of  as a scaling factor in these models. Detailed information and estimates from all models are in Additional file . The phenotypic variance for BW7 was around 363 g for PB performance and 291 g for CB performance  whereas for BW35  it was around 37 048 g for PB performance and 33 455 g for CB performance. The estimated phenotypic variance was similar across models  thus we present variances instead of their ratio to phenotypic variance. Estimates of  and of the additive genetic covariance were larger for BW35 than for BW7 (Fig. ). For BW7  the estimate of the additive genetic variance was smaller for PB performance than for CB performance  except with PED_BOA (Fig. ). For BW35  estimates of the additive genetic variance and heritabilities were consistently larger for PB performance. Differences in estimates between models  were roughly similar for BW7 and BW35. For the sake of brevity  in the following  the description of results applies to both traits  unless stated otherwise. We will refer to PED and PED_BOA as pedigree-based models  and to GEN and GEN_BOA as genotype-based models. In addition  we will refer to PED and GEN as models that ignore breed-of-origin  and to PED_BOA and GEN_BOA as models that consider breed-of-origin. Estimates of  (left) and additive genetic covariance (right) from four models. Traits are body weight measured around 7 (BW7) and 35 days (BW35). Error bars represent standard errors reported by the MTG2 software Estimates of additive genetic variance (left) and maternal variance (right) for purebred and crossbred body weight. Traits are body weight measured around 7 (BW7) and 35 days (BW35). Estimates are shown from four models. Error bars represent standard errors reported by the MTG2 software Estimates of  were larger with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models  particularly for BW7 (Fig. ). However  estimates of the additive genetic covariance were smaller with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models  except for BW7 and GEN_BOA versus PED_BOA. For PB performance  estimates of the additive genetic variance were smaller with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models. For CB performance  estimates of the additive genetic variance were similar with genotype-based models and pedigree-based models  except for BW7 and GEN_BOA versus PED_BOA  for which the additive genetic variance was larger with GEN_BOA (Fig. ). Because of these differences in estimates of additive genetic variance  the product of estimates of additive genetic standard deviations in the denominator of  was smaller with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models. Estimates of the maternal variance of PB performance were larger with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models  while for CB performance  estimates of maternal variance were similar for both types of models (Fig. ). Estimates of  from models that ignored or considered breed-of-origin were similar (Fig. ). With pedigree-based models  estimates of the additive genetic covariance were smaller when breed-of-origin was considered  whereas with genotype-based models  estimates were similar. For PB performance  there were almost no differences in estimates of additive genetic variance and maternal variance (Fig. ) between models that considered or ignored breed-of-origin. However  for CB performance  models that considered breed-of-origin had a larger estimate of maternal variance than models that did not. With pedigree-based models  the estimate of additive genetic variance of CB performance was smaller when breed-of-origin was considered than when it was not. However  with genotype-based models the estimate of additive genetic variance of CB performance was similar between models that considered or ignored breed-of-origin. For both traits  model GEN had the largest likelihood  followed by GEN_BOA  PED  and PED_BOA (Table ). Likelihoods were larger for genotype-based methods than for pedigree-based methods  while considering breed-of-origin unexpectedly reduced likelihoods compared to ignoring breed-of-origin. In addition to the best fit  model GEN also gave the smallest standard error of estimates of   followed by GEN_BOA  PED  and PED_BOA (Fig. ; Table ). In general  the standard errors of estimates or  were smaller with genotype-based methods than with pedigree-based methods. The standard errors of estimates of variance components of CB performance were slightly larger with models that considered breed-of-origin compared to models that did not  while there were no differences in standard errors for estimates of variance components of PB performance (Fig.  and see Additional file ). This study aimed at comparing models that estimate PB and CB genetic parameters of body weight in broiler chicken. We were particularly interested in the estimation of   because the value of  allows breeders to determine whether the use of CB information in the breeding program will increase genetic gain of CB performance  compared to a situation where only PB information is used. Our results showed that  for our population   estimates were 5 to 25% larger with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models. Moreover   estimates were similar (max. 7% difference) with models that consider breed-of-origin and for models that ignore breed-of-origin. Genotype-based models had larger likelihoods and estimates with smaller standard errors than pedigree-based models  which was in line with expectations. This suggests that  although our results are not conclusive   was underestimated with pedigree-based models in this study. Estimates of  were between 0.64 and 0.80 for BW7 and between 0.90 and 0.96 for BW35. To our knowledge  this is the first time that  are estimated for body weight in broilers. It should be noted that  in this study  PB and CB animals were housed in the same environment. As such  our estimates provide an upper bound for values of  in situations where PB animals are housed in a breeding nucleus environment and CB animals in a commercial herd environment. Nevertheless  our estimates are similar to estimates from the literature on egg production traits in laying hens  for which estimates of  ranged from 0.62 to 0.83 []. In pigs  the average estimate of  for growth-related traits was lower (~<U+2009>0.6) []. With an  larger than ~<U+2009>0.7  the accuracy of predicting breeding values for CB performance is not expected to substantially improve when CB data instead of PB data is used []. An empirical study on pigs also showed that  with an  of about 0.90  replacing PB data with CB data did not improve prediction accuracy []. However  these results cannot be extrapolated directly to the current study  because differences in accuracy also depend on the number of phenotypic records available from the PB and CB populations and on the strength of relationships between the reference population and selection candidates [    ]. In addition  information on PB performance may be more valuable than information on CB information  because the former may have been measured on the selection candidates themselves  whereas the latter can only be measured on relatives. Nevertheless  we expect that the use of CB instead of PB data will not substantially increase the accuracy of predicted breeding values for CB body weight in the current dataset  due to the high . A detailed investigation of the benefit of using CB instead of PB data for the accuracy of predicted breeding values will be investigated in a follow-up study. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.09 to 0.20 for BW7 and from 0.21 to 0.30 for BW35. To our knowledge  heritability estimates for body weight at 7 days of age (BW7) have not been reported before. Our heritability estimates for BW35 were similar to those reported by Koerhuis and Thompson []  Mulder et al. [] and Maniatis et al. []. In contrast  our heritability estimates for BW35 were lower than those reported by Kapell et al. [] and Rekaya et al. []. Estimates of the ratio of maternal to phenotypic variance () ranged from 0.13 to 0.22 for BW7 and from 0.02 to 0.10 for BW35. These results match with the general belief that maternal effects decrease with age. Estimates of  for BW35 from the literature ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 [    ] and were somewhat smaller than our estimates  which may be due to the use of models that consider breed-of-origin in our study  where part of the genetic variance that is not captured moves to the non-genetic maternal variance. Estimates of  were larger with genotype-based than with pedigree-based models  but the estimate of additive genetic covariance was often smaller with genotype-based models than with pedigree-based models  so the difference in  estimates was the result of differences in both additive genetic variances and covariance. The estimate of the additive genetic variance of PB performance was slightly larger with pedigree-based than with genotype-based models  while the estimate of the maternal variance of PB performance was smaller with pedigree-based models. First  the difference in variance estimates for PB performance may be due in part to bias in the genomic relationships that are estimated with markers []. To account for sources of bias when  is used  Goddard et al. [] proposed to regress  towards . However  for our data  this procedure neither changed the relationships in  substantially  nor changed the estimates of variance components (results not shown). Furthermore  in contrast to PB performance  the additive genetic variance of CB performance was similar with pedigree-based and genotype-based models. Thus  we chose not to regress  towards . Second  the estimate of maternal variance may be more accurate with genotype-based than with pedigree-based models because genotype-based models may be more efficient at disentangling non-genetic maternal effects from the maternal component of an individual’s additive genetic effect [  ]. However  in contrast to PB performance  estimates of the additive genetic and maternal variances for CB performance were similar with pedigree-based and genotype-based models. Thus  it remains unclear why the differences in estimates of variances for PB performance between genotype-based and pedigree-based models were not observed for CB performance. For PB performance  estimates of variance components from models that ignored or considered breed-of-origin of alleles were similar  which is not surprising  because relationships between PB animals are the same regardless of whether breed-of-origin is considered or not. However  for CB performance  the estimate of the maternal variance was much larger with models that considered breed-of-origin. In these models  only alleles inherited from the sires were used to describe the variation in relationships between CB offspring. Thus  the genetic part of these models only captured the additive genetic variance of CB performance that is caused by the PB sire line. As a result  the non-genetic maternal effect absorbed most of the genetic variance caused by the BC dams. In contrast  with models that ignore breed-of-origin  alleles inherited from dams describe additional genetic covariation between CB offspring. Thus  the genetic components of these models also capture some of the additive genetic variance caused by the BC dams and  as a result  the variance explained by the maternal effect was smaller with models that ignored breed-of-origin than with models that considered breed-of-origin. In spite of the differences in estimates of maternal variance between GEN and GEN_BOA  the estimate of additive genetic variance in CB performance () was similar between GEN and GEN_BOA. Thus  we hypothesized that either (1) the contribution of alleles that originated from the sire line to  is equal to the contribution of alleles that originated from the BC dams  or (2) the relationships between the sires and BC dams contributed little to the estimate of  (because the sires and BC dams were distantly related) and the paternal relationships dominated the estimate of . To test the first hypothesis  we analysed CB performance with a univariate model that fitted random sire and random dam effects separately  each with their own BOA matrix. This model yielded two estimates of   one for the sire line and one for the BC dams  which showed that the contribution of the BC dams to the estimate of  was larger than the contribution of the sire line (see Additional file ). The first hypothesis was therefore rejected. To test the second hypothesis  we compared estimates of  from the aforementioned univariate BOA approach with estimates from a univariate GEN approach using only CB performance (GEN_CB). With GEN_CB  the estimate of  also depends on genetic covariances between sires and dams because GEN_CB merges alleles from both lines into a single  matrix. However  we observed that the average of the  estimates of the sire line and BC dams from the BOA approach was close to the estimate of  with GEN_CB (8389 vs 8410; see Additional file )  which suggests that relationships between sires and dams contributed little to the likelihood or to the estimate of  with GEN_CB. Indeed  there was almost no variance in genomic relationships between sires and dams and  as a result  relationships between sires and between dams dominated the estimate of  with GEN_CB. Similar to   the estimate of the additive genetic covariance between PB and CB performance was the same with GEN and GEN_BOA. Hence  the estimate of additive genetic covariance with GEN is probably dominated by variation in relationships between sires and between dams. Of these  we believe that paternal relationships dominated the estimate of  because the model included a non-genetic maternal effect  which is strongly confounded with the maternal part of the genetic covariance between full sibs. Hence  covariances in the BC dams that are informative for  originated mainly from more distant relationships  which have a smaller impact on the likelihood than  e.g.  paternal half-sib relationships. In addition  the standard error of the estimate of  was larger when using dam alleles than when using sire alleles (see Additional file )  which suggests that paternal relationships dominated the estimate of . This study focused on the estimation of variance components and  using different models based on estimated standard errors and model fit. However  it should be noted that the model with the best fit does not necessarily yield the most accurate predicted breeding values []  which shall be investigated in a follow-up study. Nevertheless  results showed that genotype-based models had a better model-fit and smaller estimated standard errors than pedigree-based models. Thus  genotype-based models may be preferred over pedigree-based models to estimate   even when the PB and CB animals are closely related. The benefit of genotype-based models may be slightly larger when the PB and CB animals are less related or when pedigree information is difficult to obtain. However  reported standard errors of estimates should be used with care. For example  the assumption in model GEN that all alleles in the CB animals originate from the same line is incorrect  which can lead to unreliable estimates of standard errors. Models that consider breed-of-origin of alleles had smaller likelihoods than models that ignore it  which is somewhat unexpected for GEN versus GEN_BOA. With GEN  relationships between PB and CB animals are based on alleles from both the sires and dams and alleles of the dams in the PB and CB animals are assumed to have the same origin. Thus  the PB–CB relationships in  may be less accurate than the PB–CB relationships in   which may decrease the likelihood of GEN. Nevertheless  estimates of  with GEN and GEN_BOA were similar  which suggests that violation of model assumptions with GEN had only minor effects on the estimate of . In addition  GEN may have an advantage over GEN_BOA  because the assignment of the BOA is probably not without error  which may affect estimates of variance components. The GEN_BOA model that we used in this study does not explicitly fit a genetic component for the maternal alleles in the CB animals and  hence  does not allow for a covariance of allele effects from the dams with those from the sire line. In addition  we were not able to estimate  between the A(BC) crossbreds and BC dams  because phenotypes of BC dams were not available. A more complete model would use phenotypes and phased genotypes from the A(BC) crossbreds and its three parental lines (A  B and C)  model these phenotypes as four separate traits  and allow covariances between these traits []. Although such a model is more sophisticated and complete  we do not expect that it would result in different estimates of  between the CB and its sire line  because the parental lines were genetically distant. In spite of differences in standard errors and likelihoods between models  we were not able to establish which estimates were closest to the true values (i.e.  the genetic correlation at the causal loci) because this value is unknown. Gianola et al. [] showed that estimates of genetic correlations using marker information may not necessarily reflect the true genetic correlation at causal loci because of imperfect linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL. However  simulation studies have suggested that genotype-based models result in unbiased estimates of genetic correlations when relationships at causal loci are accurately predicted by the markers []. Further research is needed to establish whether these results also apply to estimation of  and which of the models presented in this study yields the most accurate estimate of . This work presents the first comparison of estimated  and variance components of body weight in broilers  using pedigree-based and genotype-based models  where the breed-of-origin of alleles was either ignored or considered. Estimates of  ranged from 0.64 to 0.80 for BW7 and from 0.90 to 0.96 for BW35. Genotype-based models resulted in larger estimates of  than pedigree-based models and are preferred for estimating  because they resulted in smaller standard errors of estimates and had better model fit than pedigree-based models. Considering breed-of-origin of alleles did not affect estimates of   probably because the parental breeds of the CB animals were distantly related but could result in different estimates of  when the parental breeds are more closely related  or when the amount of data is limited.

Seven genomic regions that control milk somatic cell counts  an indirect indicator of udder infection  have already been identified in sheep (Spanish Churra  French Lacaune and Italian Sardinian–Lacaune backcross populations). In this study  we used a 960 custom-designed ovine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip in Lacaune and Manech Tête Rousse dairy sheep to validate these seven genomic regions associated with mastitis. The most significant SNP ( on  chromosome (OAR) 3 was a previously described mutation in the  () gene. An antagonist effect of this causal candidate between health and growth in Lacaune sheep was confirmed. Effects of the mutation on the infectious status of the udder  i.e. increases in milk somatic cell counts and bacteria shedding  were also identified. This SNP was not present in the data available on Manech Tête Rousse. Three other regions associated with mastitis were also confirmed on OAR16 (Manech Tête Rousse)  19 (Lacaune) and 2 (both breeds). For the OAR2 region  we validated previously detected SNPs in several other breeds (Sarda  Churra  and Chios). For significant SNPs in the four mastitis regions  the effect varied from 0.24 to 0.67 phenotypic standard deviation of the traits. Two of the mastitis quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions (OAR2 and 16) that we validated here were also associated in opposite ways with milk production traits in both populations. These results indicate  at least in part  a genomic basis for the trade-off between milk production and mastitis resistance. Four of the seven mastitis QTL regions that were previously identified in independent populations  were confirmed in this study  which demonstrates partial sharing of mastitis-related genetic mechanisms between different distant dairy sheep populations. Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland  which in dairy sheep is mostly due to bacterial infections by  []. Mastitis is a serious burden for the milk industry due to the altered quality of milk and increased cost of flock renewal. Beside hygienic measures  genetic selection for improved resistance to mastitis is now implemented in breeding programs for several breeds of dairy ruminants worldwide []. However  its application to dairy sheep is still rare  mainly because the recording cost per animal  relative to potential income  is prohibitive for many traits other than production traits. In sheep  the identification of loci that are associated with resistance to udder infection or the causative mutations may be helpful in selection. However  resistance to mastitis is highly complex and the genetically determined biological basis behind this trait remains unknown. Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions that control milk somatic cell count (SCC)  an indirect indicator of udder infection  have been identified in dairy sheep through the EU-funded 3SR project (Sustainable solutions for small ruminants  FP7-KBBE-245140) []. For one of these QTL  Rupp et al. [] identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding frame of the  ( gene as the putative causal mutation associated with high SCC in the Lacaune breed. A few QTL regions were then confirmed by Banos et al. [] in a population of the Greek Chios breed using four mastitis indicator traits  namely clinical mastitis occurrence  milk SCC  total viable bacterial count in milk and the California mastitis test. The objective of our study was to confirm the ovine QTL that control mastitis resistance in two independent dairy sheep populations  using a 960 custom-designed ovine SNP chip. Two independent French dairy sheep populations were used: Lacaune ewes (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>504) from a divergent selection based on extreme breeding values for SCC at the experimental facility of La Fage (INRA  UE 321  Roquefort  France) []  and Manech Tête Rousse rams (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>145) raised in the CDEO (Ordiarp  France) testing station in 2013 (birth year from 2008 to 2011). Among the 504 Lacaune individuals  213 ewes belonged to the high SCC line (42.2%) and 291 to the low SCC line (57.7%). The selection lines were about three genetic standard deviations (SD) apart []. In the Lacaune ewe population  milk yield  fat content  protein content  and SCC were measured monthly at morning milking. Test-day SCC were log-transformed for normality into SCS []. The arithmetic averages of the first lactation test-days were then computed and corrected for year of sampling for fat content (FAT_L1)  protein content (PROTEIN_L1)  and SCS (LSCS_L1). The milk yield (MILK_L1) trait was computed as the trait used for genetic evaluation  i.e. the 250-day cumulative production adjusted for lactation length and standardized to an adult production (×<U+2009>1.3). MILK_L1 was multiplied by 1.3 to follow the definition used in the Manech Tête Rousse breed for genetic evaluation and allow direct comparison of average milk production between both breeds.  abundance in milk was measured at three-time points during the first lactation by a qPCR-based technique developed at the “Interactions Hôtes – Agents Pathogènes” (IHAP) laboratory (Toulouse  France). Briefly  milk was collected aseptically from each half udder independently after precleaning and disinfecting the teat apex using a cotton wool moistened with 70% alcohol. Whole milk was centrifuged (6000; 20 min) before two consecutive enzymatic proteolytic treatments with lysozyme and proteinase K. DNA was extracted using a Biosprint 96 semi-robotic workstation and DNA Blood kits (QIAGEN)  and finally eluted in 50 µL of distilled water. An internal DNA control (QIAGEN) was used to assess recovery and lack of qPCR inhibitors. High-throughput qPCR in 384-well format was performed on 1 µL of DNA extract in a total volume of 5 µL using -specific primers (tuf 5'-CAC GAC CAG TGA TTG AGA ATA CG and tuf 3'-CCA ATG CCA CAA ACT CGT GA)  probe (CCA TTC ATG ATG CCA GTT G)  and the Quantifast Pathogen PCR kit (QIAGEN). The proportion of inhibited samples was lower than 5%. Values above the cycle threshold were compared to a standard curve obtained from known amounts of genomic DNA from a  laboratory strain and expressed as a bacterial titre (quantity of equivalent bacterial genomes per volume of milk)  on a logarithmic scale. The three results were averaged for each ewe and corrected for the effects of month and year of sampling (STAPH_L1). Chronic mastitis was based on the presence of mammary abscesses  recorded by clinical examination (ABSCESS_L1). Animals were noted as “1” (case) when the presence of at least one abscess was detected at least twice  whereas animals were noted as “0” (control) when they were found to be healthy (without any abscess) at least three times during the first lactation. Each ewe was weighed at birth (W_BIRTH)  at 100 days (W_DAY_100) and 250 days (W_DAY_250)  after the first (on average 412 days  W_1ST_LAMB) and second lambing (on average 744 days  W_2ND_LAMB)  and at the age of 920 days (W_DAY_920). Phenotypes were corrected for year and feeding method (breastfeeding or artificial suckling). Basic statistics are in Table . In the Manech Tête Rousse population  SCC and milk production traits were obtained from the official milk records. In this breed  milk yield is measured monthly and SCC  fat and protein contents are measured three to four times during the first three lactations []. For association mapping  we used the daughter yield deviations (DYD) [] from regular national genetic evaluations for milk production traits (MILK  PROTEIN  and FAT) and lactation average somatic cell scores (LSCS). DYD correspond to the average performance of the daughters of a ram  corrected for the environmental effects and the genetic value of the dams (Table ). Both Lacaune and Manech Tête Rousse populations were genotyped with a 960 custom-designed ovine SNP chip []. The chip was designed and developed within the 3SR EU project [] based on several QTL for SCC that were previously identified in Spanish Churra []  French Lacaune [] and Italian Sardinian–Lacaune backcross populations ([] and personal communication). Using these previous association studies  seven regions of interest (Table ) on  (OAR) chromosomes 2  3  5  16 and 18 were selected based on commonalities among populations found at the time (in 2012) or on their high significance. SNPs were selected within these regions from the 54 K or 800 K Illumina ovine chips [] or from novel genome sequencing within the 3SR project. The 10 SNPs in the OAR3 region included the causal mutation in the  gene and nine other closely linked loci that had been identified by Rupp et al. []. Genomic positions refer to the ovine reference genome v3.1 []. After quality control  the following SNPs were excluded from the analyses: non-polymorphic SNPs  SNPs with a missingness rate higher than 5%  with a minor allele frequency lower than 2%  and SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg proportion (<U+2009><<U+2009>1E-05)  thus  745 and 708 SNPs were selected for the Lacaune and Manech Tête Rousse populations  respectively. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed for each phenotype using the polygenic univariate mixed model approach implemented in the genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA) software []. The polygenic effect was fitted using a covariance structure according to the genomic relationship matrix. Corrections were applied to account for multiple testing. First  a Bonferroni correction of a<U+2009>=<U+2009>5% was applied (significance threshold<U+2009>=<U+2009>a/number of SNPs). SNPs with a  value less than 6.6E-05 and less than 7.1E-05 were considered as highly significantly associated for the Lacaune and the Manech Tête Rousse populations  respectively. Since association tests are not independent  due to the large number of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium within the QTL regions  and to several traits being highly correlated  a less restrictive suggestive significance threshold was also calculated (significance threshold<U+2009>=<U+2009>[a/number of independent regions in the chip]/number of independent variables in the study). Table  lists the seven independent regions that were found to contain such SNPs on the 960 custom-designed ovine SNP chip. We used two methods to obtain the number of independent variables: a factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) for the Lacaune population  for which we had to consider quantitative (LSCS_L1  FAT_L1  PROTEIN_L1  MILK_L1  STAPH_L1  weights) and qualitative (ABSCESS_L1) phenotypes  and a principal component analysis (PCA) for the Manech Tête Rousse population  for which all phenotypes were quantitative. FAMD and PCA using phenotypes were computed using the FactoMineR package [] of the R software []. According to the clustering elbow method  the number of independent variables is the marginal point where the percentage of variance explained by the PCA dimensions drops and produces an angle in the histogram. This method led us to choose the first five dimensions of the FAMD (Lacaune) and the first two dimensions of the PCA (Manech Tête Rousse)  which explained 77.5% (Lacaune) and 79.6% (Manech Tête Rousse) of the variance. Therefore  we used N1<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 (Lacaune) and N2<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 (Manech Tête Rousse)  the number of independent variables in the study  leading to suggestive significance thresholds of 1.4E-03 and 3.6E-03  respectively. Significant SNPs from the GWAS are in Table  (Lacaune) and Table  (Manech Tête Rousse). The first noteworthy result concerns the highly significant region on OAR3 in the Lacaune population. Indeed  three SNPs  which were associated with mastitis and growth traits  were detected at the Bonferroni threshold. The most significant SNP (   value<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.0E-07) was the causal mutation in the  gene  previously reported by Rupp et al. []. This mutation causes a loss in functional activity of the SOCS2 protein  which is involved in inflammatory response control and growth [] through the JAK/STAT/SOCS pathway. The lowest  values and highest estimates of effects for this SNP were observed for both mastitis traits (LSCS_L1 and STAPH_L1) and four of the six weight traits. Corresponding effects varied from 0.33 SD for W_DAY_100 to 0.50 SD for LSCS_L1. Thus  we confirmed an adverse effect of the  gene point mutation on mammary inflammation and growth  as reported by Rupp et al. []. We also found that the mutation had an unfavourable effect on the infectious status of the udder (0.38 SD)  since the low-frequency allele increased cell counts and bacteria shedding in milk. All these results confirm the pleiotropic effect of the  mutation on body growth and the host’s control of mastitis. This SNP did not segregate in the Manech Tête Rousse population although 12 other SNPs segregated in this narrow genomic region (Table ). No QTL for mastitis was detected in this region for the Manech Tête Rousse population (Table )  which provides further evidence that  is a strong candidate in Lacaune but is absent from Manech Tête Rousse. Moreover  we found that there was no effect of the SNPs of the same region on OAR3 when the SNP considered as causal () was included as a fixed factor in the model for the Lacaune population analyses. Indeed  we observed an increase of the  values of the SNPs that surround the mutation for all traits for which the association was previously significant. For example  the minimum  value for the LSCS_L1 trait in the OAR3 region was 1.5E-02 ()  which confirmed that the other SNPs in the region do not explain any additional variance. Then  we applied suggestive thresholds  which allowed us to confirm three other regions that are associated with mastitis. In the Lacaune population  regions on OAR2 and 19 are associated with the ABSCESS_L1 and STAPH_L1 traits  respectively  and regions on OAR2 and 16 are also significant for the LSCS trait in the Manech Tête Rousse population. For significant SNPs  the effect varied from 0.38 SD (OAR19 in Lacaune) to 0.67 SD (OAR16 in Manech Tête Rousse) of the traits (Tables   ). These three QTL regions had already been identified in Sarda (OAR2)  Churra (OAR19 and 2) (Table ) and Chios breeds (OAR2  16 and 19) []. Thus  for these regions  and especially OAR2  our data reinforce the hypothesis of true mastitis QTL  which might involve similar genes and pathways across breeds. Banos et al. [] suggested several candidate genes for OAR2: -- (2; 204 777 523–204 784 522 bp)  --; 204 851 429–204 873 693 bp)  and + (; 209 236 699–209 259 307 bp)  which are involved in T-cell responses or mitigation of oxidative damage. However  the region between 204.2 and 209.7 Mbp on OAR2 includes more than 90 genes  which makes the identification of appropriate candidates difficult. Interestingly  two of the mastitis QTL regions (OAR2 and 16) that were confirmed in the present study  were also associated with milk production traits in both populations. Moreover  the region on OAR16 is strongly (Bonferroni threshold) associated with MILK_L1 (effect<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.56 SD) in the Lacaune population and with MILK  FAT  and PROTEIN (effect<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.50 SD  0.45 SD and 0.46 SD  respectively) in the Manech Tête Rousse population. Thus  the underlying QTL could be a QTL for milk production that has an indirect impact on mastitis. In Lacaune  the positive sign of the estimated effects of SNP  shows that this QTL is favourable for milk production (Table )  i.e. leading to an increase in milk quantity  but unfavourable for LSCS_L1 (results not shown)  i.e. leading to an increase in somatic cell count. A similar pattern is observed for SNP  in Manech Tête Rousse  for which the estimated effects have a negative sign  i.e. leading to a decrease in MILK which is unfavourable for milk yield (Table ) and a decrease in LSCS which is favourable for the health of the animal (results not shown). These results are in agreement with the positive and antagonistic correlation that exists between mastitis and milk production trait in Lacaune [] and other ovine [] and bovine breeds []  which indicates  at least in part  a genomic basis for the trade-off between milk production and mastitis resistance. We confirmed four out of seven QTL regions for mastitis in the Lacaune population  and only two in the Manech Tête Rousse population. This is consistent with the fact that Lacaune belongs to the breeds for which these regions were first discovered  although the individuals were different. The two significant regions detected in the Manech Tête Rousse population are rather encouraging  unlike a similar study on nematode resistance where QTL validation was inconclusive []. These results demonstrate that mastitis-related genetic mechanisms are shared between different distant dairy sheep populations. Bergonier D  de Crémoux R  Rupp R  Lagriffoul G  Berthelot X.

Regarding direct genetic effects  several SNPs had a significant effect on BW at different ages  and only two SNPs on chromosome 5 had a significant effect on all three BW traits. Thus  different potential candidate genes regulate BW at different ages. Maternal genetic effects followed an infinitesimal model. Some countries with pasture-based production systems consider dairy cow live weight in overall breeding goals or in selection indices [  ]. Positive genetic correlations of body weight (BW) with milk yield and protein yield have been reported [  ]. Feed efficiency reflects the ability of dairy cows to produce more milk for a given feed consumption []. Different traits are defined to measure feed efficiency  e.g. the ratio of milk to body weight  feed intake  residual feed intake []  and feed saved []. Most of these definitions imply that BW or changes in BW are taken into account. Moreover  dry matter intake and energy balances are favourably correlated with BW []. In addition  BW influences dairy cow fertility and health. For example  survival of new-born calves and calving ease are moderately correlated with birth weight of calves and BW of cows []. Berry et al. [] reported that heavier cows had a shorter interval between calving and first service  but conception rates decreased with increasing BW. In contrast  in heifers  increasing BW was associated with improved non-return rates after 56 and 90 days []. Hence  we hypothesize that different genes are involved in BW at different ages  as indicated in quantitative genetic studies via random regression models []. On the genomic scale  GWAS for BW or BW indicators have considered only one time point per animal [  ]. Zhang et al. [] analysed longitudinal BW records in cattle at 6  12  18 and 24 months of age  but BW was predicted from measurements for heart girth and hip height. The aforementioned publications focussed only on the estimation of direct additive genetic effects on BW. However  especially in early life  BW should be separated into direct genetic and maternal genetic effects []. Dams with high breeding values for maternal ability provide an improved nourishing environment  with an associated positive impact on survival rates and birth weight in offspring. For a deeper understanding of the mechanisms between direct and maternal effects  it is imperative to detect the functional segments of the genome that contribute to maternal genetic effects on BW  and to study direct-maternal associations on the genomic scale. To date  only a few studies [  ] have addressed such topics. The power of GWAS contributes to the detection of significant markers  and  furthermore  has an impact on the identification of associated potential candidate genes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is one of the parameters that affects the power of GWAS. The use of a dense 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip implies that it contains markers that are closely located to the functional mutation and contribute to acceptable LD between markers and causal loci []. Body weight is a trait with a moderate to high pedigree-based heritability [    ]  which is favourable for the detection of QTL. Furthermore  currently  the trend is to use large numbers of female observations for the estimation of SNP effects  which contributes to an increasing number of phenotypic records for GWAS []  with a positive impact on the statistical power for the detection of SNP effects. Non-causative rare alleles with high frequencies in large half-sib daughter groups might contribute to false positive signals in GWAS. Usually  the first principal components and similarity matrices can be considered in statistical modelling to correct for population stratification []. In dairy cattle breeding  deep pedigree information is available  which enables the use of mixed models for GWAS with random polygenic effects based on pedigree [] or on genomic relationship matrices []. Consequently  the objectives of our study were: (1) to perform GWAS using phenotypes and de-regressed proofs for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects on BW at different ages; (2) to correct for population stratification in GWAS when using pedigree-based or genomic relationship matrices  or a combination of relationship matrices with principal components; (3) to infer (co)variance components for/between direct genetic and maternal genetic effects on different scales (pedigree-based genetic parameters  whole genome  and single chromosomes); and (4) to identify associated potential candidate genes for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects. Body weight records at birth (BW0)  2 to 3 months of age (BW23)  and 13 to 14 months of age (BW1314) were available for 250 173  42 632 and 54 768 female animals  respectively. The number of animals with phenotypic records at all three age intervals was 15 234. Animals were born between 2004 and 2016  and kept in 56 large-scale dairy cattle test-herds  which were located in the German federal states of Mecklenburg-Westpommerania and Berlin-Brandenburg. For the 250 173 calves  the gestation length of their dams ranged from 265 to 295 days (average: 279.4 days). For BW0  we discarded birth weights above 60 kg or below 20 kg. For the detection of outlier data for BW23 and BW1314  we followed the approach by Yin et al. [] and calculated studentized residuals and corresponding Bonferroni  values (using the outlier test function in the R package “car” []). Records were excluded from further analyses when  values were lower than 0.05 or higher than 0.95. The pedigree file included 411 943 animals  born between 1948 and 2016. Among the Holstein cattle with BW records  13 827 calves with BW0 records  4246 calves with BW23 records  and 7920 heifers with BW1314 records  were genotyped. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Bovine 50 K SNP BeadChip V2 (4120 animals)  or the Illumina Bovine Eurogenomics 10 K low-density chip (11 801 animals). Animals with low-density genotypes were imputed to the 50 K chip (according to the routine procedure for official national genetic evaluations []). Finally  for all the genotyped cattle  45 613 SNPs were available that had a call rate higher than 95%  a minor allele frequency higher than 0.01  and did not deviate significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.001). Only SNPs located on  autosomes (BTA) were considered. Furthermore  we discarded animals with more than 95% identical genotypes. Quality control of SNP data was done by using the GenABEL package in R []. In order to verify the impact of LD between SNPs on the inflation factors in GWAS  we applied the indep-pairwise option in PLINK []. We eliminated one SNP from pairs of SNPs that had a LD coefficient () higher than 0.25 []. The remaining SNPs after this elimination procedure were defined as pruned SNPs. The numbers of animals  numbers of the full SNPs  and numbers of pruned SNPs  are in Table . The genomic relationship matrix  was constructed as in [] based on the full SNP dataset  and then used for principal component analysis  in order to visualise possible population stratification for the 15 921 genotyped animals. The software package GCTA [] generated the first 20 principal components (PC). Then  k-means clustering was applied by including the first 10 PC  because the remaining 10 PC were not informative and overloaded k-means clustering. A multiple-trait animal model was defined  in order to infer the genetic components and to estimate breeding values for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects. In this regard  we applied restricted maximum likelihood (REML) via AIREMLf90 from the BLUPF90 software package []. The statistical Model 1 for the three BW traits (BW0  BW23  BW1314) in matrix notation was: where  is a vector of phenotypes for BW0  BW23  and BW1314 from 250 173  42 632 and 54 768 female animals  respectively;  is a vector of fixed effects  including herd  birth year  birth month  and the covariate (linear regression) gestation length for BW0  and age (in days) of the calves/heifers for BW23 and BW1314;  is a vector of direct additive-genetic effects  with   where  is the pedigree-based relationship matrix and  is the direct-genetic variance;  is a vector of random maternal-genetic effects  with   where  is the maternal-genetic variance;  is a vector of random maternal permanent environmental effects;  is a vector of random residual effects; and       and  are incidence matrices for       and   respectively. Estimated breeding values from Model  for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects were used to calculate de-regressed proofs (DRP) for the direct genetic (dDRP) and for the maternal genetic component (mDRP)  respectively  according to Garrick et al. []. Only the animals with a DRP weight greater than 0.2 were considered in ongoing GWAS (see Model ). The number of DRP records for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects is in Table . Since animal models generate breeding values for all the animals from the pedigree database  all these animals  including the phenotyped and non-phenotyped animals  were considered for DRP calculations  which means that an increased number of genotyped animals for DRP is available. Variance components and correlations for the three BW traits explained by SNPs on all the chromosomes were estimated via genomic REML (GREML)  as implemented in GCTA []. Model  was defined as follows: where   is a vector of phenotypes for BW0  BW23  and BW1314  and  is a vector of fixed effects including the same effects as specified in Model . The variance for additive genetic effects  was equal to   with  representing the genomic relationship  and  representing the variance explained by SNPs from the full dataset. For the estimation of covariance components in bivariate models  GCTA requires that the fixed effects are the same for both traits. Hence  we ran bivariate models for pairwise combinations of pre-corrected phenotypes for BW0  BW23  and BW1314. The pre-corrected phenotype for a specific genotyped animal was the sum of the estimated direct breeding value  the maternal breeding value  the maternal environmental effect  and the residual (i.e. output from Model ). The software package GCTA [] was also used to estimate SNP effects via linear mixed models with a random polygenic effect. The statistical Model  for single marker regression analysis was: where  is a vector of phenotypes  dDRP or mDRP for BW0  BW23  and BW1314;  is a vector of fixed effects including the same effects as specified in Model  for phenotypes as dependent variables  but for DRP   only considered the overall mean effect;  is the vector for SNP effects;  is a vector of polygenic effects with a variance–covariance structure of   where  is the genetic similarity matrix between individuals  and  is the polygenic variance;  is a vector of random residual effects with ; and     and  are incidence matrices for     and   respectively. According to the Bonferroni correction  the defined GWAS significant threshold was 0.05/N  where N refers to the number of SNPs. In addition to the Bonferroni correction  a less conservative adjusted  value  based on false discovery rate (FDR)  was calculated for each SNP []. The threshold for FDR significance was 0.05. The genetic similarity matrix  was constructed with different information sources. First  we created  based on the pedigree relationship matrix   as generated from AIREMLF90. Second  the construction of  was based on the genomic relationship matrix . Due to possible undesired effects of SNP double-counting []  alternative -matrices excluded all SNPs from the chromosome on which the candidate SNP is located. This strategy is defined as “leave-one-chromosome-out” (LOCO) []. Since the length of bovine chromosomes is not constant  many SNPs on the large chromosomes are excluded. Hence  SNPs located on the large chromosomes BTA1 to 11 (these chromosomes contain more than 1500 SNPs) were separated into two segments per chromosome. The modified LOCO approach (LOCO_SEG40  i.e. the 22 segments from chromosomes 1–11 plus the remaining 18 chromosomes) constructed matrices using all SNPs  except those from the respective chromosome segment (for BTA1 to BTA11)  or excluding all SNPs from the whole chromosome (for BTA12 to BTA30). In addition  chromosomes were separated into smaller segments according to the number of SNPs with (a) segments including 90–100 SNPs (a total of 441 segments<U+2009>=<U+2009>LOCO_SEG441)  and (b) segments including 47–50 SNPs (a total of 864 segments<U+2009>=<U+2009>LOCO_SEG864). In order to account for the loss in similarity due to the deleted chromosome in LOCO  the first 20 PC were included as covariates (LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>PC20). However  consideration of 20 PC combined with the LOCO -matrix implies partial overlap of genomic information. Hence  as a further alternative  we focussed on principal component analyses for the matrix from each chromosome  and the first 3  10 or 20 PC were included as covariates (LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC3  LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC10  and LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC20  respectively). All the similarity matrices (matrix  LOCO matrix  and matrix from each chromosome) as mentioned above were constructed based on the full SNP dataset. An additional LOCO scenario using the pruned SNPs (LOCO_prune) was considered  in order to test the effect of LD between SNPs on inflation. We used the inflation factor () as evaluation criterion for the different approaches  which was calculated based on the  statistic for the -th SNP: The expected inflation factor of value 1 indicates sufficient correction for population stratification. A value above 1.05 indicates inflation in the sample []  and thus that the detected genome-wide associations might be false positives. Genetic variances for each chromosome were estimated via GREML using the full SNP dataset  and applying GCTA []. The univariate Model  was: where  and  are vectors of phenotypes and fixed effects  respectively  as introduced in Model ;  is the additive genetic effect with variance of   where  is the genomic relationship matrix constructed from SNPs located on chromosome   and  is the variance explained by SNPs on chromosome ;  is the additive genetic effect due to all the SNPs except those on chromosome ;  is the residual effect; and     and  are incidence matrices for    and   respectively. The heritability for each chromosome is equal to the ratio of  divided by the sum including the variance components from all SNPs on chromosome  plus the variance components from all other SNPs plus the residual variance. The database (version UMD3.1) including gene locations  start positions and end sites for all bovine genes was downloaded from Ensembl []. Originally  24 616 gene ID entries were available in the database. However  only the 17 545 genes on BTA1 to 29 with valid evidences for gene ontology [  ] were considered in subsequent analyses. First  SNPs used for GWAS (i.e. the full SNP dataset) were mapped to the genes  by applying the MAGMA software []  and considering a window 100 kb upstream and downstream for each gene. In the next step  a test statistic for each gene was generated by summing -<U+2009>2log( values) from a set of SNPs within the aforementioned window. This test followed a Chi square distribution []. Also  the -value for each of the 17 545 genes was calculated  and further adjusted according to the FDR []. Only the genes with a FDR lower than 5% were considered as significantly associated with one of the BW traits. Then  functional classification analyses were conducted for the significant candidate genes  based on information from the PANTHER database []. Direct pedigree-based heritabilities (i.e. using the -matrix) for BW traits were moderate to high: 0.46 for BW0  0.37 for BW23  and 0.48 for BW1314 (Table ). Similar heritabilities were reported in previous quantitative genetic studies for BW [    ]. Interestingly  the maternal genetic component had also a moderate contribution  even for BW1314 recorded later in life. Maternal heritabilities of 0.14  0.11 and 0.13 were found for BW0  BW23  and BW1314  respectively. Although the genomic relationship matrix () takes the Mendelian sampling term into account  direct genomic heritabilities (Model ) i.e. 0.33 for BW0  0.19 for BW23  and 0.22 for BW1314 were lower compared to the pedigree-based heritabilities estimated with the -matrix (Model ). The lower heritabilities estimated with the -matrix could be due to incomplete LD between SNPs on the 50 K SNP chip and/or very different sample sizes used for the estimations. An explanation for the overestimated pedigree-based heritabilities could be the occurrence of confounding between environmental effects and pedigree relationships []. Direct genetic correlations between the three BW traits estimated from genomic relationships (0.51 between BW0 and BW23  0.33 between BW0 and BW1314  0.47 between BW23 and BW1314) were slightly higher than those based on pedigree information. The k-means clustering approach (using the first 10 PC) created three clusters including 856 cows (cluster 1)  14 305 cows (cluster 2) and 760 cows (cluster 3). Genetic distances between animals based on the two most important PC (the first two PC that contribute to genetic variation) are shown in Fig. . Our study included Holstein dairy cattle from only two neighbouring German breeding organizations. When tracing back to the ancestors of the calves and heifers from the three clusters  we found that animals in clusters 1  2 and 3 were daughters from 2  890  and 11 sires  respectively. One specific influential sire (Gunnar) in cluster 1 had 855 daughters  whereas another sire (Raik) in cluster 1 had only one daughter in cluster 1 and one daughter in cluster 2 (i.e. the only black dot that overlaps with the red dot in Fig. ). The 760 calves and heifers in cluster 3 were daughters from 11 different sires. One specific sire (Guarini) had 750 daughters in cluster 3  and the remaining 10 sires only had one daughter each. The maternal grandsire of the nine daughters was Guarini. Sires in cluster 2 originated from various countries  but more than 75% calves and heifers had German and Dutch sires. The remaining 25% females were daughters of sires from 12 other countries. The average number of daughters per sire in cluster 2 was quite small (on average only 16.09). In contrast  the calves and heifers allocated to clusters 1 and 2 were mainly daughters from only two German sires. Consequently  as expected from the pedigree structure  genetic distances between animals within clusters 1 and 2 were short. Hence  the stratification that was observed in the genotyped calves and heifers was mainly due to the size and structure of the half-sib groups. The effect of breeding organization (geographical location) on population stratification was of minor importance  because genotyped animals in all clusters represented both breeding organisations quite equally. Plot of principal components (PC) 1 and 2 for 15 921 genotyped cows PC1 and PC2 only explained 1.53 and 1.13% of the total genetic variation  respectively. Consequently  we observed several overlaps between the three clusters  especially for animals allocated to clusters 2 and 3. In other studies  population stratification occurred when various breeds were pooled in the same GWAS []  or because of obvious differences in breeding and selection strategies []. In addition  family structure  especially in large families with many closely related paternal half-sibs  generated false positive SNP effects. In this regard  in a preliminary GWAS without considering any polygenic effects  we detected a large number of more than 2000 significant SNPs (after Bonferroni correction)  and the inflation factor was equal to 6.04. The number of significant SNPs that contributed to direct genetic effects for the three BW traits (results from Model ) are listed in Table . Evaluation criteria for all similarity matrices are provided for BW0 only. The general trend in terms of number of significant SNPs and inflation factors for BW23 and BW1314 was in agreement with corresponding similarity matrices for BW0. Inflation factors were largest when using LOCO for the construction of the genetic similarity matrix. This was the case for both types of dependent variables  i.e. phenotypes (inflation factor<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.22) and dDRP (inflation factor<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.19). The number of significant SNPs and inflation factors decreased slightly when SNPs on BTA1 to BTA11 were partitioned into two segments (LOCO_SEG40). A further decrease in inflation factor was observed when the number of segments (LOCO_SEG441 and LOCO_SEG864) increased  associated with a reduction of significant SNPs. LOCO plus the first 20 PC of the overall -matrix as covariates identified a quite fairly large number of 73 significant SNPs  and contributed to large inflation factors (1.90 for phenotypes and 1.87 for dDRP). The inclusion of 20 PC of chromosome-wide -matrices as fixed regressions in the model (LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC20) decreased the number of significant SNPs  and the inflation factor was close to 1. Inflation factors and number of detected significant SNPs were substantially larger for  (phenotype: 1213 SNPs according to FDR  <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>1.92) compared to  (phenotype: 7 SNPs according to FDR  <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.96). Such obvious differences were not expected  because  is the realized relationship matrix and  is the expected relationship matrix. Models with  and LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC produced inflation factors that were equal to 1.0 or slightly lower than 1.0. Generally  a near identical number of significant SNPs was found in the -matrix scenario and LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC scenarios. The number of significant SNPs was larger for BW0 than for BW1314 or BW23. Pruning the SNPs according to low LD decreased inflation factors slightly. This was the case for all three BW traits  regardless of whether phenotypes or dDRP were used as dependent variables. For example  when the phenotype of BW0 was the dependent variable  inflation factors decreased from 2.22 (LOCO) to 1.97 (LOCO_prune). The decrease in inflation factor was even smaller for BW23 and BW1314  which indicated that high LD between SNPs was not the main reason for the large number of false positive SNPs in our dataset. Based on our results  it is imperative to correct for population stratification in the German Holstein population via  or -similarities (i.e. the LOCO_CHR_PC-scenarios). GWAS that include multiple breeds and ignore population structure  increased spurious LD  which led to an inflation of false positive signals [    ]. Therefore  PC and genetic relationships [] were included in the GWAS to prevent spurious associations. Yang et al. [] compared linear mixed models by including or not candidate markers and recommended exclusion of candidate markers from the -matrix because this improved statistical power. However  for the German Holstein population with many closely related animals  LOCO overestimated SNP effects  which indicated that the -matrix from LOCO cannot capture all of the family relatedness. Correlations between the off-diagonal elements from the “full” -matrix and the LOCO -matrix ranged from 0.98 to 1.0  but the LOCO -matrix slightly underestimated the genomic relationships between animals. This underestimation was identified because the regression coefficients were always smaller than 1.0 when regressing relationships from the “full ” on relationships from the “LOCO-”. Most of the significant SNPs for direct genetic effects on the three BW traits were located on BTA5 (Table ). Manhattan and Q–Q plots for direct genetic effects for the three BW traits based on different similarity matrices are presented in Additional file . For dDRP of BW23  only two SNPs on BTA5 were significant. Both SNPs were detected using the -matrix. SNP - was also significant when applying LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC. Only two SNPs (- and -) on BTA5 significantly contributed to the three BW traits. SNP - was significant  regardless of the approach applied. However  SNP - was significant only when the -matrix was considered. The pleiotropic SNP (-) on BTA5  and the significant SNP on BTA18 (---)  also contributed significantly to BW changes in genotyped Holstein dairy cows in the US []. On BTA18  SNP --- was significantly associated with body shape  body size  dystocia  longevity  lifetime economic merit []  and calving difficulty []. The four significant SNPs  i.e. --- for BW0 and BW1314  --- for BW0  --- for BW0  and --- for BW0  had a significant impact on BW []  live weight []  carcass retail beef yield []  and hot carcass weight [] in beef and crossbred beef cattle. For maternal genetic effects  only three significant SNPs according to the FDR threshold were identified when using LOCO plus chromosome-wide PC (Table ). Two SNPs located on BTA4 and one SNP on BTA19 influenced BW0 significantly (Table ). Regarding maternal genetic effects at later age points for BW23 and BW1314  no significant SNP was detected. The Manhattan plots for maternal genetic effects on BW0 are in Fig. . In a study conducted in crossbred beef cattle []  the significant SNP --- on BTA4 explained 2.67% of the phenotypic variation for lean rate. The significant SNP - on BTA19 was identified as a marker for a QTL that controls fat percentage []. According to the infinitesimal model for maternal effects on calving performance []  many genes with small effects influenced the maternal effect on BW. In this regard  the most significant SNP on BTA 19 explained only 0.14% of the mDRP variance for BW0. Manhattan plot from GWAS for maternal genetic effects on birth weight. : Genomic relationship matrix; LOCO<U+2009>+<U+2009>CHR_PC3: leave-one-chromosome-out plus 3 principal components based on the chromosomal genomic relationship matrix. The red line is the significance threshold line for the Bonferroni correction of 5%  and the green dots represent significant SNPs according to a false discovery rate of 5% Correlations between SNP effects (using DRP and the -matrix in Model ) for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects were -<U+2009>0.15 for BW0  -<U+2009>0.27 for BW23  and -<U+2009>0.62 for BW1314. Antagonistic correlations between SNP effects for direct genetic and maternal genetic effects for each chromosome were identified for all three BW traits  except for BW0 (0.01) on BTA16 (Fig. ). In agreement with correlations that take the SNPs on all the chromosomes into account  and in agreement with pedigree-based correlations  antagonistic relationships between direct genetic and maternal genetic effects were most obvious for BW1314. If we focus on the functional region on BTA5 (i.e. between 105 445 909 and 107 612 671 bp)  the direct-maternal correlations based on the effects of 46 SNPs were equal to -<U+2009>0.04 for BW0  0.06 for BW23  and -<U+2009>0.87 for BW1314. Correlations between direct genetic and maternal genetic marker effects for body weight recorded at birth (BW0)  at 2 to 3 months of age (BW23) and at 13 to 14 months of age (BW1314) Genomic heritabilities for the three BW traits across the 29 bovine autosomes (results from Model ) are in Fig. . For BW0  genomic heritability was highest (0.03) when the SNPs on BTA5 were considered and decreased to 0.001 when those on BTA26 were considered. BTA5 and BTA26 explained 9.92 and 0.31% of the total genomic variance for BW0  respectively. Genomic heritabilities higher than 0.015 were estimated for BTA2  4  5  7  11  and 25. When comparing chromosomal genomic variances with GWAS results for BW0 (see Additional file a and c)  the proportion of explained genomic variance increased as the number of significant SNPs per chromosome increased. For BW23  genomic heritabilities were lower than 0.001 for BTA2  15  and 28  higher than 0.015 for BTA3  9  19 and 21  but significant SNPs were detected only on BTA5 (see Additional file e). For BW1314  the highest genomic heritability (0.02) was found for BTA7  but significant SNPs were detected on BTA3  5  8  16  and 18 (see Additional file g)  for which genomic heritabilities were higher than 0.012 for BTA3  5  8  and 18 and only 0.007 for BTA16. Chromosomal genomic heritabilities for direct genetic effects of body weights recorded at birth (BW0)  at 2 to 3 months of age (BW23) and at 13 to 14 months of age (BW1314). The red bars represent chromosomes with genomic heritabilities higher than 0.015 Heterogeneous chromosomal contributions were also reported for BW in Korean beef cattle []. Consistent with the latter study  we found variations in chromosome-wise BW variances for the same chromosomes at different ages. Hence  such changes in genomic variances indicate that the genetic mechanisms underlying BW differ with age  i.e. that different genes are “switched on or off” during the growth period. We have identified some chromosomes that explain more than 0.015% of the total genomic variance  although no significant SNP was detected (BTA9 for BW23 and BTA7 for BW1314)  which indicates polygenic contribution to BW on these chromosomes. In contrast to []  we found weak negative covariances between chromosome-wise genomic effects in our data  because the proportions of the sum of chromosome-wise variances to total genomic variances reached 100.81% for BW0  106.56% for BW23  and 101.41% for BW1314. Linear associations between chromosome length and chromosomal genomic variances were weak for BW0 and BW1314  with R values of 0.20 and 0.21  respectively  and null for BW23 (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02). Weak associations between chromosome length and chromosomal genomic variances indicate that the QTL for BW are not evenly distributed across the genome []. The identified potential candidate genes that significantly influence direct genetic effects on BW are in Additional file . These candidate genes are located on 12 chromosomes: BTA3  4  5  7  8  11  13  18  19  23  25 and 29  which BTA5 and BTA18 carrying more than ten. Overall  for the three BW traits  76 potential candidate genes had adjusted  values lower than 0.05 (according to FDR)  with 51 significant genes for BW0  12 for BW23  and 38 for BW1314; these figures reflect the smaller number of significant SNPs detected in the GWAS for BW at later ages. Six genes contributed significantly to the three BW traits and 12 more contributed to both BW0 and BW1314  but only one more gene  i.e.  () had a significant effect on both BW0 and BW23. Low to moderate genetic correlations between BW traits at different age points  but with some overlapping between significant genes  could indicate pleiotropic effects of the candidate genes. Some of the potential candidate genes on BTA18 for BW traits are known to be involved in calving performance and conformation traits. For example  Abo-Ismail et al. [] reported that  () and  are highly associated with body conformation traits and  ()   and  contributes to calving ease. Purfield et al. [] showed that  and  contain one and two significant missense variants  respectively  that are associated with calving difficulty in a mixed bull population including Holstein–Friesian  Charolais and Limousin. Since the above-mentioned six genes also influence birth weight  the calving difficulties in these breeds are mainly due to increased BW of the newborn []. Our analyses revealed that the identified potential candidate genes were involved in 12 biological processes (Fig. ): cellular processes (30 genes)  metabolic mechanisms (14 genes)  biological regulations and responses to stimuli (10 genes)  growth (one gene)  and body developmental processes (four genes). The latter four genes were  () and  ()   ()  and o ().  and  belong to the fibroblast growth factor family  which plays an important role in a variety of biological processes  including angiogenesis  morphogenesis  tissue regeneration  and oncogenesis []. Another significant gene  i.e.  () is involved in the activation and degradation of polypeptide hormones and growth factors [].  produces troponin T protein in the mammalian fast skeletal muscle  with causal effects on Ca muscle contractions [].  regulates the diameter and shape of collagen fibrils  which suggest an effect on bone formation []. Biological processes for direct genetic effects on body weight at different ages Four potential candidate genes on BTA19  i.e.  (SLC35B1)  - ()   ()  and  ()  were significantly associated with birth weight (see Additional file )  although only one significant SNP was detected on BTA19. The biological functions of  and  remain unknown.  is an important regulator of luminal epithelial cell proliferation [] and is associated with various cancers.  affects cell growth and survival []. None of these four genes overlapped with the candidate genes identified for direct genetic effects. Ignoring the population structure of Holstein–Friesian in the GWAS increased the number of false positive SNPs. Population structure was corrected properly when using  and LOCO plus chromosome-wide PC in the statistical models for the GWAS. The number of significant SNPs increased when DRP instead of phenotypes were used as dependent variables. Two SNPs on BTA5 influenced direct genetic effects significantly for BW at the three ages measured. Chromosomes with a larger number of significant SNPs had higher direct chromosomal heritabilities. Gene annotation analysis identified 76 potential candidate genes that are involved in 12 biological processes  which indicates that weight development is a very complex biological process. Regarding birth weight  only a limited number of significant SNPs and candidate genes were identified for the maternal genetic effects  which suggests an infinitesimal model for these effects. Antagonistic associations between direct genetic and maternal genetic effects were observed both when SNPs on all bovine chromosomes or on single chromosomes were considered  and for potential functional regions on BTA5.

However  the genes that underlie milk production quantitative trait loci (QTL) remain relatively poorly characterised. Here  we investigate a previously reported QTL located at the  locus on chromosome 5  for several milk production phenotypes  to better understand its underlying genetic and molecular causes. Using a population of 29 350 taurine dairy cows  we conducted association analyses for milk yield and composition traits  and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield  milk fat concentration  and milk protein concentration.

Using the same gene expression dataset representing 357 lactating cows  we also identified 38 novel RNA editing sites in the 3' UTR of  transcripts. The extent to which two of these sites were edited also appears to be genetically co-regulated with lactation QTL  highlighting a further layer of regulatory complexity that involves the  gene. This locus presents a diversity of molecular and lactation QTL  likely representing multiple overlapping effects that  at a minimum  highlight the  gene as having a causal role in these processes. In much of the Western world  milk is primarily produced for human consumption by taurine cattle () dairy breeds. Within these breeds  many generations of selection have improved milk production capacity and efficiency. However  in spite of numerous recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) e.g.  [   ]  major QTL remain for which no causative gene has been definitively assigned. Several genes with substantial impacts on milk yield are known  including  []   []   []   []  and  []. Recently  as part of work presented elsewhere []  we performed a genome-wide association analysis for milk volume in 4982 mixed breed cattle using a BayesB model [  ] and a panel of 3695 variants selected as tag-SNPs representing expression QTL (eQTL) from lactating mammary tissue. Of the top three loci explaining the greatest proportion of genetic variance in this model  genes representing the top and second to top effects have been well described for their role in milk production ( and  respectively [  ])  whereas no causative gene appears to have been definitively assigned for the third signal on chromosome 5 between 75 and 76 Mbp. This locus broadly overlaps QTL that were reported previously for milk yield [  ]  milk protein yield [  ]  milk protein concentration [    ]  and milk fat concentration [  ]. Although no gene has been definitively implicated  Pausch et al. [] noted significant markers that were located adjacent to the     and  genes  and proposed the latter as the most likely candidate based on its proximity to the top associated variant. Other studies have proposed  due to its high level of expression in the mammary gland [  ]  or involvement in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway [  ]. Other nearby genes that have been suggested to cause these effects also include  [] and  []. Given these observations  and the magnitude and diversity of effects at this locus  the aim of this study was to investigate this region on chromosome 5 in detail. By combining information on milk yield and composition with gene expression data from a large bovine mammary RNA sequence dataset  we highlight multiple lactation  gene expression  and RNA-editing QTL that segregate at this locus  and present  as the most likely causative gene responsible for these effects. All cows that had been genotyped using the Geneseek Genomic Profiler (GGP) LDv3 or LDv4 chips  and for which herd test phenotypes were available  were targeted in the current study (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>29 350). These animals were selected because  based on preliminary sequence-based association analyses not reported here  these panels had been enriched with 365 polymorphisms identified as tag-variants of the chromosome 5 lactation QTL (spanning a region from 74.8 to 76.2 Mbp; [see Additional file ]). These variants included 30 SNPs from the Illumina BovineSNP50 chip (50 k)  which were added to assist with imputation by increasing the overlap between the GGP and 50 k panels. Tag-variants were targeted as custom content using a scheme that attempted to genotype sites in both orientations (two primers per site)  resulting in 341 custom markers on the LDv3 chip  and 342 on the LDv4 chip for this locus. The breed composition of the animals used for these analyses comprised 8930 HF  3599 J  and 15 652 HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J cows  for which breed proportion was based on pedigree records  and purebreds were defined as animals that had a breed proportion higher than 13/16. We also included 1169 cows with minor proportions of Ayrshire ancestry. Phenotypes were calculated from animal herd-test records for the three yield traits plus fat and protein concentration in milk. These phenotypes were generated using herd-test data from the first lactation  adjusted by using an ASReml-R [] model with birth year  age at calving  breed  and heterosis as linear covariates  stage of lactation as a fixed effect  season/herd as an absorbed fixed effect  and animal as a random effect. Herd test records were sampled using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy on a combination of Milkoscan FT6000 (FOSS  Hillerød  Denmark) and Bentley FTS (Bentley  Chaska  USA) instruments. Genotypes for 29 350 animals were imputed to whole-genome sequence (WGS) resolution in the window of interest using Beagle 4 [] as described previously [  ]. Briefly  a reference population of 565 animals  comprising Holstein-Friesians  Jerseys  and crossbred cattle  was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument to yield 100-bp reads. Read mapping to the UMD 3.1 bovine reference genome was conducted using the BWA MEM 0.7.8 software []  followed by variant calling using GATK HaplotypeCaller 3.2 []. Variants were phased using Beagle 4 []  and those with poor phasing metrics (allelic R<U+2009><<U+2009>0.95) were excluded  yielding 12 867 variants. Quality control filtering to remove variants with a MAF lower than 0.01% (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>673) or Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium p-values below 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>461) resulted in a final set of 11 733 variants. As described above  the imputation window was enriched for custom  physically genotyped variants on the GGP-LDv3/4 chips  markedly increasing the scaffold density at this location. Imputed genotypes for 639 822 autosomal SNPs on the Illumina BovineHD SNPchip were used to calculate a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) for the 29 350 animals of interest  using GCTA (version 1.91.3beta) [  ]. The imputation step also used the Beagle 4 software  leveraging a BovineHD-genotyped reference population of 3389 animals. Heritabilities for all phenotypes were calculated using this GRM with the REML option in GCTA. A leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) GRM was also created excluding chromosome 5  and used in combination with the imputed variant set and phenotypes to perform a mixed linear model analysis (MLMA-LOCO) [] using GCTA. RNAseq data from lactating mammary gland biopsies representing 357 mixed-breed cows were generated as described previously []. Briefly  samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments  yielding 100-bp paired-end reads. These were mapped to the UMD 3.1 reference genome using TopHat2 (version 2.0.11) []. The Stringtie software (version 1.2.4) [] was used to quantify gene expression values for genes mapping to the window chr5:75–76 Mbp  yielding fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and transcripts per million (TPM) [] metrics. These calculations used gene models defined by the Ensembl gene build (release 81). Gene expression levels were also processed using the variance-stabilising transformation (VST) function implemented in the Bioconductor package DESeq (version 1.28.0) [] to produce expression data suitable for analysis using linear models. The 357 biopsied cows comprised  using the same breed definitions as above  224 HF  3 J  and 126 HF<U+2009>×<U+2009>J cows  with the remaining four cows having minor proportions of Ayrshire ancestry. WGS-resolution genotypes were imputed using the same WGS sequence reference described above in conjunction with a mixture of genotype panels (see Methods in []) for the 357 cows  yielding 12 825 variants in the 74.6–76.2 Mbp window. Removal of variants with more than 5% missing genotypes (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) or a MAF lower than 0.5% (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1643) resulted in a final set containing 11 146 variants. VST-transformed gene expressions were analysed for genes with FPKM<U+2009>><U+2009>0.1  using the GCTA MLMA-LOCO method described above. The GRM was calculated using physically genotyped variants from the BovineHD SNP chip for 337 cows  and imputed BovineHD genotypes for the remaining 20 cows based on an Illumina SNP50 platform scaffold. RNA editing in the 3'-UTR of the  gene was investigated in the discovery set of nine animals from []  these animals having been previously sequenced using both RNAseq and WGS methodologies. Editing sites were identified using custom scripts [] and by manual inspection of WGS and RNAseq BAM files for each animal. Sites were considered to represent RNA edits where: (1) an A-to-G variant was present in the RNAseq reads  but was absent from the WGS reads  and (2) had at least five reads containing ‘G’ at the position in every animal. This yielded 38 candidate edited sites. Following the recommendations of Ramaswami et al. [] for non- sites  the 38 candidate sites were examined for the presence of 5' mismatches  simple repeats  homopolymer runs = 5 bp  or splice junctions within 4 bp; however  none of the candidates were impacted by these filters  and all 38 were retained for further analyses. Having determined the positions of variant sites  the rate of editing at each site was quantified in the larger ‘quantification set’ of 353 cows [] with RNA editing phenotypes for each site generated by transforming editing proportions using the logit function. RNA editing QTL discovery was performed using these phenotypes by performing MLMA-LOCO  incorporating the same GRM and imputed WGS genotypes used for eQTL discovery (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>353 animals). RNA secondary structure around the edited sites was predicted using dot-plots as described by []. The sequence that contained all 38 edited sites and an additional 800 bp upstream and downstream was extracted and then plotted against its complement  with dots placed where at least 11 of 15 nucleotides surrounding a point were complementary. Diagonal lines in the resulting plot indicate regions of extended complementarity  which therefore have the potential to form double-stranded secondary structures. Manual examination of the WGS BAM files suggested the presence of a copy-number variant (CNV) located downstream of   mapping to chr5:75 781 300–75 782 800. Copy numbers were estimated from WGS reads for each of the 560 cattle using the software package CNVnator (version 0.3) []  based on sequence read depth. Thresholds for genotype calling of the CNV were set based on the histogram of the trimodal distribution of the copy number (CN) estimates  with a homozygous deletion being called when CN<U+2009><<U+2009>0.95  heterozygous 0.95<U+2009>=<U+2009>CN<U+2009><<U+2009>1.95  and homozygous wild type when CN<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.95. CNV genotypes were imputed into a larger population (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>29 350)  for use in association analyses  using Beagle version 4.1 []  and the reference population of 560 cattle described above. Combining the reference genotype calls with the imputed population yielded a set of 31 950 animals for use in MLMA-LOCO analyses  as described above. Fine mapping of milk yield and protein concentration QTL at the chr5:75–76 Mbp locus was performed using imputed sequence genotypes (see Methods) representing 29 350 cows. Sequence data were imputed using Beagle4 [] (74.8–76.2 Mbp; 11 733 markers)  and phenotypes were produced from herd-test records (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>29 350 cows) from the animals’ first lactations to derive values for milk yield (MY)  protein yield (PY)  fat yield (FY)  protein concentration (PC)  and fat concentration (FC; see Methods). Mixed linear model association (MLMA) analyses were conducted using GCTA (version 1.91.3beta) []. The top associated variant for each of the five phenotypes is in Table . All QTL were significant at the genome-wide threshold 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. The most significant QTL was identified for PC  followed by FC and MY  and the least significant QTL was detected for FY. QTL for PC and MY are illustrated in Fig. . The genetic context of milk trait QTL. Panels  and : QTL for the herd-test-derived phenotypes protein concentration () and milk yield (). Colours represent LD (R) with the most significant marker on a continuous scale  with colours provided in the legend for every 0.2 R. Panel  shows the locations of genes mapping into this window (bottom) and the numbers of RNAseq reads mapping at positions across the window (top) AI-REML analysis was performed  using a GRM calculated over all the autosomes  to estimate genomic heritabilities (; Table ). To investigate these QTL further  the linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistics () between each pair of top variants were calculated (Fig. ). Strong LD was observed between the top variants for MY  FC  and PC (MY vs FC tag variants <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.887; MY vs PC tag variants <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.991). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) observed between the top associated markers for each phenotype (). Markers are identified using dbSNP reference SNP ID numbers. Phenotypes are as in Table  To assess potential functional effects of the statistically implicated QTL variants  all polymorphisms in strong LD (<U+2009>>0.9) with the top-ranked QTL variants for each trait were extracted (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>365 variants)  and analysed using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) []. Most of these variants (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>247) were predicted to map outside of genes  whereas 113 were predicted to be intronic  with 58 in transcript ENSBTAT00000009911.4 () and 55 in ENSBTAT00000011947.5 (). The remaining five variants were predicted to be synonymous mutations  with two in ENSBTAP00000009911.4 () at positions p.Gln145<U+2009>=<U+2009>and p.Tyr243<U+2009>=<U+2009>  and three in ENSBTAP00000011947.5 () at positions p.Asn58<U+2009>=<U+2009>  p.Tyr405<U+2009>=<U+2009>  and p.Glu424<U+2009>=<U+2009>. Importantly  none of the highly associated variants were predicted to change the protein sequences of genes  suggesting a regulatory effect as the likely mechanism(s) of the QTL. To look for -eQTL effects that might explain the lactation QTL  gene expression levels were calculated for genes in the chr5:75–76 Mbp window  using RNAseq data representing lactating mammary tissue biopsies from 357 cows (Fig. c). Expression levels in FPKM and TPM were calculated using Stringtie (version 1.2.4) [] and are in Table  for transcripts for which FPKM was higher than 0.1. The gene with the highest expression level was   which is consistent with previous observations in murine mammary RNAseq data []. Moderate expression was also observed for the candidate gene . However  the expression level of  was very low  at FPKM<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.406. The highest correlation between pairs of gene expression levels was observed for  and  (=<U+2009>0.545<U+2009>±0.077)  which is concordant with the published observation of a shared bidirectional promoter for these two genes []. Association mapping was conducted for the 11 expressed genes in Table . To this end  gene expression data were first scaled using the variance-stabilising transformation (VST) implemented in DESeq (version 1.28.0) []. A GRM was then calculated for the 357 cows representing the RNAseq dataset  and the MLMA-LOCO method was performed as described for the analysis of lactation traits. This yielded genome-wide significant eQTL for three genes:  (1.33<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)   (4.30<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  and  (5.85<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) (see Table  and Fig. ). All three genes were located within the peaks of their respective eQTL  demonstrating regulation in . QTL plots showing eQTL for the three genes that exhibit genome-wide significant -eQTL (Table ). From top to bottom  the three genes are       and  . Colours represent correlations for each marker with the top variant for that eQTL (see Fig.  for legend). Grey bands indicate the location of the gene for which the eQTL is displayed In cases in which genetic regulation of gene expression (i.e.  an eQTL) underlies a complex trait QTL  we expect that both QTL share similar association signals  with the most (and least) associated variants similar between phenotypes. To test whether any of the 11 expressed genes shared similarities with the milk QTL  Pearson correlations between the log p-values for each of the milk QTL and eQTL were calculated. Table  shows the QTL:eQTL correlations for all five phenotypes with three significant eQTL  plus the  gene  which did not yield a genome-wide significant eQTL  although it has been proposed as a candidate underlying this locus. The eQTL for  has <U+2009>>0.5 (>0.707) with three of the five milk phenotypes  while correlations for the neighbouring gene  are just below this level. Neither of the  or  genes exhibited high correlations with any milk QTL. The eQTL for  was also highly correlated with the  eQTL (=<U+2009>0.863<U+2009>±0.005). A similar picture is obtained when examining the LD between the top tag markers for each QTL  with high LD observed (Fig. ) among the tags for MY  FC  and PC with the tags for the  and  eQTL. Linkage disequilibrium between the top tag variants for milk trait QTL and co-located gene expression QTL. Three genes with significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>5×10) eQTL are included  along with the  [] that have previously been proposed as a candidate causative gene at this locus Examining Fig. a (repeated in Fig. a) suggested that protein concentration might be influenced by two co-located but mechanistically independent QTL  since a number of markers that are not in strong LD with the top marker nevertheless exhibit very small p-values (<1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). To investigate this possibility  the top associated marker (rs208375076) was fitted as a fixed effect and the MLMA-LOCO analysis repeated using the residual  PC phenotype (Fig. b). The new top marker (rs210293314) remained highly significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.30<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 after adjustment  9.31<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 before adjustment)  suggesting that it is tagging a different QTL. Adjusting the original protein concentration phenotype for rs210293314 and repeating the MLMA-LOCO analysis yielded the result shown in Fig. c. Here  the most significant marker was rs208086849  a variant that is largely statistically equivalent to the top rs208375076 marker from the original  unadjusted analysis (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.999). These observations suggest the presence of two QTL for milk protein percentage. The effect of fitting the top variant on protein concentration (–) and milk yield (–) QTL. The top panels  and  show the QTL with no marker adjustments fitted; the centre panels  and  show the QTL after fitting the top variant from the panel above; and the bottom panels  and  show the QTL after fitting the top variant from the centre panel above. The phenotypes were adjusted by fitting the following markers:  rs208375076   rs210293314   rs208473130   rs378861677 This analysis was repeated with the MY phenotype (Fig. d). This phenotype showed little evidence of a second co-locating QTL  where fitting the top associated marker (rs208473130) dropped the signal below the genome-wide significance threshold (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.36<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for marker rs378861677; Fig. e). However  adjusting the MY phenotype by fitting rs378861677 and repeating the MLMA-LOCO analysis resulted in an increase in significance for the top marker rs208473130  from 6.64<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to 8.63<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (Fig. f)  which suggests that there may indeed be an additional weak QTL  or the variant otherwise addresses some other confounding signal. The variants rs208086849 (from the PC analysis in the previous paragraph) and rs208473130 show very strong LD (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.991)  which suggests that both markers are in fact tagging the same QTL across PC and MY. In contrast  variants rs210293314 (PC analysis above) and rs378861677 show moderate to weak LD (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.332)  which suggests that the two signals tagged by these variants are genetically distinct. Most of the QTL were represented by common tag-variants  with minor allele frequencies (MAF) higher than 0.4 across the whole population (Table ). The two seemingly distinct PC QTL also segregated in both breeds  as do the PY and FC QTL. One of the two MY QTL  tagged by rs378861677  was uncommon in the Jersey population (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01)  and the FY QTL tagged by rs466308089 had a MAF of only 0.002 in Jersey cows. The minor allele of the latter QTL was also the rarest signal in the population overall  with a MAF of 0.031. Since at least two differentially segregating QTL were detected at the locus  they may be underpinned by different genes and/or molecular mechanisms. To assess whether the significant  co-locating  and  eQTL were themselves comprised of multiple  overlapping signals (i.e. multiple -eQTL driven by different regulatory elements)  the top associated variants were fitted as fixed effects to the gene expression phenotypes  and the analyses were rerun as above. This yielded new top markers with p-values of 8.87<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 1.75<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 respectively  suggesting that the expression of these two genes  if influenced by multiple regulatory factors  had weak effects  or were too heavily confounded by LD to differentiate clearly. To investigate how the eQTL might contribute to the multiple  co-locating PC QTL in comparative terms  the SNP-adjusted PC association results were used to calculate eQTL correlations  using the methodology described in the previous section. Notably  these analyses resulted in improved correlations with eQTL. The correlation between the -eQTL and the unadjusted PC phenotype was 0.754<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.009 (Figs.   a). However  using the phenotype adjusted for rs210293314 yielded a correlation of 0.807<U+2009>±0.007 (Fig. b). The same pattern was observed for the  gene  for which correlations improved from 0.689<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.011 to 0.843<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.006 (Fig. c  d). Applying the same approach to MY (unadjusted  and adjusted by rs37886167) similar results were obtained  albeit with only marginal increases: correlations with the  eQTL increased from 0.849<U+2009>±0.006 to 0.872<U+2009>±0.005  and correlations with the  eQTL increased from 0.681<U+2009>±0.011 to 0.713<U+2009>±0.010. Correlations between eQTL and the co-located protein concentration QTL for the genes  (left) and  (right). Panels on the top row are plotted against the original protein concentration QTL (Fig. a)  while panels on the bottom row are plotted against the phenotype after fitting rs210293314 (Fig. c) To investigate the possibility that secondary  co-locating PC and/or MY QTL might be caused by protein-coding variants  all variants in strong LD (<U+2009>>0.9) with rs210293314 (secondary PC tag-SNP) or rs378861677 (secondary MY tag-SNP) were analysed using VEP as described previously. Of the 260 variants captured by this analysis  two missense SNPs were identified in conjunction with rs378861677  both mapping to exon 2 of : rs211170554 (p.Asp129Asn) with a SIFT score of 0.88 (predicted tolerated)  and rs209917448 (p.Arg47Cys) with a SIFT score of 0.01 (predicted deleterious). In the absence of additional eQTL that might account for the secondary PC and MY signals  these results suggest a potential protein-coding-based mechanism for the MY effect  at least. Previous work [] had identified four RNA editing sites that mapped to the introns of . Here  while manually examining RNAseq and WGS sequence reads mapping to the gene  a surprising number of additional RNA edits were observed (see Methods). This included 38 novel A-to-G variant sites present in the RNAseq data  yet absent from the whole-genome sequence representing the nine cows for which both data sources were available. These sites were present in four clusters within the 3' UTR (Fig. )  which had been missed from our previously published genome-wide analysis [] because it was based only on reference annotations that failed to capture the full length 3' UTR sequence  which was evident when empirically derived gene structures from the mammary RNAseq data were used. Because the ADAR enzymes responsible for adenosine-to-inosine editing (A-to-G in sequence reads) target double-stranded RNA [  ]  we predicted the potential for the sequences around the edited sites to form double-stranded RNA. The dot-plot in Fig.  shows that  of the 38 edited sites (red dashed lines)  37 (97.4%) sit within regions of extended complementarity (diagonal black lines)  thus having the potential to form double stranded secondary structures. Left: dotplot of the sequence from the  3'-UTR against its complement. Positions are relative to chr5:75 747 904. Black dots indicate that seven of the 11 surrounding nucleotides are complementary. Vertical dashed red lines indicate the locations of predicted RNA-editing sites. Sections of the region 2275–2452 are complementary to the regions 837–915  1178–1350  1591–1719  and 1757–1832  suggesting that the UTR is able to fold into multiple configurations. Right: the section of predicted double stranded sequence between 1184 and 1217 on the left strand (running upward)  and 2411–2444 on the right strand (running downward). Edited sites are coloured based on the strength of the edQTL at that site  from blue (not significant) to red (max P<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.22<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Sites are labelled with the correlation between the edQTL and the milk volume (MY) QTL after adjusting for marker rs208473130 As recently reported  we have observed that a proportion of RNA-edited bases are genetically modulated for some sites []. To investigate potential genetic regulation of RNA-editing on  transcripts  phenotypes for the proportion of reads edited were generated (see Methods)  to detect RNA editing QTL (edQTL [  ]). Using the MLMA-LOCO method as applied for the eQTL analysis described above  genome-wide significant edQTL (P<U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) were identified for 18 of the 38 sites. Because RNA editing may impact gene expression by different mechanisms [  ]  we investigated whether any edQTL were correlated with the eQTL for . One site  mapping to chr5:75 750 220  had a correlation of 0.849<U+2009>±0.005 between the -<U+2009>log p-values of the edQTL and the eQTL. This edQTL was also strongly correlated with the  eQTL (0.929<U+2009>±0.003). As an extension to the hypothesis that edQTL might underlie changes in gene expression (i.e. eQTL)  we reasoned that one or more of the milk phenotype QTL might also be impacted  as evidenced by the correlation values. Investigation of this hypothesis showed correlations  higher than 0.707 between edQTL and FC  PC  and PY (Table ). In addition  we found very strong correlations (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.9) between two edQTL (chr5:75 749 101 and chr5:75 750 335) and MY after adjusting for the genotype of marker rs208473130 (yield QTL illustrated in Fig. e  correlations in Fig. ). A strong correlation (0.822) was also detected between the edQTL for chr5:75 748 760 and the PC QTL after adjusting for marker rs208375076 (PC QTL illustrated in Fig. b). As with the analyses of candidate protein-coding variants  these results suggest other alternative (and likely overlapping) mechanisms that may account for the multiple QTL segregating at the chromosome 5 locus. Manual examination of the WGS alignments at the locus also revealed read depth anomalies at approximately chr5:75 781 300–75 782 800. This analysis revealed a suspected 1.5 kbp deletion variant  located between the  and  genes (downstream of the 3' UTR of both genes given a ‘tail to tail’ orientation). To attempt to derive genotypes for this variant  the copy number at this site was estimated for 560 whole-genome sequenced cattle using CNVnator 0.3 []. The resulting estimates of copy number formed a trimodal distribution (Fig. a)  which suggested a biallelic variant that could be assumed to be inherited in a Mendelian fashion []. Although one pseudogene maps to the region (LOC788541 60S ribosomal protein L7)  the deleted segment appeared otherwise devoid of noteworthy genomic features.  Histogram of copy number genotype calls of 560 animals from CNVnator. Copy numbers follow a trimodal distribution  suggesting that the variant is bialleleic. Genotype classes are coloured in gold (homozygous deletion)  grey (heterozygous) and blue (homozygous wild-type).  Deletion variant genotypes plotted against the genotypes of the rs208086849 variant. The two variants are in strong LD (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.887). Points are jittered to increase visibility To investigate the candidacy of the deletion as a potential causative variant for one or more of the QTL in the region  genotypes were called from CNVnator copy number predictions (see Methods)  and the LD (R) between the deletion and top QTL variants was investigated. Strong LD (0.887) was observed with the top markers for MY (rs208473130) and PC (rs208375076)  as well as with rs208086849  the top variant for PC after adjusting for the secondary QTL (Fig. b). A slightly lower LD score was observed for FC (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.807). The deletion allele was more frequent than the reference allele in the NZ dairy population (deletion<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.547). The strong LD between the ~ 1.5 kbp deletion and key QTL tag variants qualified the variant as a potential candidate for these QTL; therefore  we imputed the variant into the association analysis population to test for association directly. Using the same MLMA-LOCO analysis method that was applied for other variants  significant associations (P<U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) were observed for PC (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.30<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  FC (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  and MY (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.18<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Although highly significant  when ranking all variants by  value  the deletion variant never ranked higher than the 400th most significant marker; however  given the very large number of associated variants in this region generally (><U+2009>800 in the top 20 orders of magnitude for PC)  and the fact that some of the read-depth-based genotype calls may be erroneous  the deletion remains a plausible candidate variant for future consideration of these QTL. We report QTL mapping of a chromosome 5 locus for several milk yield and composition traits  with a diversity of gene expression and RNA editing QTL that could underpin these effects. We note  in particular  that some phenotypes exhibit multiple QTL that probably have distinct genetic causes. The FC and PC QTL are both in high LD with the MY QTL  which suggests that these effects may be mediated by changes in the total volume of milk produced without concomitant changes in fat or protein production. The fat and protein yield QTL are not in LD with either each other or with milk yield. However  these two QTL are less significant than the others by many orders of magnitude (see Table )  which suggests that the lack of LD may be due to insufficient power in the dataset to identify reproducible tag variants. However  it should be noted that the MAF for the FY QTL is much lower than those for the MY and PY QTL  which suggests that this signal may indeed be discrete from the other two yield signals. The frequencies of the various tag variants across the breeds is also of note  which suggests that the QTL are both shared  and unique to individual breeds. Several candidate causative genes have been previously proposed to underlie lactation effects at this locus  and based on the work presented here  we propose that one or both of the  and  genes are the likely candidates  with a predicted deleterious variant in the  gene also providing a potential candidate for milk yield QTL with a secondary effect. The  gene (ENSBTAG00000009064) encodes the common beta chain of the receptors for GM-CSF  interleukin-3  and interleukin-5  cytokines that are involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells []. The granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is produced in the mammary gland by alveolar macrophages [] where it enhances the bactericidal activity of milk neutrophils []. These receptors form a link in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway  operating via JAK2 and STAT5 []. The STAT5 proteins  especially STAT5A  are important for enabling mammopoiesis and lactogenesis [  ] and directly bind the gamma-interferon-activating sequence (GAS) found in the promoters of milk proteins such as beta-casein  []  beta-lactoglobulin []  and whey acidic protein in mice []. The importance of this pathway is further evidenced by associations with milk production traits observed at the  locus [    ]. Although the relevant ligands and subunits with which  forms complexes are unknown in the current context  mutations that impact downstream interactions with STAT5 proteins could be assumed to impact milk production/composition phenotypes. The  gene (ENSBTAG00000007531) encodes neutrophil cytosolic factor 4  which forms the p40-phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex []. This enzyme produces superoxide ()  a reactive oxygen species produced in phagocytic cells during the respiratory burst []  which is intended to kill invading fungi and bacteria [].  has been shown to be upregulated in mastitic mammary glands []  and two SNPs mapping to the  gene have been associated with elevated somatic cell scores (SCS) [  ]  a trait that is used as a surrogate phenotype for mastitis in dairy animals. Since cows suffering from mastitis produce smaller volumes of milk than healthy cows []  this provides a possible mechanism by which  could influence milk production. A more appealing mechanism is one that involves  or  but outside of a pathogen response context  given that the locus is better known for its impacts on milk production and composition in the absence of overt mammary infection. Both the  and  eQTL were correlated with the MY QTL  with the former showing stronger correlations (=<U+2009>0.849 compared to 0.682). Lower correlations were observed between the two eQTL and the PC QTL (=<U+2009>0.754 and 0.691)  however  removing one of the two apparent signals at this locus by fitting rs210293314 to the PC phenotype increased correlations for both candidate genes. Since no other genes showed similar patterns of co-association  we consider that one or both of these genes are the best candidates at this locus. The  gene was expressed very strongly in mammary samples (TPM<U+2009>=<U+2009>80.1)  and by comparison  at a much higher level than  (TPM<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.51). This observation suggests a critical role for -mediated signalling in lactation  and given the plausible biological linkages of  to these processes (via JAK-STAT signalling)  we favour  as the more likely of these two candidates. The  gene (ENSBTAG00000030650) was recently proposed by Pausch et al. [] as a candidate for milk fat and protein percentage QTL at ~75–76 Mbp on chromosome 5.  encodes thiosulfate sulfurtransferase  also known as rhodanese  a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the conversion of cyanide plus thiosulfate into thiocyanate plus sulfite []. It has been shown that the rhodanese enzyme (in misfolded form) can bind with 5S-rRNA  enabling its import into the mitochondria []. There appears to be limited literature implicating  in mammary development and milk production  and given that the gene maps downstream of association peaks in our dataset  and has no prominent eQTL by which to mediate these effects  a role for this gene seems unlikely for QTL in the NZ population. This does not preclude the involvement of the gene in other populations  however  we consider that the most parsimonious hypothesis is that these QTL are shared across populations  at least partially underpinned by regulatory variants modulating the expression of the  gene. Previously  we [] reported four RNA editing sites mapping to the  gene  one of which (chr5:75 739 106) showed a significant edQTL (smallest P<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.68<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). This site exhibited only modest correlations with the  eQTL  or with the milk yield or composition QTL []. In the current paper  we report the discovery of 38 additional RNA-editing sites mapping to the 3'-UTR of . These sites were not identified in the previous work since they map approximately 3 kbp downstream of the gene structure based on the Ensembl reference annotation. Two of the novel sites  chr5:75 749 101 and chr5:75 750 335  exhibited edQTL with correlations exceeding 0.9 with the milk yield QTL after adjusting for marker rs208473130. The correlation between the  eQTL and the same milk QTL was -<U+2009>0.173  which suggests that  if the lactation effects indeed derive from an RNA-editing-based mechanism  this mechanism is not wholly reflected by the gene expression data used to quantify the eQTL effects. We have examined a previously implicated chromosome 5 locus for milk yield and composition traits  and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield  protein concentration  and fat concentration. Using a large mammary RNA sequence resource  we have conducted eQTL mapping of the locus and show that expression of   a highly expressed gene involved in signalling pathways that are important to mammary development and lactation  appears to be responsible for these effects. RNA editing sites were also discovered in the 3'-UTR of   and edQTL for two of these are correlated with one of two co-located but differentially segregating milk yield QTL  which was also in strong LD with a predicted deleterious missense variant in the  gene. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the  gene  and showcase the mechanistic complexity of a locus that will require further statistical and functional dissection to catalogue the full multiplicity of effects.

In spite of the poor imputation accuracies  using iWGS instead of a lower density SNP chip increased the number of detected QTL and the estimated proportion of phenotypic variance explained by these QTL  especially when dosage scores were used instead of genotype scores. Thus  iWGS  even with poor imputation accuracy  can be used to identify possible interesting regions for fine mapping."

However  this requires imputation to WGS  often with a limited number of sequenced animals for the target population. The objective of this study was to investigate imputation to WGS in two pig lines using a multi-line reference population and  subsequently  to investigate the effect of using these imputed WGS (iWGS) for GWAS. Phenotypes and genotypes were available on 12 184 Large White pigs (LW-line) and 4943 Dutch Landrace pigs (DL-line). Imputed 660 K and 80 K genotypes for the LW-line and DL-line  respectively  were imputed to iWGS using Beagle v.4.1. Since only 32 LW-line and 12 DL-line boars were sequenced  142 animals from eight commercial lines were added. GWAS were performed for each line using the 80 K and 660 K SNPs  the genotype scores of iWGS SNPs that had an imputation accuracy (Beagle R) higher than 0.6  and the dosage scores of all iWGS SNPs. For the DL-line (LW-line)  imputation of 80 K genotypes to iWGS resulted in an average Beagle R of 0.39 (0.49). After quality control  2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (3.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) SNPs had a Beagle R higher than 0.6  resulting in an average Beagle R of 0.83 (0.93). Compared to the 80 K and 660 K genotypes  using iWGS led to the identification of 48.9 and 64.4% more QTL regions  for the DL-line and LW-line  respectively  and the most significant SNPs in the QTL regions explained a higher proportion of phenotypic variance. Using dosage instead of genotype scores improved the identification of QTL  because the model accounted for uncertainty of imputation  and all SNPs were used in the analysis. Imputation to WGS using the multi-line reference population resulted in relatively poor imputation  especially when imputing from 80 K (DL-line). In spite of the poor imputation accuracies  using iWGS instead of a lower density SNP chip increased the number of detected QTL and the estimated proportion of phenotypic variance explained by these QTL  especially when dosage scores were used instead of genotype scores. Thus  iWGS  even with poor imputation accuracy  can be used to identify possible interesting regions for fine mapping. Use of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data is expected to improve the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) because such data are expected to contain most of the causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  as was shown in dairy cattle populations by using WGS data of 234 bulls []. Improved QTL detection is even more important in pig breeding populations  since the QTL can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction in across- or multi-population scenarios []  which is especially relevant for pig breeding programs where cross-breeding is practised. To benefit from WGS data  a large population of animals with such data is needed. In spite of the decreasing costs of WGS []  it is still relatively expensive to sequence a large number of animals. A less expensive approach to increasing the number of animals with WGS data is to impute from lower density SNP chips to WGS. With imputation  a smaller group of sequenced animals is required and the majority of the population can be genotyped with a lower density and cheaper SNP panel. Then  low-density SNP genotypes are imputed to WGS using the sequenced animals as reference population. In dairy cattle  several studies have shown that imputation to WGS is reliable even with a limited number of sequenced animals in the reference population  e.g. [   ]. For example  for imputation from 777 K SNP genotypes to WGS  van Binsbergen et al. [] obtained an imputation accuracy evaluated by cross-validation within the reference population of 0.83 with 90 sequenced Holstein bulls. Bouwman and Veerkamp [] obtained an imputation accuracy  based on the correlation between true and imputed WGS (iWGS) of 0.83 for imputation using a multi-breed reference population consisting of 20 Holstein and 60 animals of three different breeds  and demonstrated that other breeds can improve imputation accuracy when the number of sequenced individuals from the target breeds is small. For most breeding companies  only a small number of animals is sequenced per line because  often  sequencing expenses must be divided across lines. In those cases  it might be beneficial to combine the WGS data across lines into one reference population for imputation. In addition to the size and composition of the reference population  accuracy of imputation depends on the size of the genotyping array  the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the reference and target population and the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the SNPs on the genotyping array [     ]. As a result  combining populations for imputation may not provide sufficient imputation accuracy in all populations. Inaccurate imputation can influence the results of follow-up analyses such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS)  especially when the accuracy of imputation is ignored in those analyses. Two approaches to account for imputation errors are to filter SNPs based on imputation accuracy prior to analysis or to use dosage scores in the analyses. Using dosage scores means that all imputed SNPs are included in the analysis  although the power to detect associations with poorly imputed SNPs will be low compared to using accurately imputed SNPs. So far  there is little information on the accuracy of imputation to iWGS using data of a commercial pig breeding population and on the effect of using iWGS genotype or dosage scores in a GWAS. Therefore  the objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the accuracy of imputation to WGS in two pig lines using a multi-line reference population and a limited number of sequenced animals available for the target lines; and (2) to investigate the effect of using imputed WGS genotypes versus dosage scores in a GWAS on QTL detection. The dataset used in this study was provided by Topigs Norsvin. Phenotypes for the number of teats recorded after birth on 12 184 Large White (LW-line) and 4943 Dutch Landrace (DL-line) pigs were available. We investigated this trait because records were available for both sexes and its heritability is relatively high  i.e. 0.4 []. The phenotypic records were pre-corrected for fixed effects  i.e. herd-year-of-birth  sex  and the random effect of litter  which were estimated with a pedigree-based linear model by Lopes et al. []. After correction the average numbers of teats (±<U+2009>SD) were 15.68 (±<U+2009>0.98) and 15.71 (±<U+2009>1.04) for the LW-line and DL-line  respectively. For both the LW-line and the DL-line  Geneseek-Neogen GPPHD 80 K SNP genotypes were available for all animals with phenotypic records. In addition  genotypes from the Affymetrix Axiom porcine 660 K SNP chip were available for the 120 sires with the largest number of offspring in the set of genotyped animals of the LW-line. Using the 120 sires as reference population  within-line imputation from 80 K to 660 K SNP genotypes was performed for all phenotyped animals from the LW-line using FImpute v2.2 software [] with the pedigree option. This resulted in an average imputation accuracy of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.99. Imputation from 80 K to 660 K SNP genotypes was not possible for the DL-line because none of the DL-line animals were genotyped with the 660 K SNP chip. To avoid confounding of results  imputation of the DL-line to 660 K using the LW-line 660 K reference population was not considered but for the subsequent GWAS  660 K genotypes for the DL-line were generated from the iWGS dataset. Quality control of the within-line genotypes (80 K and 660 K) consisted of excluding (1) insertions and deletions  (2) SNPs with a MAF lower than 0.01  (3) SNPs with a frequency lower than 0.1 for either one of the three genotypes  and (4) SNPs with missing map information (based on Sscrofa10.2). Whole-genome sequence data was available for 168 of the most influential boars with many offspring for 10 commercial Dutch and Norwegian (Topigs Norsvin) lines  including 36 individuals originating from the Landrace breed  39 from the Large White breed  60 from the Duroc breed  16 from a synthetic breed  13 from the Pietrain breed  one Large White Dutch Landrace crossbred animal  and three animals of unknown origin. The reference population included 12 DL-line animals and 32 LW animals  corresponding to the target populations. One DL-line animal and nine LW-line animals had both whole-genome sequence data and high-density genotypes. Raw sequence data were mapped to the pig genome build Sscrofa10.2 (Ensembl72) [] using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-mem algorithm []. The average sequence coverage across the complete reference population was 11.6 fold. SNPs  short insertions and deletions were called with the GATK unified genotype-caller [] for the complete reference population using default settings  but  in addition  the standard minimum confidence threshold was set to 30.0  the standard emittance confidence threshold was set to 20.0  and the target coverage threshold for down-sampling to coverage was set to 200. Subsequently  all detected variants were filtered using VCFtools []  retaining variants with read depth values (per individual) ranging from 4 to 35 and variants with an overall Phred Quality score higher than 20  excluding variants with more than 20% missing data  and removing insertions and deletions. In addition  the variants were thinned such that the distance between variant sites was not shorter than 3 bp. The final step included phasing the reference population and imputing missing genotypes in the sequence data using Beagle 4.1 with 10 phasing iterations []. Imputation of the 80 K genotypes of the DL-line and the 660 K genotypes of the LW-line to the iWGS was performed with Beagle 4.1 [] using the multi-line reference population. The default parameter settings for Beagle were used  except for setting the effective population size to 300 instead of the default of 1 million [] because it is much smaller in livestock than in humans [  ]. The accuracy of imputation at the SNP level was assessed by the Beagle R  which is the estimated squared correlation of the genotype score with the true genotype []. For further analyses  the same quality controls as for the 80 K and 660 K genotypes were applied to the iWGS data but one additional quality filter was applied to the iWGS scores to account for possible imputation errors by removing SNPs with a Beagle R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6. This threshold was chosen to maintain a balance between the average imputation accuracy and the number of SNPs removed. This filter was not applied to allele dosage scores  which were coded as any real value between 0 and 2  because dosage scores account for imputation uncertainty. A single SNP GWAS was performed with a mixed linear model using GCTA version 1.25.2 [  ]. The GWAS with iWGS dosage scores was performed with an adapted version of GCTA (patches provided and described in Additional file ). The model was as follows: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is the fixed effect of the SNP tested for association   is a vector containing the genotype scores or dosage scores   is a vector of random polygenetic effects  and  is a vector of residuals  which were assumed followed a normal distribution  with  as error variance. The vector  was assumed to follow a normal distribution   where  is the genomic relationship matrix and  is the genetic variance. To account for population structure and to prevent possible bias from fitting the same SNP twice  the genomic relationship matrix was computed based on all SNPs except those that were on the same chromosome as the tested SNP []. The genomic relationship matrices were computed as follows []: where () is the genotype coded 0  1  or 2 for the th SNP of the ()th individual   is the total number of markers  and  is the MAF of the th SN. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the th SNP was estimated as   where  is the estimated allele substitution effect. To account for population structure  the GWAS p-values for each SNP density were adjusted by their corresponding genomic inflation factors []  which were calculated for each SNP density as the median of the observed Chi squared test statistics divided by the expected median of the corresponding Chi squared distribution assuming 1 degree of freedom. The Chi square test statistics were calculated from the p-values. Significance thresholds were then established by applying a Bonferroni correction by dividing the expected probability of a type-1 error (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) by the number of independent tests. Following Duggal et al. [] and Ricard et al. []  we assumed that the number of independent tests was equal to the number of independent chromosome segments  which was calculated using the formula proposed by Goddard et al. []. For the LW-line  the number of independent chromosomal segments was 776.4  648.1 and 782.3 for the 80 K and 660 K SNP panels and the iWGS genotype scores  respectively. For the DL-line  the number of independent chromosomal segments was 249.5  277.4  and 280.6 for the 80 K and 660 K SNP panels and the iWGS genotype scores  respectively. Since  within a line  the numbers of independent chromosomal segments were similar between SNP densities  the same significance threshold was used for all densities within a line. As a result  a SNP was considered significant when it was associated with a -<U+2009>log ( value) higher than 4.2 and 3.7 for the LW-line and the DL-line  respectively. To identify QTL regions  SNPs on each chromosome were ranked based on their  values and  starting with the SNP with the highest -<U+2009>log ( value)  all significant SNPs within a 0.5-Mb region to the left and right of the SNP were assigned to that QTL region. This procedure was repeated until all significant SNPs were assigned to a QTL region. We chose this definition for a QTL region and assumed that significant SNPs that are more than 0.5 Mb apart belong to independent QTL regions because the average LD of commercial pig lines decreases to less than 0.3 when the SNPs are more than 0.5 Mb apart [  ]. An overview of the number of SNPs available for each SNP density and line is in Table . In total  26.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 SNPs were available in the sequenced reference animals  of which 17.6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 21.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 segregated in the iWGS data for the DL-line and the LW-line  respectively. After quality control  5.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 SNPs with iWGS dosage scores and 3.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 SNPs with genotype scores remained for the LW-line  and 5.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 SNPs with iWGS dosage scores and 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 SNPs with genotype scores remained for the DL-line. Not all SNPs on the SNP panels were present in the WGS data  i.e.  for the LW-line  91.2% of the 80 K SNPs and 88.8% of the 660 K SNPs were present in the WGS data  and for the DL-line 89.7% of the 80 K SNPs were present in the WGS data. Before filtering  the average Beagle R (measure of imputation accuracy) across the whole genome was relatively low. The LW-line 660 K genotypes were imputed to iWGS with an average Beagle R of 0.49; after removing SNPs with an Beagle R lower than 0.6  the average R was equal to 0.93. The DL-line 80 K genotypes were imputed to iWGS with an average Beagle R of 0.39 and of 0.84 after removing SNPs with an imputation Beagle R<U+2009><<U+2009>0.6. Before filtering and quality control  the Beagle R varied between (Fig. ) and within chromosomes (see Additional file : Figures S1 and S2). For the LW-line  the lowest and highest Beagle R were obtained for chromosome 13 (0.45) and 10 (0.55)  respectively. For the DL-line  the lowest and highest R were obtained for chromosome 15 (0.35) and 12 (0.43)  respectively. Beagle R also varied along each chromosome for both lines. Some regions had a low SNP coverage of SNPs  resulting in lower Beagle R in neighbouring regions  as illustrated by the region around 105.5 Mb on chromosome 7 for the DL-line (see Additional file : Figures S1 and S2). Accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence by chromosome for the LW-line () and the DL-line (). Accuracy of imputation based on Beagle R before (blue) and after (orange) filtering Imputation accuracy  i.e. Beagle R  increased with increasing MAF based on the iWGS genotype scores for each target line (Fig. ). The most pronounced increase in accuracy of imputation was observed for the 0.00–0.15 MAF range. When MAF increased above 0.15  Beagle R reached a plateau at about 0.9 for the LW-line and 0.7 for the DL-line. After filtering on imputation accuracy  most SNPs with a very low MAF (<<U+2009>0.01) were removed; the median MAF was 0.05 before filtering and 0.17 after filtering. Accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence versus minor allele frequency. Imputation accuracy based on Beagle R is plotted against minor allele frequency of the SNPs on chromosome 7 for the LW-line (orange dots and solid line) and the DL-line (blue dots and dashed line). The SNPs were divided into bins of 500 SNPs and each dot represents one bin An overview of the GWAS results based on the 80 K and 660 K SNP genotypes (based on iWGS for the DL-line)  and based on the iWGS genotype and dosage scores is in Figs.  and  for the DL-line and LW-line  respectively. For both lines  the average number of QTL regions increased with increasing SNP density. For the LW-line  37 and 104 QTL regions were identified with the 80 K SNP genotypes and the iWGS genotype scores  respectively. For the DL-line  the number of QTL regions detected increased from 48 with the 80 K SNP genotypes to 94 with iWGS genotype scores. Of the QTL detected based on iWGS genotype scores  48.9 and 64.4% were not identified with the 80 K SNP genotypes for the DL-line and the LW-line  respectively. Even more QTL regions were identified when iWGS dosage scores instead of genotype scores were used (Table ); for the LW-line and DL-line  the number of QTL regions detected increased to 132 and 217  respectively.

Manhattan plot for number teats of the DL-line population using  80 K chip   660 K chip and  iWGS genotype scores   iWGS dosage scores The Manhattan plots for each SNP density and for both lines showed a clear peak on chromosome 7 (Figs.   )  reaching a -log10(adjusted p-value) of at least 10 for each SNP density for both lines. The peak was located between 103 and 105 Mb but  within this window  the position of the most significant SNP differed between SNP densities. In addition  for the LW-line  strong significant QTL regions were identified on chromosomes 10 and 16 for all densities  and on chromosomes 2 and 12 for the higher SNP density. For the DL-line  strong significant QTL regions were identified on chromosome 12 and 16 for all densities  and on chromosomes 2 and 10 for the higher SNP density. Along with the number of significant QTL regions increasing with increasing SNP density  the number of QTL regions that explained a higher percentage of the phenotypic variance increased (Figs.   ). For example  for the DL-line  the number of QTL that explained more than 1% of the phenotypic variance increased from 22 to 123 for the iWGS dosage scores versus 80 K genotypes. However  it should be noted that the percentage of variance explained  as computed here  is not cumulative because SNPs were tested one at a time and  therefore  the estimated effects of neighbouring SNPs were not independent due to LD.

The percentage of phenotypic variance explained was calculated as follows:   where the phenotypic variance was 0.96 Very high genomic inflation factors were observed  especially for the LW-line (><U+2009>3). For both lines  genomic inflation factors slightly increased as SNP density increased from 80 K to 660 K and then dropped to the same level as for the 80 K chip when iWGS genotype scores were used (Table ). With iWGS dosage scores  genomic inflation factors decreased even more  i.e.  from 1.80 for 80 K SNP genotypes to 1.51 for iWGS dosage scores for the DL-line  and from 3.50 for 80 K to 3.18 for iWGS dosage scores for the LW-line. Thus  inflation of the test statistic was lowest when dosage scores were used. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of imputation to WGS in two pig lines when using a multi-line reference population and the numbers of sequenced animals that belonged to the target lines were small  and subsequently  to investigate the effect of using the resulting imputed WGS genotype or dosage scores in a GWAS. Imputation from 80 K or 660 K to WGS using a multi-line reference population resulted in only 40 to 50% of the SNPs having a Beagle R higher than 0.60 in the iWGS data. Nonetheless  when accounting for imputation inaccuracy by filtering iWGS genotypes or by using dosage scores  the number of QTL detected and the estimated proportion of phenotypic variance explained by these were larger compared to when conducting the GWAS using lower density SNP chip genotypes  especially when using iWGS dosage scores. In the following section  the factors that influenced imputation accuracy are discussed  followed by a discussion on the effect of using iWGS genotype or dosage scores on the results of GWAS. The average Beagle R found in this study was 0.39 for the DL-line and 0.49 for the LW-line  which were relatively low compared to other studies that have used multi-line reference populations but with a larger size (more than 242 individuals) [  ]  but similar to the accuracy of 0.46 obtained with 90 sequenced Holstein bulls by van Binsbergen et al. []. In our study  168 individuals were included in the reference population and not all haplotypes present in our target populations were represented in the reference population  which increased imputation errors [  ]. Van Binsbergen et al. [] investigated imputation accuracy in three scenarios that differed in the number of animals in a single breed reference population. They showed that for imputation from 50 K to iWGS  the accuracy was 0.37 with a reference population of 45 Holstein cows  and that it increased to 0.46 when the reference population increased to 90 Holstein cows. A similar increase of imputation accuracy was observed when imputing from 777 K to iWGS. These imputation accuracies were comparable or even higher than those found in our study  although we used a larger reference population. However  our reference population consisted of animals from 10 lines and the two target populations were only represented by 12 DL-line animals and 32 LW-line animals. The latter is probably the main reason for the disappointing imputation accuracy obtained in this study. Our hypothesis was that adding animals from other lines and using a multi-line reference population would improve imputation accuracy  which was demonstrated previously especially for SNPs with a low MAF in the target population but that are segregating in other breeds [      ]. For example  Bouwman and Veerkamp [] showed that adding 60 individuals from the Jersey  Brown Swiss and Nordic Red Dairy cattle breeds to a reference population of 20 Holstein individuals increased the imputation accuracy of 777 K genotypes to iWGS for Holsteins from 0.71 to 0.83. In our study  the original small reference population was augmented by adding animals from other lines but imputation accuracy was still low for many chromosome regions. The genetic distances of the target populations with the other lines in the reference population were maybe too large because of  for example  different breeding goals. Given the small number of reference animals from the target lines (12 DL-line and 32 LW-line)  accuracy of imputation would probably benefit more from additional sequenced DL-line and LW-line animals than from additional animals of other lines. The imputation accuracy was lower for the DL-line than for the LW-line. Apart from the fact that there were only 12 DL-line individuals in the reference population compared to 32 LW-line individuals  the difference between starting density (i.e. 80 K genotypes for the DL-line and 660 K (imputed) genotypes for the LW-line) and target density (i.e. WGS) also contributed to the lower accuracy for the DL-line versus the LW-line. With a lower density SNP panel  the LD between the SNPs on the genotyping panel and WGS is lower and there is less information to identify shared haplotypes precisely  which increases the uncertainty of imputed genotypes [  ]. Stepwise imputation from 80 to 660 K to iWGS  instead of from 80 K to iWGS directly  as suggested by van Binsbergen et al. []  and as performed for the LW-line  could improve imputation accuracy for the DL-line. However  this was not possible here because the number of available 660 K genotypes for the DL-line was not sufficient. Other possible reasons for the difference in imputation accuracies between the two lines are differences in population structure or genetic architecture between the lines. For example  selection or different effective population sizes could have resulted in different LD decays and numbers of independent chromosome segments between the lines []. Populations with a smaller number of independent chromosome segments are expected to have a higher imputation accuracy because they are expected to have less LD decay across the genome and a greater number of shared haplotypes. In this study  the DL-line had a smaller number of independent chromosomal segments (280.6) than the LW-line (782.3)  which was expected to increase imputation accuracy for the DL-Line. However  due to other factors such as the starting density and smaller representation in the reference population  we did not observe a higher imputation accuracy for the DL-Line. In addition to the above-mentioned factors  imputation accuracy could also be affected by the unequal distribution of SNPs on the genotyping array along the genome and by mapping errors. The latter complicate imputation because incorrect positions of SNPs lead to errors in haplotypes and LD structure in the region they are incorrectly mapped to. Thus  an improved reference genome should increase imputation accuracy [  ]. Iso-Touru et al. [] and Daetwyler et al. [] identified new QTL when using iWGS genotype and dosage scores compared to SNP panel genotypes. Similarly  we also found new QTL regions when iWGS genotype scores were used. For the DL-line and the LW-line  48.9 and 64.4%  respectively  of the QTL detected with iWGS genotype scores were not identified with the 80 K SNP genotypes. The QTL that were identified with all genotype densities were also reported in other GWAS studies that used DL-line or LW-line SNP genotypes [    ]. In all these studies  the most significant QTL region was located on chromosome 7 and can be linked to the  gene. This gene is important for vertebral development and is positively correlated with number of teats in pigs [    ]. Several new QTL regions identified with iWGS genotype and dosage scores include candidate genes for number of teats. For example  at approximately 125 Mb on chromosome 2  a QTL region was identified for the LW-line based on iWGS that includes the  gene  which plays a regulatory role in the  signalling pathway  which is essential for early mammary gland formation [  ]. For the DL-line  we found a QTL region on chromosome 2 at about 76.5 Mb that was close to another  gene (). Compared to the DL-line  more QTL regions were identified for the LW-line when 660 K genotypes and genotype scores were used but fewer QTL regions were identified when 80 K genotypes or dosage scores were used for GWAS. This was unexpected because the DL-line has a smaller population size and more DL-line iWGS genotype scores were removed because of low imputation accuracy. Therefore  the power to detect associations was expected to be lower in the DL-line than in the LW-line []. The larger number of QTL regions identified for the DL-line with 80 K genotypes and dosage scores might be because it has a smaller number of independent chromosomal segments (280.6) compared to the LW-line (782.3). A smaller number of independent chromosomal segments is expected to increase imputation accuracy because of less LD decay across the genome. As a result  power to detect associations might have been higher in the DL-line when using the 80 K genotypes and dosage scores. For 660 K and genotype scores  the power was lower in the DL-line compared to the LW-line because many SNPs with low imputation accuracy were removed. However  another possibility is that the smaller number of independent chromosomal segments for the DL-line  nay have resulted in the identification of a larger number of false positive QTL. Of the 94 QTL regions found for the DL-line with iWGS genotype scores  24% overlapped with QTL regions identified for the LW-line with iWGS genotype scores. Although power was limited in each line and we did not expect to detect each QTL in each line  differences might also be caused by differences in genetic architecture between the lines  such as MAF and LD patterns []. Comparing the MAF of the most significant SNPs that were identified in the DL-line with the same SNPs in the LW-line (see Additional file : Figure S3)  clearly showed that the QTL regions had different MAF between the two lines. For example  a SNP on chromosome 8 located at 104.1 Mb had a MAF of 0.005 and 0.36 in the DL-line and LW-line  respectively. Assuming that the SNP is associated with the phenotype in both lines  its low MAF reduces the power to detect it in the DL-line. Although a large number of new QTL were found using iWGS genotype  whether they are indeed new associations or artefacts of the definition of the QTL region can be questioned. Here  a QTL region was defined as the 0.5-Mb region to the left and right of the most significant SNP in a region because multiple studies have found that the average LD in commercial pig lines decreases below 0.3 when the SNPs are more than 0.5 Mb apart [  ]. This definition may increase the number of QTL regions for iWGS because iWGS consists of many SNPs that are in very high LD. In addition  LD decay can vary across and within chromosomes [] and  therefore  this definition can be too strict for some QTL regions and neighbouring regions could be merged into one region or the other way around. To test this  we increased the size of the QTL region to 1 Mb to the right and left of the most significant SNP in that region. This resulted in a reduction in the number of QTL detected with iWGS genotype scores from 104 to 64 for the DL-line and from 94 to 56 for the LW-line. Although this is a significant reduction  it is still larger than the number of QTL regions based on the original QTL region definition found with 80 K and 660 K. In addition to the definition of the QTL region  the newly identified QTL regions could also be an artefact due to the significance threshold that we applied in this study. Here  the significance threshold was set by applying a Bonferroni correction using the number of independent chromosomal segments instead of the commonly used total number of SNPs  which does not take LD between SNPs into account. The number of independent chromosomal segments has often been used for Bonferroni correction for GWAS in human [    ]  plant [  ]  and animal [  ] genetics. However  so far there has been little consensus about the most appropriate approach for testing significance for GWAS. This should be a topic for future research. Finally  even with low imputation accuracy  GWAS using iWGS can be beneficial in several cases. For example  the QTL regions identified in this study could help to pre-select SNPs to improve the accuracy of genomic predictions  as shown by [  ]. In addition  QTL regions identified could be used as indicators for fine-mapping of possible interesting regions  even if they are based on poorly imputed WGS data. For example  SNPs that are in the detected QTL regions could be added to high-density SNP chips  or animals with extreme phenotypes could be sequenced for the detected QTL regions. In this study  imputation accuracy by SNP  measured with Beagle R  was relatively low and  therefore  many SNPs were inaccurately imputed. When using iWGS genotype scores  quality control measures removed around 50% of the SNPs from the analysis and we assumed that the remaining SNPs were called without imputation error. Using iWGS dosage scores in the GWAS model is another way of analysing poorly imputed data. Dosage scores are a posterior probability of having one of the three genotypes and  thus it accounts for the uncertainty of imputation to iWGS. In this study  we identified 56.7 and 26.9% more QTL regions for the DL-line and the LW-line  respectively  when dosage instead of genotype scores were used. Moreover  the most significant SNPs in the QTL regions explained more of the phenotypic variance when using dosage scores. Genotype scores may not capture as much phenotypic variation because some information is lost due to inaccurate imputation. For example  for the DL-line  a clear peak was detected on chromosome 2 at approximately 56 Mb with dosage scores but not with genotype scores (Fig. ). In this region  many SNPs did not pass the quality control for the iWGS genotype score scenario  because imputation accuracy for this region was low (Fig. ). In addition  the Manhattan plot based on iWGS genotype scores (Fig. ) showed a very odd pattern  with an 8-Mb region from 56 to 64 Mb including SNPs that had the same significance level. This region displays high LD (i.e.  with an average (±<U+2009>SD) LD r of 0.46 (±<U+2009>0.07))  and thus the SNPs in this regions had approximately the same imputation accuracy and dosage scores  and thus  the same significance level.

Manhattan plot for number teats of the DL-line population using  iWGS genotype scores   iWGS dosage scores zoomed-in on chromosome 2 Distribution of the accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence along chromosome 2 for the DL-line In this study  the genomic inflation factors were lower when using dosage scores compared to using 80 K and 660 K genotypes and iWGS genotype scores. The scenario using dosage scores included SNPs with a low imputation accuracy  and hence SNPs with a low MAF. In the other scenarios  there is ascertainment bias  which is caused by the preference of SNPs on a chip that are more likely to be common []. In addition  SNPs selected for iWGS genotype scores have ascertainment bias  because accurately imputed SNPs in general have a higher MAF. By (indirectly) selecting SNPs with a high MAF  it is easier to detect effects for these SNPs  and their surrounding SNPs  and therefore it is likely that more significant SNPs are found than expected based on the theoretical distribution of the test statistic distribution under the null hypothesis. Linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs will also result in more significant SNPs within the region that surrounds a causal variant. Both the higher frequency of SNPs with high MAF and long-range LD increase genomic inflation factors [  ] and the rate of false positives. Use of dosage scores leads to less inflation of the test statistic because the ascertainment bias is partly removed  leading to less biased SNP effects compared to the use of lower density SNP chips and iWGS genotype scores. Use of a multi-line reference population resulted in relatively poor imputation accuracy to iWGS  with 52.7% of the SNPs on the 660 K array in the LW-line and 39.1% of the SNPs on the 80 K array in the DL-line having Beagle R lower than 0.6. Imputation from 660 K to iWGS was more accurate than imputation from 80 K to iWGS  which suggests that step-wise imputation  i.e. first imputing from 80 to 660 K and then from 660 K to iWGS  could increase the accuracy of imputation. Although imputation accuracy was poor  using iWGS instead of genotypes from a lower density SNP chip increased the number of detected QTL regions and the expected proportion of phenotypic variance that they explained. When using iWGS dosage scores instead of genotype scores  even more QTL regions were detected because all SNPs were used in the analysis and the uncertainty of imputation was taken into account by the model.

The sequencing of 935 sheep from a range of breeds provides the opportunity to impute sheep genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to WGS. This study evaluated the accuracy of imputation from SNP genotypes to WGS using this reference population of 935 sequenced sheep.ResultsThe accuracy of imputation from the Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip SNP (~<U+2009>500 k) to WGS was assessed for three target breeds: Merino  Poll Dorset and F1 Border Leicester<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino. Imputation accuracy was highest for the Poll Dorset breed  although there were more Merino individuals in the sequenced reference population than Poll Dorset individuals. In addition  empirical imputation accuracies were higher (by up to 1.7%) when using larger multi-breed reference populations compared to using a smaller single-breed reference population. The mean accuracy of imputation across target breeds using the Minimac3 or the FImpute software was 0.94. The empirical imputation accuracy varied considerably across the genome; six chromosomes carried regions of one or more Mb with a mean imputation accuracy of <<U+2009>0.7. Imputation accuracy in five variant annotation classes ranged from 0.87 (missense) up to 0.94 (intronic variants)  where lower accuracy corresponded to higher proportions of rare alleles. The imputation quality statistic reported from Minimac3 () had a clear positive relationship with the empirical imputation accuracy. Therefore  by first discarding imputed variants with an  below 0.4  the mean empirical accuracy across target breeds increased to 0.97. Although accuracy of genomic prediction was less affected by filtering on  in a multi-breed population of sheep with imputed WGS  the genomic heritability clearly tended to be lower when using variants with an  =<U+2009>0.4.ConclusionsThe mean imputation accuracy was high for all target breeds and was increased by combining smaller breed sets into a multi-breed reference.

The sequencing of 935 sheep from a range of breeds provides the opportunity to impute sheep genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to WGS. This study evaluated the accuracy of imputation from SNP genotypes to WGS using this reference population of 935 sequenced sheep. The accuracy of imputation from the Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip SNP (~<U+2009>500 k) to WGS was assessed for three target breeds: Merino  Poll Dorset and F1 Border Leicester<U+2009>×<U+2009>Merino. Imputation accuracy was highest for the Poll Dorset breed  although there were more Merino individuals in the sequenced reference population than Poll Dorset individuals. In addition  empirical imputation accuracies were higher (by up to 1.7%) when using larger multi-breed reference populations compared to using a smaller single-breed reference population. The mean accuracy of imputation across target breeds using the Minimac3 or the FImpute software was 0.94. The empirical imputation accuracy varied considerably across the genome; six chromosomes carried regions of one or more Mb with a mean imputation accuracy of <<U+2009>0.7. Imputation accuracy in five variant annotation classes ranged from 0.87 (missense) up to 0.94 (intronic variants)  where lower accuracy corresponded to higher proportions of rare alleles. The imputation quality statistic reported from Minimac3 () had a clear positive relationship with the empirical imputation accuracy. Therefore  by first discarding imputed variants with an  below 0.4  the mean empirical accuracy across target breeds increased to 0.97. Although accuracy of genomic prediction was less affected by filtering on  in a multi-breed population of sheep with imputed WGS  the genomic heritability clearly tended to be lower when using variants with an  =<U+2009>0.4. The mean imputation accuracy was high for all target breeds and was increased by combining smaller breed sets into a multi-breed reference. We found that the Minimac3 software imputation quality statistic () was a useful indicator of empirical imputation accuracy  enabling removal of very poorly imputed variants before downstream analyses. The Australian sheep industry has embraced the application of genomics to enhance genetic improvement programs []. Already  more than 47 000 Australian sheep have been genotyped by using mainly low- (12 k) and medium-density (50 k) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays []. Currently  the sheep industry uses real or imputed 50 k SNP genotypes for genomic prediction of breeding values. Imputation is the process of predicting unknown genotypes for animals genotyped at lower SNP density by using a reference set of animals genotyped at the higher SNP density. Genomic prediction relies on strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) between causal variants for a given trait and the SNPs. Such LD might not exist when using the 50 k SNP array for prediction of more distantly related animals or prediction across breeds. Furthermore  SNPs on the 50 k SNP array were preselected to be (highly) polymorphic in the target breeds. This can result in rarer causal variants not being in strong LD with the standard 50 k SNPs  and thus their effects may not be captured in the genomic predictions. In contrast to SNP arrays  whole-genome sequence (WGS) data include all or at least many causal variants. Thus  genomic prediction with sequence data would not need to rely on LD with common SNPs on arrays. Although it is not yet economically feasible to sequence many thousands of animals  it is possible to impute sequence variants for animals that are already genotyped on standard SNP arrays if a reference population of sequenced animals is available []. There is now evidence in both cattle and sheep that the accuracy of genomic prediction can be increased by combining more predictive variants from imputed sequence data with a standard SNP array  particularly for across-breed prediction or prediction of animals with low relationships to the reference animals [     ]. In order to develop the opportunity to exploit imputed WGS data in sheep  a joint collaboration between SheepGenomesDB () and the Sheep CRC project has sequenced a reference population of almost 1000 sheep []. A range of worldwide breeds were sequenced  with the largest proportion being Merino and Merino crosses. To date in sheep  there has been no evaluation of the accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence data (WGS). Thus  the main objective of our study was to evaluate a practical approach to achieve highly accurate imputed WGS in a range of purebred and crossbred sheep  that would easily scale up to imputing more than 60 000 individuals. A range of software programs is available to carry out imputation (e.g. Beagle []  FastPhase []  Impute2 []  FImpute []  and Minimac3 [])  each one implementing a different algorithm that can affect both computational speed and imputation accuracy. Beagle and FImpute have been widely used in livestock populations and consistently achieve high imputation accuracies [  ]. Recently  Minimac3 was shown to be highly accurate and computationally efficient for imputation to sequence in human populations [] and also compared favourably with FImpute in cattle []. Therefore  we evaluated the accuracy of imputed WGS using the FImpute and Minimac3 software when the starting point from which to impute to WGS was high-density (“HD”:<U+2009>~<U+2009>500 000) SNP genotypes. We also evaluated the accuracy of imputation to WGS when the starting point was low-density SNP genotypes (OvineLD: 12 k SNPs). In the sequenced reference population  many breeds are represented  with some having few individuals and others having many individuals. Thus  we validated the accuracy of imputed WGS in three target (two purebred and one crossbred) populations using either all or a subset of the sequenced reference set. In addition  we investigated local imputation accuracy along each chromosome to identify regions in the ovine genome that are poorly imputed  possibly due to large segmental repeat regions and/or errors in the reference genome. Furthermore  we demonstrated the impact of using different Minimac3 quality () thresholds  as a proxy for detecting poorly or well-imputed variants  on the accuracy of genomic prediction for three traits in a large multi-breed population. A reference set of WGS data was available for 935 animals representing multiple breeds and crosses (see Additional file : Table S1) from across the world  with approximately 10<U+2009>×<U+2009>average read depth []. The raw fastq WGS dataset was processed using an in-house pipeline to undertake the following quality control with the QUADTrim program (): adapter sequences and bases for which the qscore was <<U+2009>20 were trimmed from the 3’ and 5’ end of reads; reads with more than three missed base calls and shorter than 50 reads were removed; bases for which the qscore was <<U+2009>20 for three consecutive bases were trimmed from reads; and entire reads with a mean score <<U+2009>20 were removed. Then  the reads were aligned to the OAR () 3.1 ovine reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner []. Duplicates were removed using Samtools [] and a local realignment around indels was performed using the GATK software []. Variant calling for SNPs and short insertions and deletions (indels) was carried out simultaneously for all 935 sequenced animals using a multi-sample variant calling pipeline that was implemented with the  module of SAMtools []  as described by Daetwyler et al. []  which yielded polymorphisms at 52 676 272 biallelic sites. All variants were annotated following the pipeline developed by Grant et al. []. We evaluated imputation accuracy using three reference sets: MER<U+2009>=<U+2009>117 pure Merino animals  EUR<U+2009>=<U+2009>726 sheep representing only European breeds  and ALL<U+2009>=<U+2009>935 animals representing breeds from Europe  Africa  Asia  America and the Middle East. For all three reference sets  prior to imputation  we removed variants with minor allele counts <<U+2009>5 (across all reference animals) and variants with more than two alleles. This resulted in 42 249 885  39 844 235  and 30 660 937 polymorphic variants in the ALL  EUR  and MER reference sets  respectively. The accuracy of the imputed WGS was assessed in sequenced animals by first masking all their sequence genotypes  except for those that overlapped with variants in either the HD or OvineLD SNP arrays. To calculate imputation accuracy  we used the following three target populations with fivefold cross-validation: MER<U+2009>=<U+2009>117 pure Australian Merinos  PD<U+2009>=<U+2009>29 pure Poll Dorsets  and F1<U+2009>=<U+2009>59 Merino<U+2009>×<U+2009>Border Leicester crossbreds. For each of the fivefold validation groups  the WGS genotypes for 20% of the MER  PD  or F1 animals were reduced to either HD or OvineLD SNPs  and then these animals were used as a target set for imputation to the sequence level. This ensured that a large proportion of animals of the same breeds (80% of the total) were still available in the reference population. The positions of the Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip SNPs (developed under the auspices of the International Sheep Genomics Consortium) that mapped to the OAR 3.1 build of the ovine reference genome [] were used to prepare these target HD genotype sets. Likewise  we used the OAR 3.1 positions for the OvineLD BeadChip []. For the imputation test from OvineLD SNP to WGS  we used the three target sets above but only with the ALL reference set. The imputation test using ALL reference and MER target sets was done for the 26 ovine autosomes. For the other scenarios  to reduce computational requirements  we tested imputation accuracy on a representative set of six autosomal chromosomes (OAR for ): 1  5  10  15  20 and 25. After masking all the sequence genotypes in the target fivefold cross-validation set  except for those that overlapped with the HD SNPs  imputation was carried out directly from HD genotypes to WGS variants using two software methods: FImpute (version 2.2; []) and Minimac3 (version 2.0.1; []). Minimac3 requires pre-phased genotypes in both the reference (WGS) and target sets  for which the Eagle software (version 2.3; []) was used. Default parameters were used for Eagle and Minimac3. The Minimac3 software provides the most likely genotypes (coded as 0  1 and 2 for homozygous  heterozygous and alternative homozygous animals  respectively)  as well as the predicted allele dosage (continuously distributed values ranging from 0 to 2) for imputed variants. Neither Eagle nor Minimac3 consider pedigree information to infer haplotypes or missing genotypes. FImpute can use pedigree and population-based information to infer haplotypes and missing genotypes. However  in general  sheep pedigrees are shallow and error prone and  thus  we implemented FImpute without pedigree information and applied default parameters otherwise. Then  the imputed WGS genotypes were compared to their real genotypes  except for the variants that overlapped with the HD SNPs. After masking all the sequence genotypes in the target fivefold cross-validation set  except for those that overlapped with the OvineLD SNPs  imputation from OvineLD SNPs to WGS was performed in three sequential stages: The OvineLD SNPs (~<U+2009>12 223) were imputed to the OvineSNP50 Beadchip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA) SNPs  using FImpute and a reference population of 1933 animals that were genotyped directly with 38 378 SNPs. The animals from this reference population were from multiple breeds  including 555 pure Merino  36 Border Leicester  19 pure Suffolk  18 pure Poll Dorset  11 pure Texel  and other minor pure breeds and crossbreeds [e.g. F1 crosses between PD<U+2009>×<U+2009>MER (86) and BL<U+2009>×<U+2009>MER (9)]. The 50 k imputed genotypes were then imputed to HD SNPs using Eagle pre-phasing and Minimac3 (as described for imputation from HD to WGS)  using the same reference population of 1933 animals  which were also genotyped directly with the HD SNPs. The imputed HD genotypes were imputed to WGS variants using Eagle pre-phasing and Minimac3. Imputed WGS genotypes were compared to their real genotypes after removing the overlapping variants in the imputed HD genotypes  as for imputation from HD to WGS. The empirical accuracy of imputation was assessed as the correlation between real and imputed genotypes for all sequence variants (excluding HD SNPs) across the five-fold cross-validations. The mean imputation accuracy was also calculated per chromosome and in non-overlapping 1-Mb windows across each chromosome to identify genomic regions that were difficult to impute well because of either large duplicated segments and/or poor reference map quality. These genomic regional tests were carried out across all autosomes  using Minimac3 for the MER target with the ALL reference scenario. Empirical imputation accuracies were also compared with the Minimac3  quality statistic that is an estimate of imputation accuracy based on the concept that poorly imputed genotype counts will shrink towards their expectations across all individuals  based on population allele frequencies (). This comparison was made by evaluating the mean empirical imputation accuracies for groups of variants that were allocated to 100 bins based on their  value: 0 to 0.01  0.01 to 0.02  etc. We tested the effect of imposing a minimum Minimac3  threshold on empirical imputation accuracy. That is  prior to calculating the correlation between imputed and sequenced variants  variants were discarded if their  was lower than a given threshold (i.e. variants were retained with <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4<U+2009>=<U+2009>“thr4” or <U+2009>><U+2009>0.8<U+2009>=<U+2009>“thr8”). Variants in the ALL set of sheep reference genomes were annotated following []. The Ensembl (version 87; ) functional annotation categories included five key annotation groupings: intergenic  intronic  5 kb up- or down-stream of genes  missense  and UTR 3’ and 5’ ends. The mean empirical imputation accuracy was calculated for each of these five classes using the MER target set with the ALL reference set. We also assessed the mean Minimac3  and MAF distributions for variants in each class. We evaluated the impact of using poorly or well imputed genotypes on the accuracy of genomic prediction  using Minimac3  as a proxy for empirical imputation accuracy. This was evaluated for three traits: carcass fat depth at C site (ccfat)  post-weaning eye muscle depth (pemd)  and post-weaning weight (pwt). The data for this genomic prediction was previously described by Khansefid et al. []. Briefly  the reference and validation sets included up to 20 403 animals across these three traits. The reference sets included 1910 pure Merinos (MER)  1360 Poll Dorset (PD)  355 pure Border Leicester (BL)  1360 PD<U+2009>×<U+2009>MER crosses  619 BL<U+2009>×<U+2009>MER crosses  703 pure White Suffolk and its crossbred animals  and other minor breeds  their crosses and composite animals. Animals in the validation sets were purebred Merinos. None of the validation animals shared paternal half-sibs in the reference population. Phenotypes were obtained from Australia’s Sheep Genetics industry genetic evaluation database []  and were processed by the AGBU sheep evaluation team () including: pre-adjustment for various fixed effects (birth-rearing type  sex  and contemporary groups) and removal of animals with a phenotype more than 4 standard deviations from the mean. Phenotypes were also pre-corrected for the random genetic group effect and data source (as described in []). Trait definitions  number of records used in the reference and validation sets for each trait  raw means and standard deviations (prior to pre-adjustment) based on the genotyped and phenotyped animals are in Table . We imputed the WGS genotypes using the EUR reference and Minimac3 with Eagle pre-phasing (following the description above) for<U+2009>~<U+2009>47 000 Australian sheep  including all reference and validation animals described above. All animals had previously been genotyped with either the LD  50 k or HD SNP arrays. Genotypes on the X chromosome were excluded. For the 47 000 sheep  we did not have a direct estimate of the true accuracy of their imputed WGS. Therefore  we evaluated the impact on the accuracy on genomic prediction by using the Minimac3  statistic as a proxy filter for poorly imputed variants. For this test  we used genotype sets of 50 000 variants (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01) that were randomly selected across the genome from the available WGS variants. We used three filters to select variant sets based on the Minimac3 : imputed variants with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4 (thr0-4)  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 (thr4)  and <U+2009>><U+2009>0.8 (thr8)  respectively. For each of these three filters  five random sets of 50 000 sequence variants were selected while ensuring that each random set shared a similar allele frequency distribution (as an example  the allele frequency distribution for ccfat for each filter with five random sets is shown in Additional file : Figure S1). The mean distance between adjacent variants across each of the three filters matched expectations based on the total length of the imputed autosomal chromosomes (mean distance between adjacent variants was 48.99 kb for thr0-4  48.87 kb for thr4  and 48.78 kb for thr8). Genomic prediction analyses based on genotypes for each of the 50 000 variant sets were performed using the BayesR method []  which jointly fits the effects of all SNPs and assumes that SNP effects are from a mixture of four normal distributions with variances equal to 0  0.01  0.1 or 1% of the genetic variance  respectively []. Gibbs sampling was used for sampling from the posterior distributions of the parameters  running 40 000 iterations with 20 000 iterations of burn-in. Five parallel chains were run for each trait and each of the five-random genotype sets per  filter (that is: 5 chains<U+2009>×<U+2009>5 genotype sets<U+2009>=<U+2009>25 analyses per trait for each filter). The SNP effects from each of the 25 BayesR analyses per trait and per  filter were then used to calculate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for the Merino target set. The accuracy of genomic prediction was calculated as the correlation of the GEBV with the adjusted phenotype  divided by the square root of the heritability of the trait (). The latter was the mean of the estimated genomic heritability (shown in Table )  which was estimated as the proportion of phenotypic variance that was explained by the 50 000 sequence variants. Estimates of genomic heritability and of the accuracy of GEBV were averaged across the five parallel Gibbs sampling chains run for each variant set per trait  giving five estimates for each of the five variant sets for each filter. The standard error of the accuracy of GEBV was estimated from the five randomly sampled independent genotype sets for each trait  i.e. as the standard deviation of the five accuracies divided by the square root of 5. All imputation accuracy results presented are based on imputation from the Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip SNP (~<U+2009>500 k) to WGS  except when stated otherwise. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the genetic diversity of the sequenced animals that were allocated to reference and target validation sets (Fig. ). The PCA was based on a genomic relationship matrix that was generated from their WGS variants pruned down to the HD SNP genotype set. Animals from the MER  PD and F1 breeds that were used as imputation target populations  appear as tight groups at opposite extremes of the first and second principal component axes. Principal component decompositions of the genomic relationship matrix constructed from whole-genome sequence genotypes pruned down to HD SNP genotypes for 935 sequenced animals. Description of breed names is in Additional file : Table S1. Filled circles represent animals tested in the imputation from the Merino (test_MER  green)  Poll Dorset (test_PD  purple)  and Merino<U+2009>×<U+2009>Border Leicester (test_F1  orange) breeds Figure  compares the empirical imputation accuracy obtained with the FImpute and Minimac3 imputation softwares when the ALL reference set was used to impute the MER target test set. For the comparison between the imputation methods  only the overlapping set of imputed variants from FImpute and Minimac3 imputation was compared because FImpute was not able to impute the region between 70 and 74 Mb on OAR10. Figure  also shows the increase in empirical imputation accuracy when the imputation quality statistic of Minimac3    was used to retain variants more likely to be imputed well by applying three  thresholds: no threshold (thr0)  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 (thr4) and <U+2009>><U+2009>0.8 (thr8). Imputation accuracies for Minimac3 and FImpute were assessed based on the most likely genotypes (‘MM012’ and ‘FI012’  coded as 0  1 and 2 for homozygous  heterozygous and alternative homozygous genotypes  respectively) and also based on genotype probabilities obtained with Minimac3 (‘MMprob’: continuously distributed allele dosage values ranging from 0 to 2). The highest imputation accuracy was consistently achieved with MMprob  both before and after imposing an  filter but the difference between MMprob and MM012 was lower for  thr4 and thr8 filters (Fig. ). For the most likely genotypes  MM012 and FI012  there was little difference between Minimac3 and FImpute without the  filter (thr0) but was slightly and consistently higher for MM012 than for FI012 after imposing a filter using  (Fig.   results shown only for using ALL as a reference and MER as a target set). The use of  computed using Minimac3 as a filter may  however  have introduced some bias against FImpute because some of the removed variants with low  may have been accurately imputed by FImpute. There was  however  no equivalent statistic available from FImpute. Empirical imputation accuracy of most likely whole-genome sequence genotypes based on FImpute (FI012) and Minimac3 (MM012) and of the Minimac3 allele dosage probability (MMprob) in a Merino (MER) target population  using a mixed breed reference set (‘ALL’). Imputation accuracy is before and after imposing Minimac3  thresholds to filter the imputed sequence data: thr0<U+2009>=<U+2009>no threshold  thr4<U+2009>=<U+2009>><U+2009>0.4  and thr8<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>0.8. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between imputed and observed sequence genotypes in the target population Our results also demonstrated a clear relationship between empirical imputation accuracy  when comparing the average empirical imputation accuracy for groups of variants allocated to  bins (Fig. ). For example  when using the ALL reference and the MER target sets  the mean empirical imputation accuracy was 0.86 for variants with  between 0.40 and 0.41 compared to 0. 90 for variants with  between 0.50 and 0.51. This demonstrates that the Minimac3  is a useful indicator of empirical imputation. This relationship was slightly stronger when a within-breed rather than the ALL breed reference was considered (e.g. the empirical imputation accuracy was 0.88 for variants with an  between 0.40 and 0.41 when using MER as reference and target). Mean empirical imputation accuracy of whole-genome sequence genotypes (Minimac3 most likely genotypes) by Minimac3  of the imputed variants. The plot shows the relationship between variants grouped in  bins (x axis) and their mean empirical imputation accuracy for each bin (y axis). This relationship was evaluated in the Merino target (MER) set using a mixed breed reference set (ALL) We also estimated the mean imputation accuracy for groups of variants within a range of MAF and  generally  accuracy was lower for variants with low MAF (Table ). The accuracy was a little higher for MMprob than for MM012 and FI012 across all levels of MAF.  Because differences in imputation accuracies between MM012  MMprob  and FI012 were small  hereafter  only results for the Minimac3 imputed most likely genotypes (MM012) will be presented. In the MER target set  the accuracy of imputation using mixed breed reference sets (ALL or EUR) was slightly higher (for thr0) or the same (for thr4) than for the smaller MER single-breed reference (Table ). Notably  using either the ALL or EUR reference set resulted in more than 2.3 million (M) extra variants imputed compared to using the MER reference set. The proportion of these extra variants that were polymorphic in the real MER sequence was 96%. However  these variants were found to have <<U+2009>5 allele counts in the MER target population and therefore were discarded from the MER only imputation (see Methods section). We were able to recover some of the variants that were very rare in the single breed reference (MER) set by including a range of breeds and crosses for which the allele frequency was higher. Even after imposing the  thr4 filter  the ALL or EUR reference set had more than 0.8 M variants than MER reference set. We found little difference in the imputation accuracy between using the ALL or EUR reference sets (the ALL set represented only 209 extra animals of non-European breeds). Although the largest number of variants was observed using the ALL reference set  after imposing the  thr4 filter  the largest number of variants was observed when using the EUR reference set (0.4 M more than when using the ALL reference set). The imputation accuracy for these two reference sets was similar when we evaluated accuracy for only the set of WGS variants that were imputed in the MER reference set. Figure  compares imputation accuracies for the MER (Merino)  PD (Poll Dorset) and F1 (Border Leicester x Merino) target populations (MM012) with the ALL reference set. Although the number of pure PD was small in the reference set (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>29 minus 6 used for cross-fold validation) compared to MER (reference set N<U+2009>=<U+2009>94)  the accuracy in PD was always higher than in MER (Fig. ). The accuracy for the F1 population (reference set N<U+2009>=<U+2009>48) was lower than for PD  but was similar to that for MER. These differences in imputation accuracy between target sets remained regardless of the  threshold used. The average increase in imputation accuracy across target populations was 3% from thr0 (no filter) to thr4 (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.4) compared to only 1.5% from thr4 to thr8 (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8) (Fig. ). The average accuracy across target populations varied from 0.93 (for thr0) to 0.98 (for thr8). We also found no differences in imputation accuracies in the PD and F1 target sets when using either the EUR or ALL reference sets (results not shown). Empirical imputation accuracy of whole-genome sequence genotypes (Minimac3 most likely genotypes) in Merino (MER)  Poll Dorset (PD)  and F1 Merino X Border Leicester (F1)  using a mixed breed reference population (ALL). Imputation accuracy is before and after imposing Minimac3  thresholds to filter the imputed sequence data: thr0<U+2009>=<U+2009>no threshold  thr4<U+2009>=<U+2009>><U+2009>0.4  and thr8<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>0.8. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between imputed and observed sequence genotypes Next  we evaluated the accuracy of WGS imputation when starting from WGS pruned down to low-density SNP genotypes (OvineLD:<U+2009>~<U+2009>12 k) compared to starting from WGS pruned down to high density (HD:<U+2009>~<U+2009>500 k SNPs). Note that imputation from OvineLD to WGS genotypes was carried out stepwise: first to 50 k  then to HD and finally to WGS (see Methods). Figure  shows the difference in WGS imputation accuracy when starting from OvineLD genotypes compared with imputation starting directly from real HD genotypes. The results are shown for each target set at different  thresholds using the ALL reference set. For all target sets and  thresholds  accuracy was slightly lower when starting imputation from OvineLD genotypes compared to HD genotypes. The most marked difference was for the F1 crosses (approximately 3%) and the smallest difference was for PD (approximately 1%). However  after imposing filters on  thresholds  approximately 17% more variants were filtered out for imputation from OvineLD genotypes to WGS (regardless of the  threshold used) compared to imputation from real HD genotypes to WGS. Difference in empirical imputation accuracy of whole-genome sequence genotypes (Minimac3 most likely genotypes) when imputation started from low-density SNP versus starting from high-density SNP chips. Accuracy was tested in three target sets: Merino (MER)  Poll Dorset (PD) and Merino X Border Leicester crossbreds (F1)  and the reference population was mixed European and non-European breeds (ALL). Comparisons are given before and after imposing Minimac3  thresholds to filter the imputed sequence data: thr0<U+2009>=<U+2009>no threshold  thr4<U+2009>=<U+2009>><U+2009>0.4  and thr8<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>0.8. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between imputed and observed sequence genotypes There were clear differences in average imputation accuracies across target sets between the six chromosomes (OAR) evaluated (Fig. a  for MMprob and MM012). These differences between chromosomes were considerably reduced after imposing the thr4 filter (Fig. b). The imputation accuracy was always highest for OAR1 and lowest for OAR10  with approximately 2.2% difference in accuracy between them without applying a  filter (thr0: Fig. a). After applying the thr4 filter  the accuracy improved for all chromosomes and the difference in accuracy between these two chromosomes (OAR1 and OAR10) decreased to only 0.05%. For all chromosomes evaluated  the accuracy of MMprob was consistently higher than that of MM012  and the difference between MM012 and MMprob decreased after imposing the thr4 filter (Fig. b). Mean empirical imputation accuracy of whole-genome sequence genotypes across target sets (MER  PD and F1) based on the Minimac3 (MM012) most likely genotypes and the Minimac3 allele dosage probability (MMprob) on six chromosomes (OAR1  5  10  15  20  25). Imputation was implemented using a mixed European and non-European breed reference set (ALL).  provides imputation accuracy before imposing any Minimac3  threshold to filter the imputed sequence data  while  provides imputation accuracy after applying a threshold of Minimac3 <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between imputed and observed sequence genotypes To investigate these differences in accuracy between chromosomes further  we calculated the mean imputation accuracy for all variants within non-overlapping 1-Mb windows along each chromosome (MER target set with ALL reference set). We also calculated the density of both HD and WGS variants within the same 1-Mb windows to determine if the low imputation accuracy was more likely a result of poor HD SNP density and/or due to more highly polymorphic regions. A very poorly imputed 4 Mb region on OAR10 was identified between 70 and 74 Mb (Fig. a)  that showed a low density of HD SNPs and a high density of WGS variants (Fig. b). We also discovered a region with very poor imputation accuracy  which coincided with the MHC region on OAR20 (at approximately 25–28 Mb  Fig. c). This same region had a low density of HD SNPs and a high density of WGS variants  which was an atypical pattern compared to the rest of the chromosome (Fig. d). Notably  OAR10 and 20 had the lowest overall imputation accuracies compared to OAR1  5  15 and 25 (Fig. a). Mean empirical imputation accuracy of whole-genome sequence genotypes (Minimac3 most likely genotypes) based on non-overlapping 1-Mb windows along OAR10 () and 20 () before and after applying different thresholds based on the Minimac3  statistic: thr0<U+2009>=<U+2009>no threshold  thr4<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>0.4  and thr8<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>0.8. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between imputed and observed sequence genotypes.  and  show the number of variants per Mb of HD (high-density) SNPs (blue) and imputed sequence variants (green) on OAR10 and 20. The region on OAR20 with low imputation accuracy (~<U+2009>25 – 28 Mb) coincides with the MHC region Several other very poorly imputed regions were also observed  on OAR4  7  14 and 21 (see Additional file : Figure S2) in the MER target set with the ALL reference set. The corresponding HD SNP and WGS variant densities across all autosomes are also provided in Figure S3 (see Additional file : Figure S3). As expected  the chromosome ends always tended to be less accurately imputed due to a lack of HD flanking haplotype information. After imposing the thr4 filter  the imputation accuracy increased to above 0.9 for all 1-Mb windows  except for one very poorly imputed region on OAR21 (see Additional file : Figure S2). We also compared the mean empirical imputation accuracy for WGS variants within each of five key annotation groupings: intergenic  intronic  5 kb up- or down-stream of genes  missense  and UTR 3’ and 5’ ends (for the MER target set with the ALL reference set: Fig. ). Most variants were intergenic (63%)  followed by intronic (30%)  while variants in regions 5 kb up- or down-stream of genes accounted for 6.4% of the total  missense for 0.3%  and those in 3’ or 5’ UTR for 0.3%. The mean empirical imputation accuracies for these annotation classes without imposing an  filter (thr0) ranged from 0.866 (missense) to 0.938 (intronic). After retaining the variants with <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 (thr4)  the difference in empirical imputation accuracies between the annotation classes was much reduced (Fig. ). However  the proportion of variants filtered out (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4) was much higher in the missense class (65%) than in the intergenic class (35%). Empirical imputation accuracy of whole-genome sequence genotypes (Minimac3 most likely genotypes) variants in five genome annotation classes: intergenic  intronic  5 kb up- or down-stream of genes  missense  and 3’ and 5’ UTR. Imputation was carried out in a Merino (MER) target set using a mixed European and non-European breed reference set (ALL). Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between imputed and observed sequence genotypes  before (thr0) and after filtering variants based on Minimac3 <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 (thr4) To investigate the differences in imputation accuracy between annotation classes further  we compared the MAF and  distributions for each annotation class (Fig. ). All five annotation classes show a MAF profile that was highly skewed towards low MAF compared to the relatively uniform MAF distribution of HD SNP genotypes (Fig. a). The proportion of low MAF variants (<<U+2009>0.05) was highest for the missense (approximately 60%) and UTR variants (approximately 42%)  and this was clearly reflected in the  distribution  for which the proportion of variants with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4 was also highest for the missense and UTR variants (Fig. b). The  had a U-shaped distribution for all annotation classes  with an overrepresentation of high and low  (Fig. b). However  the difference in the proportion of variants with very low  (<<U+2009>0.1) and the proportion of variants with very low MAF (<<U+2009>0.05) was the highest for the missense variants and lowest for the intergenic and intronic variants. Distributions of minor allele frequency (MAF) () and Minimac3  () of variants in five annotation categories: intergenic  intronic  5 kb up- or down-stream of genes  missense  and 3’ and 5’ UTR. The distribution of MAF is also shown for SNPs on a standard HD (high-density) SNP chip. Imputation was carried out in the Merino (MER) target set using a mixed European and non-European breed reference set (ALL) Generally  the empirical accuracy of imputed variants is unknown  but we have demonstrated that the Minimac3  is a reasonable proxy and can be used to filter out poorly imputed variants. Therefore  we imputed a large multi-breed sheep population to WGS and then evaluated the impact of filtering WGS variants using the Minimac3  on the proportion of genetic variance explained by SNPs (“genomic heritability”) and on the accuracy of genomic prediction. Accuracies of GEBV were assessed using 50 000 sequence variants (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01) that were selected using three  thresholds: <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4 (thr0-4)  <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 (thr4)  and <U+2009>><U+2009>0.8 (thr8). Comparing the genomic heritability results for the poorly imputed (thr0-4) with more confidently imputed (thr8) variant sets  genomic heritability clearly tended to be lower for the poorly imputed variants (Fig. a). There was no difference in genomic heritability observed between using thr4 and thr8  which might be expected given the “U” shaped distribution of  (Fig. b) because there was a very low proportion of WGS variants with 0.4<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>0.8 and  thus  most variants in thr4 had an <U+2009>><U+2009>0.8. The genomic prediction accuracies  however  presented a less clear picture  with only pwt showing increased accuracy after imposing a higher filter threshold based on   possibly because we used a mixed breed reference population with a density of only 50 k variants and with most variants having a low MAF. As a result  the prediction accuracy was relatively low regardless of the  threshold applied because SNP effects were imprecisely estimated due to low LD between SNPs and causal variants. Mean genomic heritability estimates () and mean accuracies of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) () in a Merino validation population. Heritability estimates were based on a random selection of 50 000 imputed variants from three classes based on Minimac3 : 0.0<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4  0.4<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0  and 0.8<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0 This is the first study to evaluate the empirical accuracy of imputed whole-genome sequence variants in sheep  using up to 935 sequenced sheep as a mixed breed reference population. We present results for two commonly used imputation programs  for single- and multi-breed reference populations  and for one crossbred and two purebred target populations. The results provide confidence that imputation to WGS in sheep can achieve high accuracy using this mixed breed reference population  even when imputing from a low-density 12 k SNP array. These reference sequences are publicly available and  thus  our findings are widely applicable and provide a practical and cost-effective approach for imputing large mixed or single-breed sheep populations to WGS. We also demonstrated that it was practical to use Eagle and Minimac3 to phase and impute more than 47 000 mixed breed sheep to WGS and to use Minimac3  to filter variants for genomic prediction. In our study  the FImpute and Minimac3 softwares performed equally well for imputing the most likely genotypes  which is in line with results for cattle []. Unlike Pausch et al. []  we did  however  not provide FImpute pedigree information because sheep pedigrees are generally shallow and may also contain more errors than dairy cattle pedigrees  which could negatively impact imputation []. In addition  Minimac3 requires pre-phasing of haplotypes and is more computationally demanding than FImpute []. However  Minimac3 did not fail on any of the ovine 26 autosomes for this study  while FImpute failed to impute OAR10 without removal of a 4 Mb segment between 70 and 74 Mb. A similar issue was reported by Pausch et al. [] when imputing cattle to WGS with FImpute. Typically  the regions that will be difficult to impute are not known a priori and  therefore  it can take considerable computational time to identify the genomic region that causes the issue when the program aborts. To assist with this  we provide a genome-wide map of regional imputation accuracy by 1-Mb segments (see Additional file : Figure S2)  which can be used to troubleshoot if imputation software aborts when imputing an entire chromosome. In contrast to FImpute  Minimac3 imputed the entire OAR10 chromosome without aborting but with an extremely low accuracy in the region where FImpute failed (Fig. ). Thus  it is imperative to have a means of filtering out very poorly imputed variants because they may affect downstream analyses such as association studies or genomic prediction. Minimac3 provides an  quality statistic  which as we have demonstrated  can be used as a practical filter to remove poorly imputed variants (e.g. Minimac3 <U+2009>><U+2009>0.4 corresponds to a mean empirical accuracy of 0.86  Fig. )  although it is not a perfect predictor of empirical imputation accuracy. The most suitable  threshold to use depends on the type of downstream analyses. For example  there may not be an optimal threshold when searching for a gene with a major effect  but a modest threshold may be prudent when using imputed sequence for genomic prediction. In a recent genomic prediction study in sheep  we removed WGS variants with an  threshold of =<U+2009>0.4 and demonstrated that imputed sequence variants increased the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to using only the standard 50 k ovine SNP set [  ]. Our results support the use of combining smaller purebred sequenced populations into a larger mixed breed reference set to impute both purebred and crossbred individuals  in agreement with findings for imputing purebred dairy cattle [  ]. Furthermore  this is expected in sheep because previous research demonstrated that there is widespread sharing of relatively large haplotypes across a large range of European breeds []. This could also explain why there was no further increase in accuracy using the ALL reference (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>935) compared to the EUR set (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>726). The ALL set included breeds from Asia and Africa that are known to diverge from European breeds []. Combining smaller sets of sequenced animals from different breeds into one large reference population provides a cost-effective approach to impute to WGS for sheep  particularly in countries such as Australia where many breeds and composites are used in the industry. The imputation accuracies achieved in this study were similar to or higher than those reported for imputed WGS in dairy cattle [    ]. This may be due to closer relationships (i.e. more haplotype sharing) between some animals in the target and reference sets compared to the cattle studies where 1000 bulls were more distant relatives []. In addition to the purebreds  our EUR set included 177 Australian sheep that were crossbreds (“composites”): more than 90% of these animals had some recent Merino ancestry  63% had some recent Border Leicester ancestry and a lower proportion included some recent Poll Dorset (37%) and White Suffolk (30%) ancestry. The White Suffolk breed in Australia was developed initially by crossing Suffolk to mainly Poll Dorset to remove the dark pigmented body regions. The target populations used in this study represent wool (Merino  MER)  terminal (Poll Dorset  PD) and maternal breeds (Border Leicester F1 cross) that have quite different effective population (Ne) sizes: estimated as 833 for MER  318 for PD and 242 for BL  respectively []. This likely explains why the imputation accuracy was always higher in the PD and F1 animals compared to the MER population although there were fewer PD and Border Leicester animals in the reference population (both pure and crossbreds). This phenomenon was also observed in an imputation study from low- to medium-density SNPs in sheep []. In agreement with recent findings in cattle []  we provided evidence that the mean imputation accuracy differed across chromosomes largely as a result of one or more substantial genomic regions (=<U+2009>1 Mb) being poorly imputed (e.g. a 4 Mb region on OAR10 at around 70 Mb). This indicates a regional mapping issue because the accuracy was averaged across 1-Mb windows  which would not be influenced by an occasional poorly imputed variant. In addition  the HD SNP density was generally low in these regions and in some regions  there was also a higher than usual density of sequence variants (e.g. OAR10 around 70 Mb). This could arise for example  from alignment errors due to large segmental duplications. In dairy cattle  Pausch et al. [] also found a sharp decline in imputation accuracy in several regions of the bovine genome that were previously identified as containing large tandem segmental duplications. Alternatively  the increased density of sequence variants could also reflect a truly more polymorphic region resulting in the region being more challenging to impute than less highly polymorphic regions. For example  the MHC region on OAR20 (around 25–28 Mb  []) showed poor imputation accuracy and a higher density of polymorphic sequence variants. The MHC region in sheep and cattle is known to harbour some duplicated regions [] and also in humans is generally found be highly polymorphic due to strong selection by evolutionary pressures such as many different pathogens []. The ovine MHC region shows a very strong homology with the bovine MHC []  thus it is not surprising that this region is also poorly imputed in cattle []. Liu et al. [] emphasized that low heterozygosity  high sequence similarity to other genomic regions  high GC content  segmental duplication and distance between genotyped markers are the major contributing factors to consistently poor imputation. The Minimac3  statistic and MAF of annotated variants suggest purging selection on missense variants because these variants have the highest proportion of variants in the lowest MAF band. Furthermore  the higher relative proportion of low  (<<U+2009>0.1) to low MAF (<<U+2009>0.05) variants in missense compared to intergenic and intronic categories suggests poorer imputation accuracy overall in missense variants. This could indicate that the missense variants are often younger than variants in the more neutral categories (due to purging selection) and younger mutations can be more difficult to impute accurately because the surrounding haplotypes are present with and without the new mutation []. The estimates of genomic heritability (Fig. ) suggest that using the Minimac3  statistic to pre-filter WGS variants before selecting subsets for downstream studies such as genomic prediction or association studies is a sensible strategy. The Minimac3  calculation is based on the premise that poorly imputed allele counts are shrunken towards their expectations based on the estimated allele frequency. Imputation for genomic prediction was carried out in a mixed breed target set  rather than single-breed target set  and thus it is possible that the  statistic was a less precise predictor of imputation quality for the mixed breed set than for the single breed set. This  in turn  may have influenced our genomic prediction results  for which there was no clear disadvantage for the low  variants. Within the scope of this study  it was not possible to compare our genomic prediction results with results from a ‘gold standard’ set of real 50 k genotypes for two reasons: first  many animals in this population were only genotyped on LD SNP arrays and  second  the MAF distribution of SNPs on the 50 k chip is very different than the distribution of MAF for the random sets of SNPs selected here. Druet et al. [] demonstrated that the use of WGS variants for genomic prediction (compared to dense SNP panels) provides the largest increase in accuracy when the causal sequence variants are rare and thus in low LD with the SNPs genotyped on panels. For example  in our data  the missense variants had a much higher proportion of rare variants than HD array SNPs and are also more likely to affect phenotypes because they change the protein coding sequence. However  these low MAF variants are also more likely to be poorly imputed and they comprise a large proportion of sequence variants (~<U+2009>65% with <U+2009><<U+2009>0.4; Fig. ). Thus  it is useful to have a means of filtering out the least accurately imputed variants  such as by applying the Minimac3  statistic. However  it is also important to enlarge the reference population such that there is more information to impute the less common variants more accurately. We achieved a mean accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence of up to 0.97 across target breeds using the Minimac3 software  with pre-phasing using the Eagle software and filtering variants based on the Minimac3  being higher than 0.4. Imputation accuracy improved by combining smaller breed sets into a multi-breed reference. The empirical accuracy varied based on MAF  target breed  reference breed composition  and chromosome region. Brown DJ  Swan AA  Boerner V  Li L  Gurman PM  McMillan AJ  et al.
