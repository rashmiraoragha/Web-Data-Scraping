Commercial meat sheep populations participating in sire-referencing schemes were simulated to investigate the effect of selection on PrP genotypes on ARR and VRQ allele frequencies  inbreeding and genetic gain in a performance trait under selection. PrP selection strategies modelled included selection against the VRQ allele and in favour of the ARR allele. Assuming realistic initial PrP frequencies  selection against the VRQ allele had a minimal impact on performance and inbreeding. However  when selection was also in favour of the ARR allele and the frequency of this allele was relatively low  there was a loss of up to three to four years of genetic gain over the 15 years of selection. Most loss in gain occurred during the first five years. In general  the rate of inbreeding was reduced when applying PrP selection. Since animals were first selected on their PrP genotype before being selected on the performance trait  the intensity of selection on performance was weaker under PrP selection (compared with no PrP selection). Eradication of the VRQ allele or fixation of the ARR allele within 15 years of selection was possible only with PrP selection targeting all breeding animals."

"Interval mapping of quantitative trait loci with selective DNA pooling data"	"Authors: Jing Wang  Kenneth J Koehler and Jack CM Dekkers"	"Department of Animal Science and Center for Integrated Animal Genomics  Iowa State University  Ames  Iowa  50011  USAJing Wang & Jack CM Dekkers Department of Statistics  Iowa State University  Ames  Iowa  50011  USAJing Wang & Kenneth J Koehler Pioneer Hi-Bred International  Johnston  Iowa  50131  USAJing Wang"	"No Co-Author"	"6 December 2007"	"Selective DNA pooling is an efficient method to identify chromosomal regions that harbor quantitative trait loci (QTL) by comparing marker allele frequencies in pooled DNA from phenotypically extreme individuals. Currently used single marker analysis methods can detect linkage of markers to a QTL but do not provide separate estimates of QTL position and effect  nor do they utilize the joint information from multiple markers. In this study  two interval mapping methods for analysis of selective DNA pooling data were developed and evaluated. One was based on least squares regression (LS-pool) and the other on approximate maximum likelihood (ML-pool). Both methods simultaneously utilize information from multiple markers and multiple families and can be applied to different family structures (half-sib  F2 cross and backcross). The results from these two interval mapping methods were compared with results from single marker analysis by simulation. The results indicate that both LS-pool and ML-pool provided greater power to detect the QTL than single marker analysis. They also provide separate estimates of QTL location and effect. With large family sizes  both LS-pool and ML-pool provided similar power and estimates of QTL location and effect as selective genotyping. With small family sizes  however  the LS-pool method resulted in severely biased estimates of QTL location for distal QTL but this bias was reduced with the ML-pool."

By December 31st  2006  13 765 individuals had been karyotyped in our laboratory  62% of these since 2002.

Moderate but significant G × E interactions were detected for carcass traits  a significant one was observed between E and S or C for growth curve parameters but none between C and S. If G × E interactions are set aside   selecting on traits recorded in C  abdominal fatness is the best indirect selection criterion for FCR but if they are taken in account then leg yield or growth curve parameters in S and growth curve parameters in E are better.

The goal was to introgress an allele with a large negative effect on fibre diameter into a Merino flock possessing medium average fibre diameter. The influence of two factors was explored: the strategy used to select animals from the purebred and backcross line for backcrossing purposes and the use of selection on background markers to accelerate the return to the purebred line's genome. The results were compared to introgression based on EBVs only. Introgression using EBVs only produced almost the same response in the dollar index as marker-based introgression methods. However  this study did not account for some of the costs associated with implementing the programmes  including the costs of phenotyping and genotyping. Given that the cost of measuring fibre diameter is low  it was concluded that introgression on EBVs only would be the preferred method since the marginal profit of marker-assisted introgression would not be large enough to cover the additional cost of genotyping. In marker-assisted introgression  reciprocal crossing of male and female selection candidates from the backcross and the purebred line was the most advantageous strategy from a practical and profit point of view.

This diet change presents a potential for genotype-environment (G × E) interactions. We tested whether current salmonid breeding programmes that evaluate and select within fishmeal diets also improve growth and efficiency on potential future SBM diets. A total of 1680 European whitefish from 70 families were reared with either fishmeal- or SBM-based diets in a split-family design. Individual daily gain (DG)  daily feed intake (DFI) and feed efficiency (FE) were recorded. Traits displayed only weak G × E interactions as variances and heritabilities did not differ substantially between the diets  and cross-diet genetic correlations were near unity. In both diets  DFI exhibited moderate heritability and had very high genetic correlation with DG whereas FE had low heritability. Predicted genetic responses demonstrated that selection to increase DG and FE on the fishmeal diet lead to favourable responses on the SBM diet. Selection for FE based on an index including DG and DFI achieved at least double FE gain  selection on DG alone.

This diet change presents a potential for genotype-environment (G × E) interactions. We tested whether current salmonid breeding programmes that evaluate and select within fishmeal diets also improve growth and efficiency on potential future SBM diets. A total of 1680 European whitefish from 70 families were reared with either fishmeal- or SBM-based diets in a split-family design. Individual daily gain (DG)  daily feed intake (DFI) and feed efficiency (FE) were recorded. Traits displayed only weak G × E interactions as variances and heritabilities did not differ substantially between the diets  and cross-diet genetic correlations were near unity. In both diets  DFI exhibited moderate heritability and had very high genetic correlation with DG whereas FE had low heritability. Predicted genetic responses demonstrated that selection to increase DG and FE on the fishmeal diet lead to favourable responses on the SBM diet. Selection for FE based on an index including DG and DFI achieved at least double FE gain  selection on DG alone. Therefore  current breeding programmes are improving the biological ability of salmonids to use novel plant-based diets  and aiding the aquaculture industry to reduce fishmeal use.

This is combined with information on genetic merit of bulls to compare bull selection methods that minimise F and maximise breeding value for profit (called APR in Australia). The genetic composition of the future cow population of Australian Holstein-Friesian (HF) and Jersey up to 6 years into the future was predicted. F in Australian HF and Jersey breeds is likely to increase by about 0.002 and 0.003 per year between 2002 and 2008  respectively. A comparison of bull selection methods showed that a method that selects the best bull from all available bulls for each current or future cow  based on its calf's APR minus F depression  is better than bull selection methods based on APR alone  APR adjusted for mean F of prospective progeny after random mating and mean APR adjusted for the relationship between the selected bulls. This method reduced F of prospective progeny by about a third to a half compared to the other methods when bulls are mated to current and future cows that will be available 5 to 6 years from now. The method also reduced the relationship between the bulls selected to nearly the same extent as the method that is aimed at maximising genetic gain adjusted for the relationship between bulls. The method achieves this because cows with different pedigree exist in the population and the method selects relatively unrelated bulls to mate to these different cows. Selecting the best bull for each current or future cow so that the calf's genetic merit minus F depression is maximised can slow the rate of increase in F in the population."

This method reduced F of prospective progeny by about a third to a half compared to the other methods when bulls are mated to current and future cows that will be available 5 to 6 years from now. The method also reduced the relationship between the bulls selected to nearly the same extent as the method that is aimed at maximising genetic gain adjusted for the relationship between bulls. The method achieves this because cows with different pedigree exist in the population and the method selects relatively unrelated bulls to mate to these different cows. Selecting the best bull for each current or future cow so that the calf's genetic merit minus F depression is maximised can slow the rate of increase in F in the population.

"Fine mapping of multiple QTL using combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium mapping – A comparison of single QTL and multi QTL methods"	"Authors: Eivind Uleberg and Theo H. E.

Meuwissen"	"No Co-Author"	"14 April 2007"	"Two previously described QTL mapping methods  which combine linkage analysis (LA) and linkage disequilibrium analysis (LD)  were compared for their ability to detect and map multiple QTL. The methods were tested on five different simulated data sets in which the exact QTL positions were known. Every simulated data set contained two QTL  but the distances between these QTL were varied from 15 to 150 cM. The results show that the single QTL mapping method (LDLA) gave good results as long as the distance between the QTL was large (> 90 cM). When the distance between the QTL was reduced  the single QTL method had problems positioning the two QTL and tended to position only one QTL   a \"ghost\" QTL  in between the two real QTL positions. The multi QTL mapping method (MP-LDLA) gave good results for all evaluated distances between the QTL. For the large distances between the QTL (> 90 cM) the single QTL method more often positioned the QTL in the correct marker bracket  but considering the broader likelihood peaks of the single point method it could be argued that the multi QTL method was more precise. Since the distances were reduced the multi QTL method was clearly more accurate than the single QTL method. The two methods combine well  and together provide a good tool to position single or multiple QTL in practical situations  where the number of QTL and their positions are unknown."

The methods were tested on five different simulated data sets in which the exact QTL positions were known. Every simulated data set contained two QTL  but the distances between these QTL were varied from 15 to 150 cM. The results show that the single QTL mapping method (LDLA) gave good results as long as the distance between the QTL was large (> 90 cM). When the distance between the QTL was reduced  the single QTL method had problems positioning the two QTL and tended to position only one QTL   a \"ghost\" QTL  in between the two real QTL positions. The multi QTL mapping method (MP-LDLA) gave good results for all evaluated distances between the QTL. For the large distances between the QTL (> 90 cM) the single QTL method more often positioned the QTL in the correct marker bracket  but considering the broader likelihood peaks of the single point method it could be argued that the multi QTL method was more precise. Since the distances were reduced the multi QTL method was clearly more accurate than the single QTL method. The two methods combine well  and together provide a good tool to position single or multiple QTL in practical situations  where the number of QTL and their positions are unknown.

We identified five silent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the  cDNA: c.669T > C (exon 3)  c.1227C > T (exon 5)  c.1452C > T (exon 7)  c.1665T > C and c.1755A > G (exon 8). One pair of these SNP (c.1665T > C and c.1755A > G) co-segregated in the analyzed line  and the SNP c.669T > C showed the same segregation pattern as the  II polymorphism. These polymorphisms were tested in this study  although the c.1452C > T SNP within exon 7 was not analyzed due to its low informativeness. In the  cDNA  one missense SNP was found within exon 5  which caused an amino acid substitution in the coded protein: \"c.949G > A (p.Val317Met)\" and was tested on sow litter size. Information on 1622 litter records from 408 genotyped sows was analyzed to determine whether these SNP influenced the total number of piglets born (TNB) or the number of born alive (NBA). The polymorphisms : [ II; c.669T > C]  : [c.1665T > C; c.1755A > G] and : c.949G > A showed no statistically significant association with litter size. However  the : c.1227T allele was significantly associated with TNB.

We identified five silent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the  cDNA: c.669T > C (exon 3)  c.1227C > T (exon 5)  c.1452C > T (exon 7)  c.1665T > C and c.1755A > G (exon 8). One pair of these SNP (c.1665T > C and c.1755A > G) co-segregated in the analyzed line  and the SNP c.669T > C showed the same segregation pattern as the  II polymorphism. These polymorphisms were tested in this study  although the c.1452C > T SNP within exon 7 was not analyzed due to its low informativeness. In the  cDNA  one missense SNP was found within exon 5  which caused an amino acid substitution in the coded protein: \"c.949G > A (p.Val317Met)\" and was tested on sow litter size. Information on 1622 litter records from 408 genotyped sows was analyzed to determine whether these SNP influenced the total number of piglets born (TNB) or the number of born alive (NBA). The polymorphisms : [ II; c.669T > C]  : [c.1665T > C; c.1755A > G] and : c.949G > A showed no statistically significant association with litter size. However  the : c.1227T allele was significantly associated with TNB. The additive substitution effect was estimated to be 0.40 piglets born per litter ( < 0.03)  and no dominance effects were observed.

The first model estimates the correlation between intercept and slope of the random regression  while the other model restricts this correlation to 1 or -1  which is expected under a bi-allelic QTL model.

"Optimisation of contribution of candidate parents to maximise genetic gain and restricting inbreeding using semidefinite programming (Open Access publication)"	"Authors: Ricardo Pong-Wong and John A. Woolliams"	"Roslin Institute (Edinburgh)  Roslin  Midlothian  EH25 9PS  UKRicardo Pong-Wong & John A. Woolliams"	"No Co-Author"	"11 January 2007"	"An approach for optimising genetic contributions of candidates to control inbreeding in the offspring generation using semidefinite programming (SDP) was proposed. Formulations were done for maximising genetic gain while restricting inbreeding to a preset value and for minimising inbreeding without regard of gain. Adaptations to account for candidates with fixed contributions were also shown. Using small but traceable numerical examples  the SDP method was compared with an alternative based upon Lagrangian multipliers (RSRO). The SDP method always found the optimum solution that maximises genetic gain at any level of restriction imposed on inbreeding  unlike RSRO which failed to do so in several situations. For these situations  the expected gains from the solution obtained with RSRO were between 1.5–9% lower than those expected from the optimum solution found with SDP with assigned contributions varying widely. In conclusion SDP is a reliable and flexible method for solving contribution problems."

"Editorial"	"Authors: "	""	"No Co-Author"	"11 January 2007"	"As a new year begins  it is a good time to review developments of the past twelve months and to announce some changes in GSE for 2007. Since November 2005  GSE has received 122 new manuscripts  accepted 42 articles (of which 19 were submitted before November 2005) and still has 32 manuscripts in evaluation. Thus the number of submitted manuscripts is constantly increasing while the number of published articles is maintained at around 40 per year. Published articles originate from 15 countries with Spain leading (10)  followed by the USA (5)  Australia  France and Germany (4 each)  UK (3)  China  Denmark and Finland (2 each) and finally  Brazil  Canada  Greece  Japan  Norway and Slovenia. Of these 42 published papers  19 deal with methodologies of quantitative genetics and their applications to animal selection and characterization  six address genetic diversity of populations and breeds and seven fall in the field of molecular genetics. These figures clearly show that GSE is attractive to the animal quantitative genetics community and has acquired a strong experience and reputation in this domain."
