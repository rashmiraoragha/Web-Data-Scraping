The mode of inheritance is dominant for the polled trait and recessive for sex-reversal. In XX PIS mutants  the expression of testis-specific genes is observed very precociously during gonad development. Nevertheless  a delay of 4–5 days is observed in comparison with normal testis differentiation in XY males. By positional cloning  we demonstrate that the PIS mutation is an 11.7-kb regulatory-deletion affecting the expression of two genes   and  which could act synergistically to promote ovarian differentiation. The transcriptional extinction of these two genes leads  very early  to testis-formation in XX homozygous PIS mutants. According to their expression profiles and bibliographic data  we propose that  may be an ovary-differentiating gene  and the non-coding RNA   an anti-testis factor repressing   a key regulator of testis differentiation. Under this hypothesis    the testis-determining factor would inhibit these two genes in the gonads of XY males  to ensure testis differentiation."

According to their expression profiles and bibliographic data  we propose that  may be an ovary-differentiating gene  and the non-coding RNA   an anti-testis factor repressing   a key regulator of testis differentiation. Under this hypothesis    the testis-determining factor would inhibit these two genes in the gonads of XY males  to ensure testis differentiation. Correspondence to                 .  Pailhoux  E.

"Foreword to the international workshop on major genes and QTL in sheep and goats"	"Authors: Jean Michel Elsen"	""	"No Co-Author"	"15 December 2005"	"This is the third international meeting dealing with major genes in small ruminants. The first was held in Armidale (NSW  Australia) in 1980  just after the discovery of the Booroola gene by B. Bindon and L. Piper. The discovery of a gene having such a large effect on ovulation rate and prolificacy in sheep was totally unsuspected at this time and a number of research teams all over the world concentrated their efforts to study its effects and identify the causal mutation. About 20 years were finally needed to obtain this information  which opened a new approach to the physiological regulation of reproduction.The second meeting was organised in 1990 in Toulouse along the same lines. Although its main concern was the Booroola gene  other major genes influencing ovulation in sheep were also considered. Indeed  an increasing amount of evidence demonstrated that  on the contrary to the current opinion in quantitative genetics laboratories before 1980  prolificacy is not always controlled by a very large number of genes each exhibiting a very small effect  but may also be influenced by genes with large effects  generalising the Booroola situation to other populations.Since then  mixed inheritance was also found for other production traits such as body conformation  seasonality or milk composition. However  the major evolution has been the inexpensive large-scale access to molecular genetic information  using PCR  microsatellites and SNP technologies.

The first was held in Armidale (NSW  Australia) in 1980  just after the discovery of the Booroola gene by B. Bindon and L. Piper. The discovery of a gene having such a large effect on ovulation rate and prolificacy in sheep was totally unsuspected at this time and a number of research teams all over the world concentrated their efforts to study its effects and identify the causal mutation. About 20 years were finally needed to obtain this information  which opened a new approach to the physiological regulation of reproduction. The second meeting was organised in 1990 in Toulouse along the same lines. Although its main concern was the Booroola gene  other major genes influencing ovulation in sheep were also considered. Indeed  an increasing amount of evidence demonstrated that  on the contrary to the current opinion in quantitative genetics laboratories before 1980  prolificacy is not always controlled by a very large number of genes each exhibiting a very small effect  but may also be influenced by genes with large effects  generalising the Booroola situation to other populations. Since then  mixed inheritance was also found for other production traits such as body conformation  seasonality or milk composition. However  the major evolution has been the inexpensive large-scale access to molecular genetic information  using PCR  microsatellites and SNP technologies. QTL detection experiments are performed in all domestic species  including sheep and goats  and the identification of genes having an average effect on the performance trait variability is now possible. The utilisation of these polymorphisms should also be a great help for a better management of populations  either through the selection of breeders or through the preservation of genetic diversity.

"A presentation of the differences between the sheep and goat genetic maps"	"Authors: Jillian F Maddox"	"Centre for Animal Biotechnology  The University of Melbourne  Victoria  3010  AustraliaJillian F Maddox"	"No Co-Author"	"15 December 2005"	"The current autosomal version (4.2) of the sheep genetic map comprises 1175 loci and spans ~3540 cM. This corresponds to almost complete coverage of the sheep genome. Each chromosome is represented by a single linkage group  with the largest gap between adjacent loci being 19.8 cM. In contrast the 1998 goat genetic map (the most recently published) is much less well developed spanning 2737 cM and comprising only 307 loci. Only one of the goat chromosomes appears to have complete coverage (chromosome 27)  and 16 of the chromosomes are comprised of two or more linkage groups  or a linkage group and one or more unlinked markers. The two maps share 218 loci  and the maps have been aligned using the shared loci as reference points. Overall there is good agreement between the maps in terms of homologous loci mapping to equivalent chromosomes in the two species  with only four markers mapping to non-equivalent chromosomes. However  there are lots of inversions in locus order between the sheep and goat chromosomes.

The objective of the current study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with bone mineralization and strength in a chicken resource population. Layer (White Leghorn hens) and broiler (Cobb-Cobb roosters) lines were crossed to generate an F2 population of 508Â hens over seven hatches  and 26 traits related to bone integrity  including bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC)  were measured. Genotypes of 120 microsatellite markers on 28 autosomal groups were determined  and interval mapping was conducted to identify QTL regions. Twenty-three tests representing three chromosomal regions (chromosomes 4  10 and 27) contained significant QTL that surpassed the 5% genome-wise threshold  and 47 tests representing 15 chromosomes identified suggestive QTL that surpassed the 5% chromosome-wise threshold. Although no significant QTL influencing BMD and BMC were detected after adjusting for variation in body weight and egg production  multiple suggestive QTL were found.

The variance component method combining linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis seems to be an appropriate choice to analyze data sets which vary in marker density and which contain complex family structures.

"A combination of walk-back and optimum contribution selection in fish: a simulation study"	"Authors: Anna K Sonesson"	"AKVAFORSK (Institute of Aquaculture Research Ltd)  P.O. Box 5010  1432  Ås  NorwayAnna K Sonesson"	"No Co-Author"	"15 November 2005"	"The aim of this paper was to study the performance of a novel fish breeding scheme  which is a combination of walk-back and optimum contribution selection using stochastic simulation. In this walk-back selection scheme  batches of different sizes (50  100  1000  5000 and 10 000) with the phenotypically superior fish from one tank with mixed families were genotyped to set up the pedigree. BLUP estimated breeding values were calculated. The optimum contribution selection method was used with the rate of inbreeding (<U+0394>) constrained to 0.005 or 0.01 per generation. If the constraint on <U+0394> could not be held  a second batch of fish was genotyped etc. Compared with the genotyping of all selection candidates (1000  5000 or 10 000)  the use of batches saves genotyping costs. The results show that two batches of 50 fish were often necessary. With a batch size of 100  genetic level was 76–92% of the genetic level achieved for schemes with all fish being genotyped and thus candidates for the optimum contribution selection step. More parents were selected for schemes with larger batches  resulting in a higher genetic gain  especially when all selection candidates were genotyped. There was little extra genetic gain in genotyping of 1000 fish instead of 100 for the larger schemes of 5000 and 10 000 candidates. The accuracy of breeding values was similar for all batch sizes (~0.30)  but higher (~0.5) when all candidates were included. Since only the phenotypically most superior fish were genotyped  BLUP-EBV were biased.

A line selected for large litter size for 124 generations (H) and a control line (K) maintained without selection for the same number of generations were crossed (HK) and used as a basis for the experiment. Within the HK cross  full sib  cousin or random mating were practised for two generations in order to create new inbreeding (IB) at a fast rate. In the first generation of systematic mating  old inbreeding was regenerated in addition to creation of new inbreeding from the mating design giving total inbreeding (IB). The number of pups born alive (NBA) and body weights of the animals were then analysed by a model including both IB and IB.

University of New England  Armidale  NSW  2351  AustraliaKarin Meyer"	"No Co-Author"	"15 September 2005"	"Regression on the basis function of B-splines has been advocated as an alternative to orthogonal polynomials in random regression analyses. Basic theory of splines in mixed model analyses is reviewed  and estimates from analyses of weights of Australian Angus cattle from birth to 820 days of age are presented. Data comprised 84 533 records on 20 731 animals in 43 herds  with a high proportion of animals with 4 or more weights recorded. Changes in weights with age were modelled through B-splines of age at recording. A total of thirteen analyses  considering different combinations of linear  quadratic and cubic B-splines and up to six knots  were carried out. Results showed good agreement for all ages with many records  but fluctuated where data were sparse.

Basic theory of splines in mixed model analyses is reviewed  and estimates from analyses of weights of Australian Angus cattle from birth to 820 days of age are presented. Data comprised 84 533 records on 20 731 animals in 43 herds  with a high proportion of animals with 4 or more weights recorded. Changes in weights with age were modelled through B-splines of age at recording. A total of thirteen analyses  considering different combinations of linear  quadratic and cubic B-splines and up to six knots  were carried out. Results showed good agreement for all ages with many records  but fluctuated where data were sparse.

Detilleux"	"No Co-Author"	"15 July 2005"	"Given that individuals are genetically heterogeneous in their degree of resistance to infection  a model is proposed to formulate appropriate choices that will limit the spread of an infectious disease.

To do so  the risks associated with the PrP genotype and other transmission factors in relation to clinical scrapie were estimated. Data from 4049 Romanov sheep affected by natural scrapie were analyzed using survival analysis techniques. The original data set included 1310 animals with missing genotypes; five of those had uncensored records. Different missing genotype-information patterns were simulated for uncensored and censored records. Three strategies differing in the way genotype information was handled were tested. Firstly  records with unknown genotypes were discarded (P1); secondly  those records were grouped in an unknown class (P2). Finally the probabilities of genotypes were assigned (P3). Whatever the strategy  the ranking of relative risks for the most susceptible genotypes (VRQ-VRQ  ARQ-VRQ and ARQ-ARQ) was similar even when the non-genotyped animals were not a negligible part of uncensored records. However  P3 had a more efficient way of handling missing genotype information. As compared to P1  either P2 or P3 avoided discarding the records of non-genotyped animals; however  P3 eliminated the unknown class and the risk associated with this group. Genotype probabilities were shown to be a useful technique to handle records of individuals with unknown genotype."

Whatever the strategy  the ranking of relative risks for the most susceptible genotypes (VRQ-VRQ  ARQ-VRQ and ARQ-ARQ) was similar even when the non-genotyped animals were not a negligible part of uncensored records. However  P3 had a more efficient way of handling missing genotype information. As compared to P1  either P2 or P3 avoided discarding the records of non-genotyped animals; however  P3 eliminated the unknown class and the risk associated with this group. Genotype probabilities were shown to be a useful technique to handle records of individuals with unknown genotype. Correspondence to                 .  Vitezica  Z.G.  Elsen  J.  Rupp  R.

These records were a subset of the complete data for both countries and comprised a sample of herds that had recorded progeny of sires used across both countries. Genetic and phenotypic parameters for weaning weight were estimated within the countries. The estimates of direct genetic heritabilities were higher in France than in the Trans-Tasman block (0.31  0.22)  while direct-maternal genetic correlations were less negative in the Trans-Tasman block (-0.10) than in France (-0.21). Different strategies for an international evaluation were studied  and the correlations between the estimated breeding values (EBV) of national evaluations and these strategies were derived. The international evaluation strategies were a) an animal model on raw performance data with non unity genetic correlations and heterogeneous residual and genetic variances across countries; b) the same animal model applied to pre-corrected (for fixed effects) performance data; and c) a sire model on de-regressed proofs (MACE). Estimates of the genetic correlations between weaning weight in both countries were 0.86 (0.80) for direct (maternal) genetic effects for the first strategy. Estimation of variance components by MACE appeared to be very sensitive to the sample of bulls and their reliability approximations. Variance component estimates obtained using pre-corrected data were inconsistent with estimates on raw data. However  the EBV predicted using pre-corrected data and parameters estimated from the raw data were similar to those predicted from raw data. Correlations between national and international EBV were always high (> 0.90) for sires  whichever genetic effect (direct or maternal) or international evaluation model was considered. The ranking of the bulls in the top 100 is of primary interest in terms of international genetic evaluation. In this study  some re-ranking of sires was observed for the top 100 bulls between countries and between the three international evaluation models.

For each breed the relative contribution to the core set was estimated and the breeds were ranked for conservation priority according to their relative contribution. The method was based on average kinships between and within breeds and these can be estimated using genetic marker data. The method was compared to a recently published core set method that maximises the variance of a hypothetical population that could be obtained by interbreeding the conserved breeds (MVO core set). The results show that the MVT (MVO) core set favours breeds with a high (low) within breed kinship that are not related to other breeds.

Theoretical predictions of proportional genomic contributions  including donor linkage drag  from ancestors used at each generation of crossing after an introgression programme agreed closely with simulated results. The obligate drag  the donor genome surrounding the target locus that cannot be removed by subsequent selection  was also studied. It was shown that the number of backcross generations and the length of the chromosome affected proportional genomic contributions to the carrier chromosomes. Population structure had no significant effect on ancestral contributions and linkage drag but it did have an effect on the obligate drag whereby larger offspring groups resulted in smaller obligate drag. The implications for an introgression programme of the number of backcross generations  the population structure and the carrier chromosome length are discussed.

Theoretical predictions of proportional genomic contributions  including donor linkage drag  from ancestors used at each generation of crossing after an introgression programme agreed closely with simulated results. The obligate drag  the donor genome surrounding the target locus that cannot be removed by subsequent selection  was also studied. It was shown that the number of backcross generations and the length of the chromosome affected proportional genomic contributions to the carrier chromosomes. Population structure had no significant effect on ancestral contributions and linkage drag but it did have an effect on the obligate drag whereby larger offspring groups resulted in smaller obligate drag. The implications for an introgression programme of the number of backcross generations  the population structure and the carrier chromosome length are discussed. The equations derived describing contributions to the genome from individuals from a given generation provide a framework to predict the genomic composition of a population after the introgression of a favourable donor allele.

Genetic parameters and direct and correlated responses in performance and carcass traits were estimated on 2884 pigs with pedigrees comprising a total of 5324 animals  with restricted maximum likelihood and best linear unbiased prediction methods applied to a multi-trait animal model. Estimates of heritability (± SE) were 0.19 ± 0.04 for lifetime daily gain (LDG)  0.16 ± 0.03 for test daily gain (TDG)  0.25 ± 0.04 for ultrasound P2 backfat (UBF) and 0.16 ± 0.03 for food conversion ratio during test (TFC)  and 0.15 ± 0.04 for daily carcass weight gain (CDG)  0.43 ± 0.06 for carcass backfat (CFT) and 0.40 ± 0.06 for carcass lean percentage (LEAN). Common litter effects for TDG  UBF and TFC were less than 5% and for LDG  17% of total phenotypic variance. Genetic correlations between performance and carcass traits were moderately to highly favourable. After four years of divergent selection for growth rate  the selection responses in estimated breeding value (EBV) for TDG were 40.14 and -41.11 g (SED 2.95) for the high and low growth lines  respectively. The regressions of EBV on year of birth  indicate that the annual genetic trend for TDG  was 8.73 g/yr in the high and -8.48 g/yr in the low lines ( < 0.001). Correlated genetic responses in the high and low lines respectively were 5.28 g and -12.40 g (SED 2.09) in LDG  -0.35 mm and 0.56 mm (SED 0.009) in UBF  -0.145 units and 0.185 units (SED 0.012) in TFC  3.17 g and -10.97 g (SED 1.53) in CDG  -1.13 mm and 1.01 mm (SED 0.155) in CFT and 1.24% and -1.27% (SED 0.150) in LEAN. It was concluded that selection for increased post-weaning daily gain on a ration of fixed amount reduces the age at slaughter and the level of backfat and increases the efficiency of food utilisation  weight and leanness of pig carcasses."

Statistical methods for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with epistasis effects have become available recently. However  little is known about the statistical power and sample size requirements for mapping epistatic QTL using genetic markers. In this study  we developed analytical formulae to calculate the statistical power and sample requirement for detecting each epistasis effect under the F-2 design based on crossing inbred lines. Assuming two unlinked interactive QTL and the same absolute value for all epistasis effects  the heritability of additive × additive (a × a) effect is twice as large as that of additive × dominance (a × d) or dominance × additive (d × a) effect  and is four times as large as that of dominance × dominance (d × d) effect. Consequently  among the four types of epistasis effects involving two loci  'a × a' effect is the easiest to detect whereas 'd × d' effect is the most difficult to detect. The statistical power for detecting 'a × a' effect is similar to that for detecting dominance effect of a single QTL. The sample size requirements for detecting 'a × d'  'd × a' and 'd × d' are highly sensitive to increased distance between the markers and the interacting QTLs.

The animals were divergently selected for five generations for either a high (H line) or a low (L line) body weight  based on their BLUP breeding value. Heritability () was 0.22 for 63-d body weight ( = 4754). Growth performance and quantitative carcass traits in the C group were intermediate between the H and L lines ( = 390). Perirenal fat proportion ( = 0.64) and dressing out percentage ( = 0.55) ranked in the order L < H = C (from high to low).

The animals were divergently selected for five generations for either a high (H line) or a low (L line) body weight  based on their BLUP breeding value. Heritability () was 0.22 for 63-d body weight ( = 4754). Growth performance and quantitative carcass traits in the C group were intermediate between the H and L lines ( = 390). Perirenal fat proportion ( = 0.64) and dressing out percentage ( = 0.55) ranked in the order L < H = C (from high to low).
