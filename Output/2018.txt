A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ear size has been identified on SSC5 (SSC for  chromosome) but the underlying causative gene and mutation remain unknown. Thus  our aim was to identify the gene responsible for enlarged ears in pig. First  we narrowed down the QTL region on SSC5 to a 137.85-kb interval that harbors only the  () gene. Then  we identified a 38.7-kb copy number variation (CNV) that affects the last two exons of  and could be the candidate causative mutation for this QTL. This CNV showed complete concordance with genotype at the QTL of the founder animals in a white Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Erhualian F intercross and was found only in pigs from six Chinese indigenous breeds with large ears and from the Landrace breed with half-floppy ears.

Our findings shed insight into the underlying mechanism of development of external ears in mammals and contribute to a better understanding of how the presence of CNV can regulate gene expression. The size and type of ears are important conformation characteristics that distinguish pig breeds. Many Chinese indigenous pig breeds  such as Erhualian and Min  show unusually large and floppy ears. In contrast  Wild boars and European commercial breeds such as Large White and Duroc have small and erect ears. In humans  congenital underdevelopment of the external ear or microtia affects about 0.83 to 17.40 newborns per 10 000 in different ethnic populations []. The pig is an important biomedical model [] and naturally occurring mutations that affect ear size in pigs offer opportunities to investigate the mechanisms that underlie development of human external ears. To date  quantitative trait loci (QTL) for porcine ear size have been identified on several pig chromosomes (SSC for ) [  ]  of which two major QTL have consistently been detected on SSC5 and 7 in multiple populations [  ]. Previously  we showed that a missense mutation in the  () gene was the causative mutation for the QTL on SSC7 []. For the QTL on SSC5  Zhang et al. [] analyzed the association of two SNPs within the  () gene with ear size in a Large white<U+2009>×<U+2009>Min F intercross. We refined the QTL on SSC5 to a 8.7-cM interval and proposed  as a candidate gene []. Interestingly  the genomic region between 31.74 and 33.78 Mb on SSC5 shows a high level of genetic differentiation between breeds with floppy ears and breeds with prick/partly floppy ears []. In addition  this region is orthologous to a QTL for ear type in dogs [  ] and a strong selection signature within  has been reported in large-eared sheep []. However  the causative mutation(s) for this QTL remain(s) unexplored in mammals. In this paper  we report (1) the identification of a 38.7-kb copy number variation (CNV)  which involves part of   as the suggestive causative mutation for this QTL on SSC5  and (2) the underlying biological mechanism that is responsible for its effect on ear size. Five pig populations that included 912 White Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Erhualian F pigs (hereafter referred to as F)  403 Sutai (F of a Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Meishan cross)  312 purebred Laiwu  343 Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>(Landrace<U+2009>×<U+2009>Yorkshire) (DLY)  and 331 purebred Erhualian pigs were phenotyped and used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ear size. The F intercross was constructed and managed as described previously [  ]. Briefly  two White Duroc boars and 17 Erhualian sows were mated to produce F animals  and then nine F sires and 59 F dams were randomly intercrossed to generate 1912 F individuals. A total of 912 F individuals were phenotyped after slaughter at 240<U+2009>±<U+2009>3 days of age. Sutai is a Chinese synthetic breed that was originally produced by intercrossing Chinese Taihu and Western Duroc []. In this study  435 Sutai pigs were generated by crossing four Sutai boars with 55 Sutai sows and slaughtered at 240<U+2009>±<U+2009>3 days of age. Except for the DLY population that was raised on a commercial farm (Xiushui  Jiangxi) until slaughter (90–100 kg)  the four other populations were raised on an experimental farm at Jiangxi Agricultural University in Nanchang  Jiangxi. One hundred and forty-four purebred Landrace pigs were phenotyped for ear size and used to evaluate the association between the identified CNV and ear size. These 144 pigs were raised on a commercial pig farm (Zhengbang  Jiangxi). To evaluate the distribution of the causative CNV  we used three Chinese indigenous purebred breeds with small and erect ears (Diannan small-ear  Tibetan and Mingguang small-ear)  five Chinese indigenous purebred breeds with large and floppy ears (Hetao large-ear  Min  Mi  Jiaxing Black and Meishan)  three western commercial breeds with small and erect ears (Large White  Duroc and White Duroc)  for illustrations see (Additional file : Figure S1) and for the number of individuals per breed see Table   and 11 Chinese wild boars. Two methods were used to determine ear size: (1) the ear size of 912 F  331 Erhualian  435 Sutai  343 DLY and 314 Laiwu pigs  was measured as previously described []: after dissection from the slaughtered pig  each ear profile was drawn on a sulphate paper  which was scanned  and ear areas were calculated by the Leica Qwin area measurement software (Leica  USA); and (2) for the 144 Landrace pigs  ear size was measured on live animals by taking photographs []: the ears of each animal were fixed and photographed with a ruler placed on the surface of the ear as an internal size reference  and the surface of each ear was calculated using the Leica Qwin software (Leica  USA). In addition  we recorded the body weight of each phenotyped pig to use as covariate in the statistical analysis. Ear tissue was sampled from 26 Sutai two-day old piglets  i.e. 10 CNV/CNV  10 wild-type  and six CNV/wild-type piglets  and used for gene expression analysis. Of these 26 samples: six (three CNV/CNV and three wild-type piglets) were used for qRT-PCR  RNA sequencing  and miR-584-5p expression  western blot  and immunohistochemistry analyses; six (three CNV/CNV and three wild-type) piglets were used for Western blot and miR-584-5p expression analysis; four (two CNV/CNV and two wild-type) piglets were used for miR-584-5p expression and qRT-PCR analysis; six (CNV/wild-type piglets) were used for western blot analyses only; and the remaining four samples (two CNV/CNV and two wild-type piglets) were used for qRT-PCR analysis only. Furthermore  ear tissue samples from 59 Landrace piglets were used for eQTL mapping of miR-584-5p. Storage of ear tissue samples differed depending on their future use  i.e. for RNA-based expression analysis  samples were stored in RNAlater (Ambion  UK) at -<U+2009>80 °C until use  for Western blot analysis  samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen and then stored at - 80 °C until use  and for immunohistochemistry analysis  samples were embedded and frozen in OCT freezing medium (Tissue-Tek  Japan). Genomic DNA was extracted from ear tissue by the standard phenol/chloroform method. DNA quality was evaluated using a Nanodrop-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher  USA). The F  Sutai  Laiwu  Erhualian and DLY populations were genotyped for 62 163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the porcine SNP 60 K Beadchip (v1.0) (Illumina  USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality control of SNP genotype data was performed separately for each population by the check marker function of GenABEL []. SNPs with a call rate higher than 95%  a minor allele frequency lower than 1% and a  value for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) less than 10 as well as X-linked SNPs that were likely autosomal (odds<U+2009>><U+2009>1000) were removed from further analyses. Animals with a SNP call rate lower than 95% were also excluded. First  we performed a GWAS of ear size for each of the F  Sutai  DLY  Laiwu and Erhualian populations. Associations of SNPs with ear size were evaluated using a mixed linear model that included a random polygenic effect with the variance–covariance matrix proportional to genome-wide identity-by-state derived using SNP genotypes [] to account for population stratification. Sex and batch were included as fixed effects  and carcass weight was treated as a covariate. The single-marker GWAS was performed using the GenABEL package [  ]. Presence of residual population stratification was evaluated by examining the distribution of test statistics generated from thousands of association tests and assessing their deviation from the null distribution in a quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot []  which was created using the R software. A meta-analysis of the GWAS for the five populations was conducted by summing  for each SNP  the statistical Chi square () value of the SNP for each experimental population to calculate a new  value with four degrees of freedom. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple-testing by using a threshold <U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 divided by the number of SNPs used for GWAS analysis as a genome-wide significance level (see Additional file : Table S1). Linkage disequilibrium () between SNPs within the QTL region was estimated by PLINK (v1.07) []. To determine each confidence interval  a region was defined with all SNPs (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8) in strong LD with the peak SNP. Then  within that region  the confidence interval was defined by the 2-LOD drop-off method  i.e. all SNPs with a lod-score higher than the peak lod score minus 2 were retained []. The phenotypic variances explained by the top SNPs were calculated by (V - V)/V  where V and V are residual variances of the models for the association analyses with and without the effect of the top SNP genotype  respectively. Haplotypes were reconstructed with the dualPHASE software [] for all F  F and F animals in the F population using the SNPs on SSC5. Phenotypic differences between F animals that carried different haplotypes were compared by applying the -test in the lm function of R as described previously []. The QTL genotypes of the 19 F animals were inferred by integrating the analysis of the segregation of phenotypic values and haplotypes in the F pigs. To further identify the shared haplotype within the QTL region in large-eared pig breeds  haplotype sharing analysis was also performed between Erhualian and Min pigs using whole-genome resequencing data  as described in our previous study []. We reconstructed the haplotypes within a 0.99 Mb region  which covers the QTL intervals on SSC5 that were detected in the GWAS in four Erhualian and six Min pigs using 118 SNPs from this resequencing data. Wuzhishan (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3) and Tibetan (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3) pigs with small and erect ears were used as controls using the whole-genome resequencing dataset []. The genomes of the 19 F pigs of the F population were resequenced at<U+2009>~<U+2009>25 to 30X coverage on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform  as described previously []. Clean reads were aligned to the Sscrofa11.1 pig reference genome by using the Burrows-Wheeler alignment software []. Local realignment around potential insertions/deletions (InDel) and base quality recalibration were conducted with the GATK software []. Variants within the QTL interval on SSC5 were called using the HaplotypeCaller algorithm implemented in GATK []. Raw SNPs were filtered with the GATK Variant Filtration tool using the following criteria: QD<U+2009><<U+2009>2.0  FS<U+2009>><U+2009>60.0  MQ<U+2009><<U+2009>40.0  a haplotype score<U+2009>><U+2009>13.0  mapping quality rank sum<U+2009><<U+2009>-12.5 and ReadPosRankSum<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>8.0. Raw InDel were filtered by setting the following criteria QD<U+2009><<U+2009>2.0  FS<U+2009>><U+2009>200.0 and ReadPosRankSum<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>20.0. CNV were called using the depth of coverage method described by Nord et al. [].. Briefly  first  sequence coverage was normalized and corrected for capture bias associated with GC-content; then a sliding window was used to identify regions for which the majority of bases had a coverage ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.4 or<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6  which indicates a copy number gain or loss  respectively. A 20-bp window with a minimum of 18 bp meeting the criteria for either gain or loss was defined as a variant window. CNV regions were generated by extending variant windows and merging neighboring variant regions. CNV were examined for presence of partially mapped reads within the predicted breakpoint region. The breakpoints of the 38.7-kb CNV were determined by PCR and Sanger sequencing with the primers 5'-CGAGGGAGTAAGGCAGACAG-3' and 5'-GGCTCGGATCATCAGTATCG-3'. The PCR reaction contained 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>buffer  2 mM Mg  2 mM dNTP  200 nM of each primer  2.5U rTaq polymerase (Takara  Japan)  and 50 ng genomic DNA  and thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min  40 cycles (94 °C for 30 s  68–55 °C touchdown for 30 s  72 °C for 1 min) and a final step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gels and sequenced after purification with the PCR products purification kit (Qiagen  Germany). The number of 38.7-kb CNV was estimated using both the comparative C (2) relative quantification (qPCR) and the absolute quantification method (ddPCR for droplet digital PCR). In total  435 Sutai  314 Laiwu  343 DLY  and 144 Landrace pigs were genotyped for the causative CNV by qPCR. Briefly  one pair of primers and a probe (MSRB3-CNV1) (see Additional file : Table S2) were designed with the Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems  USA). The 20-µL-reaction system contained 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa  China)  1<U+2009>×<U+2009>ROX Reference Dye II (TaKaRa  China)  20 nM FAM-labeled MGB probe (Applied Biosystems  USA)  4 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers and 21.5 ng genomic DNA. The -- () gene was used as an internal control. Real-time PCR was performed in a 7500 fast real-time PCR system instrument (Applied Biosystems  USA). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. In order to validate the accuracy of genotyping  some samples were randomly drawn and genotyped by another pair of primers and probe using the same reaction system and parameters (MSRB3-CNV2) (see Additional file : Table S2). The number of CNV in 12 samples from six large-eared pig breeds was determined by ddPCR  as described previously [  ]. Briefly  genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme I (NEB  UK) that cuts the DNA outside of the amplicons. Primers and TaqMan probes used for ddPCR were the same as those used for the qPCR (MSRB3-CNV1) (see Additional file : Table S2). The  1 () gene was used as reference and was labeled with VIC at the 5' end. The ddPCR reaction mixture was prepared in a 22-µL volume containing 40 ng of digested DNA template  1<U+2009>×<U+2009>ddPCR master mix (Bio-Rad  USA)  1.1 µL of each target primer (0.9 µM) and probe (0.25 µM) mix  and 1.1 µL of each reference primer (0.9 µM) and probe (0.25 µM) mix. The disposable cartridge was loaded with the reaction mixture and droplet generation oil and then placed into a QX100 Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad  USA) to acquire droplets. The droplets were run on a Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad  USA) as follows: 95 °C for 10 min  40 cycles (94 °C for 30 s  60 °C for 1 min)  98 °C for 10 min and then kept at 12 °C. After amplification  we loaded the plate on the QX100 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad  USA) to read the droplets. The Droplet reader processed each sample independently and interrogated both FAM and VIC fluorescence under the guidance set in the Quanta soft software (V1.3.2.0). The software measured the numbers of positive and negative droplets per fluorophore per sample  which were converted into digital signals. The numbers of CNV copies in the tested samples were read directly from the software (Bio-Rad  USA). Association of the CNV with ear size was tested using a general linear mixed model []: where  is the phenotype of ear size   is the intercept of phenotype after correction for sex  batch and carcass weight   is the sex (j<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1) and  is the slaughter batch (i<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  3  4  …)  which were included as fixed effects   is the carcass weight that was treated as a covariate   represents the effect of the CNV on ear size  which was estimated by treating the relative quantity (RQ) values as quantitative covariates  and  is the residual. The analysis was conducted by using the GenABEL package in R software []. A similar model was used to test the interaction between the two causative mutations ( G32E and the  38.7-kb CNV) for ear size: where  indicates the effect of  G32E on SSC7 as a fixed factor   indicates the effect of the  38.7-kb CNV on SSC5 as a fixed factor  and <U+2009>×<U+2009> is the interaction effect between the two variants as a fixed factor. Ear tissue samples from 10 CNV/CNV and 10 wild-type Sutai piglets were used for qRT-PCR analysis (as described above). Total RNA was extracted using the Rneasy Fibrous Tissue mini kit (Qiagen  Germany). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA using the Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen  Germany). Expression profiles of the two transcript isoforms of  were determined using the SYBR Green method. qRT-PCR was performed in a 20-µL reaction volume containing 50 ng of template cDNA  1<U+2009>×<U+2009>Power SYBR Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems  USA) and 5 pM of each primer  with the following thermocycling conditions: 15 min at 95 °C and 48 cycles (95 °C for 15 s  60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min). Then  a dissociation curve analysis was performed. Expression levels of  and  were determined by the Taqman method. The 20-µL reaction volume included 50 ng of template cDNA  1<U+2009>×<U+2009>Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa  China)  1<U+2009>×<U+2009>ROX Reference Dye II (TaKaRa  China)  4 pM of each primer and 2 nM of probe  with the following thermocycling conditions:15 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min). - was used as an internal control. Gene-specific primers and probes were designed using the primer premier 5.0 software (see Additional file : Table S3). qRT-PCR was performed using the 7500 Fast real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems  USA). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. RNA sequencing was done on ear tissue from six Sutai piglets  including three CNV/CNV and three wild-type animals. DNA contamination was removed from total RNA by incubation with RNase-free DNase I (NEB  UK) at 37 °C for 30 min. The quality of total RNA was assessed by a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent  USA) and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA sequencing was performed as described previously []. Briefly  mRNA was isolated from total RNA with oligo (dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen  USA) and then fragmented using the RNA fragmentation kit (Ambion  USA). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen  USA)  while the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using RNase H (Invitrogen  USA) and DNA polymerase I (NEB  UK). The cDNA libraries were loaded onto flow cell channels of a HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina  USA) for paired-end 90 bp<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 sequencing. The average insert size for the paired-end libraries was 200 bp. A paired-end cDNA library was constructed for each of the six samples. The raw sequence dataset was processed to produce clean sequence data  which were then aligned to the porcine reference genome sequence (Sscrofa 11.1) using TopHat []. The gene expression value was determined and normalized using fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) []. The Cuffdiff program in Cufflinks [] was used to identify differential expression genes (DEG) based on |log (FC)|<U+2009>><U+2009>1  where FC is fold change  and q-value (an adjusted  value)<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01. Potential alternative splicing transcripts of the  gene were estimated in all six sequenced samples using the Cuffdiff program. We refined the gene structure by assembling transcripts with clean reads with the Cufflinks software []. The assembled transcripts were compared to gene annotations from the reference genome to detect the extensions at the 5' and 3' ends of the corresponding gene annotation. In this study  we focused on the 3' gene boundary of . Total protein was extracted from ear tissue samples of 18 Sutai piglets (described above) and porcine fetal fibroblast (PFF) cells by using the total protein extraction kit (Applygen  China) and quantified with the BCA Protein Quantification kit (Vazyme  China). Then  the extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer  the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-MSRB3 primary antibody (orb373913  Biorbyt  UK) at a 1:400 dilution and mouse anti-ß-actin primary antibody (A1978  as endogenous control) (Sigma  USA) at a 1:1000 dilution. After incubation with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase antibody (A0545) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG peroxidase antibody (A9044) for MSRB3 and ß-actin  respectively) that were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma  USA)  the nitrocellulose membranes were visualized by using a BeyoECL plus kit (Beyotime Biotechnology  China). The images were acquired with the GeneSnap software (SynGene  UK) and quantified by the ImageJ software []. Ear tissue samples from six Sutai piglets were used for immunohistochemistry analysis (described above). All ear tissue samples that had been embedded and frozen in OCT freezing medium (Tissue-Tek  Japan) were cut in sections of 4 µm with a cryostat. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature  and then permeated in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The sections were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100  and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing the primary antibodies (orb373913  Biorbyt  UK) at a 1:100 dilution. The secondary antibody  goat anti-Rabbit IgG (whole molecule) (F9887  Sigma  USA) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate at a dilution  was used to incubate the slides at room temperature for 45 min. Immunohistochemistry images were captured using a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope equipped with NIS-Elements D software (Nikon  Japan). The mature miRNA-584-5p sequence was predicted by using the miRBase database (release 20) []. Expression profiles of miR-584-5p in ear tissue from eight CNV/CNV and eight wild-type Sutai piglets  along with 59 Landrace piglets were analyzed. Extraction and quality control of total RNA were performed as described above. A stem-loop RT-PCR method [] was used to design the primers and probes to quantify the expression level of miR-584-5p using the 2 method (see Additional file : Table S4). The  gene was chosen as endogenous control. The qRT-PCR reaction and conditions were the same as those described above. eQTL mapping was performed for miR-584-5p in ear tissue samples from 59 Landrace two-day old piglets. Thirty-five SNPs within the QTL interval on SSC5 were genotyped by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. CNV genotypes were determined by qPCR on an ABI7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems  USA)  as described above. The expression values of miR-584-5p were adjusted for the effects of sex  batch  and kinship using a robust linear regression model []. eQTL mapping was performed using a mixed linear model implemented by the  function of GenABEL in R package. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple-testing. The DIANA-microT web server (v5.0) was used to predict the target genes of miR-584-5p based on the rule that the miRNA regulate gene expression mainly by base pairing with miRNA-recognition elements (MRE) in the target mRNA 3'UTR or coding sequences (CDS) []. The miTG (miRNA targeted genes) score was calculated by microT-CDS using the weighted sum of the scores of all conserved and non-conserved MRE in the 3'UTR and CDS of the target mRNA. The higher the score  the higher the probability of targeting MRE that are within the 3'UTR or in the CDS of the mRNA. The 3'UTR of  was synthesized and cloned into the vector downstream of the firefly luciferase ORF by cloneEZ (Genscript  China). We obtained a pGL3 luciferase reporter with the mutant 3'UTR of  that has a 7-bp deletion in the target site. Porcine fetal fibroblast (PFF) cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of the wild-type or mutant 3'UTR luciferase reporter and 100 nM of the miR-584-5p mimics or the negative control duplexes using lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen  USA) in 24-well plates. Each treatment was replicated three times. After transfection for 48 h  cells were harvested by adding 200 µL of passive lysis buffer. Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were assayed on an Infinite 200 PRO multimode reader (Tecan  Switzerland) using the luciferase assay system from Promega. The relative luciferase activity was normalized to the Relina luciferase activity in each sample. We compared the normalized firefly luciferase activity between the wild-type and mutant reporters using the Student’s t test (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). This assay was repeated in triplicate. PFF cells (2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 cells seeded in 6-well plates) were cultured in DMEM (with high glucose and pyruvate) (Gibco  USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum  50 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco  USA) and incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO at 37 °C. When the cells were 70% confluent  the mirVana miRNA Mimic negative control (Ambion  USA) and the miR-584-5p mimic (Ambion  USA  5'-UUAUGGUUUGCCUGGGACUGAG-3') were transfected into the PFF cells with 6 µL of 100 nM lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen  USA). After 7 h  the transfection mix was replaced by complete medium. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Total proteins were extracted from the cultured cells and used for western blot analysis using the protocol described above. To narrow down the interval on SSC5 that harbors the QTL for ear size  we performed GWAS in five populations  totaling 2301 pigs. For all these pigs  detailed records on ear size and genotypes for<U+2009>~<U+2009>62 000 SNPs from the Illumina porcine 60 K SNP chip were available. The final set of informative SNPs for GWAS in each population is in Additional file : Table S1. First  we conducted a GWAS in each of the five pig populations using a linear regression model assuming an additive effect (see “”). The inflation factor (<U+03BB>) values for genomic control [] ranged from 0.96 to 1.08  which indicates that there was no population stratification in our data (see Additional file : Figure S2). We identified genome-wide significant association signals on SSC4  5  7 and X (Fig. ). In the F and Erhualian populations  the top SNPs were located around the  gene on SSC7 (30.14 Mb  LOD<U+2009>><U+2009>15.58). The second most significant signal was observed at 29.94 Mb on SSC5 in the F population (ALGA0031524  LOD<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.50) (Fig. ). No association signal was observed on SSC5 in the Erhualian population. For the Sutai and the DLY populations  we detected a genome-wide significant QTL only on SSC5 and the most significant SNPs were detected on SSC5 at 29.94 Mb (ALGA0031524  LOD<U+2009>=<U+2009>14.05) and 29.69 Mb (ASGA0025245  LOD<U+2009>=<U+2009>19.72)  respectively. In Laiwu pigs  the strongest signal was also observed on SSC5  between 29.55 and 30.07 Mb  a region that harbored four genome-wide significant SNPs: ASGA0025241  ASGA0025245  H3GA0016181 and ALGA0031527 (LOD<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.49)  while other genome-wide significant SNPs were identified on SSC4  7 and X (LOD<U+2009>><U+2009>6.00). The top SNPs on SSC5 explained 11.5  27.4  12.4 and 27.9% of the phenotypic variance for ear size in the F  Sutai  Laiwu and DLY populations  respectively. Then  we performed a meta-analysis of the GWAS across the five pig populations  which identified the most significant SNP on SSC5 at 29.69 Mb (ASGA0025245  LOD<U+2009>=<U+2009>50.90  Fig. ). Manhattan plots of genome-wide association studies to map a major QTL for porcine ear size. GWAS were performed in the White Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Erhualian F resource population ()  Sutai ()  Laiwu ()  Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Landrace<U+2009>×<U+2009>Yorkshire ()  and Erhualian pig populations (). A meta-analysis of the GWAS was also performed across these five populations (). In the Manhattan plots  -log  ( values) of the SNPs are plotted against their positions on the porcine chromosomes  with chromosomes shown in different colors for clarity. The solid line indicates the 5% genome-wide significance threshold and the dashed line shows the suggestive-significance threshold (5% chromosome-wide significance) To determine the empirical confidence interval of this QTL  we identified SNPs that were in the regions around the top SNPs on SSC5 that had linkage disequilibrium () values with the top SNP higher than 0.8. To correct for potential effects at other loci  we re-conducted GWAS in the F and Laiwu populations by including the  causative mutation (G32E) on SSC7 and the top SNPs on SSC4 and X as fixed effects in the linear regression model. By applying the 2-LOD drop-off and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8 criteria (see “”)  we estimated the empirical confidence intervals for the QTL on SSC5 in the F  Sutai  Laiwu and DLY populations at 509.28 kb (29.74–30.25 Mb)  894.37 kb (29.36–30.25 Mb)  921.14 kb (29.33–30.25 Mb) and 696.68 kb (29.55–30.25 Mb)  respectively (Fig. ). The smallest confidence interval (509.28 kb) in the F population could be due to recombination within the interval that led to the segregation of the QTL on SSC5 in the founder dams (see below). Thus  this is the most likely QTL interval. Regional Manhattan plots for association analyses around the QTL for ear size on chromosome 5 in four pig populations. The top SNPs are highlighted by red dots. Different levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD based on ) of the top SNPs with surrounding SNPs are indicated by different colors. The QTL intervals indicated by dashed lines were defined by the 2 drop-off of LOD value and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8. Their overlapping region spans 509.28 kb between 29.74 and 30.25 Mb on chromosome 5 We reconstructed the haplotypes of two founder sires and 17 founder dams in the F population by using SNPs on SSC5. Fourteen of the Erhualian founder dams shared a hapotype of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.99 Mb around the most significant SNPs (Q  Fig. a). As predicted  this shared haplotype was associated with increased ear size and presumably with the chromosomes carrying the QTL allele increasing ear size (Q-bearing chromosomes). Three Erhualian founder sows (E0124  E0142 and E0146  Fig. a) carried a distinct haplotype that was denoted as q. This haplotype appeared to have originated from Q with a recombination breakpoint occurring between SNPs ASGA0025245 (29.69 Mb) and ASGA0025246 (29.74 Mb) (see Fig. a). Two White Duroc founder sires carried another distinct haplotype q. Both q and q haplotypes were associated with decreased ear size  which is different from the effect of the Erhualian Q-bearing chromosome (Q). The least-square mean (±<U+2009>s.e.) of ear area for individuals carrying the Q haplotype was 161.26<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.77 cm  which is significantly larger than least square means for q (133.16<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.48 cm  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and q (130.28<U+2009>±<U+2009>8.29 cm  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001  Fig. b). This shared haplotype Q allowed us to refine the major QTL on SSC5 to a 0.99 Mb interval between SNPs H3GA0016173 (29.29 Mb) and ASGA0025256 (30.28 Mb). Haplotype-sharing analysis refines the critical QTL region to a 137.85 kb interval.  Haplotype-sharing analysis in the 19 F founder animals of the White Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Erhualian F resource population. The SNPs and their positions are displayed at the top of the figure. For SNPs  alleles with the highest frequencies are denoted 1  while those with the lowest frequencies are denoted 2. The shared haplotypes are indicated by shaded boxes. Identities of these F animals are given on the left axis. D and E represent Duroc and Erhualian  respectively. The QTL genotype for each chromosome is shown on the right axis. The red colored box represents the shared Q-haplotype block in Erhualian sows  Individuals E0124  E0142 and E0146 carried a distinct haplotype that is marked in yellow.  Effects of haplotypes q  Q and q on ear size in the White Duroc<U+2009>×<U+2009>Erhualian intercross (least square mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>s.e.  cm). The haplotype Q significantly increased ear size.  Haplotype-sharing analysis in pigs with different ear sizes. The upper panel shows haplotypes of small-eared Tibetan and Wuzhishan pigs that were selected as controls. The lower panel depicts haplotypes of Min and Erhualian pigs with large and floppy ears. The sample ID is shown in the left column and the SNP ID is shown in the top row. The Min and Erhualian pigs shared two haplotypes of 133.31 and 295.03 kb  which are not found in small-eared pigs.  The most likely critical interval of this QTL was defined as the 137.85-kb region indicated by a red box. Exons 3–7 of  are located in this region. The gray arrows indicate the direction of the transcripts and the green vertical bars show the exons of the transcripts Chinese Min pigs  such as Erhualian  also have unusually large and floppy ears  and we identified the same QTL for ear size on SSC5 in a Large White<U+2009>×<U+2009>Min F resource population []. This led us to assume that Min pigs carry the same causative mutation that affects ear size. Thus  we expected the presence of shared haplotypes around the causative mutation between Min and Erhualian pigs. To test this  we performed a haplotype-sharing analysis on 10 large-eared pigs (four Erhualian and six Min pigs) and six small-eared pigs (three Wuzhishan and three Tibetian pigs). We reconstructed the haplotypes of these pigs using the 118 SNPs in the 0.99-Mb QTL interval that contains the 509.28-kb critical region of the SSC5 QTL. As predicted  all large-eared pigs shared two chromosomal segments of 295.03 kb (29.58–29.88 Mb) and 133.31 kb (29.45–29.58 Mb) (Fig. c). One of the two segments  i.e. the 295.03-kb (29.58–29.88 Mb) segment overlapped with the 509.28-kb critical region (29.74–30.25 Mb). Thus  the 137.85-kb overlapping region (29.74–29.88 Mb) was the most likely confidence interval for the QTL on SSC5 on which we focused all further analyses. Exons 2–7 of the  gene are located within this 137.85-kb interval (Fig. d). First  we performed a comparative genomic sequence analysis (see “”) of the 137.85-kb QTL interval and found that the reference genome (Sscrofa 11.1) was misassembled for this region (see Additional file : Figure S3). We constructed a corrected contig that was submitted to GenBank in NCBI with accession number MK028166. Then  we isolated the full-length mRNA sequence of  and identified two transcript isoforms that encode 188 and 183 amino acids  respectively (accession numbers: KX557289 and KX557290). Comparison of these two transcripts showed that the  exon 2 was absent in isoform 1 due to alternative splicing (see Additional file : Figure S4). To identify the causative mutation in the QTL  we screened all candidate mutations within the 137.85 kb confidence interval using whole-genome sequencing data from the 19 F animals of the F population  for which QTL genotypes were inferred  including two  (D73  D75)  three  (E124  E142 and E146) and 14  animals. The sequencing data completely covered the 137.85-kb interval and allowed us to identify 64 polymorphisms (SNPs and InDels) and one 38.7-kb CNV as candidate mutations. The 64 polymorphisms showed concordance with the genotypes at the QTL of the 19 F founder animals. However  none of these candidate mutations was within the exons of . Next  we used PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing to determine the breakpoints of the 38.7-kb CNV that starts at 349 577 bp and ends at 388 246 bp of the corrected contig (MK028166) (Fig. a)  covering the last two exons 6 and 7 of the  gene. We found a 33-bp sequence repeat at the 3'-end of the CNV (Fig. b). Among the 64 SNPs and InDel variants  51 were located within the CNV. All 51 mutations were called as homozygous in the CNV/CNV pigs  which indicates that they were identical in each CNV copy. The causative CNV and its distribution in pig breeds with different ear sizes.  Structure of the CNV.

The -axis shows the RQ values obtained by qPCR  the -axis indicates each individual’s ID and its QTL genotypes.  CNV distribution in pig breeds with different ear sizes. All pigs with large and floppy ears had the CNV  while none of the small-eared pigs had it In theory  the causative allele (most likely derived) for the increased ear size should not be detected or occur at a very low frequency in breeds with small and erect ears. We analyzed the allele frequencies of these 64 polymorphisms in 30 individuals from two small and erect-eared breeds (Wuzhishan and Tibetan) and in 20 individuals from two large and floppy-eared breeds (Min and Erhualian) using the dataset described in our previous publication []. For all small-eared pigs  the alleles that presumably increases ear size occurred at high frequencies for all 64 polymorphisms (see Additional file : Table S5). In contrast  the 38.7-kb CNV was absent from all small-eared pigs and present at high frequencies in large-eared pigs. This provided important supporting evidence that the 38.7-kb CNV is the most likely causative mutation for the QTL on SSC5. Next  we determined the copy number of this CNV in the 19 F founder animals of the F population (see “”) and found that the genotypes of the founder animals at this CNV were completely concordant with their genotypes at the QTL  i.e. two copies in two White Duroc sires (qq)  three copies in three Erhualian founder sows (Qq)  and four copies in 14 Erhualian sows (QQ) (Fig. c). We also determined the copy number of this CNV in 12 ear tissue samples from seven large and floppy-eared pig breeds by both qPCR and ddPCR. Copy numbers in CNV/CNV homozygous Erhualian  Jiaxing Black  Laiwu  Meishan  Mi and Min pigs were equal to 4  4  6  4  4 and 6  respectively (see Additional file : Table S6). To investigate the distribution of this CNV in diverse pig breeds  it was genotyped in another 162 pigs from 13 breeds with distinct ear sizes. All animals from the three Chinese breeds with small and erect ears had only two copies (wild-type) at the CNV site. In contrast  nearly all animals from the six Chinese indigenous pig breeds with large and floppy ears had four copies of the CNV (Table   Fig. d). Among the four Western breeds  Large White  Duroc  and White Duroc had two copies of the wild-type allele  and three out of the 11 Landrace pigs carried more than two copies of this CNV (one carrying three copies and two carrying four copies; see Table ). This result is in agreement with the fact that Landrace pigs have partly flopped down ears and the other three breeds have small and erect ears. Whether the causative CNV has been introgressed from Chinese large-eared pigs into Landrace pigs is not known at present and requires an evolutionary history analysis of the haplotypes around the CNV in different Chinese and Western pig breeds. We also analyzed the copy number of this CNV in 11 Chinese wild boars and found that none of these animals carried it (Table )  which was consistent with the findings in [] that showed that floppy ears are a derived phenotype that appeared after domestication. To obtain additional supporting evidence  we performed association studies between this CNV and ear size in four pig populations  i.e. Sutai  Laiwu  DLY and Landrace. As expected  the CNV was significantly associated with ear size across the Sutai (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  Laiwu (<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.72<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  DLY (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.0<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and Landrace pigs (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.37<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) (Table ). Compared to the top SNPs identified in the GWAS  this CNV explained more phenotypic variance for ear size in Sutai (29.4 vs. 27.4%)  Laiwu (13.8 vs. 12.4%) and DLY pigs (33.4 vs. 27.9%). To further evaluate the causality of this CNV  we conducted conditional GWAS in the Sutai  Laiwu and DLY populations by including the genotypes of the CNV as a fixed effect in the GWAS statistical model. This resulted in the disappearance of the previously detected significant association signals on SSC5 across these populations (see Additional file : Figure S5). This finding strengthened our hypothesis that the CNV is the causative mutation underlying the QTL for ear size on SSC5. To test whether the two major QTL on SSC5 and 7 epistatically or additively affected ear size  we analyzed the interaction between the causative mutations ( G32E and the 38.7-kb CNV) at the two QTL in the F population but found no significant epistatistic effect between the two mutations (Fig. )  which suggests these two QTL have additive effects on ear size in the pig. Indeed  the two QTL collectively explained 48.2% of the phenotypic variance of ear size in the F pigs (133.5 cm). Two major QTL on SSC5 and 7 collectively affect ear size in pigs. The different color dots represent the genotypes of  G32E (C<U+2009>><U+2009>T)  which is the causative mutation for the QTL on SSC7. The -axis indicates ear size values (cm) and the -axis shows the number of copies of the causative CNV for the SSC5 QTL Because only the  gene is located within the 137.85-kb confidence interval  we quantified the mRNA levels of  and its flanking genes  and  by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Because the pinna has reached the morphology of an adult at birth [] and the shape of the external ears (erectness or floppy) can be identified clearly  ear tissue samples from 10 CNV/CNV (large-eared) and 10 wild-type (small-eared) 2-day-old piglets were used for this analysis. Neither of the two  transcripts and neither of the  and  genes showed differential expression between the two groups (see Additional file : Figure S6). Next  we conducted a comparative RNA sequencing analysis using total RNA extracted from ear tissue of three CNV/CNV and three wild-type 2-day-old piglets (accession number: GSE80613). The structure of the three genes was investigated by aligning the reads to the reference genome and transcript assembly. We did not identify any transcript isoform for  that was uniquely associated with the large ear phenotype  which is most probably due to the duplicated region being located at the 3'UTR of . Moreover  we did not find significant differences in the mRNA levels of    and  between the CNV/CNV and wild-type samples and we did not detect any alternative splicing events for  mRNA associated with ear size (see Additional file : Figure S7). Then  we investigated the spatial distribution of MSRB3 in the external ears of both CNV/CNV and wild-type two-day-old piglets by immunohistochemistry. MSRB3 was expressed in both the skin and cartilage of the ear  with a higher expression level in the external ear tissues from wild-type piglets (Fig. a). Western blot analysis revealed a higher level of MSRB3 in wild-type compared to CNV/CNV piglets (Fig. b  c) (see Additional file : Figure S8)  which was consistent with the results of the immunohistochemistry analysis. Expression of the MSRB3 protein in ear tissue samples representing different genotypes at the causative CNV.  MSRB3 immuno- and DAPI nuclear staining on ear tissue from wild-type (small-eared) and CNV/CNV (large-eared) piglets. The image was captured at FITC: 1 s  20 X. A significant difference in MSRB3 abundance was found in both the skin and cartilage between CNV/CNV and wild-type pigs.  Western blot analysis showing MSRB3 protein levels in 18 (six CNV/CNV  six CNV/- and six -/-) pigs. The expression level of ß-actin was used as loading control.  MSRB3 protein level in the 18 animals was quantified by the GeneTools software. The histogram illustrates the abundance of MSRB3 after normalization to ß-actin abundance. **   < 0.01 To establish a relationship between the presence of the CNV and the level of MSRB3  we investigated the genomic region around the 137.85-kb QTL interval and found a novel miRNA (ENSSSCG00000024846  SSC5: 29 938 800–29 938 890 bp)  miR-584-5p  which is located on the reverse strand of the reference genome sequence and at 75.21 kb of the 3' end of . The CNV is located in the 3' region of miR-584-5p (Fig. d). One target site of this miRNA was predicted to be located within the 3'UTR of   979–1000 bp downstream of the stop codon of this gene (Fig. a). By comparing the expression levels of miR-584-5p in ear tissue samples between CNV/CNV and wild-type piglets by qRT-PCR  we found that it was significantly higher in CNV/CNV compared to wild-type animals (<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.82<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  Fig. b). eQTL mapping of miR-584-5p in the ear tissue of 59 Landrace piglets showed segregation at the CNV site and confirmed that the CNV had an effect on the expression of miR-584-5p (see Additional file : Table S7). We genotyped another 35 SNPs within the 200-kb interval covering the 137.85-kb critical QTL region and the region from the end of the QTL interval to the end of miR-584-5p (29.74–29.94 Mb). These SNPs were considered as candidate SNPs because of their concordance with QTL genotypes in the 19 F animals of the F population in the above 59 piglets. SNPs within the CNV were excluded as candidates (described above) and were not genotyped. Interestingly  the CNV showed the strongest association with the expression level of miR-584-5p (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.74<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) (Fig. c). miR-584-5p regulates the expression of  in pigs.  A target site of miR-584-5p was identified in the 979–1000 bp region downstream of the stop codon of the  gene via DIANA-microT web server (v5.0).  Comparison of the expression levels of miR-584-5p between CNV/CNV and wild-type animals.  eQTL mapping for miR-584-5p in ear tissue samples. The CNV shows the strongest association with miR-584-5p expression.  Construction of the mutant 3'UTR reporter. The 7-bp seed region (in bold) was deleted in the mutant 3'UTR reporter.  Porcine fetal fibroblast cells were transfected with the 3'UTR mutant or wild-type luciferase reporters and co-transfected with miR-584-5p mimics or the negative control duplexes. The relative luciferase activity was measured 48 h later. The figure shows the mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>S.D. from three independent experiments performed in duplicate (**  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.01). The  mRNA expression levels () and protein levels () in porcine fetal fibroblast cells transfected with miR-584-5p mimics or negative control duplexes Given that the MSRB3 protein level was lower in CNV/CNV compared to wild-type piglets  we hypothesized that miR-584-5p suppresses the expression of MSRB3. To test this hypothesis  we constructed luciferase reporters that included either the wild-type or the mutant 3'UTR of  (Fig. d) and co-transfected them with a miR-584-5p mimic or a negative control into porcine fetal fibroblast cells. We found that miR-584-5p significantly reduced the luciferase activity of the wild-type  reporter compared with the negative control (<<U+2009>0.01). In contrast  we did not observe reduced activity with the mutant luciferase reporter (Fig. e)  which confirmed that miR-584-5p targets the 3'UTR of  directly. We examined the repression of miR-584-5p in the endogenous MSRB3 protein by transfecting miR-584-5p mimics into porcine fetal fibroblast cells. The results of qRT-PCR indicated that the amount of  mRNA was not decreased by miR-584-5p compared to the control (Fig. f). Western blot analysis revealed that miR-584-5p significantly decreased the MSRB3 protein level (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) (Fig. g) (see Additional file : Figure S8). Because miR-584-5p can affect the expression of multiple genes  other than   and because other target genes may be involved in porcine ear size  we predicted the target genes of miR-584-5p in silico with the DIANA-microT web server (v5.0) []. At a significance threshold for the miTG score<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8  we identified 388 predicted target genes (see Additional file : Table S8). To identify other possible target genes associated with porcine ear size  we examined the literature for phenotypic consequences in knockout mice for each of these 388 predicted target genes []. As a result  we identified five genes associated with ear morphology  including  which is related with abnormal ear shape []   with abnormal outer ear morphology []   [] and  [] with abnormal middle ear morphology  and  with abnormal inner ear morphology []. It is well known that miRNA can regulate gene expression by inhibiting target mRNA translation at some stage or by promoting mRNA degradation []. To examine whether some of the target genes identified for miR-584-5p were differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the ear tissue between CNV/CNV and wild-type piglets  we isolated a list of 280 DEG with a<U+2009>><U+2009>2-fold change at an FDR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001 using RNA sequencing data. These DEG included 82 up-regulated genes and 198 down-regulated genes in the large-eared (CNV/CNV) pigs (see Additional file : Table S9). We also examined the literature for phenotypic consequences in knockout mice for these 280 DEG and found abnormal ear morphology in knockout mice for the        and  genes [  ]. However  none of these five DEG were target genes of miR-584-5p  and none of the five miR-584-5p target genes described above were DEG. The DEG identified in this study should be located within a transcriptional network involving the miR-584-5p target genes  e.g. . In this study  we have narrowed down the interval containing the QTL affecting ear size on SSC5 to 137.85 kb and identified a 38.7-kb CNV as the causative mutation underlying the QTL. We also suggest that this CNV influences porcine ear size by increasing expression of miR-584-5p  which suppresses the expression of its target genes  e.g. . Considering the universality of this QTL for ear type in pig  sheep and dogs  our findings provide important clues for identifying the causative gene or mutations for ear type in mammals  as well as insights about the development of human external ears as a biomedical model. Previous studies proposed    and  as positional candidate genes for the QTL on SSC5 [    ]. Here  fine-mapping analysis allowed us to exclude these three genes as the responsible gene. The use of multiple pig populations allowed us to fine-map the QTL to a small critical interval. In particular  haplotype-sharing analysis in Chinese indigenous pigs with unusually large and floppy ears refined the QTL to a 137.85 kb region. It was previously reported that Chinese indigenous pig breeds show a low level of linkage disequilibrium [  ]  which facilitates QTL fine-mapping and identification of causative genes for porcine complex traits. In this paper  we provide several solid lines of evidence that support the CNV on SSC5 as a causative mutation: (1) association of this CNV with ear size was strongest in Sutai  Laiwu  DLY and Landrace pigs  which are expected to have a very low level of linkage disequilibrium; (2) the CNV genotypes were completely concordant with the inferred QTL genotypes of all F individuals in the F population; and (3) this CNV occurred at very high frequencies in Chinese indigenous pig breeds that have large and floppy ears  but was absent in breeds with small and erect-ears. No other mutations within the 137.85-kb region of the QTL on SSC5 showed such concordance patterns in the tested breeds. CNV are increasingly shown to have causative effects on phenotypes in livestock [    ]. Here  we provide another example that a CNV has a major QTL effect on porcine ear size. CNV can account for variation in gene expression in a variety of ways  including through a gene dosage effect  disruption of gene coding regions  and deletion or duplication of regulatory elements []. In this study  the CNV is located in the 3' region of miR-584-5p and was shown to be associated with the expression of miR-584-5p expression by eQTL mapping. We propose two possibilities to explain the mechanism underlying the effect of this CNV on ear size: (1) the presence of this CNV could duplicate the regulatory elements (e.g. enhancer) that affect the expression of miR-584-5p but analysis of the CNV sequence did not identify any potential regulatory elements; and (2) because this CNV is quite large  it could modify the chromatin structure in this region and thereby cause a change in the expression pattern of miR-584-5p. To investigate how the increased expression of miR-584-5p can lead to enlarged ear size in pigs  we predicted the target genes of miR-584-5p in silico. In addition to   five of the 388 predicted target genes were associated with abnormal ear morphology in knockout mice.  is within the 137.85-kb QTL interval and functional null mutations of  have been associated with deafness in both humans [] and mouse []. Moreover  knockout of  in mouse inhibits cell growth through the activation of the p53-p21 and p27 pathways []. As a proof of principle  we performed experiments in vivo and in vitro to establish that miR-584-5p suppresses the translation of   which subsequently results in enlarged porcine ear size (both immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses showed that expression of  is associated with ear size). We did not observe a significant difference in  mRNA level between CNV/CNV and wild-type animals. A similar mechanism was also observed in Texel sheep  where a G to A transition in the 3'UTR of the  gene creates an illegitimate microRNA target that causes translational inhibition of the gene  which contributes to muscular hypertrophy []. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how the presence of CNV can regulate gene expression. The effects of other target genes of miR-584-5p on porcine ear size requires further investigation. RNA sequencing analysis identified several DEG related to ear morphology in knockout mice but none of these was a target gene of miR-584-5p. These DEG may be located within a transcriptional network involving the miR-584-5p target genes (e.g. ). We show that the 38.7-kb CNV in the 3' region of the  gene is the suggestive causative mutation for a QTL for ear size on SSC5. The presence of this CNV results in an increase in the expression of miR-584-5p  which inhibits the expression of its target gene   which affects porcine ear size. As a proof of principle  we confirmed that miR-584-5p hinders the translation of  and we found that the MSRB3 protein level differed between pigs with large and small ears. These findings not only shed insight into the underlying mechanisms for development of external ears in mammals but also improve our understanding of the regulation mechanism involving CNV  miRNA  and functional genes.

Genomic models that include non-additive effects must also consider inbreeding depression in order to avoid upward bias of estimates of dominance variance. Inclusion of epistasis did not improve the accuracy of prediction of breeding values. Genomics provides tools to understand the effects of genes and their interactions and new approaches for genetic improvement []. In quantitative genetics  partitioning genetic variance for a trait into statistical components due to additivity  dominance  and epistasis is useful for prediction and selection  even if it does not reflect the biological (or functional) effect of the underlying genes []. Additive  dominance and epistatic genetic variances of quantitative traits are required to estimate breeding values and for making optimal selection decisions. Within-breed non-additive effects  and in particular epistasis  are often ignored in genetic improvement programs. However  the total genetic value of an animal is a function of both additive and non-additive effects and  taken together  these effects could result in better predictors of future phenotypes [] and inform mate allocation. Indeed  assortative mating can improve the performance of livestock when dominance [] and/or epistasis are/is present []. Evidence of non-additive variance in commercially important traits (e.g. for body depth in fish  []) has opened opportunities for specialized breeding schemes. To take the effects of dominance and/or epistasis into account  it is necessary to refine the estimation of non-additive variance components from phenotypic data. The additive genetic effect is the part of an individual’s total genetic effect that is transmissible across generations from parents to offspring. In contrast  non-additive genetic effects (dominance and epistasis) can be seen as the residual genetic effect after fitting additive substitution effects. Although most of the genetic variance is additive [  ] and captures most of the functional epistatic action of genes  the epistatic variance should not be neglected. Knowing its magnitude in real data and exploring the predictive ability of a model that accounts for epistatic effects are of great relevance. It is also of interest to know how much gene-by-gene (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>G) interaction exists (e.g. to determine the effect of the same allele in different breeds) or to account for the contribution of epistasis to the creation of “new” additive variance over time []. Several authors have proposed the inclusion of dominance and epistatic effects in genetic evaluation using high-density marker genotypes (genomic evaluation) [     ]. Most epistatic models consider only additive-by-additive epistatic interactions (e.g. [  ])  although dominance-by-dominance and dominance-by-additive interactions may play a major role in heterosis and in inbreeding and outbreeding depression (see [] p. 223). Recently  Vitezica et al. [] proposed a flexible and general approach to construct “genomic” relationship matrices for populations that are or are not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)  e.g. F1 crosses. They proved that epistatic genomic relationship matrices for two or higher order interactions can be constructed using Hadamard products of additive and dominance genomic orthogonal relationships  regardless of the existence of HWE. They also pointed out that  nevertheless  standardization of genomic relationship matrices based on the trace of the relationship matrices is needed. However to date  models that use these relationship matrices have not been applied to real data. Xiang et al. [] proved analytically that  in the presence of directional dominance  inclusion of genomic inbreeding as a covariate is necessary to obtain correct estimates of dominance variance. Genomic inbreeding of an individual was shown to be correctly defined as the proportion of genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at which the individual is homozygous []. This was confirmed in real data by Xiang et al. [] and Aliloo et al. []. The effect of fitting or not fitting genomic inbreeding on estimates of epistatic variance components is unknown. In current pig production systems  the number of pigs weaned is a key factor to increase productivity  and litter size (e.g.  total number of piglets born per litter) is one of the most important traits under selection  in maternal line breeding programs []. Although litter size in pigs has a low narrow-sense heritability [  ]  non-additive variance could still be abundant and should be ascertained. This is particularly important because the estimation of non-additive effects (dominance and epistasis) for litter size is of increasing interest since it can be used to define mate allocation strategies between selection candidates for developing new crossbreeding or even purebred breeding schemes. The objectives of this work were to estimate additive and non-additive (dominance and epistasis) variance components for litter size for a real pig population  by considering or not inbreeding depression and to determine whether the accuracy of prediction of breeding values and total genetic values increases with the inclusion of dominance and epistatic effects. Data for this study were provided by Genus plc (Hendersonville  TN  USA). Animal Care and Use Committee approval was not necessary for this study because the data were obtained from an existing database. Data on litter size (total number of piglets born per litter) were from a pig pure line. The average litter size was equal to 12.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>3.1 and 13 369 records were available for 3619 sows. Genotypes for all sows were generated using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA). After quality control using default parameters by preGSf90 [] (HWE  minor allele frequency  SNP call rate and animal call rate)  38 779 autosomal SNPs remained and were used to build genomic relationship matrices. Phenotypes were analyzed using a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) (mixed) model. Parity number and the combined effect farm-year-month of farrowing were included as fixed effects. The model also included a random permanent environmental effect for each sow. The linear model including additive  dominant and interaction terms can be written as: where  is the vector of phenotypic records   is the fixed effect vector   models the inbreeding depression  where  is the vector of genomic inbreeding coefficients based on the proportion of homozygous SNPs and  is the inbreeding depression parameter per unit of inbreeding   is a vector of breeding values of the sows   is a vector of dominance deviations   is a vector of epistatic genetic values   is the permanent environmental effect vector    is a residual vector   and  and  are design matrices relating records to fixed effects and genetic and permanent environmental effects  respectively. The epistatic genetic effects can be partitioned into additive-by-additive   additive-by-dominance   and dominance-by-dominance  effects. Higher order epistasis interactions were not considered as they were deemed to be negligible [] or too difficult to estimate. Covariance matrices of genetic effects were as follows: where the covariance matrices  and  for additive and dominance effects  which are involved in the construction of covariance matrices    and  for epistatic effects  were constructed assuming HWE. The additive relationship matrix was calculated as in VanRaden []:   where matrix  has elements that are equal to  for genotypes    and   respectively  where  is the frequency of allele  at SNP . The dominance relationship matrix was computed as  where  has elements equal to  for genotypes    and   respectively []. Covariance matrices for epistatic effects were computed using the Hadamard products and traces as     and  []. In these analyses  we implicitly assume that allele substitution effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) are distributed as   dominance effects as   additive-by-additive epistatic effects as   and similarly for additive-by-dominant  and dominant-by-dominant  effects. Note that under the assumption of HWE  the GBLUP “breeding” model in Vitezica et al. [] that accounts for additive and dominance effects is a particular case of the model to analyze epistasis in Vitezica et al. []  which in turn is an extension of the NOIA (natural orthogonal interactions) QTL analysis model by Alvarez-Castro and Carlborg []. Note that a “statistical” or “breeding” model implies that the covariance between breeding values and dominance deviations is zero []. The NOIA model is orthogonal  which means that genetic effects are defined in such a way that the addition of other genetic effects (e.g. dominance) to a model does not change the definitions of genetic effects (e.g. additive) that were already included in the model []. For instance  the additive effect is always the regression of genotypic value on gene content; the dominance effect is a regression of the remainder on a measure of heterozygosity or identity at the genotype  and so on. The NOIA model of Alvarez-Castro and Carlborg [] achieves orthogonality automatically due to its construction of the incidence matrices  and  and their Kronecker products; Vitezica et al. [] proved that  for analyses at the individual level  these Kronecker products can be reformulated as Hadamard products. Statistically  orthogonality means that inclusion of new terms in the model does not change estimates of already included effects in an infinitely large population. For instance  in practice  going from an additive to an additive plus dominant model should not change the estimates of additive variance components much. The advantage of using orthogonality in genetics and breeding is that it is the only way to carry out the estimation of breeding values (additive “statistical” effects) in an unambiguous manner i.e. such that they do not depend on other genetic terms that are fitted in the model. Variance components were estimated for five nested models that added  in succession  additive effects ()  dominance effects ()  additive-by-additive genetic effects ()  additive-by-dominance genetic effects ()  and dominance-by-dominance genetic effects (). Genetic variances (       and ) were estimated by Bayesian methods using Gibbs sampling in the software gibbs2f90 []  available at . In total  200 000 iterations were run  discarding the first 10 000 and keeping every 100th sample. Convergence was checked by visual inspection of trace plots for the chains. Post-Gibbs analysis included estimation of the effective sample size and the deviance information criteria (DIC) as a goodness-of-fit criterion []. GBLUP was used to obtain estimated breeding values (EBV) by fixing the variance components that were estimated. Predictive ability of total genetic values for lowly heritable traits is difficult to ascertain  thus for the comparison of models  we proceeded as follows. EBV  were obtained from the “whole” dataset (13 369 records from 3619 sows)  which included litters from 2000 to 2014. EBV  were also computed for a “partial” dataset that included only litters prior to 2010 (10 002 records from 2440 sows). No sow farrowed both before and after 2010 (such sows were excluded from the data set). The three models:     and  were used to estimate  and . The models were compared using the following three statistics of cross-validation based on method R approaches [  ] to detect bias in subsequent genetic evaluations  and as more recently suggested by []: where  is referred to as the bias and should be equal to 0 under unbiasedness;  is a measure of dispersion of EBV  obtained as the slope of the regression of EBV obtained with the whole data on EBV estimated with the partial data  and should be 1; and  measures the relative increase of accuracies of EBV from partial data to whole data and was computed as the correlation of partial data on whole (among two models with different values of   the model with the highest  was chosen). EBV of only “new” sows that farrowed after 2010 were included in the statistics. These sows have no own or progeny phenotypic information in the partial data and thus  they can be seen as selection candidates at birth. For comparison purposes  we also investigated the predicted ability of phenotypes of “new” sows for the three models as the correlation  [] where  is the corrected phenotypic observation obtained from the “whole” dataset   and  is the predicted corrected observation from the “partial” dataset  which is equal to the sum of the estimated genetic values  and the estimated permanent environmental effect . The estimated genetic value included the estimated additive genetic effects ( model)  the sum of estimated additive and dominant genetic effects ( in the  model  and the sum of all genetic effects )  in the  model. The regression coefficients of  on  were also estimated. Estimates of additive and dominance genetic variances for litter size ranged from 0.81<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.12 to 0.84<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.12  and from 0.17<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 to 0.20<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11  respectively for all models (       and ). Variance component estimates did not differ among the models (Fig. )  which empirically illustrates the orthogonality in the partition of the total genetic variance  a property that holds under HWE (which holds in this dataset) and under linkage equilibrium (which holds approximately). Under orthogonality  allele substitution effects contribute to the additive variance  dominance deviations contribute to the dominance variance  etc. and there is no covariance between the genetic effects. If the model used is not orthogonal (e.g. “genotypic” model in Su et al. [])  estimates of additive genetic variance may be biased downward when the model is expanded from additive to include dominance and epistatic effects (e.g. Su et al. [] and Muñoz et al. [])  and many others). Not using orthogonal models leads to views that are too optimistic on the role of dominance on breeding. Estimates of additive (Var.A)  dominance (Var.D)  additive-by-additive (Var.AA)  additive-by-dominance (Var.AD)  and dominance-by-dominance (Var.DD) genetic variances for five models that included genomic inbreeding and successively added additive effects ()  dominance effects ()  additive-by-additive effects ()  additive-by-dominance effects ()  and dominance-by-dominance effects () Estimates of epistatic variance ranged from 0.11<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 to 0.14<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.12 for the additive-by-additive component  from 0.11<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 to 0.12<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 for the additive-by-dominant component  and were equal to 0.09<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 for the dominant-by-dominant component. As explained in many previous papers [  ]  the magnitude of the epistatic variances is trivial compared to that of the additive variance. However  non-orthogonal models can result in exaggerated estimates of epistatic variances (e.g. Su et al. [] and Muñoz et al. []). Estimates of epistatic variances had a large standard error in all models (   and )  which illustrates the difficulties in obtaining good estimates of epistatic variances also from genomic information  even when there are only two-way interactions. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability for the total number of piglets born per litter were similar between models (Table )  close to 0.09  and consistent with estimates reported by Varona et al. []  Nielsen et al. [] and Guo et al. []. Dominance variance expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance    was about 0.02  as in Misztal et al. []. The total epistatic variance (additive-by-additive plus additive-by-dominance plus dominance-by-dominance) expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance    was 0.04. The latter estimates need to be considered with caution due to the low precision of the estimates of epistatic effects. The estimated broad-sense heritability for litter size  was 0.15  i.e. almost twice the narrow-sense heritability. The joint posterior distribution of heritability and  or  (Fig. ) shows that there is no dependency between variance component estimates and thus  the partition of additive and non-additive effects was empirically orthogonal. Bivariate density plot of the posterior distribution (1900 samples) of narrow sense heritability   dominance variance as a proportion of phenotypic variance   and total epistatic variance as a proportion of phenotypic variance  for the  model Inclusion of non-additive (dominance and epistasis) effects in the model did not have a large effect on estimates of residual variance  but they reduced the permanent environmental variance (Table )  which shows that non-additive genetic effects are captured by the permanent environmental effects if they are not included explicitly in the model. Similar results were observed by Aliloo et al. [] when dominance was included in an additive model. Only second-order epistatic effects (e.g. additive-by-additive) were included in this study. Although it is tempting to fit high-order epistasis terms given the relative ease of computing the Hadamar products of relationship matrices  caution is needed. First  the products  quickly tend to the identity matrix  in which case there is no hope of distinguishing genetic components from residual effects. Second  partitioning genetic variance into additive and non-additive statistical components does not indicate the importance of additive versus non-additive gene actions []. The estimate of inbreeding depression  based on the inbreeding coefficient calculated as the proportion of homozygosity  was equal to -<U+2009>12.33<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.29 piglets born per litter for this population. Inbreeding depression expressed as a change in phenotypic mean per 10% increase in inbreeding was equal to -<U+2009>1.23 piglets born. This result shows the importance of inbreeding depression in fitness traits such as total number of piglets born. Estimates of non-additive variance components when inbreeding depression is not fitted in the model are rarely reported but  in our analyses  yielded an upward biased estimate of the dominance variance (i.e. GDI model in Fig. ). The estimate of dominance variance increased from 0.18 in the GDIF model (including inbreeding) to 0.38 in the GDI model. The estimate of epistatic variance was slightly affected by inclusion of inbreeding depression in the model. Estimates of additive variance were not affected. Similar results for dominance variance were obtained by Xiang et al. [] and Aliloo et al. []. To take directional dominance into account  inbreeding depression must be included in genetic evaluation models  which has long been known for pedigree analysis (e.g. DeBoer and Hoeschele []). Estimates (boxplots of posterior distributions) of additive  dominance  and epistatic genetic variances for the  model  with (GDIF) or without (GDI) including genomic inbreeding. The  model involves additive  dominance  additive-by-additive  additive-by-dominance  and dominance-by-dominance effects The global fit of the models was studied using DIC. Models with smaller DIC exhibit a better fit after accounting for model complexity. Differences in DIC between models of less than 7 units are considered as irrelevant []. The values of DIC were 68 365  68 370  68 367  68 370 and 68 375 for the        and  models  respectively  i.e. they were similar across models  and models that included dominance and epistasis do not appear to fit the data better than the simplest model. The predictive ability of the models for selection candidates was assessed using two approaches: the three statistics based on method R and by conventional cross-validation. The method R statistics of bias   slope   and correlation  were based on comparison of EBV obtained from the whole data (up to 2014) and model  with EBV obtained from the partial data and models    and . Similar results (not shown here) were obtained when using the  and  models in the whole dataset. For the correct models   and  are expected. The estimate of  was equal to  across the models and the estimate of  was equal to 1.01  1.04 and 1.09 in models    and   respectively. These estimates near zero for  and near to 1 for   suggest that the model is empirically unbiased. The statistic  (accuracy)  measured as the correlation between the EBV of selection candidates based on “whole” and “partial” data  was around 0.73 for all models. Based on conventional cross-validation (Table )  models    and  showed similar predictive ability of phenotypes. Estimates of the regression coefficient of  on  were close to 1 for all three models  which all achieved very similar levels of inflation of total genetic values. No differences in the accuracy of predicting future records for young animals were observed between the three models. Using orthogonal relationship matrices  empirically orthogonal estimates of additive  dominance and epistatic variances were obtained for litter size in a pig dataset. The broad-sense heritability for litter size was almost twice the narrow-sense heritability. Genomic models that include non-additive effects must consider simultaneously inbreeding depression based on inbreeding in order to obtain unbiased estimates of variance components. Inclusion of epistasis or dominance did not improve the accuracy of prediction of breeding or genotypic values. Mäki-Tanila A  Hill WG.

The mean squared error was reduced by at least 6.5% in the simulated data and by at least 1% in the real data. Moreover  by comparing NN of different complexities  our results confirm that a shallow model with one layer  one neuron  one-hot encoding and a linear activation function performs better than more complex models. The ABNN model provides a computationally efficient approach with good prediction performance and in which the weight components can also provide information on the importance of the SNPs. Hence  ABNN is suitable for both GWP and GWAS. Transformation of large quantities of data into valuable knowledge has become increasingly important in various fields of genomics and bioinformatics []. Machine-learning methods are flexible general-purpose approaches to automatically learn complex relationships and patterns from data  and they play a vital role in the analysis of big data [  ]. The concept of genome-wide prediction (GWP) was introduced by Meuwissen et al. [] and refers to the idea that regression coefficients of genomic markers  often single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  can be used to predict phenotypes of individuals. In order to identify markers that affect some phenotype of interest  state of the art genome-wide marker data comprise several thousands  sometimes millions of SNPs  scored in a number of individuals that is in the order of some hundreds to a few thousands []. There are plenty of examples of the successful use of machine-learning in genomic prediction  genome-wide association studies and in other forms of genomic sequence analysis [  ]. Among the most flexible methods in machine-learning are deep artificial neural networks  which have recently received large attention because of their outstanding prediction properties []. An artificial neural network (NN) connects the inputs (predictor variables) to an output (response variable)  either directly or through one or several layers of interconnected computing units (neurons). The depth of an NN corresponds to the number of hidden layers and the width to the number of neurons in its layers. NN with larger numbers of hidden layers are called “deep networks”. Training of a NN is accomplished with mathematical optimization algorithms that iteratively perform forward and backward passes (epochs) in order to minimize some loss (error) function and learn the weights (regression coefficients) and biases (intercepts) of the inputs. In the forward pass  the linear or non-linear activation functions are applied to the current values of the weights of the links to get the output at each layer. The final result of a forward pass is new predicted outputs. The backward pass starts by calculating the derivatives of the error function between the predicted outputs and the real outputs. Then  the derivatives are propagated backwards updating the weights and computing new error terms for that layer. This process is repeated for each layer until the input layer is reached again []. The number of epochs and the learning rate determine the amount of training and need to be evaluated against validation or test data in order to avoid over-fitting. Gradient descent is a popular algorithm that is used to perform mathematical optimization and is one of the most common ways to perform learning in neural networks. The gradient is computed layer-wise using the chain rule for reverse-mode differentiation []. The computed gradient indicates by what amount the errors would increase or decrease if the weights are increased by a small amount. Then  the weight vector is adjusted in the opposite direction to the gradient vector  i.e. the negative gradient vector specifies the direction of the steepest descent towards the minimum of the loss function. The gradient descent algorithm is an efficient alternative in NN with many connections  but easily leads to over-fitting. Two of the most important methods for regularization in NN are weight decay and dropout []. Weight decay is an old technique in which each weight decays towards zero at a rate that is proportional to its magnitude. Weight decay is closely related to ridge regression and can be interpreted as Bayesian Gaussian regularization []. Dropout is a recent innovation where a random proportion of the input weights are set to zero in each epoch []. Recently  it was shown that dropout can be interpreted as a Bayesian approximation to deep-learning with a near connection to Gaussian processes []. In genetics  there are some examples of the use of NN. Gianola et al. [] introduced the feed-forward NN and showed how it could be interpreted in terms of standard regression models  and classical and molecular genetics. Moreover  they suggested Bayesian ridge regression based regularization to prevent overfitting in the NN and showed that this improved prediction accuracy of traits such as milk production in Jersey cows and yield of inbred lines of wheat compared to normal linear models. The same model improved prediction accuracy of body mass index in mice in an accompanying study []. Ehret et al. [] replaced the computationally demanding Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm in [] with back-propagation. Glória et al. [] showed how two approximate measures of variable contribution and importance could be used to assess marker effects in genomic NN. Deep-learning has also received attention in the related fields of bioinformatics and systems biology [  ]. The purpose of this study is to present a NN model for genomic SNP data that can be modified easily. We will also show that regularization is obtained using weight decay and dropout  and that it results in an approximate Bayesian model that can be used to obtain model-averaged posterior predictions. The predictive accuracy of the NN model is evaluated by using both simulated and real data  and we show that weight components can provide information on the importance of SNPs under some circumstances. The most basic model starts with a single hidden layer NN. Denote  and  the weight matrices that connect the input matrix  of dimension  to the output  of dimension  through the hidden layer. The dimensions of  and  depend on the number of units in the hidden layer. Hence  for a hidden layer with  units  will be of dimension  and  of dimension . Associated with  and  is a bias vector  of dimension  and an activation function  that performs element-wise linear or non-linear transformation of the inputs. A standard NN model now becomes: A model with one hidden layer containing one unit will be of dimension  and thus   disappears. For regression purposes  the NN model is usually completed with the Euclidean squared loss function: where  denotes the square of the Euclidean norm. For classification  one can use the logistic or cross-entropy loss. If  is larger than   training of the NN will lead to over-fitting and it is necessary to regularize the NN parameters . Therefore  regularization terms are added during optimization. One common approach is to add the  penalty [] through weight decay parameters   which need to be tuned by cross-validation. The cost function to minimize is now: The above single hidden layer NN with the Euclidean loss is identical to a basis function regression model. With  and  chosen to be the linear identity function  the model is closely related to ridge regression. Extending this simple NN model to multiple layers is straightforward and results in a more expressive deep NN model  but it may result in over-fitting if the relationship between the input and output is linear and lacks structure. Hence  it is important to evaluate NN with different architectures and possibly also different activation functions. The most simple activation function is the linear identity function   which has the derivative  and range   and therefore is well adapted for linear regression purposes. In genetic terms  this function will infer additive effects of bi-allelic loci if the SNPs are coded 0  1 and 2. In order to model non-linear effects  there are several activation functions that can be used. The tanh function is  with derivative  and range . The rectifier function is defined as  and has several related functions  for example the rectified linear unit (ReLU). However  these non-linear functions may not be so useful for the first layer if the input contains integer coding (e.g. the 0  1 and 2 of SNP genotypes) and the weights are expected to be in both the positive and negative domains. An alternative way of inferring non-linearity of integer coded input variables is one-hot encoding []. In this approach  indicator variables are formed for each level of the input variable. From a genetic perspective  it means that each genotype will be coded by one  variable  and both additive and dominance effects can be modelled straightforwardly. Gradient descent (GD) is a first order optimization algorithm where the cost function  is minimized by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function . The learning rate  determines the size of the steps towards the minimum. The original gradient descent uses all training data per epoch : and  thus  can be slow for large datasets and get stuck in local minima. In contrast  stochastic gradient descent (SGD) uses random single training samples that modifies the gradient to: which makes it much faster per epoch  but also results in large fluctuations of the cost function. A compromise between GD and SGD is mini-batch GD (BSGD)  where a batch of size  is used for every epoch: which reduces the variance between updates and makes computations efficient. The number  needs to be chosen  usually between 50 and 250 depending on the number of observations in the training data. Several suggestions on how to improve the convergence properties of BSGD [] have been reported. Kingma and Ba [] introduced the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) algorithm that computes momentum components of the gradients: where  is the moving average of the gradient and  is the moving average of the squared gradient.  and  are hyper-parameters that control the exponential decay of the moving averages. Furthermore  their bias-corrected estimates are calculated as: which leads to an update of the parameters with adaptive learning rate: where  controls the effective stepsize. Kingma and Ba [] suggest the following default hyperparameters     and . ADAM can be combined with weight decay  and then will perform  regularization. This results in parameter update: Dropout is applied by sampling of binary vectors  and  in each epoch from two Bernoulli distributions  i.e.  and   and setting  of the inputs and  of the outputs to zero. This leads to an extension of Eq. () as follows: The dropped weights of  and  are usually scaled by  and   respectively  to maintain constant output magnitude. The surviving nodes have to stand in for those that are omitted  which forms another form of regularization that has been shown to be effective in preventing over-fitting []. Dropout can be interpreted in several ways [  ]. Gal and Ghahramani [] showed that dropout is mathematically equivalent to a variational approximation of a Bayesian deep Gaussian process. The goal of Bayesian prediction is the posterior predictive distribution []  which for the test input  is: where  is the likelihood of the test output (response) and . The posterior distribution of the training data  is usually analytically intractable  but the variational distribution  can be defined as: where      is a random variational matrix and  are the dropout probabilities.  and  were set to 0.5 for all NN configurations in this study. Then  the idea behind variational inference is to minimize the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between  and  through maximization of the log evidence lower bound: which results in the approximate predictive distribution: Note that the loss function is equal to the negative log-likelihood  i.e.   and that the dropout model can be interpreted as Bayesian ridge regression with a spike-and-slab -prior []. Sampling from Eq. () is straightforward. Start by sampling  sets of vectors   combine with  to obtain  and perform one gradient descent optimization per  with some predefined values of the weight decay. ADAM will automatically adapt the learning rate. Iterate until  to get predictions  and calculate  for each iteration: Plot the  against the iteration number to determine at which iteration  the chain has converged. The first moments (expectations) of the parameters  are approximated as: whereas the predictive variances for the parameters are: Moreover  the model’s averaged MSE can be calculated based on the MSE from each  of the stationary part of the chain yielding: The original data was produced for the QTLMAS2010 workshop and intended to mimic a real breeding livestock population []. The number of individuals is 3226  and these are structured in a pedigree with five generations. The pedigree is founded by 20 individuals (5 males and 15 females)  and it was created assuming that each female mates once and gives birth to approximately 30 progeny. Five 100 Mbp long autosomal chromosomes were simulated. A neutral coalescent model was used to simulate the SNP data. The algorithm created 10 031 markers  including 263 monomorphic and 9768 biallelic SNPs. The mean LD () between adjacent SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.05 is estimated at 0.100 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.152). The continuous quantitative trait was created from 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL)  including nine controlled genes and 28 random genes. The QTL were modelled as additive effects  apart from two pairs of additive epistatic QTL and three paternal imprinting QTL. The controlled genes were selected based on their high polymorphism as well as their high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with markers. The additive effects of all controlled QTL were equal to +3 (i.e. half the difference between the means of the homozygotes). The random genes were selected from the simulated SNPs and then their effects were sampled from a truncated normal distribution    and accepted if the absolute value of the additive effect was less than 2. The resulting additive effects of the random genes varied between -<U+2009>1.98 and 1.93. The two epistatic pairs of QTL are on chromosomes 1 and 2  respectively  and determined by four controlled additive QTL with an additional epistatic effect of 4 for the lower homozygote pairs. Each simulated QTL was surrounded by 19 to 47 polymorphic SNPs (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) positioned within a 1-Mb distance from the QTL. A total of 364 SNPs were in moderate to high LD with the QTL (). Furthermore  one dominance locus was positioned at SNP 9212 on chromosome 5 by giving the heterozygote (1) an effect of 5  and the upper homozygote (2) a value of 5.01 (for numerical reasons). One over-dominance locus was produced at SNP 9404 by assigning the heterozygote an effect of 5  the lower homozygote (0) an effect of -<U+2009>0.01  and the upper homozygote (2) an effect of 0.01. Finally  one under-dominance loci was created at SNP 9602 by assigning a value of -<U+2009>5 to the heterozygote  and giving the lower homozygote (0) an effect of -<U+2009>0.01 and the upper homozygote (2) an effect of 0.01. The values of the genotypes of these new SNPs were added to the original -values. SNPs with a MAF lower than 0.01 were removed resulting in a final sample of 9723 SNPs. Cleveland et al. [] published a pig dataset comprising 3534 individuals with high-density genotypes  phenotypes  and estimated breeding values for five anonymous traits. Genotypes were obtained with the PorcineSNP60 chip  and after quality control  52 842 SNPs remained. Missing genotypes were imputed using a probability score. SNPs with both known and unknown positions were included and imputed. The map order was randomized and the SNP identities were recoded. The number of SNPs was further reduced in this study by a more stringent MAF (<<U+2009>0.01)  which produced a final number of 50 276 SNPs. Most of the genotyped animals were measured for all five purebred traits (phenotypes in a single nucleus line). Heritabilities ranged from 0.07 to 0.62. In this study  trait 3 with a heritability of 0.38 was used. The phenotypic data points were adjusted for environmental factors and rescaled by correcting for the overall mean. Individuals with missing phenotype data were removed which  at the end  resulted in 3141 observations. All NN models were implemented in the Python version of MXNet [] using the ADAM optimizer with default settings. The Python code is available at . Predictions were also obtained for Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO) and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) (using default settings in the R-package BGLR; []). For the simulated QTLMAS2010 datasets  individuals in generations 1 to 4 (2326 individuals) were used as training data and in generation 5 (900 individuals) as test data. Individuals in the real pig data were divided into different cross-validation (CV) sets with test datasets of sizes between 627 and 631. The MSE was averaged over these CV sets. The Monte Carlo Markov chains of the GBLUP and BLASSO analyses were run for 60 000 iterations  and a burn-in of 10 000 and thinning of 10 resulted in a final sample of 5000 iterations. The resulting testing set MSE was 88.42 and 89.22 for the GBLUP and BLASSO  respectively (Table ). Initially  two NN were tested in which the first one was designed to have one hidden layer and one node  and the second to have two hidden layers with two and one node  respectively. The weight decay were varied between 1.0 and 1.5 for both NN. The ABNN analyses were run for 6000 iterations and the first 1000 were considered as burn-in. Overall  the model averaged test MSE and its standard deviation were smaller for the first NN than for the second NN (Table ). This NN also produced the smallest test MSE with an estimate of 82.69 for a weight decay of 1.4. The MSE quickly converged to a stationary phase for this NN (Fig. ). One larger NN with three layers (3  2 and 1 nodes  respectively) was run only for a weight decay of 1.4. The resulting test MSE was equal to 93.55 with a standard deviation (sd) of 1.424. In addition  the best model was evaluated with tanh and relu activation functions. The resulting test MSE were equal to 85.68 (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.166) and 83.72 (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.248)  respectively. Trace plot of test MSE for the best model (one-neuron  one-layer and linear activation function) on the simulated QTLMAS2010 data In order to investigate the effect of possible outliers in the test predictions  we also calculated the model averaged mean absolute error (MAE) for the most important models. MAE was equal to 7.640 and 7.635 for the BLASSO and GBLUP  respectively. The smallest MAE was 7.407 for the small ABNN model with a weight decay of 1.5. The MAE for the larger ABNN model was 7.675  which indicates overall the same pattern as for MSE. The model’s averaged weights  were calculated for the best model. The additive genetic effects were then obtained from the two homozygotes as <U+2009>+<U+2009> and are plotted in Fig. . It can be seen that the ABNN detects the two major additive loci on chromosome 3 (SNPs 4354 and 5327) and the additive part of the epistatic effect on chromosome 1 (SNP 931) as well as the additive part of the dominance locus (SNP 9212). Then  the dominance genetic effects were obtained from the heterozygote as  and are plotted in Fig. . It is clear that dominance  over-dominance and under-dominance loci were identified at SNP positions 9212  9404 and 9602  respectively. Mode-averaged weight plots for the additive genetic effects for the best model (one-neuron  one-layer and linear activation function) on the simulated QTLMAS2010 data. The two major additive loci are SNP 4354 and 5327 (red circles) and the additive part of the epistatic effect at SNP 931 is indicated by a red circle) and the additive part of the dominance locus at SNP 9212 by a blue circle Model-averaged weight plots for the dominance genetic effects for the best model (one-neuron  one-layer and linear activation function) on the simulated QTLMAS2010 data. The dominance  over-dominance and under-dominance loci were identified at SNPs 9212  9404 and 9602  respectively (blue circles) The analyses of the real data were run with the same number of iterations as for the simulated data. For the GBLUP and BLASSO  the MSE estimates were equal to 0.8759 and 0.8741  respectively (Table ). In the ABNN analyses  weight decays were optimized for values between 21 and 25 based on the two smallest NN. Again  the model averaged MSE and its standard deviation were overall smaller for the first NN than for the second NN  with MSE estimates of 0.8653 and 0.9221  respectively  for a weight decay of 23 (Table ). For the third NN  the test MSE was equal to 0.9236 (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00447). The analyses of the best model with tanh and relu activation functions resulted in test MSE of 0.894 (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.000383) and 0.867 (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.000781)  respectively. MAE of 0.6863 and 0.6865 were obtained for the BLASSO and GBLUP models  respectively. The smallest MAE was 0.6811 for the small ABNN model with a weight decay set to 22. The second ABNN model yielded a MAE of 0.7153 for a weight decay of 22. Hence  the pattern of MAE is very similar to the MSE pattern for both datasets. The model-averaged weights were extracted from the best model. Based on these  additive and dominance genetic effects were calculated and plotted (Figs.   )  which shows that six SNPs have quite high dominance effects. The same SNPs were found to be important in an earlier study []. Model-averaged weight plots for the additive genetic effects for the best model (one-neuron  one-layer and linear activation function) on the Cleveland pig dataset Model-averaged weight plots for the dominance genetic effects for the best model (one-neuron  one-layer and linear activation function) on the Cleveland pig dataset Alternative designs to fully-connected feed-forward NN differ in the way neurons are arranged and activated  and the architecture needs to be tailored to specific applications. Shallow NN have few layers and neurons  whereas deep NN consist of many layers  often with a large number of neurons  connected in various patterns. A one-layer and one-neuron NN with a linear activation function is equivalent to a standard multiple regression model. Many different architectures have been developed for deep-learning  the most important being convolutional neural networks (CNN)  which are widely used for modelling images []  and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for sequential data []. Restricted Boltzmann machines and autoencoders have been developed for unsupervised learning []. The number of software packages for deep-learning and computational sophistication have increased in recent years. However  application of NN in genetics is still relatively scarce  but tends to increase []. Here  we showed that regularization of genome-wide data can be obtained by a combination of weight decay and dropout in NN  and that this provides an efficient method  which can be used both for GWP and GWAS. Extensions to more complex NN resulted in overfitting and worse prediction accuracy on both simulated and real data. Hence  one can argue that it is more important to focus on efficient regularization and sparsity than on modelling of complex structures when genomic data consists of SNPs. Glória et al. [] also found that more complex NN designs reduced the predictive accuracy compared to a simple one-layer one-node net when evaluated on simulated genotype/phenotype data. A recommended strategy for optimization of the NN structure and the associated weight decays is to start with a simple model with one layer and one node  and monitor the MSE over a range of weight decays. Then  one can increase the complexity of the NN and evaluate if the test MSE decreases. Of course  cross-validation or some other form of test data is needed to obtain the minimum test MSE. The dropout probability can be set to a value between 0 and 1  but it turned out that the best result in terms of minimum test MSE was always obtained when setting this parameter to 0.5. Although  one should be aware that one of the dimension reduction properties of a NN structure is that once a variable from a layer is dropped  all the terms that are above it in the network also disappear []. Initially  it is important to evaluate values of the weight decay and the dropout using a broad range of parameter values and then consecutively shorten down the interval. A positive outcome of our results is that the weights can be interpreted as regression coefficients and therefore will be useful for the identification of important SNPs which is the main goal of GWAS. The one-hot encoding means that both additive and dominance effects can be detected as illustrated by the figures of both datasets. It is much more difficult to interpret weights for complex NN that include non-linear activation functions  pooling and feedback. Hence  the usefulness of deep-learning for GWAS is limited  although some techniques exist for variable importance analysis e.g. [  ]. Although SNPs are positioned on chromosomes  it is often sufficient to assume that the SNPs behave as independent data units due to recombination. However  it should be pointed out that the structures of SNP chip data and DNA sequence data differ. Some recent studies have tried to account for the structure at the DNA level in various prediction settings. Alipanahi et al. [] introduced the DeepBind model based on deep CNN for the detection of protein binding sites in DNA sequences. The DeepBind model was shown to outperform other methods  to recover known and novel sequence motifs  and quantify the result of sequence alterations and detect functional single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Quang and Xie [] proposed DanQ  a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent (LSTM) neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from DNA sequences. The idea behind DanQ is that the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs  while the recurrent layer takes care of long-term dependencies between the motifs. DanQ was shown to have outstanding prediction properties. It is likely that both CNN and RNN will become more important in the near future for GWP as sequence data becomes more abundant  but the computational demands for whole-genome analyses of large samples of individuals will be huge. In future studies  it would be interesting to combine the ABNN with convolutional and recurrent structures in order to incorporate possible LD. Another option that would be worth testing would be to replace weight decay (i.e. ridge regularization) with the  penalty (i.e. lasso regularization) of the weight parameters. Further studies on other datasets are also needed before general conclusions can be drawn. This study shows how the drop-out technique can be applied to neural networks and result in an approximate Bayesian (ABNN) model that provides a computationally efficient approach with good prediction performance. ABNN is suitable for prediction of unknown phenotypes using large-scale genome-wide SNP data  and as a tool for the detection of the SNPs that contribute information to the prediction when simple linear NN are favored. Our results show that  compared with the GBLUP and BLASSO methods on simulated data and real pig data  ABNN has lower prediction error and that a simple one-neuron one-layer network is preferred over deeper and more complex structures.

The  gene was moderately intolerant to variation and showed evidence of positive selection in the pig lineage  but no evidence of recent selective sweeps during breeding. In this work  we investigated sequence variation  evolutionary constraint  and selection at the  gene in pigs. A functional CD163 protein is required for infection by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) []  which is a serious pathogen with major impacts on pig production []. PRRSV-resistant genome-edited pigs with a modified  gene have been developed  either by knocking out the gene completely or by targeting its fifth scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain  which is essential for virus PRRSV infection [   ]. The physiological functions of the CD163 protein include clearing haemoglobin from blood plasma []  adhesion of nucleated red blood cells to macrophages during red blood cell differentiation []  and immune signalling [  ]. When red blood cells rupture  and haemoglobin is released into the blood stream  it is bound by haptoglobin  and the haptoglobin—haemoglobin complex is taken up by macrophages using the CD163 protein as receptors on their surface []. Since the natural function of CD163 is receptor-mediated endocytosis  it is a target for pathogens entering cells. At least one other virus  the simian hemorragic fever virus []  has independently evolved to target CD163. Given that genome editing of  has led to PRRVS-resistant pigs  we wanted to determine if natural knockout variants for the  gene could be identified in elite pigs  in order to investigate the opportunity to select for resistance to PPRSV within existing breeding programs. The aims of this paper were to survey  sequence variation for such naturally occurring knockout variants (i.e.  stop-gain and frameshift variants that likely disrupt gene function)  and to compare the  sequence variation to genomic distributions of selection and constraint. We used targeted pooled sequencing of  exons to detect sequence variants in 35 000 pigs of diverse genetic backgrounds. Then  we used whole-genome sequence data from three pig lines to put these results of  sequence variation in the context of the whole genome. We used three complementary population genetic analyses: a variant intolerance score  which measures the tolerance of genes to protein coding variation; a selection test on protein coding variation over evolutionary time; and haplotype diversity statistics to detect recent selective sweeps during breeding. We used targeted  exon sequence data and whole-genome sequence data from pigs in the Pig Improvement Company (PIC) breeding programme. This programme contains a diverse collection of genetics  which represent broadly used populations  including animals of Large White  Landrace  Duroc  Hampshire and Pietrain heritage. The targeted sequencing included DNA samples from 35 000 pigs  which were previously collected from 2011 to 2016 as part of the breeding programme. To put the targeted exon sequence data in a genomic context and compare it to genomic distributions of selection and constraint  we used whole-genome sequence data from three lines of pigs of the PIC breeding programme. These lines were also sampled in the targeted exon sequencing. We used 1146 individuals from Line 1  sequenced at various coverages. Eighty-four individuals were sequenced at 30X coverage  11 at 10X  45 at 5X  561 at 2X  and the remaining 445 at 1X. Individuals and their sequence coverages were chosen with the AlphaSeqOpt algorithm [  ]  and we added sires that contributed a large proportion of the progeny in Line 1 that were genotyped as part of the routine breeding activities of PIC. AlphaSeqOpt uses phased genotype data  which in our case consisted of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes from a 60 K or 15 K SNP chip  which were phased with AlphaPhase []. The AlphaSeqOpt algorithm consists of several steps. First  we identified focal individuals that had a genome representing the haplotype diversity of the population as much as possible  and allocated a fixed sequencing budget to the families of the focal individuals in order to maximise phasing accuracy proportionate to the population haplotype footprint of the focal individual. Then  we identified individuals that carried underrepresented haplotypes to maximise the number of haplotypes that were sequenced at sufficiently high coverage for accurate imputation. We also used 408 individuals from Line 2 and 638 individuals from Line 3  which were all sequenced at 2X coverage. These individuals were sires that contributed a large proportion of the progeny in Lines 2 and 3 that were genotyped as part of the routine breeding activities of PIC. We used a hierarchical pooling strategy to sequence  exons in many individuals cost-effectively. Using sequence capture  we could target the sequencing effort to the  exons only  and thus fit many animals into the same lane of an Illumina sequencer. The pooling allowed us to use fewer targeted capture reactions  while retaining the ability to go back to the original plate and individually sequence animals for validation. Therefore  we pooled 96 DNA samples each into one combined DNA sample and constructed a shotgun sequencing library using the ThruPLEX Tag-seq kit from Rubicon Genomics. This kit incorporates unique molecular identifiers that allow a consensus sequence to be generated from reads originating from the same molecule  and thus reduces the impact of sequencing errors. Twenty-four such barcoded libraries were combined and used as input into a sequence capture reaction with baits that were designed against the  exons (Arbor Biosciences  Ann Arbor  MI). Then  the product of the library capture was used to generate 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>150-bp reads on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. This pooling scheme allowed us to sequence up to 2304 samples per sequencing run. In total  35 808 animals were sequenced using this scheme. We aligned reads with BWA (v 0.7.15-r1140) []  using the BWA-MEM algorithm  against the 10.2 version of the pig genome to which we added a 33-kb contig representing the  genomic region that was missing from this version of the reference genome. The coding sequence of  on this contig is identical to the sequence that is annotated as  in the version 11.1 of the pig reference genome. We used Connor () to call consensus sequences from reads with the same unique molecular identifier and called variants from these consensus alignments using the LoFreq variant caller []. We used snpEff [] to classify the variants as synonymous  nonsynonymous  stop-gain and frameshift indel variants. Potential stop-gain variants detected in the pooled targeted sequencing data were pursued for validation by sequencing individual animals  i.e. we went back to the pools in which the variants were detected and sequenced amplicons of the appropriate exons from all the DNA samples that made up the pool with individual barcodes on the MiSeq. None of the potential stop-gain variants were validated in the individual sequencing. We tested five potential frameshift indel variants in the same way  and none of these were validated in the individual sequencing either. We aligned reads to the pig genome (Sscrofa11.1) with BWA-MEM []  removed duplicates with Picard ()  and called variants with the GATK HaplotypeCaller []. We filtered and processed variant call format files with VCFtools []. We used the Ensembl variant effect predictor [] to find the protein-coding SNPs  and classify them into synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs based on the Ensembl gene annotation [] version 90. We downloaded variants in  from the Ensembl variation database. The residual variant intolerance score [] measures gene-level tolerance to mutations by counting segregating variants. To calculate the residual variant intolerance  we counted the number of nonsynonymous variants and the total number of variants in each gene  and calculated the studentised residual of the regression between the number of nonsynonymous variants and the total number of variants. We included variants that segregated in at least one of the three lines. We applied the residual variant intolerance score both at the level of the gene  and at the level of the protein domain []  using protein domains that were found by identifying Pfam profiles in Ensembl protein sequences with PfamScan []. All gene-level analyses were performed on the principal transcript  as designated with APPRIS annotation []. SnIPRE [] uses a Poisson model to measure gene-level selection based on between-species divergence and within-species polymorphism. We calculated the divergence between the pig and cattle (UMD 3.1.1) genomes using the Nei-Gojobori method []  which estimates the number of potential synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two codons. We aligned the reference genomes using Lastz [] and refined the alignments using the chain/net method []. We excluded all codons that were not fully aligned between genomes  i.e.  any codon that contained an alignment gap or a missing base in any of the genomes. For within-species polymorphism data  we used the protein-coding variants from whole genome sequence data of the three lines combined. SnIPRE models the logarithm of the mutation count in a sample of individuals as a linear function of fixed effects (an intercept term  a term for nonsynonymous variants  a term for divergent variants  an interaction term for divergent nonsynonymous variants  and an offset term) and random gene effects  which allow the coefficients for nonsynonymous variants  divergent variants and the interaction between them to be estimated with regularisation. The selection effect for each gene is the interaction term for nonsynonymous fixed variants (summing the coefficient for the fixed effect and the gene-specific coefficient for that gene)  i.e. it provides an estimate of the excess or deficit in nonsynonymous divergent variants in a gene. We ran the empirical Bayes implementation of SnIPRE  using the lme4 R package []  which generates confidence intervals for the selection effect based on standard errors. We estimated haplotype diversity at   at 100 random control genes of similar length as  (at most 10% difference)  and at 11 homologs of genes that are stably expressed in humans []. We imputed genome-wide sequence data to 65 000 pigs from Line 1  using SNP genotypes from a 60 K or 15 K SNP chip and the Line 1 sequence data described above. We extracted mapped read counts that supported each allele from low coverage samples  as outlined in []  and used multilocus hybrid peeling []  as implemented in AlphaPeel  to phase and impute all individuals to full sequence data in the selected genes. We extracted all variants that were within exons and introns of the genes and identified the haplotypes that were carried by each genotyped individual in each gene. For each gene  including introns  strings of phased alleles were compared to define haplotypes carried by each individual in each parental chromosome. Strings of alleles that were identical (with a mismatch threshold) between two individuals were considered to be the same haplotype  while strings with more than two mismatches were considered as different haplotypes to account for sequencing or phasing errors. Then  we calculated haplotype homozygosities based on the pooled frequency of the two most common haplotypes (H)  which is used as a test statistic for detection of selective sweeps  and has been shown to be sensitive to soft sweeps []. We downloaded gene ontology (GO) biological process terms for all Ensembl genes from BioMart []  and ranked enriched biological processes based on p values from a Fisher’s exact test of independence. For comparison  we extracted the genes found to be under positive selection in the pig  based on dN/dS ratio in []  and mapped their names to Ensembl gene identifiers with BioMart. We found enriched biological process terms in this gene list in the same way as in our data  and identified the overlap of genes with enriched gene ontology terms between the two lists. We used a hierarchical pooling strategy to sequence the exons of  from over 35 000 pigs from nine lines and identified  variants from whole-genome sequencing of 1146  638  and 408 pigs from three of these nine lines. Targeted sequencing of exons identified 140 single nucleotide variants in . Whole-genome sequencing in three of the nine lines identified 15 single nucleotide variants in   two of which were nonsynonymous  the rest being synonymous  and no potential knockout variants. Table  shows the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants found in each dataset  and the overlap between them. Figure  shows the location of the variants in the CD163 protein sequence and their frequencies in targeted and whole-genome sequencing. The targeted sequencing also identified 14 potential stop-gain variants  which all occurred at low frequency (mean 0.01%; maximum 0.4%). We further investigated these stop-gain variants by performing individual sequencing of the animals that composed the pool in which the potential stop-gain variant was identified. This ruled out all potential stop-gain variants as false positives that were likely caused by polymerase errors during amplification before incorporation of unique molecular identifiers. The targeted sequencing also identified 45 potential frameshift indel variants  which all occurred at low frequency (mean 0.03%; maximum 0.1%). We further investigated five of these variants by individual sequencing and ruled them out also as false positives.

Grey and black coloured points indicate replication. Grey dots in targeted sequencing are variants that are not present in the Ensembl variation database. Grey dots in the whole-genome sequenced lines are variants that are not replicated by the targeted exon sequencing. The blue boxes represent SRCR domains  with the fifth domain (which is the target of the PRRS virus) in dark blue The  variants detected in the whole-genome sequence data of three pig lines were mostly concordant with those from targeted exon sequencing. The discordant SNPs found in the whole-genome sequence data had low allele frequencies. One nonsynonymous shared variant  K851R  occurred at a relatively high minor allele frequency (16% in the targeted exon sequencing  10% in Line 1  4.0% in Line 2  and 1.9% in Line 3) and is located in the eighth SRCR domain. Among the sequence variants detected  10 were already present in the Ensembl variation database. These were all synonymous and had a higher minor allele frequency (mean equal to 7.6%) than variants that were missing from Ensembl variation (mean minor allele frequency 0.44%).  was not among the most variant-intolerant genes based on the residual variant intolerance score.

Arrows indicate the position of  and five of its SRCR domains We used the bottom 2% of the genome-wide residual variant intolerance distribution to identify 358 variant-intolerant genes. The list was enriched for basal cellular processes such as microtubule-based movement  cell adhesion  and calcium ion transport (Fig. ). Conversely  the top 2% of the residual variant intolerance score distribution was enriched for olfaction-related and immunity-related terms  namely G-protein coupled receptor signalling  detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell  antigen processing and presentation  and response to stimulus. The five most enriched gene ontology biological process terms in variant-intolerant genes and positively selected genes in the pig  with the negative logarithm of the p value of their enrichment based on Fisher’s exact test  showed evidence of positive selection in the pig lineage  as estimated by the SnIPRE model. Figure  shows the selection estimates from the SnIPRE model  highlighting positively and negatively selected genes and the position of . We found 1125 putatively selected genes  778 positively selected genes  and 347 putatively negatively selected. Positively selected genes in the pig lineage were enriched for cell surface receptor signalling  proteolysis  protein phosphorylation and terms related to lipids (Fig. ). SnIPRE estimates of selection. The arrow indicates the position of   which is one of the potentially positively selected (blue) genes There was limited overlap between the positively selected genes in our study and those reported by Groenen et al. []. We were able to map 287 of the 331 positively selected genes from the previous study to Ensembl gene identifiers  and nine of these genes were shared with our list of positively selected genes. However  both of the gene lists were enriched for the GO term ‘protein phosphorylation’ (at Fisher’s test p values<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). We investigated haplotype diversity of  in one of the lines using imputed whole-genome sequence data. We calculated the selective sweep test statistic H for   and compared it to that for 100 randomly selected control genes of similar length. Figure  shows H at   the 100 control genes  a set of homologs of genes that are stably expressed in humans  and randomly selected genes labelled as intolerant based on the residual variant intolerance score. Based on this   showed no evidence of a recent selective sweep. Number of haplotypes  number of SNPs per gene  and selective sweep statistic H for   100 control genes of similar length  100 intolerant genes with a low residual variant intolerance score  and 11 control genes that are homologs of human genes with stable expression across many tissues In this paper  we investigated sequence variation  evolutionary constraint  and selection at the  gene in pigs. Within   we identified synonymous and nonsynonymous variants but no potential knockout variants. We found that  is relatively tolerant to variation  shows evidence of positive selection in the pig lineage  but no evidence of selective sweeps during recent breeding. In light of these results  we will discuss (1) variant intolerance scores; (2) selection on  in the pig lineage (3) the lack of evidence of recent selective sweeps; and (4) some technical aspects of the targeted exon sequencing method. Variant intolerance scores measure the lack or excess of common nonsynonymous variants in a gene []. A low variant intolerance score for a gene indicates that its sequence is constrained  which correlates with gene essentiality []. The intermediate variant intolerance scores of  suggest that it is moderately constrained in the pig. Given the known functions of  in haemoglobin scavenging and immune signalling [    ]  it appears that  is under purifying selection  but not as strongly constrained as essential genes involved in basic cellular functions. The 2% bottom extreme tail of the variant intolerance distribution was enriched for genes that are related to microtubule-based movement  which is consistent with an enrichment of microtubule-genes in human essential genes []. The 2% top extreme tail of the variant intolerance distribution was enriched for genes that are related to olfaction and antigen processing and presentation  which is again consistent with results from humans []  where olfactory receptors and human leukocyte antigen genes tend to have high residual variant intolerance scores. The SnIPRE model is a generalized mixed linear model that estimates the selection effect on each gene based on the number of fixed nonsynonymous substitutions compared to an outgroup species []  for which we used cattle. A positive selection estimate is based on a significantly larger number of nonsynonymous fixed substitutions when comparing the porcine and the bovine genomes than expected under neutrality  which is assumed to hold for synonymous sites. The positive selection effect estimated for  suggests that its sequence is quite flexible and has been subjected to accelerated evolution in the pig lineage. Positive selection on  is consistent with its known role in infection. The estimated positive selection effect for other cell surface genes  including those encoding the T cell surface proteins    and  and immunoglobulin receptors  and   is consistent with previous observations of selection on immune genes in the pig []. However  the overlap between genes found to be positively selected here and in Groenen et al. [] is limited. Selective sweeps occur when fixation of one or more beneficial variants affects allele frequencies at linked sites []. Such signals of recent selection (within   generations) can be detected from population genetics data. When the beneficial variant is already present in the population as standing variation  selection may give rise to a so-called soft sweep  which may be more difficult to detect than a sweep that arises from a beneficial new mutation []. Since selection on standing variation is the expectation in animal breeding  we used a statistic designed to detect soft sweeps []. The lack of a selective sweep at  suggests that it has not been a target of strong recent selection during pig breeding  which is consistent with its lack of obvious connections to traits that are under strong artificial selection  such as production and reproduction traits. However  selective sweep analysis cannot rule out the possibility that  variants could have small effects on some quantitative trait and may have been subjected to subtle allele frequency shifts by selection. Targeted exon sequencing of pooled samples is a feasible way to sequence a gene in many individuals cost-efficiently. However  as our unsuccessful validation of potential stop-gain and frameshift variants shows  this method suffers from low-frequency false positives  which are likely due to polymerase errors before incorporation of unique molecular identifiers. This suggests that the low-frequency nonsynonymous variants detected in the targeted exon sequencing are also likely to be false positives. The targeted exon sequencing and whole-genome sequencing were in good agreement for higher frequency variants. The targeted sequencing sampled a wider range of pig diversity that whole-genome sequencing and  therefore  the rare variant calls could also represent genuine rare variants. However  with the depth of sequencing and the absence of stop-gain and frameshift indel variants in the whole-genome sequencing data  we are confident that there are no natural stop-gain variants and likely no natural frameshift indel variants in  in the evaluated pigs. We performed a deep survey of sequence variation in the  gene in domestic pigs. We found no potential knockout variants.  was moderately intolerant to variation  and showed evidence of positive selection in the pig lineage  but no evidence of selective sweeps during breeding.

A deletion in the  gene is responsible for the frizzle feather phenotype in the Kirin chicken. The identification of this mutation  which causes a developmental defect of avian integument appendages  will improve our understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in feather formation. Birds display a high degree of diversity in feather structure. In chickens  the frizzle trait is a varietal characteristic  and birds that carry this trait have all their contour feathers curling outward and upward [  ]. The rachises of frizzle and normal feathers are different i.e.  frizzle feathers turn outward relative to the skin  whereas normal body and flight feathers have a dorsal orientation. In frizzle chickens  rectrices and remiges are less affected but have an irregular appearance  and display other modifications  such as thickening of the barbs and barbules  alteration of the hooklets and in some cases  other structural abnormalities [  ]. These modifications of the feather structure reduce the insulating effect of feathers [  ]. To date  the frizzle mutation has been reported to occur in a single autosomal gene  denoted as the F gene (see [])  and shows incomplete dominance inheritance [  ]. Although the curling of feathers of the frizzle phenotype is visible in heterozygous individuals  it is even more pronounced in homozygous individuals  but frizzle feathers are more ornamental (the curve is less severe and feathers look like daisy petals) in heterozygous than in homozygous chickens. Because of their enhanced heat dissipation under tropical conditions  both homozygous and heterozygous frizzle chickens have a relatively higher meat and egg production than wild type individuals [  ]. Kirin chicken (KRC) is a Chinese indigenous breed of chicken that is noted for its frizzle feathers. The KRC breed originates from the Guangdong province  and is raised exclusively in this region with a warm and humid subtropical climate. Adult KRC have a distinct disorientation of feathers (Fig. a–d). In general  the frizzle phenotype is not observed in the down of frizzle dwarf chicken at hatch but becomes more obvious in the second-generation bilateral feathers []. In contrast  in KRC  Tao et al. [] observed the presence of frizzle downy feathers in chicks at hatch (Fig. e  f)  which suggests a different mechanism for the frizzle trait in this breed. Ng et al. [] demonstrated that a deletion at the junction between exon 5 and intron 5 of the  gene causes the frizzle feather phenotype in frizzle dwarf chicken  but this deletion is absent in KRC  which suggests that another gene is involved in the formation of feathers [  ] and that the molecular mechanism responsible for frizzle feathers in KRC is different. Comparison between frizzle and normal phenotypes. – Adult Kirin (frizzle feathers) and Huaixiang (normal feathers) chickens. Adult frizzle feathers curve away from the body  which gives a highly divergent appearance from normal feathers.  One-day-old Kirin and  Huaixiang chickens. The downy feathers appear frizzled  which contrasts with feathers from previously reported breeds To dissect the genetic basis of the frizzle phenotype in KRC  we crossed homozygous frizzle KRC with normal feathered Huaixiang chickens (HX). A double-digest genotyping by sequencing (dd-GBS) based [] genome-wide association analysis on individuals from the F generation  allowed us to identify a candidate region for the  gene  in KRC. Then  we used Sanger sequencing to ascertain the causative mutation in several candidate genes. We also compared the transcriptome profiles of KRC and HX. Finally  we validated our finding in other breeds  e.g. Houdan (H)  Luhua (L) and HX. A three-generation resource population was produced by crossing purebred KRC with frizzle feathers and HX with normal feathers. The F generation was derived by mating one KRC male with 10 HX females (KRC<U+2009>×<U+2009>HX)  and by mating one HX male with 10 KRC females (HX<U+2009>×<U+2009>KRC). Three male and eight female F individuals from KRC<U+2009>×<U+2009>HX and three male and eight female F individuals from HX×KRC were mated  respectively  to produce the F generation. We conducted a <U+03C7>-test to study inheritance patterns of the frizzle trait by using the R package software []. Eighteen F and 57 F homozygous frizzle feather and normal feather individuals were sampled from 12 families [see Additional file : Table S1]. Genomic DNA was extracted following the instructions of the AxyPrep™ DNA Gel Extraction kit  double-digested with different restriction enzyme pairs and sequenced. We found that digestion with the enzyme combination   I and  I  was appropriate and highly consistent with in silico digestion-site prediction. Thus  these two restriction enzymes were used to digest total DNA. Adapters marked with specific barcodes were ligated to the restriction-digested overhanging sequences by T4 ligase  following the dd-GBS protocol []. DNA samples from the above 75 individuals  marked by different barcode adapters  were mixed and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA fragments that carried ligated adapters were amplified with primers that had complementary sequences for each adapter. The constructed 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>150 bp libraries were sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing system in Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co.  Ltd. All raw sequences are deposited at NCBI under the BioProject registration number PRJNA445355. Removal of adapter sequences from the reads was done by using AdapterRemoval v2 [] and the trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome of  (galGal5) by the Burrows–Wheeler Alignment (BWA) tool v0.7.12 [] in order to identify variants. High-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called by using the GATK software []  and the outputs were transformed into PED and MAP files format  which were the standard input files of PLINK-1.9 []. The dd-GBS based SNPs were filtered out based on the following criteria: (1) minor allele frequency lower than 0.05; (2) SNP missing rate across all individuals higher than 0.2; (3)  value for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium less than 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10e; and (4) Mendelian errors based on parental genotypes. GWAS on 57 F samples were performed by using the case-control model in PLINK. In order to detect all possible causative mutations in five keratin genes (       and )  we used exon sequencing. Primers for these candidate genes were designed by using primer premier 5.0 and are provided in Additional file : Table S2. DNA obtained from blood samples of five homozygous normal and five frizzle feather individuals was pooled  PCR-amplified and sequenced  respectively  with three replicates for each pool. To validate that the mutation was in exon 3 of the  gene  blood was sampled from individuals that were randomly selected from KRC  HX  H and L chicken. Heterozygous frizzle samples (F) were obtained from crosses between KRC and other breeds with normal feather breeds. DNA was extracted and pooled from 49 H  34 HX  12 L  86 F and 104 KRC chickens  resulting in five pools. DNA samples of 10 H  10 HX  10 L  40 F and 102 KRC chickens were PCR-amplified individually. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94 °C for one cycle  and 30 s at 94 °C  30 s at 60 °C  and 30 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The PCR products were sequenced on an ABI 3730 sequencer. We performed the transcriptome analysis of follicle tissues from three KRC and three HX individuals at the embryonic age of E13. Under an RNase-free laminar flow cabinet  feather follicles with skin were removed surgically from the back of each individual  sprayed with RNAsafety  and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent  and mRNA sequencing was carried out using poly (A)-enriched mRNA. Each of these mRNA samples was converted first into barcoded RNA-seq libraries  and then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The FASTQ sequence of each library was submitted to NCBI (PRJNA445349). Using the Tophat2 [] program with default parameters  stock-specific transcripts were mapped to the chicken reference genome. The normalized gene expression levels were measured in fragments per kb of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) using Cufflinks. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified using the DESeq package [] based on a  value less than 0.05 and |log2(K/H)|<U+2009>higher or equal to <U+2009>1  where K and H denote the expression level of each gene in the KRC and HX groups  respectively. Reciprocal matings between homozygous KRC and HX resulted in a heterozygous F  and  as previously reported [  ]  the frizzle phenotype was incompletely penetrant in this population. Penetrance was similar regardless of whether the  gene was inherited from a cockerel or a hen  thus ruling out sex-linked inheritance. In order to determine the gene underlying the frizzle trait  six males and 16 females were selected from the F generation to produce 486 F offspring. Of these  113 individuals were homozygous frizzle  241 were heterozygous frizzle and 132 were homozygous normal feathered. The <U+03C7>-test (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) showed that the frizzle phenotype is consistent with Mendelian inheritance (=<U+2009>0.22) and incompletely dominant in KRC. dd-GBS sequencing applied to 75 F and F individuals generated 1464 million reads for an average of 3× sequencing depth. After filtering  these reads were aligned to the reference genome  generating about 100 000 effective fragments  which is equivalent to 30 Mb and represents 2.8% of the entire genome with an average depth of 54×. A total of 1 948 658 raw variants were identified  loaded into PLINK 1.9 []  and filtered according to the criteria presented in the Methods section  which yielded 525 561 variants. The distribution of these variants across the chromosomes was relatively even [see Additional file : Figure S1]. Eighteen of the 75 F individuals were used as references to remove variants with Mendelian errors. We applied a case-control model to calculate the association of variants with the frizzle phenotype across the whole genome (see Fig. ). SNPs that showed a significant association and their nearest gene are listed in Table . A majority of the most significant SNPs were located within a region of 130 kb (=<U+2009>9.46<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  which corresponds to intron 5 of the - gene (). The other most significant SNPs were located in the vicinity of the      and  genes  which encompass a region between 1.19 and 1.52 Mb on chromosome 33 and are putative candidates for the  locus. In summary  the candidate QTL overlaps (1.19–1.39 Mb) with the cluster of a-keratin genes on chromosome 33 []. To our knowledge  the other detected genes  such as    and  are not involved in feather formation. Genome-wide significance of associations.

The red solid line indicates a significant association with a  value of 1e-10 The candidate region identified by GWAS lies within a genomic interval on chromosome 33  which covers the cluster of type II a-keratin genes. Although in frizzle dwarf chicken  the causative mutation for the frizzle phenotype is localized in the  gene []  previous results indicate that this is not the case in KRC []. To detect the putative causative mutations in KRC  we PCR-amplified and sequenced all the exons of five keratin genes (        and ) located within the region detected by GWAS. The  gene has three isoforms (ENSGALT00000086819  ENSGALT00000090244 and ENSGALT00000047324) and the transcript is associated with two gene entries (ENSGALG00000044875 and ENSGALG00000043689). We analyzed the DNA extracted from 10 homozygous F individuals  i.e. five with normal and five with frizzle feathers and detected 90 synonymous substitutions  five missense substitutions  two deletions and three insertions (indels). Among these five indels  only one was located within the coding sequence of   i.e. a 15-bp deletion (Fig. )  which can alter the sequence of the corresponding protein. This deletion showed complete segregation with the frizzle phenotype in the F samples that were sequenced; and thus  was named  deletion. All the other variants were excluded because at least one wild type chicken had the same genotype as that in the chickens with frizzle feathers. Fluorescent peaks of the 15-bp deletion and its flanking sequences. The sequence on chromosome 33 starts at position 1 294 968 bp of the reference genome (Gallus_gallus-5.0). The upper and lower sequences are from HX and KRC individuals  respectively  with a deletion of 15 bp in KRC. The upstream and downstream sequences of the deletion have blue and red backgrounds  respectively Whole-transcriptome sequencing produced an average of 49 million reads for each sample. After the trimming and filtering steps  37.4 to 53.6 million high-quality sequence reads from each of the individuals remained and were aligned to the reference genome. On average  88% of the reads were successfully aligned. Of the 94 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) based on a |log(K/H)|<U+2009>higher than <U+2009>1 and a  less than 0.05 [see Additional file : Table S4]  50 DEG were up-regulated and 44 were down-regulated in KRC. However  none of these DEG were located in the 1.19–1.52 Mb region detected by GWAS on chromosome 33 or in the type II a-keratin cluster. The level of expression of  was similar in the KRC and HX groups. However  the sequence of the  transcript (displayed by the integrative genomics viewer (IGV) [  ]) differed between the KRC and HX groups (Fig. ). Due to the  deletion in one exon (exon 3 of ENSGALT00000090244.1 or exon 4 of ENSGALT00000086819.1)  the  transcript was comparatively shorter in KRC than in HX  leading to the loss of Val-Leu-Pro-Ala-Ser in the translation product  which thus may have a different function compared to the normal protein. The transcripts of the other keratin genes on chromosome 33 were similar for both KRC and HX  which is concordant with the results from the analysis of the KRC’s genome sequence. Thus  our findings indicate that  is probably the  gene. Integrative genomics viewer (IGV) display of KRT75L4 transcripts in KRC and HXC breeds.  Part of the alignment tracks of RNA-seq reads in the region of  is shown. The read coverage tracks of HX and KRC groups are in orange and green  respectively.  Zoomed-in image of the second exon in the upper graph. Missing coverage in the middle-front region is observed in the three samples of the KRC group  which is due to the F-deletion that is shown in  To validate furthermore the association detected between  and the frizzle feather phenotype  we PCR-amplified and sequenced the  deletion and its flanking sequences located in  exon 3 from DNA obtained from other breeds of chickens. The  deletion was not found in HX  H and L chickens  which are breeds with normal feathers (Table ). These results suggest that even if the  deletion is not the causative variant  it is strongly linked to the phenotype of frizzle feathers. Heat stress can be a major concern for chickens that are raised in warm climates [  ]. A reduction in feather coverage increases heat dissipation and body heat irradiation  and such adaptation to high environmental temperatures has been well-documented [  ]. Adomako et al. [] reported favorable effects of the  locus on production traits  such as egg weight  egg mass  body weight and productivity index. Thus  identification of the  gene is important for breeding programs that are designed to enhance the productive performance of chickens maintained in hot humid climates. Feathers consist mainly of two types of keratin proteins: a- and ß-keratins  which are encoded by multigene families. ß-keratins are found only in reptiles and birds  whereas a-keratins exist in all vertebrates []. Prum and Williamson [] attributed the alteration of feather shape to mutations in keratin genes. Cellular and biochemical evidence indicates that a-keratin may have a key role in the early formation of rachides  barbs  and barbules []. In addition  the human and mouse homologs of    and  are expressed in distinct parts of the hair follicle [  ]. The morphological and structural diversity of feathers probably results from different combinations of a- and ß-keratin genes in different intra-feather tissues []. Analyses of mouse and human cells showed that some a-keratins are involved in intracellular signaling pathways  and that mutations in the corresponding genes may interfere in the construction of the cell cytoskeleton [  ]. Although type II keratin genes are located within a single cluster on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 15 []  studies on avian keratin genes have been challenging because of their conservation and duplications. In spite of considerable efforts to establish a correspondence between individual a-keratin chicken genes and their homologs in mammals []  they are not included in the most recent chicken genome assembly and annotation release. Ng et al. [] reported that the loss of the authentic splice site at the exon5/intron 5 junction of  resulted in a 69-bp in-frame deletion within its coding region and played a key role in frizzle feather development. The gene referred to as  [] is actually  according to RefSeq. Furthermore   lies within the noncoding region of   along with      and other predicted loci. The official full name of  is -  and encodes an uncharacterized protein  with an annotation score of 1 []. Our results of transcriptome analysis  combined with other evidence  show that the gene is expressed in chicken tissues  although its function is unknown. We have demonstrated that a deletion allele in  is the major determinant of frizzle feathers in Kirin and  not   as in other breeds of frizzle chickens. This feather defect seems to be amplified in chickens due to the elaborate morphogenesis of their feathers. Thus  identification of another gene that has a role in the morphology of feathers contributes to a better understanding of the genetics and development of feathers. Finally  our work provides information on a key gene involved in the formation of frizzle feathers and should help to explore furthermore the role of the keratin genes in normal and aberrant vertebrate development.

We make this algorithm available as a standalone program called AlphaPeel. In this paper  we extend multi-locus iterative peeling to provide a computationally efficient method for calling  phasing  and imputing sequence data of any coverage in small or large pedigrees. In the past few years  the use of genomic data has expanded greatly. The widespread genotyping of animals empowers breeding via genomic selection [  ] and progress in biological knowledge via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [  ]. The accuracy of genomic selection and the power of GWAS depend on both the number of individuals that have genomic data and the density of genomic data e.g.  [   ]. Thus  the goal is to generate genomic data on as many individuals as possible at the highest density possible with the upper limit being the presence of whole-genome sequence on hundreds of thousands or millions of individuals [  ]. Although the cost of producing whole-genome sequence data for an individual has decreased substantially  it is still prohibitively expensive to obtain high coverage whole-genome sequence data on tens of thousands of individuals. An emerging strategy in breeding populations is to obtain a mix of high and low coverage sequence data on a subset of individuals  and then to propagate that information between related individuals to call whole-genome sequence genotypes for all members of a population  some of which may have only single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotype data []. This strategy exploits the high degree of relatedness and haplotype sharing between individuals in a breeding population  meaning that a haplotype can be inferred at high accuracy by low coverage sequencing of different individuals that share that haplotype. Algorithms for selecting the individuals to sequence in such a context have already been developed [  ]  but a method that could efficiently propagate the sequence information between related individuals is still lacking. Past methods for using mixed coverage sequence data to call  phase  and impute genotypes have primarily exploited linkage disequilibrium (LD)  e.g.  MaCH []  Beagle [  ]. LD-based methods perform well  particularly in human settings where individuals are mostly unrelated and there is limited pedigree data. However  these methods generally do not exploit explicit relationship information when pedigrees are available  but exceptions do exist [  ]. In contrast  pedigree-based methods can have a higher accuracy and lower computational cost than LD-based methods  particularly in populations with closely related individuals and accurate pedigrees across multiple generations e.g.  [  ]. Pedigree-based methods are particularly appealing for mixed coverage sequence data on relatives because they are able to collapse information across the long haplotype segments shared between individuals  their ancestors and their descendants. Single-locus and multi-locus peeling are two pedigree-based methods that model an individual’s haplotypes based on the haplotypes of its parents and offspring and the individual’s genotype data. There is a large body of literature on peeling methods in genetics e.g.  [       ] and related methods in other areas e.g.  [  ]. Since our interest is in efficient methods that could handle whole-genome sequence data in complex multi-generational pedigrees with loops  we focused on approximate (iterative) peeling methods  in particular on the single-locus method of Kerr and Kinghorn [] and the multi-locus method of Meuwissen and Goddard []. In single-locus peeling  all loci are treated independently and so linkage between loci is not exploited. In contrast  multi-locus peeling tracks the linkage between loci allowing for information at one locus to be used at a neighbouring locus  which has a large potential with whole-genome sequence data. Although multi-locus peeling exploits more information and  thus  is more accurate  it is computationally more expensive due the high cost of calculating the segregation probabilities at each locus  and currently it is ill-suited for whole-genome sequence data. In this paper  we present a hybrid peeling method that is scalable to whole-genome sequence data on tens of thousands of individuals. In hybrid peeling  segregation probabilities are calculated at a subset of loci (e.g.  all of the loci on a high-density SNP array)  and then fast single-locus style peeling operations are used at the remaining loci (e.g.  the remaining segregating sites in whole-genome sequence). This approach exploits the benefits of using linkage from multi-locus peeling while still being able to scale to whole-genome sequence data on thousands of animals. In the following  we first present the hybrid peeling method  and then the results of its performance on a synthetic dataset based on a real commercial pig population with 65 000 animals on a single chromosome with 700 000 segregating loci. Peeling is a method for inferring the genotypes and underlying haplotypes of an individual based on their own genotype information and the genotype information of their ancestors and descendants. In this context  we refer to ‘calling an individual’s genotype’ to describe the process of inferring the genotype of an individual based on their own genetic information and the genetic information of their relatives. Furthermore  we use the term ‘phasing’ for determining the parent of origin for each allele at a heterozygous locus. Peeling is computationally intractable when considering whole-genome sequence in the context of large multi-generational pedigrees with loops [      ]. Iterative peeling approximates this problem through a series of peeling up and peeling down operations [    ]. In the following  we refer to iterative peeling simply as peeling. In a peeling up operation  information from an individual’s descendants is used to infer the individual’s genotypes and allele origins. In a peeling down operation  information from an individual’s ancestors is used to infer the individual’s genotypes and allele origins. Repeating these operations propagates genetic information between members of a pedigree. Peeling relies on a model of the transmission of genetic information between a parent and their offspring. Single-locus and multi-locus peeling differ in how they model this transmission. In single-locus peeling  both parental alleles are assumed to be inherited with equal probability at all loci. In multi-locus peeling  it is assumed that there is a high probability that the alleles at nearby loci are inherited jointly from the same parental haplotype. To share information between loci  multi-locus peeling estimates the segregation probabilities at each locus. These probabilities indicate which parental haplotypes were inherited at a given locus. Hybrid peeling is a computationally efficient approximation of multi-locus peeling. Like multi-locus peeling  it uses information from nearby loci to infer which parental haplotype was inherited at a locus. Unlike multi-locus peeling  it estimates segregation probabilities at a subset of loci only  and linearly interpolates segregation probabilities at the remaining loci. For completeness  we describe these peeling operations in detail below. For single-locus peeling  we follow the previous work of Kerr and Kinghorn []  and for multi-locus peeling  we follow the previous work of Meuwissen and Goddard []. Following Kerr and Kinghorn []  in single-locus peeling we estimate the probability of an individual’s genotype at a locus as the product of three terms that represent the information from the genotype of their parents (anterior)  the genotypes of their offspring (posterior)  and their own genomic data (penetrance). For a biallelic locus  we have a set of four possible (phased) genotypes (      )  where the first allele in each pair is inherited from the father and the second allele is inherited from the mother. For brevity  we use the term phased genotype and genotype interchangeably. The probability that individual  has genotype g is: We examine each of these terms separately. The penetrance term gives the conditional probability of the available genomic data  i.e.  SNP array data or sequencing data  given the individual’s genotype. If no information is available  we set the penetrance term to a constant value  i.e.  . If we have SNP array data  we set  if  is consistent with the genotype called by the SNP array  and  otherwise  where  accounts for a small error rate in SNP array genotype data. If we have sequencing data with  sequence reads of the reference allele    and  sequence reads of the alternative allele    then: where  accounts for a small error rate in sequence data. By default  penetrance terms for an individual will not sum to 1  and so must be normalized to sum to 1. The anterior probability captures the information about an individual’s genotype garnered from their parents’ genotypes. If the parents of the individual are unknown  then we use the minor allele frequency    to calculate the anterior probabilities: When the parents of the individual are known  the anterior probabilities are: where  is the joint probability that the mother has phased genotype  and the father has phased genotype  excluding any information from individual . The “” term (a shorthand for “transmission”) is a function that gives the probability that the child inherits genotype  given their parent’s genotypes  i.e.  . Examples of this function when inheriting from a single parent are in Table a. The joint probabilities of the parental genotypes are calculated by combining the anterior and posterior probabilities for both parents except for the information that pertains to individual . This gives: where the value  is calculated as the product over the three lines. The first line calculates the probability of the mother’s genotype    independent of shared children with . The second line calculates the probability of the father’s genotype    independent of shared children with . The third line calculates the probability of both parents’ genotypes based on their shared children except for individual . There are two types of posterior terms. First   is the joint probability of the parents’ genotypes  based on all their shared children. Second   is the probability of a single parent’s genotype based on all of its mates and children. We can calculate  by: which is the product of the probability that a child    inherits genotype   based on its parent’s genotypes  marginalized over the genotypes for   and multiplied across all children. We then calculate  as the product of the  for all of the mates of  marginalized over their possible genotypes: The remaining terms are calculated by removing the individuals that relate to them in the equations: Together the posterior  anterior  and penetrance terms give the probability of an individual’s genotypes (Eq. ). Information from the individual’s siblings and parents is contained in the anterior term. Information from an individual’s children and mates is contained in the posterior term. Information from more distant relatives is included via anterior and posterior terms of the individual’s immediate relatives. An individual’s own genetic information is contained in the penetrance function. When estimating the genotype probabilities for a set of parents in the anterior term  the focal individual’s penetrance and anterior terms are excluded from the calculation (Eq. )  which ensures that information from an individual is included only in the anterior or posterior term but not both. Due to the dependence of the anterior terms and posterior terms on the anterior and posterior terms of other individuals in the population  the order in which they are updated is important and can decrease the overall number of peeling operations that need to be performed. We follow the updating pattern given in []. At the start  we initialize all the posterior terms to a constant value  i.e.  1. Next  we peel down the pedigree from the oldest to the youngest generation  updating the anterior terms and then peel up the pedigree  updating the posterior terms. These peeling operations are repeated until the genotype probabilities for all of the individuals in the population converge  or for a maximum of 20 cycles of peeling. There are two model parameters that need to be estimated  the minor allele frequency    and error rates   and . We found that an easy way to update these is by setting them equal to their observed values after each pair of peeling (up and down) operations. For the minor allele frequency    we average allele dosages for all the founders in the population (i.e.  individuals without known ancestors): where the sum is over each of the  founders and  gives the probability that individual  has genotype  based on the current estimates (Eq. ). For the error rate  we calculate the proportion of errors at each locus  i.e.  the probability that an individual’s true genotype and observed genotype do not match. For array data  we calculate: where  is an indicator function which is 1 if the observed genotype (a value of 0  1  or 2) disagrees with the estimated underlying genotype  and 0 if they agree. For sequence data  we estimated the error rate based on the number of incorrect reads found for homozygous loci  ignoring heterozygous loci: In the numerator  we estimate the number of errors for a given individual. The term  gives the number of reads for the alternative allele for individual   times the probability that individual  is homozygous for the reference allele. The denominator is the total number of reads on a given individual multiplied by the probability that the individual is either homozygous for the reference allele or homozygous for the alternative allele. We tested either a single error rate for all loci or a locus-specific error rate and found that the locus-specific error rate leads to a slight increase in accuracy and  thus  we used a locus-specific error rate for  and . Multi-locus peeling extends single-locus peeling by modifying the transmission function such that it is sensitive to which parental haplotype was inherited at a locus. In single-locus peeling  we assume that each parental haplotype is inherited with equal probability  and that the alleles at neighbouring loci are inherited independently  but this is not the case due to the small number of recombinations per chromosome causing children to inherit parental haplotypes in large blocks. This means that if we can identify which parental haplotype was inherited at one locus  we also know which haplotype was likely inherited at nearby loci. In the context of the peeling operations  if we know which haplotype was inherited  we can modify the peeling operations so that only the alleles from that haplotype will be transmitted  as demonstrated in Table b. Uncertainty about which haplotype is inherited can be incorporated in the model by marginalizing over possible inherited haplotypes. More formally  we track the set of inherited haplotypes in terms of a segregation probability  which gives the probability that a child inherits one of the four possible pairs of parental haplotypes  ; relating to whether the father (first allele) or the mother (second allele) transmits their paternal () or maternal () haplotype at a locus. We can then build the transmission function by marginalizing over segregation states: where  is the probability that individual  has segregation  at locus .  is the probability that the child inherits genotype  given its paternal genotypes and their segregation (see Table b for an example). To perform peeling  we substitute the transmission function in Eqs.     and  with the transmission function in Eq. . The segregation probabilities at each locus are calculated via the forward–backward algorithm []. In the algorithm  we calculate the segregation probabilities from three terms: where e.g.  In Eq. ()  the first and the last terms   and   provide information about the segregation probabilities at locus  based on the segregation at the locus immediately before  and immediately after. In Eq. ()  we explicitly marginalize over the segregation probabilities at loci <U+2009>-<U+2009>1 (or <U+2009>+<U+2009>1)  using information only from the markers before (or after) . We set the loci-to-loci transmission function to: where  is the number of differences in the segregation (up to 2) between  and   and  is recombination rate  i.e.  . The calculation of segregation probabilities differs from that of Meuwissen and Goddard []  since here  we infer the segregation probabilities for both parents simultaneously  whereas Meuwissen and Goddard [] infer the segregation probabilities for each parent separately (and assume that the probabilities are independent of each other). The middle term    gives estimates for the segregation probabilities based on the information at locus   as follows: The first line is the probability of the individual’s genotype  the second is the probability of the mother’s genotype  the third is the probability of the father’s genotype  and the fourth is the joint probability of the parents’ genotype. It is worth noting that none of the posterior or anterior terms in Eq. () rely on . The transmission term for an individual governs which alleles an individual is likely to have inherited from their parents  and is a key part of the anterior term for the focal individual   and the posterior term for their parents  . The anterior term is excluded from Eq. ()  as is the contribution of individual  to the joint posterior term of their parents. Multi-locus peeling is performed as a combination of forward–backward operations over loci and up-down operations over individuals. Forward–backward operations update segregation probabilities between loci for each individual  while up-down operations update anterior and posterior terms and genotype probabilities for each individual. At the end of each pass  we update the minor allele frequency    error rates   and   and recombination rate   The minor allele frequency and error rates are updated as in single-locus peeling. The recombination rate is updated by estimating the number of recombinations that occurred between loci by examining the difference between the segregation estimates at adjacent loci: Similar to the error rate  we found that using a locus-specific recombination rate slightly increased accuracy  and thus  we used a locus-specific recombination rate. Pilot simulations found that the genotype probabilities converged at around 10 to 20 cycles in large multi-generational livestock pedigrees with 60 000+ members  and thus we ran the algorithm for a fixed number of 20 cycles. Hybrid peeling is a computationally efficient approximation to multi-locus peeling. In a preliminary analysis  we found that the primary computational cost of multi-locus peeling stemmed from updating the segregation probabilities  Eq. (). When evaluating many loci on a chromosome  we expect that the segregation probabilities at nearby loci to be nearly equal. Because of this  it should be possible to evaluate the segregation probabilities at a subset of loci  and interpolate segregation probabilities at the remaining loci. Then  these estimates can be used to create a new transmission function for peeling operations. More formally  we divided the set of loci into two sets  A and B  with the size of A being much smaller than B  |A|<U+2009><U+2009>|B|  e.g.  A are the loci on a high-density SNP array and B is the entire set of segregating loci obtained from whole-genome sequencing. We performed multi-locus peeling on the loci in A to calculate segregation probabilities and then single-locus peeling on the loci in B using Eq. () as the transmission function with interpolated segregation probabilities: where  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 are the loci in the set A that flank locus   and  is the proportional distance between locus  and locus : The distance can be calculated in number of base pairs  centiMorgans  or number of intermediary loci. The exact measure of distance should only have a minimal impact on performance: if a sufficiently large number of loci is used in set A then adjacent segregation probabilities should be nearly equal  i.e.   leading Eq. () to reduce to  and no longer depend on the distance metric used. The aim of the hybrid technique is to make multi-locus peeling more computationally tractable when applying it to large pedigrees. We evaluated the performance of this algorithm on a synthetic dataset. We examined the performance of hybrid peeling for calling  phasing  and imputing sequence data of different coverages in pedigrees. To perform these analyses  we simulated genomes for 65 000 animals using a multi-generational pedigree derived from a real commercial pig breeding line. We assumed that some animals had high-density or low-density SNP array genotypes from routine genomic selection. In addition  we generated mixed coverage sequence data for a subset of focal animals. Then  we carried out three sets of analyses. First  we analysed the performance of hybrid peeling for calling and phasing in disconnected families  these are subsets of the pedigree  which contained only a focal animal and its parents and grandparents. Second  we analysed the performance of hybrid peeling for calling and phasing in the context of the full general pedigree. Third  we analysed the performance of hybrid peeling for whole-genome sequence imputation. In the following  we describe in detail how we simulated and analysed the data. Genomes were generated using the Markovian Coalescent Simulator (MaCS) [] and AlphaSim []. We generated 1000 base haplotypes for each of 10 chromosomes  assuming a chromosome length of 10 base pairs  a per site mutation rate of 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  a between-site recombination rate of 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  and an effective population size () that varied over time in accordance with estimates for a livestock population []. The resulting haplotypes had about 700 000 segregating loci per chromosome. On each of the chromosomes  we designated 2000 evenly distributed loci as markers on a high-density SNP array and a subset of 500 as markers on a low-density SNP array. We used AlphaSim to drop the base haplotypes through a multi-generational pedigree of 65 000 animals from a real commercial pig breeding line. We assigned SNP array data to animals  in line with routine genotyping for genomic selection in the population; 45 000 animals were genotyped with the high-density SNP array  10 000 animals were genotyped with the low-density SNP array  and 10 000 animals were not genotyped. We generated sequence data  in line with the strategies implemented in the population. The goal was to use roughly $300 000 worth of sequencing resources to sequence and impute the entire population. First  the top 475 sires (all sires with more than 25 progeny) were sequenced at 2x<U+2009>coverage. Second  AlphaSeqOpt [] was used to identify focal animals and their parents and grandparents (211 in total) to be sequenced and the coverages that they should be sequenced at. In AlphaSeqOpt  focal individuals are individuals who carry the most frequent haplotypes in the population. Once focal individuals are selected  then AlphaSeqOpt distributes a fixed sequencing budget among the focal individuals and their relatives to maximise the proportion of haplotypes in the population that are sequenced and could be subsequently phased with high accuracy using heuristics. AlphaSeqOpt was run using the high-density SNP array data on all chromosomes with an option to assign an individual sequencing coverage of either 1x  2x  15x  or 30x  and a total budget of $71 000. Third  the top 50 dams (based on the number of progeny and grand-progeny with and without a sequenced sire) were sequenced at 2x and the next 450 dams were sequenced at 1x. Finally  AlphaSeqOpt2 [] was used to identify 800 individuals to be sequenced at 1x  to top-up the accumulated coverage of common haplotypes to 10x. In total  we generated sequenced data for 1912 animals at a range of coverages for a cost of $289 312. We partitioned this data into three sets: (1) the  identified with AlphaSeqOpt  (2) the  which also included the top 475 sires  and (3)   i.e. all the sequenced animals. A breakdown of the total cost and sequencing coverage by these sets is in Table . We assumed that the cost of obtaining a DNA library for an individual was $39 and the cost of sequencing that library for an individual at 1x was $68  2x was $136  15x was $408  and 30x was $816. The costs were assumed to be non-linear to reflect current industry costs. Sequence data were simulated by sampling sequencing reads for the 700 000 segregating loci on chromosome 10. The number of reads was generated using a Poisson-Gamma distribution  which allowed the number of sequence reads per locus to vary along the genome and between individuals []. First  a sequenceability () of each of the 700 000 loci along the genome was sampled from a gamma distribution  with shape and scale parameters respectively equal to  and . Second  the number of reads () per individual  at locus  was sampled from a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to   where  was the targeted coverage for individual . Third  sequencing reads were generated by randomly sampling alleles from the two gametes of individual  at locus   accounting for a sequencing error (). We tested the ability of hybrid peeling to call genotypes and phase alleles in sequenced individuals using information from their parents and grandparents. For this  we selected 10 disconnected families (consisting of a focal individual and its parents and grandparents) from the full pedigree  and analysed the effect of sequencing coverage on our ability to call and phase the individual’s genotypes. To perform this  we ran the hybrid peeling when the focal individual was sequenced at 1x  2x  5x  15x  or 30x coverage  and when its parents or grandparents were sequenced at 0x  1x  2x  5x  15x  or 30x coverage. We generated data for each of these scenarios separately. We assumed that all the parents or all the grandparents were sequenced at the same coverage  and that all family members had high-density SNP array data. To call genotypes and phase alleles  we extracted the phased genotype probabilities generated by hybrid peeling and made a call if the probability of a genotype was higher than a pre-defined threshold. For all analyses  we used a probability threshold of 0.98. Scenarios were compared on the percentage of called genotypes (genotype yield) and phased alleles (phase yield). Next  we tested the ability of hybrid peeling to call genotypes and phase alleles in sequenced individuals using information from the full pedigree. To perform this  we ran hybrid peeling twice. First  we ran it separately for each disconnected family that consisted of an individual  its parents  and grandparents  with (potentially missing or low coverage) SNP array and sequence data. Second  we ran it with SNP array and sequence data on all individuals in the pedigree. The sequencing coverage for each individual was the same as its coverage in the  condition (see the Data subsection). We compared the genotype and phase yield between runs and compared the correlation between individual’s genotype dosages and the true genotypes (genotype accuracy) and correlation between individual’s allele dosages and the true alleles (phase accuracy) between runs. Last  we tested the ability of hybrid peeling to impute whole-genome sequence for non-sequenced individuals in the full pedigree. We ran hybrid peeling on all the individuals in the full pedigree. The multi-locus step used the high-density SNP array loci to estimate segregation probabilities. Then  hybrid peeling was run on the sequence data using all available sequence and SNP array data. Hybrid peeling was run three times  using either the sequence data from the     or  conditions. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between an individual’s imputed genotype dosages and the true genotypes. This measure of imputation accuracy has been reported to give imputation accuracies that are higher than the resulting genomic prediction accuracy []. Correcting for allele frequency is often recommended to improve the relationship between imputation accuracy and genomic prediction accuracy  particularly in the context of population-based imputation algorithms (e.g.  []) where the default prediction for an individual’s allele is the major allele. The advantage of correcting for allele frequency in the context of pedigree-based imputation is less clear and may result in imputation accuracies that are still inflated. This is compounded by the fact that allele frequency is not clearly defined for a structured population  and by itself has limited impact on the imputed genotypes of a specific individual (which depends primarily on the frequency of the allele in the parents and other close relatives). Because of this  we did not correct allele frequency in this study  but we wish to highlight the fact that the imputation accuracies obtained here may not directly reflect the value of the genetic data for downstream analyses (e.g.  genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) or GWAS). To provide a comparison to hybrid peeling  we also tested findhap v4 []  a combined pedigree and LD-based imputation algorithm that can impute low to medium coverage sequence data. We ran findhap using a maximum segment length of 10 000  minimum segment length of 1000  and sequencing error rate of 0.01. Simulated genotype and sequence data are available from the authors upon request. To perform hybrid peeling  we used the software package AlphaPeel  which is available from the AlphaGenes website (). The code for generating simulated sequence data from genotype data is available from the authors on request. Overall  we found that hybrid peeling had a high yield and accuracy for calling genotypes and phasing alleles. It also had a high accuracy for imputing whole-genome sequence data to non-sequenced individuals. We found that hybrid peeling yielded a high percentage and accuracy of called genotypes and phased alleles even with low coverage sequencing. The yields in each simulation are in Fig. . Genotype and phase yield with varying sequence coverage of the focal individual and its parents and grandparents.    Give the percentage of called genotypes when varying  the sequence coverage of parents and  grandparents.    Give the percentage of phased alleles when varying  the sequence coverage of parents and  grandparents. In    the sequence coverage of grandparents was 0x. In    the sequence coverage of parents was kept constant at 30x. In all four panels  the accuracy of calling genotypes and phasing alleles was higher than 0.98. Error bars represent plus and minus one standard error based on ten replications The primary determinant for the percentage of called genotypes was the individual’s own degree of sequencing coverage. If neither the parents nor the grandparents of an individual were sequenced  and if the individual was sequenced at 1x  the percentage of called genotypes was 0.6%  and increased to 5% at 2x  39% at 5x  76% at 10x  and 98% at 30x. These values greatly increased if the parents were sequenced at high coverage. If the individual’s parents were both sequenced at 30x  then the percentage of called genotypes was 56% at 1x  61% at 2  75% at 5x  90% at 10x  and 99% at 30x. Adding additional coverage on grandparents increased the accuracy of called genotypes even if the parents had 30x coverage. If both the parents and the grandparents had 30x coverage then the percentage of called genotypes reached 88% at 1x  90% at 2x  94% at 5x  97% at 10x  and 99% at 30x. In all cases  the percentage of correctly called genotypes was higher than 0.995 (median 0.999). We obtained a similar pattern of results when evaluating phasing yield. In this case  although an individual’s own sequencing coverage was an important determinant for phasing yield  high coverage on both the parents and the grandparents was needed to phase the alleles. If neither the parents nor the grandparents of an individual were sequenced  then phasing yield was 0.7% at 1x  6% at 2x  35% at 5x  59% at 10x  and 70% at 30x. The low phasing yield at 30x is due to the inability to phase heterozygous loci without information from relatives. Sequencing the parents at high coverage substantially increased phasing yield  and continued to do so even if the individual was sequenced at high coverage. If the parents of the individual were sequenced at 30x  then phasing yield was 72% at 1x  74% at 2x  82% at 5x  89% at 10x and 94% at 30x. If both the individual’s parents and grandparents were sequenced at 30x  then phasing yield increased to 94% at 1x  95% at 2x  96% at 5x  98% at 10x  and 99% and 30x. In all cases  the percentage of correctly phased alleles was higher than 0.989 (median 0.999). We examined the effect of using all sequence data from the full pedigree on percentage of called genotypes and phasing yield and accuracy of sequenced individuals. The gains in yield and accuracy in comparison to using data from disconnected families are plotted in Fig. . We found that including the full pedigree greatly increased both percentage of called genotypes and phasing yield and accuracy. The gains were smaller for high coverage individuals compared to low coverage individuals. For example  phase accuracy increased on average from 0.85 to 0.97 for 30x individuals  but increased on average from 0.67 to 0.89 for 1x individuals. Genotype  and phase yield and accuracy when hybrid peeling is run on a series of disconnected families containing a focal individual and its parents and grandparents  or as part of the full general pedigree.    Compare the performance of calling genotypes  measured either with  the genotype yield or  the correlation between individual’s genotype dosages and the true genotypes (accuracy).    Compare the performance of phasing alleles  measured either with  the phase yield  or  the correlation between an individual’s allele dosages and the true alleles (accuracy) The gains in phasing accuracy were also not equal for all individuals in the pedigree; some individuals had only a small gain in accuracy  whereas others had a large gain in accuracy. This difference was particularly pronounced for individuals sequenced at 1x where the mean phasing yield increased from 0.11 to 0.67  but the standard deviation of the phasing yield increased from 0.13 to 0.28. If all individuals were influenced equally by including the full pedigree  we should expect an increase in mean but not a corresponding increase in standard deviation. The increased variability is a consequence of the different sequencing coverages on relatives who are outside of the immediate family. We found that the amount of sequencing coverage on immediate relatives (parents and grandparents) is a good predictor of the phase accuracy of individuals sequenced at 1x in the disconnected family (Pearson correlation r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.37)  but is a weak predictor for the phase accuracy of those individuals in the full pedigree (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13). In contrast  adding the sequencing coverage on all ancestors increased the ability to predict accuracy when assessing the phase accuracy in the full pedigree (r increased from 0.13 to 0.42)  compared to when assessing the phase accuracy in the disconnected families  (r increased from 0.37 to 0.55). The higher overall r for disconnected families is likely due to performance in a disconnected family being easier to estimate because of the limited interaction between coverage levels for distant ancestors. We found a similar pattern of results for genotype accuracy and the percentage of called genotypes and phasing yield. Finally  we analysed the ability of hybrid peeling to impute whole-genome sequence data to all non-sequenced individuals in the pedigree. Figure  plots the imputation accuracy for every individual as a function of their position in their pedigree. In Table   we present the median imputation accuracy stratified by the sequencing sets used and the individual’s SNP array genotype status. Overall  we imputed highly accurate genotype dosages across the entire pedigree using the  sequencing set  with an accuracy of 0.987 for individuals with high-density SNP array data  0.967 for individuals with low-density SNP array data  and 0.881 for non-genotyped individuals. We observed a qualitative difference in imputation accuracy in older individuals. Because of this  we stratified the results for the first quintile (first 12 919 individuals) and the entire pedigree.  Individual imputation accuracy as a function of birth order. The lines show the rolling average for 1000 individuals when the  individuals (green)  the   or the  individuals (red) were used for imputation with AlphaPeel. The grey dots show accuracy for each individual when the  individuals were used for imputation with AlphaPeel. The black line shows the rolling average for 1000 individuals from findhap when run with the  individuals. The vertical dotted line represents the break between the first quintile of individuals and the remaining four quintiles of individuals We observed three trends in imputation accuracy. First  individuals in the first quintile had on average a lower imputation accuracy then the rest of the population. When we used the  sequencing set  the imputation accuracy for the first quintile was 0.908  compared to the average imputation accuracy of 0.970. This decrease in imputation accuracy is due to the lower average sequencing coverage of ancestors for individuals in the first quintile (the average coverage summed across all ancestors in the first quintile was 83x compared to the population average of 308x) and the smaller number of individuals with high-density SNP array data (0.2% in the first quintile compared to the population average of 70%). Second  increasing the amount of sequencing resources increased accuracy for all individuals in the population. The largest contribution came from using focal individuals and their parents and grandparents  which yielded an imputation accuracy of 0.945. Furthermore  adding low coverage sequence data of top sires increased imputation accuracy to 0.963. Finally  adding sequence data of top dams and of the remaining low coverage individuals increased imputation accuracy only to 0.970  but had a proportionally larger influence on individuals in the first quintile where imputation accuracy increased from 0.885 to 0.908. This effect is likely because 78% of the top dams and top-up individuals came from the first quintile. Third  imputation accuracy for an individual depended on its SNP array genotype status. A comparison of the imputation accuracies depending on their SNP array density is in Table . Overall  the difference between having high-density or low-density SNP array data tended to be small  whereas the difference between having SNP array data or not tended to be larger  although this difference decreased in the later generations. For the final four quintiles  the difference between having high-density or low-density SNP array data was negligible (both had an accuracy higher than 0.987)  and the difference between having SNP array data or not was smaller than in the first quintile (0.988 vs. 0.959). In comparison  in the first quintile the difference between having high-density or low-density SNP array data was relatively larger (0.983 vs. 0.951) and the difference between having SNP array data or not was much larger (0.951 vs. 0.868). Compared to findhap  hybrid peeling consistently yielded a higher accuracy  both in the first quintile  but also in the remaining four quintiles. Hybrid peeling outperforms findhap on individuals genotyped at high density (0.987 vs. 0.958)  low density (0.967 vs. 0.892)  and non-genotyped individuals (0.881 vs. 0.702). Similar to hybrid peeling  the performance of findhap was substantially lower in the first quintile  compared to the final four quintiles (mean of 0.777 vs. 0.915)  but also was low in some regions  likely due to the presence of a large number of low-density or non-genotyped individuals clustered in certain portions of the pedigree. Computational requirements were much less for hybrid peeling than for multi-locus peeling. We compared the time necessary for multi-locus peeling to process the high-density SNP array with 2000 markers used as an initial step of hybrid peeling to the time necessary for hybrid peeling to process the remaining sequence with 700 000 segregating loci when using the  sequencing set. We found that the initial multi-locus peeling step took 823 min and 41 GB of memory to process 2000 SNPs on 64 598 individuals  which translates to 6.3 h per 1000 individuals per 1000 loci. The hybrid peeling step was split across 1000 jobs of 700 SNPs each. Each job took on average 40 min and 2.3 GB of memory  which translates to 53.5 min per 1000 individuals per 1000 loci and a total of 40 344 min (roughly 28 core-days). The total computation time for findhap was 5.14 h and it required 101 GB of memory. In this paper  we present a hybrid peeling method for calling  phasing  and imputing sequence data of any coverage in large pedigrees. This method is computationally efficient and enables the benefits of multi-locus peeling to be realised for datasets with tens of thousands of individuals on tens of millions of segregating variants. We evaluated the performance of hybrid peeling for calling and phasing sequence data in a livestock population and for imputing that sequence data to the non-sequenced individuals in the population. Hybrid peeling successfully used the pedigree to propagate information between relatives to call genotypes and phase alleles for individuals with low and high sequencing coverage. Furthermore  calling and phasing these individuals were most effective when the full pedigree was used. Hybrid peeling was also able to impute whole-genome sequence information to 65 000 animals with an accuracy higher than 0.98. We discuss these results in more detail below. We found that hybrid peeling effectively used pedigree information to call genotypes and phase alleles in a population of sequenced individuals. When using hybrid peeling  sequence data from an individual’s parents and grandparents increased the yield and accuracy of called genotypes and the yield and accuracy of phased alleles compared to just using an individual’s own sequence data. We also found that further increases could be gained by using more distant relatives. The benefits of using the full pedigree were most apparent for individuals that had low coverage sequencing data (1x and 2x)  for which in some cases the total genotype yield could rise from 0.1 based on the individuals own sequence data to over 0.9 using the sequence data from the entire pedigree. These results suggest that hybrid peeling could be used to increase the yield of calling and phasing sequence data in pedigrees. The application of hybrid peeling is not limited to individuals with whole-genome sequence data  but may also be useful when handling data that are generated through genotyping via a reduced-representation sequencing (e.g.  RAD-seq [] or genotyping-by-sequencing [  ]). In addition to increasing genotype yield  hybrid peeling also phases many alleles. An individual’s own sequence data limits the number of its alleles that can be phased to just homozygous loci. In contrast  the number of phased heterozygous loci greatly increased with higher sequencing coverage of the individual’s parents  grandparents  or even more distant relatives. The ability to phase alleles accurately will be important for downstream imputation and other analyses. Pedigree-based methods  such as hybrid peeling offer one route for obtaining this information. There are alternative methods that are based on hidden Markov models  e.g.  Beagle []. These methods phase an individual’s alleles by finding the shared chromosome segments between the individual and its distant relatives. However  currently these methods do not scale well for performing whole-genome sequence phasing and imputation for tens of thousands of individuals []  making them impractical for many livestock settings. The power of hybrid peeling comes from its ability to combine sequence data across many related individuals. Hybrid peeling identifies shared chromosome segments between parents and their progeny and propagates that information to all the individuals who share those segments. In many cases  particularly with low coverage sequence data  it is not possible to clearly identify shared chromosome segments. Hybrid peeling handles those cases by marginalizing over the possible segregation probabilities  allowing it to exploit even low coverage sequence data over many generations. When analysing the increase in performance between phasing 1x individuals in the case of disconnected families versus the case of the full pedigree  we found that the most reliable indicator of phasing accuracy was the total amount of sequencing coverage for all the individual’s ancestors  and not the amount of sequencing coverage on the individual’s parents and grandparents  suggesting that hybrid peeling is able to use even distant relatives to phase individuals. The heavy reliance of pedigree-based imputation is both a boon and a curse for hybrid peeling. As we discuss above  using pedigree information can lead to high accuracy  high yield genotype calling and phasing for low coverage individuals. The usefulness of this technique relies on the availability of multi-generational pedigree information. Although there is some benefit in using sequence information on an individual’s parents and grandparents  the primary benefit comes from aggregating sequencing information across many generations. Multi-generational pedigree information is generally routinely available in commercial livestock populations  but may not be available for human  wild animal  and plant populations. When pedigree information is unavailable  the performance of hybrid peeling may be less than that of non-pedigree based imputation methods that rely on LD to call and phase sequence data []. There may be some benefit in combining linkage-based information with pedigree-based information for calling and phasing individuals in populations with shallow pedigrees where linkage information between disconnected populations can be exploited. Existing methods have already considered combining linkage-based information in the context of multi-locus peeling []  and for using pedigree-based information in the context of linkage disequilibrium based calling and phasing algorithms [  ]. Future work is needed to analyse the optimal integration of hybrid peeling with linkage-based methods for use in low-depth pedigrees. We found that hybrid peeling could effectively use mixed coverage sequence data to impute whole-genome sequence into the non-sequenced individuals in the pedigree. For the majority of individuals  we obtained an imputation accuracy of 0.98. Imputation accuracy was lower at the beginning than at the end of the pedigree due to the low ancestral sequencing coverage and the large number of individuals genotyped with low-density SNP arrays early in the pedigree. This trend identifies a difficulty that many pedigree-based imputation methods face  i.e.  it is generally easier to impute children from their parents then it is to impute parents from their children. This difficulty arises from the fact that it is often challenging to phase parents based on their children’s genotype since it requires finding patterns of shared inheritance across multiple offspring  and generally requires many children []. In contrast  it is relatively easy to phase a child’s genotype based on its parents’ genotypes. One of the more surprising results was the high accuracy observed for non-genotyped individuals. Restricted to the last four quintiles of individuals in the pedigree  non-genotyped individuals had an imputation accuracy of 0.959  which is only slightly less than the 0.988 accuracy for individuals that had high-density SNP array data. The only information that was available for hybrid peeling for non-genotyped individuals was their position in the pedigree and the list of parents  mates  and offspring. Using this information  hybrid peeling was able to accurately reconstruct inheritance of chromosomes across generations  and impute these individuals up to whole-genome sequence. The ability of hybrid peeling to impute non-genotyped pedigree members highlights the difference between pedigree- and LD-based methods such as Beagle []  Impute2 []  or MaCH []  which require that all individuals are genotyped with  at least  a low-density SNP array. We also noted significant computational gains of hybrid peeling compared to the multi-locus peeling of Meuwissen and Goddard []. Both methods scale linearly with the number of individuals and number of loci. However  compared to full multi-locus peeling  we found that hybrid peeling ran about 6 times faster and used less memory than full multi-locus peeling. The increased speed stems from not having to update the segregation probabilities at each locus. The decreased memory stems from being able to run each locus independently  allowing us to deallocate the memory for variables associated with the previous allele when working on the next allele. The resulting memory requirements of hybrid peeling scale linearly with the number of individuals O(N)  while multi-locus peeling memory requirements scale linearly both with the number of individuals and number of loci O(NL). The gains in speed and memory also lead to practical gains in implementing hybrid peeling. Because each locus is independent of other loci given the segregation probabilities  hybrid peeling is trivial to parallelize. Furthermore  the lower memory requirement makes it possible to do this parallelization on even small machines. Parallelisation meant that although overall imputation time for 700 000 segregating loci on 64 598 individuals took 28 days of CPU time  we were able to run it on a computing cluster in under 24 h of real time. This paper presents hybrid peeling  a computationally tractable multi-locus peeling algorithm for whole-genome sequence data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of hybrid peeling in calling  phasing  and imputing whole-genome sequence in a large livestock population. We found that hybrid peeling could effectively use multiple generations of variable coverage sequence data to increase easily the yield and accuracy of called genotypes and phased alleles compared to using an individual’s own sequence data. We also found that hybrid peeling could accurately impute whole-genome sequence into non-sequenced individuals. We implemented a version of this method in the software package AlphaPeel  which is available from the AlphaGenes website (). Hybrid peeling has the potential to open the door to the routine utilization of whole-genome sequence in large pedigreed populations  increasing the accuracy of genomic prediction and the power to detect quantitative trait loci.

Genomic evaluation improves the ability to predict future performance relative to traditional BLUP and will allow more accurate identification of genetically superior individuals within catfish families. Catfish farming is the largest aquaculture segment in the US  accounting for approximately 50% of US food-fish production []. The US catfish industry is based on the production of channel catfish () and the hybrid between the channel and blue catfish (). To provide a centralized source for US catfish production research  the USDA-ARS Warmwater Aquaculture Research Unit (WARU) was established in Stoneville  MS. As part of its mission to improve catfish production efficiency  the WARU has conducted a channel catfish breeding program since 2006  primarily selecting fish for increased growth and carcass yield. Traditional evaluation using pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) has been applied since the beginning of the breeding program at WARU. To investigate the potential for implementing genomic selection in the WARU catfish breeding program  animals were genotyped using a 57 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Dense markers are used as an extra source of information to estimate breeding values [] in breeding programs for several livestock species because of the potential increase in accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV). Another advantage of genomic selection  which is particularly important to aquaculture breeding  is the ability to exploit within-family genetic variation for animals that do not have records []. One of the methods available for genomic evaluation is single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) []. This method combines phenotypes  pedigree  and genotypes  and potentially gives more accurate and less biased genomic EBV (GEBV) than multistep methods []. In ssGBLUP  the relationship matrix is a combination of pedigree and genomic relationships [  ]; therefore  information on all animals can be used in the evaluation  regardless of genotyping status. The accuracy of genomic evaluation depends on several factors including linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL)  effective population size ()  and the relationship among individuals in training and validation data [  ]. Thus  investigating the  and the extent of LD can give clues about how much genetic gain can be obtained by adopting genomic selection  how many animals should be genotyped  and potentially  how many SNPs should be included in the marker panel. The possibilities of using lower density SNP chips to reduce costs and promote adoption of genomic selection  and searching for individual SNPs explaining major portions of variance should also be explored. If major SNPs explain a reasonable proportion of the genetic variance observed for a trait  selection based on a limited number of SNPs can be performed. The first objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of implementing genomic evaluation in US channel catfish by using ssGBLUP. The second objective was to determine the presence of potential regions in the genome that contain SNPs with major effects on harvest weight and residual carcass weight (i.e. carcass weight adjusted for harvest weight). Data from the USDA-ARS Warmwater Aquaculture Research Unit (WARU) were available for this study. Harvest weight and carcass weight (i.e.  the weight of a fish with intact skin  but removed head and viscera) were recorded from 2008 to 2015  with a total of 27 160 and 6020 records  respectively  and pedigree information was available for 36 365 fish. Among those  27 883 had either phenotypes/genotypes or were related to phenotyped/genotyped fish. This population constitutes the Delta Select strain that was developed based on 10 to 13 egg-masses collected from eight commercial catfish farms in the spring of 2006 (total<U+2009>=<U+2009>97 egg masses). Each egg-mass was assumed to be a single full-sib family and families were assumed to be unrelated to each other. Each egg-mass was hatched in a separate hatching tank  fry were reared in separate full-sib family tanks until the fingerling stage when ~<U+2009>50 fish per family were tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) and stocked communally in earthen ponds where they were grown until the fall of 2007. At harvest  gender and weight of all fish were recorded  and an average of seven males and six females were randomly selected from each full-sib family and kept as broodfish. In addition to these fish  mature fish were obtained from two additional farms (40 males and 39 females from one farm  and 20 males and 59 females from the other farm). The broodfish from the base population were allowed to mate at random until 2 and 3 years old  and offspring represent the 2008 and 2009 year-class. Parentage was determined by genotyping fish for 16 microsatellites []. In total  181 and 198 families were produced in 2008 and 2009  respectively. The families were reared separately until tagging (about 280 days old). Approximately 30 fish per family were tagged and reared communally in earthen pounds. Harvest weight was recorded when the animals were about 16 months old and a month later  approximately seven fish per family were processed for carcass weight recording. Variance components and EBV were estimated and broodfish were selected using an index  which was the average standardized EBV for harvest weight and residual carcass weight. This approach was used to equalize selection emphasis on each trait. The fish selected from the 2008 and 2009 year-class (first generation of selection) were spawned in ponds in 2011 and 2012 as 2-  3- and 4-year old fish. Performances of the 2011 and 2012 year-class progeny reflect effects of one generation of selection. Progeny from the 2011 and 2012 year-classes were evaluated and selected on the same index  spawned in ponds in 2014 and 2015 as 2-  3- and 4-year old. Progeny from the 2014 and 2015 year-class were evaluated as described previously  and their performance reflects effects of the second generation of selection. Approximately 10% of the harvested fish from each year-class were kept as broodfish and no more than 10% of selected broodfish were from a single full-sib family to limit inbreeding. From 110 to 198 full-sib families were evaluated for each year-class and 954 and 752 full-sib families were evaluated for harvest weight and residual carcass weight  respectively. Broodfish were stocked in March of each spawning year into 0.04 to 0.1 ha earthen ponds at a rate of 800 to 1000 kg per ha and stockings were designed to prevent mating among full-sibs. Male to female ratios in brood ponds ranged from 1:1 to 1:2. In early April  weighted plastic ‘spawning-cans’ were placed in ponds to provide spawning sites  and cans were inspected for the presence of egg-masses two or three times a week. Egg-masses were collected from ponds and transported to the hatchery. Fry were reared in separate full-sib tanks until the fingerling stage at which point they were tagged and stocked communally in earthen ponds and fed daily. Appropriate commercial catfish diets were provided and proper water quality was maintained throughout the year. Genomic DNA from 49 founders of the Delta Select strain (described above) was sequenced with 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>150 bp reads on the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) to obtain approximately 5× genome coverage per individual (25–40 million read pairs per individual). Paired sequences were aligned to the reference genome [] using BWA-MEM [] and variants were identified using the Genome Analysis ToolKit []. The GATK best practices workflow was used to identify SNPs and indels in individuals (HaplotypeCaller) and then jointly across the population (GenotypeGVCFs). The analysis produced more than 15 million raw variants (SNPs plus indels) and more than 12 million raw SNPs. Filtering for strand bias  map quality  and depth of coverage ( mean<U+2009>+<U+2009>2 standard deviations) reduced the number of high-quality putative SNPs to 7 445 905. Further filtration to identify SNPs that were positioned at least 50 bp from another SNP or indel and with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05 reduced the number of candidate SNPs to 1 661 221. An Axiom custom screening array (ThermoFisher Scientific  Waltham  MA) was produced using 660 000 SNPs  and 162 channel catfish were genotyped to validate the selected SNPs. Six doubled haploid (homozygous) catfish were also included to identify false heterozygosity at loci within genomic repeats. A total of 489 390 loci were called as polymorphic  high resolution loci on the array  and 340 737 loci were uniquely located on the catfish genome assembly. After the removal of 17 635 loci that demonstrated heterozygosity in the doubled haploids  323 102 converted SNPs were available. A custom python script (Guangtu Gao  personal communication) was used to select SNPs that were evenly distributed across each of the 29 chromosomes. A new custom Axiom genotyping array was produced  which contained 57 354 SNPs with an average distance between markers of 13.3 kb. The final genotype data included 2911 animals  each genotyped at 54 837 SNPs after quality control. The SNPs excluded in the quality control had a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05  were monomorphic or had a call rate lower than 90%. Genotyped animals were excluded if the call rate was lower than 90% (i.e.  10% of the genotypes were missing). Among the animals that passed the quality control  2826 had records on harvest weight and 969 on carcass weight. The distribution of genotypes and phenotypes based on year-class is in Table . Single-trait animal models were used for harvest weight and residual carcass weight. For harvest weight  the model was: where  is a vector of harvest weight;  is a vector of fixed effect of year-sex-pond interaction  and age (ranging from 391 to 620 days) as a linear covariable nested within sex;  is a vector of additive direct genetic effect;  is a vector of common environmental effect  which accounts for the fact that full-sibs from the same spawn were raised in the same tank until they reach an age and weight suitable for tagging (average tagging weight of 119.3 g and average tagging age of 271 days);  is the vector of residuals;     and  are incidence matrices for the effects contained in     and   respectively. For residual carcass weight  the model was: where  is a vector of carcass weight;  is a vector of linear covariables for body weight nested within year-sex interaction;  is a vector of fixed effect of year-sex-pond interaction;     and  are described above;  and  are incidence matrices for the effects contained in  and . The term residual carcass weight arose from the fact that adjusting carcass weight to a common body weight allows identification of fish that have a higher proportion of whole weight as saleable carcass. The idea is similar to the residual feed intake which is widely used in livestock breeding. Traditional BLUP and ssGBLUP analyses were performed using the BLUPF90 family of programs []. In the mixed model equations for ssGBLUP  the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix () is replaced by  []  the realized relationship matrix that combines pedigree and genomic relationships: where  is the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix and  is the inverse pedigree relationship matrix for genotyped animals. The  matrix was constructed as in VanRaden []: where  is a matrix of genotypes centered by twice the current allele frequencies ();  is the th locus;  is a diagonal matrix of SNP weights with a dimension equal to the number of SNPs. All SNPs were assumed to have homogeneous weights in ssGBLUP  meaning that  was an identity matrix (). To avoid singularity problems   was blended with 5% of . The main interest in fish breeding is to better predict genetic merit of a fish as broodstock; however  the data collected so far during this first development of genomic predictions for catfish in the US do not allow a comparison between mid-parent GEBV and progeny performance  but this comparison will soon be possible. In our study  most of the genotyped animals with phenotypes were from the same year-class (i.e.  2015)  precluding the use of validation on progeny performance and also forward prediction (i.e.  future performance on individual fish). Therefore  to compare predictive ability of traditional and genomic evaluations  we conducted validations using several strategies to split fish into training and validation datasets. Strategies 1 and 2 were used for both harvest weight and residual carcass weight. Strategy 1 was a random - cross-validation  where the dataset was randomly split into k folds  predicting one fold based on k-1 folds. Genotyped animals with phenotypes were randomly split into 5 or 10 mutually exclusive groups (k<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 or k<U+2009>=<U+2009>10  respectively). In each round of cross-validation  phenotypes from one group (i.e.  validation group) were removed from the dataset and the remaining folds (i.e.  training group) were used to predict the future performance for animals in the validation group. This k-folds cross-validation was replicated five times and results are presented as the mean and standard error for the five replicates. In the validation strategy 2  genotyped full-sibs were split into two groups with one group used for training and the other group used for validation  and all phenotypes of the validation group were removed from the evaluation. This scenario is most important when phenotypes are measured on sibs of the selection candidates. Validation strategies 3 and 4 were conducted for residual carcass weight only to evaluate the importance of collecting genotypes on fish that will be slaughtered for phenotype recording. Carcass weight requires the slaughtering of many animals and thus their removal from the pool of selection candidates and is also considerably more expensive to measure than harvest weight. Harvest weight is quickly and inexpensively measured on all selection candidates and therefore  evaluating scenarios 3 and 4 for harvest weight provided no realistic benefit. Strategy 3 was similar to strategy 2 except that we assumed that only half of the full-sibs in the training population had phenotypes. This third validation strategy would be especially important for carcass traits to reduce the number of genotyped animals that are slaughtered to collect phenotypes. The validation group remained the same as in scenario 2. In strategy 4  training animals had genotypes  but no phenotypes and the validation group remained the same. The ssGBLUP method uses all available information in the evaluation  meaning that phenotypes for 5051 ungenotyped  slaughtered fish were included. In this way  genotyped animals could benefit from phenotypes of ungenotyped animals if both groups are related through the pedigree relationship matrix although no genotyped animals had phenotypes for carcass weight. This scenario was proposed because the cost of genotyping fish can be as high as the value of a fish itself. If genotyped fish have to be slaughtered for phenotype recording and they are removed as selection candidates  the cost of implementation of genomic selection would likely increase. Trait heritabilities with the full data were 0.27 and 0.34 for harvest weight and residual carcass weight  respectively. As we changed the data structure by creating different training datasets for each validation strategy  we also estimated updated variance components to evaluate how changing the animals used in the training set analysis (which also changed the subsequent variance components) impacted predictive ability and inflation of (G)EBV. Reverter et al. [] pointed out that breeding value inflation or deflation can be introduced if variance components do not reflect the actual data. Ability to predict performance was used to compare traditional and genomic models. It was calculated as the correlation between (G)EBV for validation animals and phenotypes adjusted for fixed effects (  as described in () and ()  which were estimated based on the full data: In addition  the regression coefficient () of adjusted phenotypes on (G)EBV was used as a measure of inflation of breeding values. A regression coefficient lower than 1 indicates (G)EBV inflation  whereas a value higher than 1 indicates deflation. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify possible regions of the genome containing SNPs with major effects on harvest weight or residual carcass weight. Weighted ssGBLUP (WssGBLUP; Wang et al. []) implemented in postGSf90 from the BLUPF90 family of programs [] was used for the GWAS. In the first implementation of WssGBLUP  Wang et al. [] suggested that SNP weights should be calculated as   following the formula for genetic variance due to an additive locus []. However  Lourenco et al. [] showed that this method did not reach convergence under a more polygenic scenario because of extreme weights. Therefore  the SNP weights used in this study were described by VanRaden [] as non-linear A weights: where  is a constant that determines the departure from normality;  is the absolute estimated SNP effect for marker   and  is the standard deviation of the vector of estimated SNP effects. non-linear A weights had good convergence properties and avoided extreme values (Breno O. Fragomeni  personal communication). This is because the maximum change in weights is limited by the minimum between 5 and the exponent of . In our study   received a value of 1.125 based on Legarra et al. [] and VanRaden []. Although these values were empirically derived based on dairy cattle populations  they resulted from tests over several traits with a more polygenic architecture. The WssGBLUP is an iterative process. Wang et al. [] and Zhang et al. [] suggested that two iterations of weights were sufficient to maximize genomic accuracy and to correctly identify major SNPs in WssGBLUP. Based on the non-linear A weights  the number of iterations to reach convergence may vary from 5 to 10 (Breno O. Fragomeni  personal communication). Therefore  we chose five iterations and checked the stability of predictive ability and regression coefficients of adjusted phenotypes on GEBV. Predictive ability and inflation can be used as indicators for convergence when computing SNP weights in WssGBLUP []. After investigating which iteration had the highest predictive ability  based on reduced data  WssGBLUP was applied to the full data for harvest weight and residual carcass weight  and Manhattan plots were drawn for that iteration. Manhattan plots were drawn based on the proportion of additive genetic variance explained by windows of 20 adjacent SNPs. The concept of SNP windows is rather abstract and tries to approximate haplotype blocks; therefore  it assumes that windows may be inherited together  which may not always be the case for all assumed windows. We used the first medium density SNP array (55 K SNP) developed for channel catfish in this study. However  we also examined linkage disequilibrium (LD) to determine the feasibility of using a lower cost  reduced SNP panel for genomic selection in this population. In our study  LD was calculated with preGSf90 using the following equation: where ;  is the frequency of the genotype ;      and  are the allele frequencies. The LD was calculated as the average of adjacent SNPs within chromosomes and across the genome. A curve that fits the LD decay with distance between markers for each chromosome was calculated by fitting the equation proposed by Sved []: where  is the distance between markers  and  in Morgan and  is the effective population size for the chromosome   calculated as proposed by Saura et al. []: with  as the average chromosome length in Morgan;  is the average LD at chromosome ;  is the adjustment term for sample size (number of genotyped animals); and  is a fixed parameter that is assumed to be 1 if mutation is not considered and 2 if it is considered; we considered . Besides chromosome-based   we also calculated  based on the rate of inbreeding by generation using the of formula Falconer et al. []: where with  as the inbreeding coefficient in the th generation. Table  shows the predictive ability for both traits under different validation strategies. In all validations  using genomic information through ssGBLUP improved the ability to predict future fish performance relative to traditional BLUP. In general  cross-validation scenarios using either k<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 or k<U+2009>=<U+2009>10-fold scenarios had very similar predictive ability. In addition  updating the variance components for different training datasets did not affect predictive ability  as expected []. Including genomic information increased predictive ability by 28% (for both five and ten fold) for harvest weight  and by 29% and 33% (five and ten fold  respectively) for residual carcass weight relative to traditional BLUP. Validation strategy 2 (splitting full sibs into training and validation sets) resulted in overall predictive abilities for traditional BLUP and ssGBLUP that were greater compared to k-fold cross-validations. This was likely due to closer relationships between animals in training and validation groups [] in strategy 2. The ssGBLUP outperformed BLUP by 23% for harvest weight and by 36% for residual carcass weight in strategy 2. Genomic information may have more impact on traits that cannot be measured on the selection candidates []  such as carcass and disease resistance traits. For instance  in our study the greatest increase in predictive ability was for residual carcass weight. Validation strategy 3  where only a portion of the full-sibs in the training set had phenotypes  had a predictive ability slightly higher than strategy 4 (no phenotypes on genotyped animals)  but lower than those for validation on full-sibs with genotypes and phenotypes (strategy 2) and k-folds cross-validation (strategy 1). The gain in predictive ability of GEBV over EBV in strategy 3 was 22% for residual carcass weight. The drop in predictive ability for residual carcass weight for strategy 3 relative to strategies 1 and 2 was caused by the reduction in the number of phenotypes available to estimate breeding values. Validation strategy 4 represented the situation where genotyped fish had no phenotypes in the dataset  which would eliminate the need to process genotyped fish. Predictive ability for residual carcass weight EBV decreased from 0.24 to 0.22  and of GEBV from 0.31 to 0.24. These results suggest that having genotypes for fish that are slaughtered for carcass weight recording is important and translates into the greatest benefit from genomic selection. Having phenotypes for genotyped individuals is important not only in aquaculture genomics  but in general livestock genomics. In a simulation study  Pszczola et al. [] showed that the highest accuracies from genomic evaluation were obtained when animals from both reference (phenotyped) and evaluated (non phenotyped) populations were genotyped. Furthermore  Lourenco et al. [] showed only one point increase in predictive ability in the genomic evaluation for calving ease in American Angus and related that to the small number of genotyped animals with records on difficult calving. Although predictive ability decreased considerably when carcass records for genotyped fish were removed  ssGBLUP still outperformed traditional BLUP by about 9%. The improved performance of ssGBLUP in this situation is due to the fact that the  matrix connects genotyped animals without phenotypes to ungenotyped animals with phenotypes  if they are connected through the pedigree. Overall  the use of genomic information improved the calculation of relationships among animals and allowed for a better estimation of Mendelian sampling  promoting an increase in predictive ability and allowing the use of within-family variation. Without genomic information  young full-sib fish (i.e.  without phenotype or progeny) would have the same EBV for a trait  which equals to parent average []. Lourenco et al. [] showed that when an animal is genotyped but has no phenotype and progeny  the GEBV is composed of: where  is the parent average EBV for the animal   is the portion of prediction due to the genomic information  coming from   and  is pedigree prediction that comes from ; weights w1–w3 sum to 1. Quaas [] described that the breeding value of an animal is the average of EBV from parents () plus a random term that takes into account the uncertainty about which 50% of the genes were passed to progeny (i.e.  Mendelian sampling): where  is EBV from sire;  is EBV from dam and  is the Mendelian sampling term. If the first portion of the formula corresponds to    can be partially estimated by the genomic information present in   as shown in Eq. ()  because genomic data helps to estimate part of the uncertainty about which alleles and the proportion of alleles shared among individuals. Therefore  genotyped full-sibs that are selection candidates (i.e.  young) have unique GEBV (not just ) and the best candidates can be identified within families. Figure  shows the distribution of GEBV for a family of 34 full-sibs that had no phenotypes for residual carcass weight but were genotyped. Without genomic information  all 34 full-sibs had only PA  which is equal to 4.64 g. After including genomic information for all full-sibs  we observed a distribution ranging from 1.24 to 7.65. Use of GEBV would allow selection of fish within a family based on individual genetic merit for carcass weight  avoiding random selection of fish within a family based on BLUP   which could result in selecting fish with in fact lower genetic merit. Distribution of genomic EBV for residual carcass weight (g) in a family of 34 young genotyped full-sibs The ability to identify selection candidates within a family that have higher genetic merit is a key benefit for a trait such as carcass weight in fish  which is not measured on selection candidates  and for quite large full-sib family sizes. Studies on other fish species such as Atlantic salmon [   ] and rainbow trout [  ] have demonstrated increases in predictive ability or accuracy of GEBV compared to EBV  confirming the benefits of genomic selection for aquaculture species. Tables  and  present EBV and GEBV inflation () for harvest weight and residual carcass weight. In all validation scenarios  GEBV were less inflated or deflated compared to EBV  meaning that GEBV were closer in scale to the adjusted phenotypes. Updating variance components for each training dataset was beneficial for estimating inflation for both EBV and GEBV. The benefit comes from the fact that the variance components used to predict (G)EBV reflect the true state of the population after removing phenotypes for validation animals and therefore  less inflation is expected. Wiggans et al. [] suggested that one way to reduce inflation of genomic evaluations of US cows would be to reduce heritability; this would be in line with a reduced additive genetic variation in recent generations. In our study  when variance components were re-estimated  the regression coefficients became closer to 1 and were the most beneficial for the cross-validation scenario for harvest weight  in which  for GEBV  meaning that GEBV and adjusted phenotypes had similar dispersion. Manhattan plots from the GWAS for harvest weight and residual carcass weight are shown in Figs.  and   respectively. The plots were drawn for the first iteration of WssGBLUP  because it had the greatest predictive ability and least inflation. In the first iteration  GEBV were computed assuming that all SNPs had the same weight. The GEBV were then back-solved to SNP effects and new weights were calculated and plotted as percentage of variance explained. Although predictive ability had to be computed based on the reduced dataset  the Manhattan plots were drawn based on the full dataset. The proportion of additive genetic variance explained by windows of 20 adjacent SNPs was up to 0.96% for harvest weight and up to 1.19% for residual carcass weight  which indicates that both traits are extremely polygenic. A single window explaining close to 1% of the additive genetic variation for harvest weight was located on chromosome 19  whereas  for residual carcass weight the top windows were located on chromosomes 13 and 21. Manhattan plot for harvest weight in the 1st iteration of WssGBLUP  with the proportion of additive genetic variance explained by windows of 20 adjacent SNPs Manhattan plot for residual carcass weight in the 1st iteration of WssGBLUP  with the proportion of additive genetic variance explained by windows of 20 adjacent SNPs In an experimental population of less than 600 genotyped progeny of F1 males (channel x blue catfish) and channel catfish females  Li et al. [] found a significant association between SNPs on chromosome 5 and body weight. These SNPs explained from 3.69 to 6.72% of the phenotypic variance for body weight. In a rainbow trout population from the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture  Gonzalez-Pena et al. [] found windows of 20 SNPs that explained more than 1% of the additive genetic variance for body weight at 10 and 13 months on chromosome 5  for fillet weight and yield on chromosome 9  and for carcass weight on chromosomes 9  17  and 27. In our study  the windows that explained the top variance did not overlap with windows already described in the literature for the same species or trait. The fact that top windows do not overlap even in populations from the same species has been described in the literature. Silva et al. [] found very few overlapping genomic windows that explained more than 1% of the additive genetic variance for columnaris disease in two different rainbow trout populations. Fragomeni et al. [] showed that  in a selected commercial broiler chicken population  the location of the windows with the largest effect was not consistent across different generations. With a polygenic architecture and windows of SNPs explaining small proportions of the additive genetic variance  genomic selection for harvest weight and residual carcass weight in this catfish population is preferred over marker-assisted selection (MAS). Using MAS with such an architecture would not provide successful results given that only a small proportion of variance can be explained by individual SNPs. Under a polygenic architecture  the use of Bayesian alphabet (e.g.  BayesA  BayesB) and GBLUP-based methods that allow SNPs to explain a different proportion of variance (i.e.  different SNP weightings; [  ]) may not help to increase the predictive ability or accuracy of GEBV. In fact  we observed that predictive ability for harvest weight and residual carcass weight did not change over the iterations of WssGBLUP when using non-linear A weights (results not shown). In addition  inflation slightly increased from iterations 1 to 3  reaching a plateau in later iterations (results not shown). When the best results for predictive ability and inflation are obtained in the first iteration of WssGBLUP  we can assume that using different weights is not beneficial  and  in this case  GEBV obtained from WssGBLUP are the same as in ssGBLUP. In a simulation study using linear SNP weights (i.e.  )  Lourenco et al. [] found that for more polygenic traits  decreases in accuracy or increases in inflation/deflation for WssGBLUP could be caused by the shrinkage of SNP weights for SNPs with smaller effects. Although Manhattan plots were drawn based on the first iteration of WssGBLUP  the percentage of variance explained by SNPs did not change considerably over iterations. In fact  there was no change from iterations 2 to 5 for harvest weight and 3 to 5 for residual carcass weight. This possibly shows that non-linear A weights are not overestimated and they converge at some point. This convergence occurs because the formula contains a maximum limit for SNP weight. In an attempt to use the linear weights  we observed a constant increase in the proportion of variance explained (results not shown). This increase is due to the fact SNP weights keep changing over iterations without a limit for maximum change. The overall whole-genome LD was 0.22 and ranged from a low value of 0.12 (chromosome 29) to a high value of 0.37 (chromosome 17). The LD was moderate even at long distances as shown in the LD decay plots in Fig. . There was a large  conservative LD block  which did not decay even at long distances (20 Mb) on chromosome 17  and a more in-depth investigation is needed to understand what might have caused this LD pattern. LD decay plots for 29 chromosomes The effective population size calculated based on LD and that based on inbreeding did not differ much  i.e. 27 and 28  respectively. Compared to livestock species   in catfish is relatively small. Pocrnic et al. [] showed that  for broiler chicken  swine  Angus cattle  Jersey  and Holstein cattle were 44  32  113  101  and 149  respectively. In studies based on simulated populations  Pocrnic et al. [] and Muir [] associated  with the dimensionality of the genomic information and showed higher accuracy of genomic predictions for smaller . When  is small  there are fewer and longer LD blocks  which can be well estimated even when the number of genotyped animals is less than 5000 []. In this way  the small  in this catfish population may have contributed to the great increase in predictive ability even when only 2911 fish were genotyped (i.e.  8% of the population). Considering the small effective population size and the long-range LD in this population  it might be possible to reduce the number of markers needed for genomic selection. Other studies have demonstrated similar accuracies when comparing low- and high-density SNP panels in salmonid species [      ]. Recently  Vallejo et al. [] reported gains of accuracy (relative to traditional BLUP) of 88% for a 35 K SNP panel and 42% with a greatly reduced 200 SNP panel with ssGBLUP for bacterial cold water disease resistance in rainbow trout. The authors related the efficiency of the reduced SNP panel to the strong long-range LD in that rainbow trout population. Reducing the density of markers in the panel would likely reduce genotyping costs and improve the cost efficiency of genomic selection in fish. More studies are necessary to investigate the overall cost and benefit of different SNP panel densities on implementation of genomic selection in this catfish population. Genomic information is beneficial for channel catfish breeding because it provides greater ability to predict future performance and reduces inflation of breeding values. For carcass traits  it is important to record carcass weight phenotypes on genotyped fish to obtain the largest advantage of genomic selection. Genomic information also allows the estimation of Mendelian sampling  enabling the identification of genetically superior individuals within families  which is not possible with pedigree information only. Genome-wide association suggests that harvest weight and residual carcass weight have a polygenic architecture  indicating that using many SNPs in a genome-wide selection approach would be superior to using fewer SNPs in a marker-assisted selection type of approach.

"Required properties for markers used to calculate unbiased estimates of the genetic correlation between populations"	"Authors: Yvonne C. J. Wientjes  Mario P. L.

Calus  Pascal Duenk & Piter Bijma"	"No Co-Author"	"14 December 2018"	"BackgroundGenerally  populations differ in terms of environmental and genetic factors  which can create differences in allele substitution effects between populations. Therefore  a single genotype may have different additive genetic values in different populations. The correlation between the two additive genetic values of a single genotype in two populations is known as the additive genetic correlation between populations and thus  can differ from 1. Our objective was to investigate whether differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequencies of markers and causal loci between populations affect the bias of the estimated genetic correlation. We simulated two populations that were separated by 50 generations and differed in LD pattern between markers and causal loci  as measured by the LD-statistic . We used a high marker density to represent a high consistency of LD between populations  and lower marker densities to represent situations with a lower consistency of LD between populations. Markers and causal loci were selected to have either similar or different allele frequencies in the two populations.ResultsOur results show that genetic correlations were underestimated only slightly when the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was similar for the markers and the causal loci. A lower marker density  representing a lower consistency of LD between populations  had only a minor effect on the underestimation of the genetic correlation. When the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was not similar for markers and causal loci  genetic correlations were severely underestimated. This bias occurred because the markers did not predict accurately the relationships at causal loci.ConclusionsFor an unbiased estimation of the genetic correlation between populations  the markers should accurately predict the relationships at the causal loci.

Therefore  a single genotype may have different additive genetic values in different populations. The correlation between the two additive genetic values of a single genotype in two populations is known as the additive genetic correlation between populations and thus  can differ from 1. Our objective was to investigate whether differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequencies of markers and causal loci between populations affect the bias of the estimated genetic correlation. We simulated two populations that were separated by 50 generations and differed in LD pattern between markers and causal loci  as measured by the LD-statistic . We used a high marker density to represent a high consistency of LD between populations  and lower marker densities to represent situations with a lower consistency of LD between populations. Markers and causal loci were selected to have either similar or different allele frequencies in the two populations. Our results show that genetic correlations were underestimated only slightly when the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was similar for the markers and the causal loci. A lower marker density  representing a lower consistency of LD between populations  had only a minor effect on the underestimation of the genetic correlation. When the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was not similar for markers and causal loci  genetic correlations were severely underestimated. This bias occurred because the markers did not predict accurately the relationships at causal loci. For an unbiased estimation of the genetic correlation between populations  the markers should accurately predict the relationships at the causal loci. To achieve this  it is essential that the difference in allele frequencies between populations is similar for markers and causal loci. Our results show that differences in LD phase between causal loci and markers across populations have little effect on the estimated genetic correlation. Alleles in different populations are often expressed in different environments and genetic backgrounds. Because of genotype by environment interactions and non-additive genetic effects  these differences result in different allele substitution effects between populations [  ]. In addition  the set of loci that underlie a trait can differ between populations. Therefore  a single genotype may have different additive genetic values in different populations [  ]. For each population  the additive genetic value is the product of the genotype  which is measured as the allele count at each locus  multiplied by the allele substitution effects for that population. The additive genetic correlation between two populations is the correlation between the two additive genetic values of a single genotype in the two populations and may differ considerably from 1. Knowledge of the genetic correlation between populations helps to understand the differences and similarities in genetic architecture of complex traits between populations [  ]. For both genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies  combining information from populations is an attractive approach to increase the accuracy of estimated genetic values or the power to identify quantitative trait loci. This is especially the case when the number of individuals with marker genotypes and phenotypes in a population is limited. For both genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies  the genetic correlation between populations determines the added benefit of combining information from multiple populations [    ]. Therefore  the genetic correlation between populations is an important parameter in human studies e.g. [  ]  as well as in animal and plant breeding e.g. [  ]. To estimate a genetic correlation between two populations  it is essential to know the relationships between individuals from the two populations. Traditionally  relationships between individuals are based on pedigree information  which generally is only available within a population. The current availability of genome-wide marker panels has opened up new opportunities to estimate genetic correlations between populations of distantly related individuals  such as between breeds e.g. [  ]  lines []  sub-populations e.g. []  or ethnicities e.g. [  ]. Genetic correlations between populations can be estimated using methods based on genomic relationships []  random regression on marker genotypes [  ]  or summary statistics of genome-wide association studies [  ]. Wientjes et al. [] showed that it is possible to obtain an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation from genomic relationships based on causal loci. Because causal loci are generally unknown  genomic relationships have to be based on marker information. It is expected that this creates bias in the estimates of genetic correlation  because the strength and phase of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between causal loci and markers differ between populations in humans []  livestock [  ]  and plants [  ]. Due to imperfect LD between causal loci and markers  not all the genetic variance is explained by the markers  which can further distort the estimation of genetic correlations [  ]. In contrast to the expectations  a simulation study with populations that had different LD patterns showed that the estimated genetic correlation between populations based on marker information was only slightly biased []. This contrast indicates that the impact of differences in LD patterns between populations on the estimated genetic correlation remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences in LD patterns between populations and differences in allele frequencies of markers and/or causal loci between populations affect bias of the estimated genetic correlation. We simulated two populations that were separated by 50 generations using scenarios that differed in consistency of LD between populations  defined as the correlation in LD phase between the two populations  and in allele frequencies of markers and causal loci between the populations. We used marker-based relationship matrices to estimate the genetic correlation. Two populations were simulated using the QMSim software []. The simulations were set-up with two characteristics: (1) the two populations have different LD patterns  as measured by the LD statistic ; and (2) a large number of loci segregate in the last generation with part of these (><U+2009>200 000) having similar allele frequencies in both populations  and another part (><U+2009>200 000) having different allele frequencies in each population. We simulated a historical population for 211 generations (Fig. ). The first generation (generation -<U+2009>211) contained 300 individuals. During the following 100 generations (generations -<U+2009>211 to -<U+2009>112)  population size decreased gradually to 50 individuals to create LD. From generation -111 to generation -<U+2009>12  population size increased gradually to 300 individuals and was kept constant for the next 10 generations (generations -<U+2009>11 to -<U+2009>2). In the last generation of the historical population (generation -<U+2009>1)  population size increased to 1800 individuals. In the entire historical population  generations were discrete  there was no selection  mating was at random  and the male to female ratio was 1:5. The effective population size () of the entire historical population was<U+2009>~<U+2009>79  which was approximated as the harmonic mean of  in each generation calculated as:   where  is the number of males and  the number of females used to create the next generation []. Schematic representation of the simulated population structure The last generation of the historical population was divided randomly into two equally-sized populations ( and ) of 900 individuals. In the next generation  the size of both populations was increased to 1800 individuals and was kept constant for the following 40 generations (generations 1–40). These reasonably large population sizes limited the drift of allele frequencies. The number of offspring was set to 10 and selection was at random  such that the number of selected offspring per individual followed approximately a Poisson distribution  as assumed in the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift. During the last 10 generations (generations 41–50)  population size decreased to 120 individuals in each population to increase the extent of LD in each population  and the number of offspring was set to 20. Similar to the historical population  these generations were discrete  there was no selection  mating was at random  and the male to female ratio was 1:5. All individuals from the last generation (2000) were used for the analyses. A genome of 10 chromosomes of one Morgan each was simulated. This genome size was a balance between the computational effort necessary for the analyses and the variation in relationships between family members []. Each chromosome contained 300 000 randomly spaced loci  with a recurrent mutation rate of 0.00005 in the historical population. In the last generation of the historical population  segregating loci were selected and mutation was stopped. The chosen population size and mutation rate resulted in a U-shaped allele frequency distribution of segregating loci in the two populations  as common in real populations. In the last generation (generation 50)  markers and 2000 causal loci were selected from all segregating loci. Three marker panels were constructed: a high-density panel (HDP) with 200 000 markers  a medium-density panel (MDP) with 20 000 markers  and a low-density panel (LDP) with 2000 markers. Each of the smaller marker panels was a subset from the larger marker panels. Markers and causal loci were selected to have either similar or different allele frequencies in populations  and . For both approaches  three selection criteria were used; namely (1) the segregation in one or both populations  (2) the absolute difference in allele frequency between population  () and population  ()  and (3) the difference in  between populations  and   which is a measure of the difference in variance explained by a locus when allele substitution effects are the same in the two populations. The last criterion was mainly effective for loci with a low allele frequency  since an apparently small difference in allele frequency can result in a relatively large difference in variance explained for those loci. This criterion was used to ensure that the proportion of genetic variance explained by a locus was more or less similar in the two populations when populations had similar allele frequencies. As a first step  markers were selected from the segregating loci. To select markers with similar allele frequencies in the two populations  (1) loci had to segregate in both populations  (2)  should be less than 0.14  and (3)  should be less than 2  where  is the average of  and . To select markers with different allele frequencies in the two populations  (1) loci had to segregate in at least one population  (2)  should be more than 0.14  and (3)  should be more than 1. The cut-off values were chosen to either minimize or maximize the difference in allele frequencies between the populations  while ensuring that enough loci in each replicate met the criteria. Our aim was to select marker panels with a uniform distribution of allele frequencies to reflect commercially available marker chips [   ]. For this step  the loci that met the criteria were divided into 50 bins based on average allele frequency over the two populations (i.e.  allele frequencies of bin 1 ranged from 0 to 0.02  of bin 2 from 0.02 to 0.04  etc.)  and from each bin an equal number of loci was randomly selected. When the number of loci was too small in the two extreme bins (0.00–0.02  and 0.98–1.00)  the bins were combined with the neighbouring bin. As a second step  causal loci were selected from the segregating loci that were not selected as markers. To select causal loci  the same criteria and cut-off values were used as for markers  with one exception. In all scenarios  causal loci did not have to segregate in both populations  since some causal loci are known to be at least partly population-specific []. Causal loci were selected randomly from all simulated loci that met the criteria  and therefore the pattern of their allele frequencies followed an approximate U-shaped distribution as expected for causal loci [  ]. The LD pattern and consistency of LD between the populations was investigated. Within each population and between all causal loci and markers less than 10 cM apart  the parameter  was calculated []: where  is the haplotype frequency with allele 1 at the first locus and allele 1 at the second locus     and  are frequencies of the other possible haplotypes   and  are the frequencies of allele 1 and allele 2 at the first locus  and  and  are the frequencies of allele 1 and allele 2 at the second locus. The LD pattern within each population was represented by the average  for intervals of 0.1 cM between the markers. The consistency of LD between the two simulated populations  and  was calculated as the correlation between  values of the two populations for intervals of 0.1 cM  following De Roos et al. []. The consistency of LD between populations is known to decrease when the genomic distance between markers and causal loci increases []. This indicates that the populations were expected to have a higher consistency of LD between markers and causal loci when using HDP markers than when using MDP or LDP markers. In this way  the analysis with the HDP markers represented a situation with the highest consistency of LD between populations  and the analysis with LDP markers represented a situation with the lowest consistency of LD between populations. For each causal locus  allele substitution effects were sampled from a bivariate normal distribution  with a mean of 0  a standard deviation of 1  and a correlation between the populations of 1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2 or 0. For each individual  its allele counts for the causal loci (coded as 0  1  and 2) were multiplied by the corresponding allele substitution effects and the results were summed over loci to calculate the additive genetic value (AGV) of the individual. The AGV were scaled to a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 across all individuals. Since allele substitution effects were sampled independently from allele frequency  the correlation between AGV of populations  and  (i.e.  genetic correlation) was similar to the correlation between allele substitution effects (i.e.  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2 or 0). A normally distributed environmental effect was sampled for each individual to obtain a heritability of 0.3 in each population. Phenotypes of all 2000 individuals in generation 50 were computed by summing the AGV and the environmental effects. The simulation of phenotypes was replicated 50 times for each scenario. For each replicate  markers and causal loci were selected for three scenarios; (1) similar allele frequencies between populations for both markers and causal loci  (2) similar allele frequencies between populations for markers and different allele frequencies between populations for causal loci  and (3) different allele frequencies for both markers and causal loci. Within each scenario  phenotypes were simulated for each of the six genetic correlations. Scripts and seeds to simulate the data are in Additional file . The additive genetic correlation between populations was estimated using the following bivariate model: where  is a vector of phenotypes for population  (   is an incidence vector relating phenotypes to the mean in population  ()   is an incidence matrix relating phenotypes to estimated additive genetic values  with  representing the Kronecker product function  and  are vectors with independent residual effects. Genetic and residual variances were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The first analyses were performed using the ASReml software []. For the scenarios analysed later  we switched to MTG2 [] to reduce computation time. We verified that the estimated variance components were identical using both programs. The genomic relationship matrix () between all individuals was calculated as []: where  is a matrix with centered allele counts of all individuals from population   and  is the allele frequency for locus  in population . Centered allele counts were calculated as   where  is the allele count of locus  for individual  from population   coded as 0  1 or 2. This  defines the relationships as standardized covariances between the genetic values of individuals []. In all scenarios and for all replicates  we calculated  using allele counts of (1) causal loci  (2) HDP markers  (3) MDP markers  or (4) LDP markers in both populations. The relationships at causal loci are the true relationships for that trait  which are approximated when using markers. Marker-based relationships are subject to sampling error  since markers are a subset of the genome and in imperfect LD with the causal loci. A way to account for this sampling error is by regressing  towards the pedigree relationship matrix () [    ]  which is expected to reduce bias of the estimated variance components []. To investigate the effect of this regression   matrices based on the three marker panels were regressed towards  and used for the scenarios with a correlation of 0.8 or 0.4. Before regressing  towards   the inbreeding level of each within-population block in  was rescaled to the inbreeding level in   following []: where  is the average inbreeding coefficient of all individuals of population  based on the pedigree  and  is a matrix of 1s. The rescaled  was regressed towards  following [  ]: where  is the number of markers. To set-up   the pedigree of the last 10 generations was used  such that between-population  relationships were zero. The regression was done separately within each population per bin of pedigree relationships (<<U+2009>0.10  0.10–0.25  0.25–0.50 <U+2009>><U+2009>0.5) and between populations  since regression coefficients are higher for stronger pedigree relationships [  ]. For the diagonal elements  only the inbreeding coefficients in  were regressed towards  []. Regression coefficients were all close to 1 for higher marker density panels (><U+2009>0.99 for HDP and<U+2009>><U+2009>0.97 for MDP). For LDP markers  regression coefficients were lower  i.e.<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.84 for between-population relationships <U+2009>~<U+2009>0.89 <U+2009>~<U+2009>0.91 <U+2009>~<U+2009>0.94 and<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.96 for the four bins of within-population relationships  and<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.93 for inbreeding coefficients. The criteria for selecting markers and causal loci resulted in clear differences between the scenarios with similar and different allele frequencies in the two populations (Fig. ) and [see Additional file ]. As designed in the simulations  the distribution of allele frequencies was uniform for markers and U-shaped for causal loci as expected in livestock populations. Therefore  the percentage of causal loci with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 was higher (on average 33% in each population) than the percentage of markers with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 (on average only 15% in each population). The decay of LD was similar in both populations (Fig. )  with a stronger decay as distances between the loci in the 0–2 cM interval increased. The correlation of LD phase between the populations  representing the consistency of LD phase between the populations  decreased rapidly at short distances (0–5 cM)  and fluctuated around zero at distances longer than 5 cM. As designed in the simulations  the extent and consistency of LD between populations were comparable to those in chicken and pig populations [    ]. Allele frequencies of markers in two populations using two approaches to select markers. For one random replicate  allele frequencies of markers from both populations are plotted against each other for markers that are selected to have  similar allele frequencies or  different allele frequencies in the two populations Extent of LD in two populations and correlation of LD phase between the populations as a function of distance. The average LD () between causal loci and markers for both populations  and the correlation of LD-phase (correlation of ) between the populations  as a function of distance between causal loci and markers for one random replicate The proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the markers  known as the genomic heritability []  was close to the simulated heritability for the scenarios with HDP and MDP markers and slightly lower than the simulated heritability for the scenarios with LDP markers (estimated:<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.29; simulated: 0.3). This implies that genetic variances were estimated accurately regardless of the marker panel used. With relationships based on causal loci  all estimated genetic correlations were unbiased  irrespective of whether causal loci had similar or different allele frequencies in the two populations (Fig. ). This was expected based on our previous results []. Estimated genetic correlations between populations without regressing the genomic relationship matrix. The average estimated genetic correlation (±<U+2009>standard error of the mean) at different simulated genetic correlations for the scenario in which  markers and causal loci have similar allele frequencies in the two populations   markers have similar and causal loci different allele frequencies in the two populations  or  markers and causal loci have different allele frequencies in the two populations  when the genomic relationship matrix is either based on the genotypes of causal loci (2000)  HDP (200 000)  MDP (20 000)  or LDP (2000) markers without regression towards the pedigree relationship matrix. Standard errors were calculated as the standard deviation over replicates divided by the square root of the number of replicates With relationships based on markers  all estimated genetic correlations were slightly to severely biased. The bias was very small when the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was similar for the markers and the causal loci. For example  when marker-based relationships were not regressed towards the pedigree relationships  genetic correlations were underestimated by only<U+2009>~<U+2009>2.5% for HDP <U+2009>~<U+2009>3% for MDP  and<U+2009>~<U+2009>11% for LDP markers (Fig. a  c). The bias was much larger when markers had similar allele frequencies in the two populations and causal loci had different allele frequencies  i.e. when the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations differed between markers and causal loci (Fig. b;<U+2009>~<U+2009>28% for HDP <U+2009>~<U+2009>30% for MDP  and<U+2009>~<U+2009>41% for LDP markers). It should be noted that the distribution of allele frequencies was always uniform for markers and always U-shaped for causal loci. Across all scenarios  regressing  towards  had only a small effect on the estimated genetic correlation (Fig. ). At a high marker density  regressing  towards  lowered the estimated genetic correlation. Therefore  the underestimation for HDP and MDP markers increased from<U+2009>~<U+2009>4 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>9% when the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was similar for markers and causal loci  and from<U+2009>~<U+2009>28 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>32% when this was not the case. In contrast  regressing  towards  resulted in higher estimated genetic correlations at low marker density. For LDP markers  the underestimation decreased from<U+2009>~<U+2009>12 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>8% when the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was similar for markers and causal loci and from<U+2009>~<U+2009>41 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>38% when this was not the case. Thus  regressing  towards  was only beneficial for the estimation of the genetic correlation between populations when the marker density was low. Estimated genetic correlations between populations with regression of the genomic relationship matrix. The average estimated genetic correlation (±<U+2009>standard error of the mean) at a simulated genetic correlation of  0.8 or  0.4 for the three scenarios with HDP (200 000)  MDP (20 000)  or LDP (2000) markers and regression of  towards . Standard errors were calculated as the standard deviation over replicates divided by the square root of the number of replicates In general  standard errors of the mean across replicates for the estimated genetic correlation were small for all scenarios (~<U+2009>0.02)  and tended to be slightly larger for lower true genetic correlations. Moreover  standard errors were slightly larger when the difference in allele frequencies between populations was not similar for markers and causal loci (Fig. b vs a  c). Regression of  towards  had no effect on the standard error. Estimates of the genetic variance are biased when the regression of true relationships on marker-based relationships is not equal to 1 []. We investigated whether this could explain the underestimation of the genetic correlation by considering the genomic relationships at the causal loci as the true relationships for that trait. In Figs.  and   we plotted the relationships at the causal loci versus the unregressed relationships at the markers for one of the replicates. The regression coefficients for within-population genomic relationships were close to 1  and were only slightly lower when causal loci had different allele frequencies (Fig. ) compared to similar allele frequencies (Fig. ) in the two populations. This means that the within-population relationships at the markers can predict quite accurately the relationships at the causal loci. Genomic relationships at causal loci versus markers when causal loci have similar allele frequencies in the two populations. The genomic relationships at the causal loci versus the genomic relationships based on  HDP (200 000) markers   MDP (20 000) markers  or  LDP (2000) markers  when markers and causal loci have similar allele frequencies in the two populations for one replicate. Relationships in population  are represented in dark blue (Eq. 1 of regression line and correlation)  relationships in population  are represented in medium blue (Eq. 2 of regression line and correlation)  and relationships between population  and  are represented in light blue (Eq. 3 of regression line and correlation) Genomic relationships at causal loci versus markers when causal loci have different allele frequencies in the two populations. The genomic relationships at the causal loci versus the genomic relationships based on the  HDP (200 000) markers   MDP (20 000) markers  or  LDP (2000) markers  when markers have similar and causal loci different allele frequencies in the two populations for one replicate. Relationships in population  are represented in dark blue (Eq. 1 of regression line and correlation)  relationships in population  are represented in medium blue (Eq. 2 of regression line and correlation)  and relationships between population  and  are represented in light blue (Eq. 3 of regression line and correlation) Regression coefficients of between-population relationships deviated more from 1  especially at low marker density. When the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was similar for markers and causal loci  the regression coefficients were equal to<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.8 for HDP and MDP and 0.67 for LDP markers (Fig. ). This means that the relationships at the markers led to an over-prediction of the relationships at the causal loci. When the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was not similar for markers and causal loci  regression coefficients of between-population relationships were equal to<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.30 (Fig. ). Thus  the over-prediction of between-population relationships using markers was much larger when the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was not similar for markers and causal loci. The correlation between the relationships at the causal loci and at the markers  i.e.  the accuracy of the marker-based relationships  decreased when the density of the markers decreased (Figs.   ). When the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was similar for markers and causal loci  the correlation for within-population relationships was<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.91 for HDP and MDP  and<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.88 for LDP markers. The correlation for between-population relationships was<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.70 for HDP and MDP  and 0.60 for LDP markers. The correlation between relationships at causal loci and at markers was much lower when the difference in allele frequencies between the populations was not similar for markers and causal loci (within-population relationships:<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.66 for HDP and MDP <U+2009>~<U+2009>0.63 for LDP; between-population relationships:<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.09 for HDP and MDP <U+2009>~<U+2009>0.08 for LDP). Our objective was to investigate whether differences in LD patterns between populations and differences in allele frequencies of markers and/or causal loci between populations affect bias of the estimated genetic correlation. We simulated two populations that differed in LD pattern between markers and causal loci  as measured by the LD-statistic . Our results show that when the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations is similar for markers and causal loci  estimated genetic correlations are only slightly underestimated using markers. When the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was not similar for markers and causal loci  genetic correlations were severely underestimated. Differences in LD and allele frequencies of causal loci between populations had only a very slight effect on the precision of the estimated genetic correlation. Estimates of the genetic variance and heritability are known to be biased when the regression coefficient of the true relationships on the marker-based relationships is not equal to 1  i.e.  when  [    ]. When this regression coefficient is less than 1  relationships at the markers show too much variation  which results in an underestimation of the genetic variance. Yang et al. [] argued that a regression coefficient less than 1 can be due to two effects: (1) sampling error on the relationships because the number of markers is finite; and (2) a difference in the distribution of allele frequencies between causal loci and markers. In all our scenarios  the number of markers was finite and the distribution of allele frequencies differed between causal loci and markers. However  within populations  the estimated genomic heritability [] was close to the simulated trait heritability for all scenarios. This suggests that the number of markers used was sufficient to constrain the sampling error on within-population relationships to an acceptable level  and that our estimated genetic variances were affected only slightly by the difference in the distribution of allele frequencies between causal loci and markers. Thus  the underestimation of the genetic correlation between populations is not a result of biased estimates of the genetic variance. The relative sampling error due to the use of a finite number of markers is much larger for between-population relationships than for within-population relationships  because more markers are needed to accurately estimate the small between-population relationships []. Moreover  we showed that the accuracy of predicting the between-population relationships at the causal loci using markers depended on whether the difference in allele frequency of causal loci between populations was reflected by the markers. These two factors can result in an underestimation of the genetic covariance between populations  which can explain the slight underestimation of the genetic correlation in the scenarios in which the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations was similar for markers and causal loci and the larger underestimation in the scenarios in which this was not the case. The higher sampling error on between-population relationships can also explain the larger underestimation of the genetic correlation for the LDP markers than for the HDP and MDP markers. Thus  to estimate the genetic correlation between populations  it is important that the difference in allele frequencies between the populations is similar for markers and causal loci and that the number of markers is sufficiently large. The additive genetic correlation between populations is defined as the correlation between the two additive genetic values of a single genotype  measured as the allele count at each causal locus  in the two populations. This correlation is equal to the correlation between allele substitution effects when allele substitution effects are independent of allele frequency. This independency was used in our simulated phenotypes and also to set-up the  matrix  as it is an implicit assumption in Method 1 of VanRaden []. When this assumption is not met  the genetic correlation is no longer equal to the correlation between allele substitution effects  and violation of this assumption in the set-up of  may result in biased estimates of the genetic correlation. Regressing  towards  is a way of correcting the marker-based relationships for the sampling error due to a finite number of markers []. The regression was strongest for LDP markers and reduced the underestimation of the genetic correlation. These results agree with the findings that regressing  towards  is important when the number of markers is small [] and supports our statement that relationships at LDP markers were affected by sampling error. However  regressing  towards  slightly increased the underestimation of the genetic correlation with HDP and MDP markers. The reason for this is not clear. It might be that the regression of  towards  not only reduces the sampling error  but also amplifies the effect of the difference in the distribution of allele frequencies between causal loci and markers. In our study  regressing  towards  was slightly detrimental for the estimation of the genetic correlation when using HDP (200 000) or MDP (20 000) markers  with regression coefficients being only slightly less than 1  and it was beneficial when using LDP (2000) markers with regression coefficients being considerably less than 1. The simulated genome represented about one-third of the genome of livestock species such as cattle and chicken [  ]. This suggests that regressing  could be detrimental when using a genome-wide total of 60 000 or more markers in livestock. Note that this number of markers will depend on the consistency of LD between populations. Between-population relationships are all closer to zero when the LD pattern is less consistent between populations []. Such weaker relationships generally require more markers to reduce their relative sampling error to an acceptable level []. Hence  we think that the regression coefficients may be a better indicator for deciding whether or not to regress ; when all regression coefficients are close to 1  e.g.  higher than 0.95  it is probably better not to regress  towards  when estimating the genetic correlation between populations. The coefficients to regress  towards  were approximated using the number of markers and the variation in   assuming that the sampling error was only a result of using a limited number of markers []. To investigate the impact of this approximation  we repeated the analysis by using  [] as the regression coefficient to regress  towards . This regression requires that the causal loci are known  which generally is not the case. Here  we used this approach to investigate whether the bias in the estimated genetic correlation indeed occurs because the marker-based relationships do not accurately predict the relationships at the causal loci  i.e.    and not because of differences in LD between populations. We calculated  separately for within- and between-population relationships  using 11 bins based on pedigree relationships within populations (<<U+2009>0.05  0.05–0.10  0.10–0.15  0.15–0.20  0.20–0.25  0.25–0.30  0.30–0.35  0.35–0.40  0.40–0.50 <U+2009>><U+2009>0.50  self-relationships) and 3 bins based on genomic relationships between populations (<<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.10  -<U+2009>0.10–0.10 <U+2009>><U+2009>0.10)  and used those  values to rescale the relationships. As shown in Fig.   this rescaling removed almost completely the bias in the estimated genetic correlations based on HDP and MDP markers  but overestimated the genetic correlation when using rescaled relationships based on LDP markers. This might result from the much larger sampling error for LDP markers compared to HDP and MDP markers  which could result in underestimated  values. Thus  there appears to be a lower boundary for the number of markers necessary to calculate between-population genomic relationships that can be corrected using regression. Altogether  our results confirm that for an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation between populations  the regression coefficient of true relationships on marker-based relationships should be equal to 1. Estimated genetic correlations between populations after rescaling the marker-based genomic relationship matrix. The average estimated genetic correlation (±<U+2009>standard error of the mean) at different simulated genetic correlations for the scenario in which markers and causal loci have similar allele frequencies in the two populations when the genomic relationship matrix is either based on the genotypes of HDP (200 000)  MDP (20 000)  or LDP (2000) markers  after rescaling the marker-based relationships using a regression coefficient based on the relationships at causal loci. Standard errors were calculated as the standard deviation over replicates divided by the square root of the number of replicates When calculating the marker-based relationships  the current generation within each population was used as the base population  since we used current population-specific allele frequencies. This means that between-population relationships were zero on average. When the LD is at least partly consistent between the populations  due to the existence of a recent or distant common ancestor  between-population relationships will show variation around zero []. This variation is essential to estimate the genetic correlation between populations  and genetic correlation estimates are more precise when it is larger []. We expected that a lower consistency of LD between populations would reduce the estimated genetic correlation between populations  because it reduces the correlation between (apparent) marker effects. Surprisingly  our results showed that estimated genetic correlations were similar with HDP and MDP markers  and only slightly lower with LDP markers. This can be explained by the potential of marker-based relationships to accurately predict the relationships at the causal loci  which is essential to estimate without bias the genetic (co)variances and the genetic correlation between populations. A lower consistency of LD between populations results in a smaller variation in between-population relationships [  ]  both at causal loci and at markers. Therefore  the regression coefficient of the relationships at the causal loci on the relationships at the markers may not be greatly affected (Figs.   ; HDP and MDP markers). Hence  the consistency of LD between the populations seems to have little impact on the estimated genetic correlation between populations. The consistency of LD between populations does affect the correlation between the relationships at the causal loci and at the markers (Figs.   )  i.e.  the accuracy of the marker-based relationships. For an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation between populations  the regression of true relationships on marker-relationships should be equal to 1 and marker-based relationships do not necessarily have to be accurate. This contrasts with the estimation of genetic values  as in genomic prediction  for which relationships must be accurate and must show variation []. Thus  an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation between populations does not guarantee that accurate genomic prediction across populations can be performed. In our study  the analysis with the HDP markers represented a situation with the highest consistency of LD between populations  and the analysis with LDP markers represented a situation with the lowest consistency of LD between populations. Therefore  the effects of marker density and consistency of LD between populations were confounded. The combined impact of marker density and consistency of LD appears to be limited  because the bias in the HDP and MDP scenarios was similar and only a little stronger in the LDP scenario. The impact of marker density can be reduced by regressing the genomic relationships towards the pedigree relationships. If the causal loci are known and the regression coefficients are calculated using relationships at causal loci  we showed that this regression completely removed the bias in estimated genetic correlations based on HDP and MDP markers. This suggests that the slight bias in the HDP and MDP scenario was due to marker density  and that differences in LD between the populations had almost no effect. In order to investigate whether the simulated genome represented livestock genomes  we compared the distribution of allele frequencies and LD pattern with real genomes  as suggested by Daetwyler et al. []. The simulated genome showed a comparable pattern of allele frequencies between markers and causal loci  and a comparable extent and consistency of LD between populations as shown in chicken and pig populations [        ]. Thus  our results can be translated directly to livestock populations if the same marker density is used. This simulated LD was much higher than that generally observed in human populations [  ]. Since marker density  and thereby the average LD between causal loci and nearest marker  had almost no effect on the estimated genetic correlation  it is expected that the simulated LD pattern will not affect the results. We simulated causal loci that were spread randomly across the genome  which is not always the case in real populations. When causal loci are enriched in regions with either high or low LD  (co)variance estimates can be over- or underestimated [  ]. However  we expect that the impact of the heterogeneity of LD will be smaller on the estimated genetic correlation than on the heritability  since differences in LD across the genome affect both the genetic variance and covariance estimates. This mechanism may also explain why estimates of the genetic correlation between traits within a population are less affected by incomplete LD between causal loci and markers than genetic variance estimates []. As explained above  the genetic correlation is equal to the correlation between allele substitution effects when allele substitution effects are independent of allele frequency. Differences in allele substitution effects between populations result from non-additive genetic effects and from differences in allele frequencies  and/or from genotype by environment interactions [  ]. To date  the magnitude of these additive  dominance and epistatic effects is not well known. Therefore  we chose to simulate directly the different allele substitution effects from a bivariate normal distribution  instead of simulating the underlying non-additive effects. Contrary to our simulations  selection generally occurs in livestock populations. Selection creates negative correlations between causal loci  known as the Bulmer effect []. However  the impact of the Bulmer effect on the correlation between loci is very small because the number of causal loci () is large for most breeding goal traits (the average correlation is at maximum ). Moreover  in general  selection acts on multiple traits  which further reduces the correlation between the causal loci affecting a trait. Therefore  the Bulmer effect will have only a small effect on the correlation between loci in one population. Since selection is within population  the Bulmer effect does not cause covariances between loci in different populations. For these reasons  we do not expect that selection and the Bulmer effect would have a large impact of on the results of our study. Furthermore  the Bulmer effect is a transient phenomenon that depends on the type and intensity of selection. Hence  the additive genetic variance as affected by the Bulmer effect does not represent a fundamental biological property of a population  but it can result from selection decisions that may fluctuate over time. The biologically relevant quantity is the genic (co)variance  which is always twice the Mendelian sampling (co)variance. The relevance of the genic (co)variance follows from the decomposition of the additive genetic value of an individual into the Mendelian sampling deviations of its ancestors []    where  is a vector of contributions of ancestors to the individual (including the individual itself  for which )  and  is a vector of Mendelian sampling deviations of those ancestors. Hence  the variance of the additive genetic values equals . In the absence of selection   is diagonal and   where  is the (full) Mendelian sampling variance. Selection causes  to deviate from  and creates covariances between Mendelian sampling deviations of different ancestors. These deviations are transient  and are eroded by recombination when selection ceases  so that  returns to  []. This illustrates that the genic (co)variance is the biologically relevant quantity. We have investigated the estimation of the genic correlation  by focusing on a population in the absence of selection  so that genic and genetic correlations are equal. Generally  marker panels are designed such that the markers have intermediate allele frequencies across multiple populations [  ]. Hence  markers tend to have a higher average minor allele frequency than causal loci [  ]. Moreover  the difference in allele frequencies of causal loci between populations is probably not accurately represented by markers. These factors likely result in underestimated genetic correlations between populations using real data  but the impact of each of the factors requires further research. For an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation between populations based on marker information  it is important that marker-based relationships accurately predict the relationships at causal loci  i.e.  . This is obtained when the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations is similar for the markers and the causal loci  and the number of markers is sufficiently large to constrain the sampling error on between-population relationships to an acceptable level. Our results show that differences in LD phase between causal loci and markers across populations have little effect on the estimated genetic correlation (Additional file ). Falconer DS.

The impact of these artefacts is likely greater for low-coverage data than for high-coverage data because low-coverage data has scant information and many standard tools for processing sequence data were designed for high-coverage data. With the proliferation of cost-effective low-coverage sequencing  there is a need to understand the impact of these errors and bias on resulting genotype calls from low-coverage sequencing.ResultsWe used a dataset of 26 pigs sequenced both at 2× with multiplexing and at 30× without multiplexing to show that index hopping and bias towards the reference allele due to alignment had little impact on genotype calls. However  pruning of alternative haplotypes supported by a number of reads below a predefined threshold  which is a default and desired step of some variant callers for removing potential sequencing errors in high-coverage data  introduced an unexpected bias towards the reference allele when applied to low-coverage sequence data. This bias reduced best-guess genotype concordance of low-coverage sequence data by 19.0 absolute percentage points.ConclusionsWe propose a simple pipeline to correct the preferential bias towards the reference allele that can occur during variant discovery and we recommend that users of low-coverage sequence data be wary of unexpected biases that may be produced by bioinformatic tools that were designed for high-coverage sequence data."

The impact of these artefacts is likely greater for low-coverage data than for high-coverage data because low-coverage data has scant information and many standard tools for processing sequence data were designed for high-coverage data. With the proliferation of cost-effective low-coverage sequencing  there is a need to understand the impact of these errors and bias on resulting genotype calls from low-coverage sequencing. We used a dataset of 26 pigs sequenced both at 2× with multiplexing and at 30× without multiplexing to show that index hopping and bias towards the reference allele due to alignment had little impact on genotype calls. However  pruning of alternative haplotypes supported by a number of reads below a predefined threshold  which is a default and desired step of some variant callers for removing potential sequencing errors in high-coverage data  introduced an unexpected bias towards the reference allele when applied to low-coverage sequence data. This bias reduced best-guess genotype concordance of low-coverage sequence data by 19.0 absolute percentage points. We propose a simple pipeline to correct the preferential bias towards the reference allele that can occur during variant discovery and we recommend that users of low-coverage sequence data be wary of unexpected biases that may be produced by bioinformatic tools that were designed for high-coverage sequence data. Sequence data has the potential to empower identification of causal variants that underlie quantitative traits or diseases  to enhance livestock breeding  and to increase the precision and scope of population genetic studies. For sequence data to be used routinely in research and breeding  low-cost sequencing strategies must be used to assemble large datasets that cover most of the genetic diversity in a population. Such low-cost strategies could involve sequencing large numbers of individuals at low coverage  followed by imputation of whole-genome sequence data [  ]. Current sequencing technologies have inherent sources of errors and bias that affect the quality of the resulting sequence data. Some biases affect the ability to successfully generate and align reads that cover regions with structural complexity  extreme base compositions  or particular sequence motifs [    ]. Biases  together with other sources of errors  also increase the error rate in genotype calls [  ]. Among these  two of the most important causes of incorrect genotype calls are index hopping and preferential bias of some bioinformatic tools towards the reference allele. The impact of these artefacts is likely greater for low-coverage data than for high-coverage data because low-coverage data has scant information and many standard tools for processing sequence data were designed for high-coverage data. With the proliferation of cost-effective low-coverage sequencing  there is a need to understand the impact of these artefacts on resulting genotype calls. Index hopping has a biochemical cause and appears in the early stages of sequencing. Currently  the most widely used high-throughput sequencing platform is the HiSeq series of instruments from Illumina Inc. Due to the large sequencing capacity of these platforms  several samples are often sequenced jointly within a single flow cell channel by multiplexing. To link multiplexed sequence reads to the original samples  the adapter sequences used during library preparation include a set of unique index sequences. However  spurious extensions of library fragments with an incorrect sample index can occur during the exclusion-amplification (ExAmp) clustering that is used by the Illumina instruments when free adapters are present in a library pool. This leads to misassignment of sequence reads between samples in the multiplex. Recently  alarming data showed index hopping incidences of up to 10% []. These results sparked debate and concern about index hopping  although some subsequent studies reported a low incidence for most applications [  ]  which is in line with expectations if cleaning protocols are used to remove free adapters from the libraries []. While these results are reassuring  they pertained to high-coverage sequence data and the effect of index hopping on low-coverage sequence data and its downstream analysis remains unclear. Preferential bias of some bioinformatic tools towards the reference allele (i.e.  the allele that is present in the reference genome sequence) can be observed in sequence data following bioinformatic processing. It originates mainly during read alignment  but it can also occur during variant discovery and genotyping. Alignment of sequence reads onto a haploid reference genome relies on the calculation of similarity scores between reads and the reference genome. The more a read diverges from the reference  the less likely it is to align appropriately. This disfavours the alignment of reads that carry the alternative allele at a variant site because such reads have at least one additional mismatch to the reference genome compared to reads that carry the reference allele. If a read covers multiple variant sites and carries alternative alleles at multiple sites  the probability of aligning that read decreases even further  which in turn produces a stronger reference allele bias in highly polymorphic regions. This can lead to biases in downstream applications  e.g.  in the estimation of allele frequencies [  ]. Another potential source of bias towards the reference allele can occur during variant discovery and genotyping. One of the most popular variant callers is GATK HaplotypeCaller []  which provides a pipeline for efficient joint genotyping of multiple samples. In the GATK Best Practices pipeline  variant discovery and joint genotyping of multiple samples are performed as two separate steps [  ]. In the variant discovery step  read information for each site of the reference genome is stored for each individual sample in a gVCF file  which differs from the traditional VCF file in that it stores information of the non-variant sites as well as the variant sites. In the joint genotyping step  the gVCF files that have been created separately for each individual are combined  and genotypes are called for all individuals at all sites that are variant for at least one individual in the sequenced population. Compared to other pipelines  this two-step process has the advantage that only the genotyping is done jointly for all the samples and not the variant discovery itself  which is the most computationally demanding step. This two-step process improves scalability and facilitates incorporation of new batches of sequenced individuals for the joint genotyping step. However  GATK HaplotypeCaller was designed for high-coverage sequencing and  to our knowledge  its performance in low-coverage sequencing has not been assessed. In this study  we explored the impact of index hopping and bias towards the reference allele in low-coverage sequence data. We show that index hopping and bias towards the reference allele due to alignment have little impact on genotype calls. However  unexpected biases may arise from pipelines that apply tools that were designed for high-coverage sequence data to low-coverage sequence data. In particular  we describe how a function from GATK HaplotypeCaller that is very useful for high-coverage data introduces a strong bias towards the reference allele when used on low-coverage data. We propose a new pipeline that avoids this bias. The results in this paper show the importance of validating the performance of tools designed for high-coverage data on low-coverage data. Twenty-six commercial pigs were used in this study. Tissue samples were collected from ear punches or tail clippings and genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy 96 Blood & Tissue kits (Qiagen Ltd.  Mississauga  ON  Canada). Paired-end library preparation was conducted using the TruSeq DNA PCR-free protocol (Illumina  San Diego  CA). Two sets of libraries were produced; one with an average insert size of 350 bp and the other with an average insert size of 550 bp. Libraries with an average insert size of 350 bp were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina  San Diego  CA)  for a target coverage of 2× per sample. For this  all 26 samples were multiplexed within a single flow cell channel. Libraries with an average insert size of 550 bp were sequenced on a HiSeq X instrument (Illumina  San Diego  CA)  for a target coverage of 30× per sample. For this  the 26 samples were sequenced  one sample per flow cell channel. All libraries were sequenced at Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh Genomics  University of Edinburgh  Edinburgh  UK). DNA samples from the same pigs were also genotyped using the GGP-Porcine HD BeadChip (GeneSeek  Lincoln  NE). DNA sequence reads were pre-processed using Trimmomatic [] to remove adapter sequences from the reads. Then  the reads were aligned to the reference genome  (GenBank accession: GCA_000003025.6) using the BWA-MEM algorithm with default settings and the option of marking shorter split hits as secondary alignment []. Duplicates were marked with Picard (). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) were identified with the variant caller GATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK 3.8.0) [  ]. The GATK HaplotypeCaller performs local re-assembly of the reads to generate a list of possible haplotypes in a region by constructing a read-threading graph. Sections of that graph  which are supported by a number of reads (kmers) smaller than a predefined threshold  are considered to be likely sequencing errors and removed from the graph in a step referred to as ‘pruning’. By default  the threshold for pruning is set to ‘–minPruning 2’. We used the default settings but we also performed variant discovery without pruning (–minPruning 1). Variant discovery with GATK HaplotypeCaller was performed separately for each individual. A joint variant set for the 26 individuals was obtained by extracting the variant sites from all the individuals with GATK GenotypeGVCFs. Finally  biallelic SNPs were extracted with VCFtools []. To minimise computing costs  we considered variants on chromosome 1 only. We did not use genotypes that were called directly by GATK GenotypeGVCFs or any other software tool. Instead  we extracted allele read counts (i.e.  the coverage that each allele received at each variant site) from the VCF file. Then  we called genotypes based on genotype probabilities that were calculated from allele read counts of the reference allele (nRef) and the alternative allele (nAlt). Genotype probabilities for the reference homozygote (0)  heterozygote (1)  and alternative homozygote (2) were calculated  respectively  as: where  is the sequencing error rate  which was assumed to be 0.01. The three probabilities were scaled to sum to 1. Genotype calls were made at three levels of certainty: (1) the most probable genotypes (referred to as ‘best-guess’); (2) genotypes that had a probability greater than 0.90; or (3) genotypes that had a probability greater than 0.98. Genotype concordance was calculated by: (1) comparing genotypes for the same variant from the sequence data and the SNP genotyping array  using the SNP array genotypes as being true; or (2) comparing the same variant from the sequence data at low and high coverage and using the high-coverage genotype calls as being true. Genotype concordance was calculated as the percentage of matches between the true genotypes and the genotype calls. We used the genotypes from all SNPs on chromosome 1 for which there was evidence of allele segregation based on the SNP genotyping array data of the 26 individuals and that were successfully discovered based on the sequence data of these individuals. The number of SNPs tested for concordance with SNP genotyping array data was equal to 5136 for the low-coverage data and 5531 for the high-coverage data. The same set of 5531 SNPs was also used to test the concordance between the low- and high-coverage sequence data. We also calculated allele concordance  as the percentage of matched alleles between the true genotypes and the genotype calls. Initially  we called genotypes using the read counts stored in the gVCF files produced by GATK HaplotypeCaller. For testing potential biases introduced by the variant caller  we also called genotypes using the read counts that were obtained directly from the aligned reads stored in the BAM files. To do this  we extracted the read counts from the BAM files for the variant sites discovered by GATK HaplotypeCaller using pysam (version 0.13.0; )  which is a wrapper around htslib and the samtools package []. We excluded reads with a mapping quality MAPQ lower than 20  reads that were not mapped in a proper pair  and secondary alignments. We refer to this method as the ‘new’ pipeline. Our initial results indicated that there was a strong bias towards the reference allele introduced by the variant caller. Therefore  for all further analyses we used read counts that were obtained from the BAM files with the new pipeline for genotyping. We called genotypes for the 5531 variant sites on chromosome 1 discovered from the high-coverage sequence data that had already been genotyped using the SNP genotyping array. In this study  we defined alignment bias to be the differential alignment of almost-identical reads that differed only in one allele at a given variant site  regardless of whether it was the reference or alternative allele. To quantify the alignment bias  we aligned the 2× data against two reference genomes: the ‘original’ reference genome (GenBank accession: GCA_000003025.6) and a ‘tailored’ reference genome. The tailored reference genome was created by replacing the reference allele with the alternative allele at all variant sites discovered across the 26 individuals with the 30× sequence data from chromosome 1. Thus  the allele that was originally the alternative allele became the reference allele in the tailored reference genome and vice versa. We extracted the allele read counts from the aligned reads in the BAM files that were generated with both reference genomes. The allele read counts were used to call genotypes for evaluating genotype concordance between the 2× data and the true genotypes (from the 30× data). Genotypes were called from the allele read counts obtained with either: (1) the original reference genome (REF)  or (2) the tailored reference genome (ALT). Because REF could favour the alignment of reads that carry the reference allele and disfavour the alignment of reads that carry the alternative allele  and vice versa for ALT  we also considered two additional cases that were a combination of the previous two: (3) read counts for the reference allele from the original reference genome and read counts for the alternative allele from the tailored reference genome (CIS)  and (4) vice versa  read counts for the reference allele from the tailored reference genome and read counts for the alternative allele from the original reference genome (TRANS). Thus  the CIS case used allele read counts that had a more favourable alignment for each allele  and  in contrast  the TRANS case used allele read counts that had a more unfavourable alignment for each allele. In order to quantify the incidence of index hopping in our 2× dataset  we generated 2× data that either were free of index hopping or had different levels of simulated index hopping. The 2× data free of index hopping were generated by down-sampling the 30× data (i.e.  random sampling of ~<U+2009>1/15 of the 30× reads)  which had been generated without multiplexing (1 sample per lane). The resulting down-sampled 2× data was used to obtain baseline sequence data in the absence of index hopping. Then  index hopping was introduced in this data by randomly assigning reads to other individuals with a probability of 0.1  0.5  1  2  or 5%. For each of these cases  we down-sampled the data independently before simulating index hopping to account for the random sampling of reads that occurs during sequencing. To analyse the data  genotypes in each dataset were called as described above (best-guess or above a certain probability threshold) but also with an additional method that was more sensitive to index hopping based on the presence/absence of each allele. With this presence/absence method  the presence of a single read that supported the opposite allele was sufficient to change the genotype call (e.g.  the genotype call with nRef<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 and nAlt<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 would be homozygous but the genotype call with nRef<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 and nAlt<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 would be heterozygous). Note that this method is equivalent to calling best-guess genotypes with null sequencing error rate. To predict the level of index hopping level in the observed 2× dataset  we regressed the percentages of genotype concordance on the level of index hopping. Concordance percentages represent relative  rather than absolute  information and therefore should not be analysed using standard statistical techniques that are defined in real space  which has an absolute scale []. In order to validate the estimates of the level of index hopping with a methodology that was more appropriate for compositional data  we also analysed the data using isometric log-ratio transformations (ilr) of the concordance percentages [  ]. The ilr were the log-ratios of the percentage of correct calls against the percentages of incorrect calls or the log-ratios of the percentage of correct homozygous calls against the percentage of incorrect heterozygous calls. We fitted a quadratic regression of the ilr variables on the level of index hopping. Most of the SNPs present on the SNP genotyping array were discovered using sequence data  both at high and low coverage. The number of biallelic SNPs discovered on chromosome 1 with high- and low-coverage data is in Table . A total of 1 693 308 biallelic SNPs were discovered with the high-coverage data and 1 333 943 with the low-coverage data. The low-coverage sequence data contained 76.3% (1 292 269) of the biallelic SNPs that were discovered with the high-coverage data. The SNP genotyping array had 5779 SNPs on chromosome 1 that segregated in the 26 sequenced individuals. Of these  95.7% (5531) were discovered with the high-coverage data and 88.9% (5136) with the low-coverage data. Disabling the pruning step in GATK HaplotypeCaller for processing the low-coverage data increased the number of variants discovered but also the number of potential false positives. The numbers of biallelic SNPs discovered on chromosome 1 with low-coverage data with or without pruning are in Table . When pruning was disabled  1 877 644 biallelic SNPs were discovered with the low-coverage data. This number was larger than the set of variants discovered with the high-coverage data with the default pruning settings (Table ). However  24.1% of these extra SNPs could not be validated using the high-coverage data  which is a much greater proportion than when pruning was used (3.1%). The variant caller that we used introduced a bias towards the reference allele and this had a large impact on genotype calling with low-coverage data. Table  shows the genotype concordance for calls that were obtained with the allele read counts from the gVCF files produced by GATK HaplotypeCaller. This table shows that there was a large bias towards the reference allele with the low-coverage sequence data. In the most extreme case of sites with 1× coverage  we would expect the genotypes that are heterozygous according to the SNP genotyping array to be called as either of the two possible homozygotes  ‘0’ and ‘2’  50% of the times. Instead  we called them as reference homozygotes ‘0’ 95.1% of the times and as alternative homozygotes ‘2’ only 4.9% of the times. Also  at 1× coverage  82.0% of the alternative homozygotes ‘2’ were called as reference homozygotes ‘0’. Because of this bias  the overall genotype concordance was only 62.1% and the allele concordance was only 77.6%. The bias towards the reference allele due to the variant caller can be avoided by calling genotypes from the read counts that are obtained directly from the aligned reads stored in BAM files. Table  shows the genotype concordance obtained with the new pipeline using allele read counts that were extracted directly from BAM files. The bias was corrected and the concordances matched expectations. Overall  genotype and allele concordances rose to 81.1 and 90.5%  respectively. As expected  most of the incorrect calls arose from the difficulty of calling heterozygous genotypes at low coverage. Disabling pruning was not as good a solution for correcting the bias as the new pipeline of extracting the allele read counts from the BAM files. Table  shows genotype and allele concordances with the default pruning setting and without pruning. Without pruning  the genotype and allele concordances rose to 76.5 and 87.5%  respectively  but these percentages were lower than with the new pipeline. Once the bias towards the reference allele due to the variant caller was corrected  the concordance at homozygous sites was very high  regardless of the conservativeness of the genotype calls  but these thresholds were important for concordance at heterozygous sites. Table  shows genotype concordance between calls with low- and high-coverage data obtained as best-guess genotypes or with a minimum probability of 0.90 or 0.98. At reference and alternative homozygous sites  the best-guess genotypes had an overall concordance of 98.5 and 98.2%  which was greater than the concordance of calls with a minimum probability of 0.90 (97.2 and 96.4%  respectively)  despite the latter being called with a greater level of certainty. The reason for this is that with a minimum probability of 0.90  there is not enough certainty for calling any genotype at sites with a coverage of 1×  and at sites with a coverage of 2× or 3×  only potential heterozygotes (either true or false)  but not homozygotes  can be called due to the considered error rate. While the number of homozygotes that were incorrectly called as heterozygous was actually very small  the impact of these incorrect calls on overall concordance was noticeable because the low-coverage data had many more loci with 2× and 3× coverage than with 4× or greater coverage. A similar situation occurred with genotype calls that had a minimum probability of 0.98. At heterozygous loci  it was very difficult to call heterozygotes at the lowest coverages. Because of the large proportion of loci with low coverage  the genotype concordance of heterozygous loci with best-guess genotypes was 52.4%. With more conservative calls  the heterozygotes were called more accurately and the genotype concordance was 93.3 and 98.3% with minimum probabilities of 0.90 and 0.98  respectively. However  there was a trade-off between the concordance of called genotypes and the number of called genotypes. With more conservative calls  the number of called genotypes was only a small fraction of those that could be called using best-guess genotypes: 33.7% with a minimum probability of 0.90 and only 8.3% with a minimum probability of 0.98. Reads with an allele that was present in the reference genome had a greater probability of successful alignment  but the difference was small. Table  shows the average allele read counts depending on which allele was in the reference genome. Approximately 1.3% of reads were not aligned when the reference genome contained the opposite allele than the read. The number of reads that carried the allele in the reference genome but that were incorrectly mapped to a site where the individual was homozygous for the opposite allele increased by 9.8% due to the alignment bias  but these potentially mismapped reads represented only a small fraction of the total. However  the impact of the bias towards the reference allele due to alignment on the genotype calls is likely to be small. Table  shows the genotype concordance between low- and high-coverage sequence data after alignment with the original reference genome (REF)  the tailored reference genome (ALT)  or a combination of both (CIS and TRANS). Use of the REF or ALT reference genomes introduced some bias towards homozygote calls for the reference or the alternative allele  respectively. Use of the CIS combination  where the allele read counts were obtained from the most favourable case for each (i.e.  the reference genome contained that same allele)  increased the number of genotype calls regardless of the conservativeness of the calls and increased the ability of correctly calling heterozygotes with lower levels of certainty. In contrast  use of the TRANS combination  where the allele read counts were obtained from the least favourable case for each (i.e.  the reference genome contained the opposite allele)  reduced the number of genotype calls and the ability to correctly call heterozygotes. Overall  changes in best-guess genotype concordance were small and the percentage of incorrect calls between the use of CIS (most favourable case) and REF (current practice) differed only by 0.1 absolute percentage points. Index hopping was estimated to be around 1.5% in our dataset. The results of using the method based on presence/absence of each allele  which is more sensitive to index hopping  are in Table   which shows the genotype concordance for the real and simulated data. Regression of genotype concordance for homozygotes on the level of index hopping had a very high R (=<U+2009>0.99)  while the R was less than 0.05 for heterozygotes. Similarly  regression of ilr transformations of concordance on the level of index hopping also had a high R when calculated for homozygotes (=<U+2009>0.98). In all cases  the level of index hopping was estimated to range from 1.3 to 1.8%. Results obtained using the concordance variables of best-guess genotypes and genotypes called with probabilities higher than 0.90 and 0.98  largely supported the results for the presence/absence calling method (data not provided). Results obtained using the concordance variables of best-guess genotypes gave estimates of the level of index hopping ranging from 1.3 to 1.8% (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99). The concordance variables of genotypes with probabilities higher than 0.98 were less sensitive to index hopping and resulted in a lower regression fit and lower or unreliable estimates of the level of index hopping (1.1–1.3%  R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.96–0.99  for percentages; 1.4–1.7% but R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81 to 0.97 for ilr). The concordance variables of the genotypes with probabilities higher than 0.90 were in between  with estimates ranging from 1.3 to 1.5% (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99). Table  shows the impact of different levels of index hopping on genotype concordance. Incidences of 1 or 2% of index hopping increased the percentage of incorrect calls from 17.8 to 18.1 or 18.7%  respectively  for best-guess genotypes  from 3.1 to 3.8 or 4.6%  respectively  for genotypes with a probability above 0.90  and from 0.6 to 0.8 or 0.9%  respectively  for genotypes with a probability above 0.98. We quantified the impact of different sources of sequencing errors and biases towards the reference allele on genotype calls derived from low-coverage data. Index hopping and bias towards the reference allele due to alignment had little impact on genotype calls. However  we found that variant callers can introduce a strong bias towards the reference allele and this has a large impact on genotype calls. This bias is likely to be pipeline specific []  but we have detected it using one of the most popular tools for variant discovery. The step that causes this bias was designed for the processing of high-coverage data but introduces a systematic bias when it is applied to low-coverage data. Other unexpected biases may appear when tools designed for use with high-coverage data are used to process low-coverage data. Awareness of these biases allowed us to design a pipeline that gave significantly more accurate genotype calls from low-coverage sequence data than a standard pipeline. In the following  we discuss each of the sources of errors and biases that we have analysed and our proposed new pipeline for variant discovery and joint genotyping  which addresses the most important source of bias. Tools that are designed for high-coverage sequence data can introduce unexpected biases when used to process low-coverage sequence data. We found that this was the case for the ‘pruning’ step implemented in GATK HaplotypeCaller. During variant discovery  it is virtually impossible to distinguish between a sequencing error and a genuine variant. In order to make variant discovery more robust  different tools use different strategies to identify potential sequencing errors. In the case of GATK HaplotypeCaller  this strategy is the ‘pruning’ step. GATK HaplotypeCaller performs local re-assembly of the reads to generate a list of possible haplotypes in a region by constructing a read-threading graph. Paths of this graph that are supported by a number of reads (kmers) equal or smaller than a predefined threshold are considered to be probably sequencing errors and are removed from the graph (pruned). In the next step of the HaplotypeCaller method  each individual read is aligned against each possible haplotype  including the reference  and a likelihood score is calculated for each read-haplotype pair. Then  the likelihood that a read carries each of the alleles at a site is calculated as the product of the likelihoods of all haplotypes that carry that allele. Finally  the allele with the greatest marginal likelihood is called. While this is a reasonable strategy for high-coverage sequence data  it introduces a huge bias towards the reference allele when used for low-coverage sequence data. This can be understood intuitively with a simple example. Imagine that at any given site with the reference allele ‘A’ and the alternative allele ‘B’  we have only one read and that this read carries the alternative allele B. The graph path representing the haplotype with the allele B will be supported by only one read and will be pruned out of the graph with the default settings  where at least two reads supporting a path are required. This means that the only haplotype that remains in the graph path is the reference haplotype with allele A. Then  in the next step  this same read with allele B will be paired with all the possible haplotypes. In this case  the only possibility is the reference haplotype with allele A and therefore that read is called as carrying the reference allele A. Thus  instead of the true state with nRef<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and nAlt<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  we end up with the opposite situation with nRef<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and nAlt<U+2009>=<U+2009>0. The same bias would arise with a coverage of 3×  if two reads carry allele A and one read carries allele B. In that case  instead of the true state with nRef<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and nAlt<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  which indicates a heterozygote  we end up with nRef<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 and nAlt<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  which indicates a reference homozygote. Then  these biased allele read counts are stored in a gVCF  the file that includes both the variant and non-variant sites and that is used for multi-sample joint genotyping. The bias in our low-coverage data was so pervasive that it was carried over to downstream analyses and affected imputation accuracy at the population level. We performed preliminary analyses of whole-genome imputation using the hybrid peeling algorithm implemented in AlphaPeel [] with sequence data of 1146 individuals  mostly with 2× coverage. We used a leave-one-out design to assess imputation accuracy on 84 individuals that were sequenced at high coverage. To test the impact of the bias on imputation accuracy  we used as input information either the biased allele read counts obtained with pruning or the non-biased allele read counts that were extracted directly from the aligned reads. We estimated that the individual-wise dosage correlations decreased by an average of 0.10 (0.04 SD; max. 0.20) and the individual-wise percentage of correct best-guess genotypes by 7.5 absolute percentage points (3.8% SD; max. 14.7%) as a result of this bias (unpublished data). The imputation algorithm that we used for this test accounts for uncertainty by calculating genotype probabilities from the allele read counts []  but the impact of the bias on imputation accuracy could be even greater for imputation algorithms that instead take genotype calls as an input. Based on our findings  we propose a new pipeline for variant discovery and genotype calling with low-coverage sequence data that takes advantage of the robustness provided by the pruning option of GATK HaplotypeCaller while avoiding bias towards the reference allele. The proposed pipeline has two steps: (1) variant discovery with the default pruning setting of GATK HaplotypeCaller; and (2) genotype calling from the aligned reads stored in the BAM files for the variants discovered. In step 1 of the proposed pipeline  variant discovery is performed with GATK HaplotypeCaller with the default pruning setting on a per-individual basis. Disabling pruning does not seem an appropriate solution for variant discovery with low-coverage sequencing because this increases the number of potential false positives (Table )  as well as computational time. The pruning option of GATK HaplotypeCaller makes variant discovery more robust to false positives  but there is a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity. While pruning reduces the ability to discover variants from low-coverage data  this can be overcome by sequencing strategies that target haplotypes from the population instead of individuals (e.g.  AlphaSeqOpt; [  ]) in two ways: (1) sequencing individuals that share large amounts of haplotypes with the population at high coverage ensures discovery of many common variants []; and (2) given that the realized coverage at a base site follows a Poisson distribution and  therefore  every individual has a greater coverage than the average target coverage at many random sites  many variants can be discovered if a sufficiently large number of individuals are sequenced at low coverage  even if pruning is enabled. For instance  with only 26 individuals sequenced at 2× coverage  we discovered 76.3% of the variants that were discovered with the same individuals at 30× coverage. The gap between variants discovered at low or high coverage is expected to decrease with increasing sample sizes. In step 2 of the proposed pipeline  a joint list of variant sites is extracted from the individual VCF files and the allele read counts at these sites are extracted from the aligned reads stored in the BAM files for each individual. GATK HaplotypeCaller with pruning induces a bias towards the reference allele when used with low-coverage data. This bias is introduced during variant discovery but manifests itself in the genotype calls if the joint genotyping uses the allele read counts stored in the gVCF or VCF files that are produced by the variant caller. This bias can be avoided if we call genotypes based on allele read counts  which are extracted directly from the aligned reads that are stored in the BAM files using tools such as pysam (). The proposed pipeline provides the scalability needed for routine incorporation of new batches of sequenced individuals  using a similar logic as the GATK Best Practices pipeline. In the latter pipeline  information for both variant and non-variant sites is stored for each individual in the gVCF files  which is used later for joint genotyping at all variant sites  but these gVCF or VCF files contain biased allele read counts for low-coverage data. In the new pipeline that we propose  we produce regular VCF files only to obtain a list of all variant sites that have been discovered across the sequenced samples  followed by extracting the raw allele read counts at those sites for all individuals. Using this pipeline  it is very easy to add new batches of samples without having to repeat the joint genotyping by simply extracting the allele read counts for the new individuals and the new variants discovered and adding them to any pre-existing dataset. This also reduces data storage needs because the VCF files are much smaller than the gVCF files. The proposed pipeline simplifies the processing of large numbers of individuals that are sequenced at low coverage by using available tools. This pipeline gave better genotype and allele concordances than using GATK HaplotypeCaller with disabled pruning. Alternative pipelines based on tools such as SAMtools [] or ANGSD [] may be equally well-suited for low-coverage sequence data. Pipelines based on imputation tools such as STITCH [] may also be unaffected by the bias introduced by the pruning step because  similar to the proposed pipeline  they directly exploit the information from the aligned reads (in this case  the phase information of the reads). With the current pig reference genome   bias towards the reference allele due to alignment was very low and its impact on genotype calls was negligible. Our estimates suggest that 1.3% of the reads did not align because the reference genome contained the opposite allele to the read allele and this increased the percentage of incorrect best-guess genotype calls by only 0.1 absolute percentage points. The reference genome  was largely constructed using Pacific Biosciences long reads  with a coverage of 65× and provides much better mapping quality than the previous version  (GenBank accession: GCA_000003025.4). For example  in a 2× coverage sample  the percentage of mapped reads increased from 89% with  to 95% with   the percentage of properly paired reads increased from 77 to 86%  and the percentage of reads with high mapping quality (MAPQ<U+2009>=<U+2009>40) increased from 71 to 84%. Here  we considered only SNPs but we expect that the alignment bias would have a greater impact when using a lower quality reference genome or in regions of high variability and structural complexity  e.g.  in presence of multiple indels. Development of alternative-aware alignment algorithms or genome variation graphs [  ] could alleviate bias towards the reference genome due to alignment in the near future  but these methods still have some practical limitations and their use is not yet generalised. We estimated the level of index hopping in the 26 samples sequenced in a multiplex at 2× coverage to be equal to 1.5%. This was within expectations based on Illumina guidelines (<<U+2009>2%) []. The impact of index hopping on the percentage of incorrect genotype calls depends on the conservativeness of the genotype calls. For conservative calls  the impact was negligible  but for best-guess genotype calls  the percentage of incorrect calls increased by 0.3 to 0.9 absolute percentage points (1.8–5.2% more incorrect calls). We used a novel empirical method to estimate the level of index hopping that relies on sequencing the same set of samples twice  with and without multiplexing  such that the level of index hopping in the multiplexed data can be measured against a scale of simulated index hopping levels obtained from a set of index hopping-free data. Previously  Owens et al. [] proposed a method for testing index hopping that was based on finding heterozygotes with unbalanced read counts for the reference and alternative alleles (e.g.  one allele supported by many reads but the opposite allele only by one read)  and then estimating index hopping based on the frequency of that opposite allele in the rest of individuals in the multiplex. The advantage of this method is that it uses existing data and does not require the same samples to be sequenced twice. However  this method requires high-coverage data and does not answer how index hopping affects genotype calls. Our results  together with those of other studies [  ]  reassure us that the high levels of index hopping reported by Sinha et al. [] are unlikely to occur in most applications when good cleaning protocols are followed to remove excess free-floating indexing primers during library preparation or when unique dual indexes are used []. Index hopping and bias towards the reference allele due to alignment have little impact on downstream genotype calls from low-coverage sequence data  but unexpected biases may arise from pipelines that use tools that were designed for high-coverage sequence data on low-coverage sequence data. The step of ‘pruning’ that is implemented in GATK HaplotypeCaller is an example of a feature that is desirable for high-coverage data but that introduces a systematic bias when applied to low-coverage data. We propose a simple new pipeline to correct this bias and we recommend that users of low-coverage sequence data be wary of unexpected biases before using bioinformatic tools that were designed for high-coverage sequencing.

Eigenanalysis separated the phenotypic impact of a defined challenge with  on WG  caecal inflammation/pathology  and production of IL-10 into three major eigenvectors  indicating that the susceptibility-resistance axis is not a single continuous quantitative trait. The SNPs identified by the GWAS for body weight were located in close proximity to two genes that are involved in innate immunity ( and ). In chickens  seven species of  (Apicomplexa  Coccidia) are responsible for the debilitating and sometimes fatal disease coccidiosis that is estimated to cost the international poultry industry around US$3 billion per year  mainly due to reduced productivity and the cost of preventive measures [  ]. Current control of coccidiosis relies on the prophylactic use of synthetic or fermented ionophore anticoccidial drugs and on vaccination with formulations of live wild-type or attenuated parasites [  ]. Use of some anticoccidial drugs has been curtailed by legislation in many countries  while the costs and limited production capacity of live attenuated vaccines compromise their utility in broiler flocks []. Thus  identification of traits that may contribute towards selective breeding of chickens to control the consequences of coccidiosis is of great importance to industry. In principle  the impact of  infection could be mitigated by selecting chickens that limit their infectious load by being refractory to parasite infection (resistance)  by tolerating the consequences of infection (tolerance)  or by recovering from pathological consequences of infection sufficiently quickly to maintain their growth and body condition (resilience). Resistance  resilience and tolerance to disease are distinct  individual-specific traits that are likely to have a different genetic basis [  ]. However  phenotypic distinction between these three traits is difficult without a longitudinal measurement of pathogen load [  ]. Nevertheless  there is evidence for genetic differences among chicken populations in their response to  parasitism. For example  some native chicken breeds  such as the Egyptian Fayoumi  appear to tolerate the pathological impacts of  infection [  ]  while distinct inbred lines of White Leghorn chickens support variable levels of parasite replication by different  species []. Biological pathways that may be indicative of resistance to  infection have been noted in modern commercial broilers [  ]. One genome-wide association study (GWAS) [] alluded to the mechanisms of resistance to  including primary innate immune response  tissue repair  and proliferation. Definitions of the immune categories used in this study are presented in Fig.  [        ]. Definitions of immune categories used  species that infect chickens have life cycles of 4 to 14 days in vivo that include self-limiting phases of asexual (schizogony) and sexual (gametogony) reproduction.  causes haemorrhagic coccidiosis in chickens  with morbidity and mortality being highest during maturation and rupture of the second-generation schizonts in the caeca  starting from<U+2009>-<U+2009>108 h (4.5 days) post-infection []. The caecal lesions caused are sometimes exacerbated by bacterial co-infection and  is therefore associated with local induction of a wide range of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines []. Selection of chickens with intrinsically high or low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to  (i.e. IL-6  CXCLi2  and CCLi2) has revealed an association of innate immune response with resistance to the pathology that is associated with coccidial infections []. Induction of the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine  interleukin-10 (IL-10)  was first characterised in the spleen and intestine of chickens of inbred White Leghorn lines infected with  []. Both constitutive and inducible levels of IL-10 mRNA were higher in “disease-susceptible” than in “disease-resistant” lines. Later  enhanced expression of IL-10 mRNA was shown in the caeca of broilers infected with  []. Monoclonal antibodies and an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test to detect IL-10 in chicken blood were recently developed and  as in mice  IL-10 was shown to be an inhibitor of both innate and acquired immune responses  with a marked elevation in chickens challenged with  []. This finding agrees with the proposed specific function of IL-10 in immune regulation in the intestine  based upon spontaneous colitis that develops in IL-10 knockout mice []. Mechanisms of innate immunity have been alluded to in many previous studies that investigated genetic resistance to coccidiosis [            ]. However  those exploring response to  were performed using either microsatellite or low-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) in inbred chicken lines [  ]. A previous large-scale GWAS using the Cobb500 investigated a different  () with a commercially available SNP panel []. In this study  our aim was to investigate the relationship between circulating IL-10 (IL-10) as a quantitative trait and two standard phenotypic measures of  infection: weight gain (WG) and caecal lesion score (CLS)  to assess the heritability of each trait and to identify candidate genetic markers that impact the outcome of coccidial challenge. We hypothesized a positive relationship of circulating IL-10 with disease pathology (CLS)  and negative relationships of both these traits with WG  and the identification of significant SNPs that correlate with these traits. In this study  1200 1-day old infectious bronchitis-vaccinated (Nobilis IB H120  MSD Animal Health  Milton Keynes  UK) commercial four-way crossbred Cobb500 broiler chickens () were acquired from a major UK supplier. These comprised three replicate intakes of 375 (intake  September 2016)  376 (intake  October 2016) and 391 (intake  November 2016) individuals at the time of infection. At the conclusion of the trial  1142 animals were available for sampling. For each intake  chicks were initially housed together in a coccidia-free environment at a DEFRA (Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs) approved stocking density of 34 kg/m (anticipated end weight) under a UK Home Office project licence. Up to day 10  chickens received a starter feed that contained the anticoccidial drug Maxiban (Elanco; Greenfield  Indiana  USA; 31.25 g/kg feed). On day 11  an anticoccidial-free grower diet was introduced  and dust-extracted pinewood shaving bedding (StableBed  Essex  UK) was replaced to diminish the risk that anticoccidial residues in the bedding affected future experimental procedures. Consistent with standard commercial broiler rearing management  the grower diet was replaced with finisher pellets on day 25 (Target Feeds Ltd  Shropshire  UK). The light:dark ratio and temperature were changed according to commercial broiler rearing practice. The design of the study is summarised in Fig. . To facilitate animal management  at day 19 each chick intake was randomly divided into two separately housed equally-sized groups  referred to as replicates ‘a’ and ‘b’  that were handled on consecutive days (day and day). At d-2 post-infection (pi)  birds were wing tagged for individual identification and weighed (WT  WT for body weight) to the nearest 0.01 g using digital scales (Kern CXB 3K0.2  KERN & SOHN GmbH  Balingen  Germany). Following WT  birds were randomly assigned to control (intake  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>100; intake  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>50; and intake  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>50) or infection (intake  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>275; intake  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>326; and intake  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>341) within-replicate groups. On d0pi  control birds received a unique 1.0 mL inoculum of DNase/RNase free HO. The remaining birds were infected via oral gavage with a unique 1.0 mL inoculation of  (Houghton strain) sporulated oocysts. Individuals in intakes received 42 500 2-month old oocysts  while those in intake received 40 000 1-month old oocysts. Oocyst sporulation was verified by light microscopy. Birds assigned to replicate ‘a’ received inoculations on day 21  while those assigned to replicate ‘b’ were inoculated on day 22  i.e. replicate ‘b’ gained an additional day of infection-free growth. Infected and control birds were housed in separate rooms  thus allowing both sufficient space to meet commercial environmental conditions and minimising the risk of accidental infection of the control birds with  parasites. Experimental design At d4.5pi (108 h)  all birds were weighed (WT) and a 0.5-mL blood sample was collected from the brachial vein. Blood was immediately transferred to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (Sigma-Aldrich  Dorset  UK)  allowed to clot overnight at 4 °C  and centrifuged at 2000<U+2009>×<U+2009>/10 min. Then  the serum was aspirated into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and stored at -<U+2009>20 °C  for IL-10 assay at a later date. Circulating IL-10 was measured by Capture ELISA according to []  using ROS-AV164 and biotinylated ROS-AV163  as capture and detection antibodies  respectively. At d6.5pi (156 h)  birds were culled by cervical dislocation and weighed - (WT). Both caeca were removed and scored individually for lesion damage [] by the same experienced operator throughout the entire study. For DNA isolation  a 1-cm section of the base of each caecal pair was transferred to a 7 mL Sterilin™ bijou tube (ThermoFisher Scientific  Waltham  MA  USA) that contained 5–10 volumes of RNA at room temperature (Life Technologies  Carlsbad  CA  USA)  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN  Hilden  Germany) was used to isolate total genomic DNA (gDNA) from each caecal tissue sample  following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extracts were stored at -<U+2009>20 °C. A total of 942 DNA samples were available from infected chickens and were genotyped by GeneSeek  a Neogen Company [] using a proprietary 62K SNP array (Cobb-Vantress  Arkansas  USA). Three phenotypic traits were measured: body weight (WT  g) at time-points d2pi (WT)  d4.5pi (WT) and d6.5pi (WT); circulating IL-10 (pg/mL) at d4.5pi  and caecal lesion score (CLS  on a scale of 0-4) - (d6.5pi). The derived trait  weight gain (WG<U+2009>=<U+2009>WT–WT) was also considered. Since the pathology of the two caeca from a bird may differ  CLS were allocated per bird according to the higher score for each caecal pair. A natural log-transformation was applied to IL-10 for it to conform to a Gaussian distribution. The same transformation did not improve the negative distribution skew of CLS  thus these data were not adjusted. Formal testing of differences in weight traits and in the three phenotypic traits of interest (WG  CLS and IL-10) between control and infected birds was carried out in ASReml 4.0 [] using a simple linear univariate model Eq. () to generate predicted means: where  is the vector of observations   is the design matrix relating fixed effects to observations   is the vector of fixed effects  and  is the vector of residual effects. Fixed effects included intake (a three-level factor)  trial replicate (a two-level management within intake factor  accounting for the 1-day handling age difference: ‘a’ and ‘b’)  sex (male or female)  and all significant interaction terms. Weight at d-2pi (WT) was fitted as a covariate in all analyses of weight traits except WT. To ascertain the most parsimonious model for each phenotypic trait  fixed effects were formally tested and removed from the individual trait model if their significance was above the 5% threshold based on a conditional Wald F-test. All three traits of interest were subsequently rescaled (mean-centred/standard deviation) to adjust for differences in units of measurements. Using ASReml 4.0 [] and referring to the univariate models for the assignment of significant fixed effects to each trait  a multivariate linear model was used to estimate the phenotypic variance–covariance matrix () among traits  i.e. no genetic effect was fitted at this stage. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to determine the significance of trait (co)variances by comparing the full multiple trait model with a model that constrained trait covariances to zero. This approach avoided differences in environmental variance (or measurement error) that can generate spurious support for correlation significance. An eigen decomposition was applied to  and the percentage of variance and trait loadings for each eigenvector (EV) was derived. Trait loadings for each EV were plotted on a histogram to facilitate interpretation of the between-trait correlations  following []. Genotyping the 942 infected individuals resulted in 62 732 SNPs located on 28 autosomes  the W and Z sex chromosomes  and four unplaced scaffolds. GenABEL [] was used to construct a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) based on the SNP genotypes and used in a univariate linear mixed model for each trait (using ASReml 4.0 []) to estimate variance components and genetic parameters Eq. (): where      and  are defined as in Eq. ()   is the vector of additive genetic effects  and  is a design matrix relating random effects to observations. Weight at d-2pi was included as a covariate for WG trait. Heritability of each trait was calculated as the ratio of additive genetic and phenotypic variance. Genetic correlations between traits were estimated by bivariate analyses using Model (). For GWAS  quality control removed individuals and SNPs that failed according to the following criteria: minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 to distinguish common polymorphisms from rare variants); call rate lower than 90%; cut off individual call-rate lower than 90%; identity by state threshold less than 1; Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium   10. Thus  921 individuals and 46 836 SNPs remained for further analyses. Classical multidimensional scaling of the SNP genotypes was conducted to confirm the genetic homogeneity of the sample before analysis. Since no obvious substructure was detected (see Additional file : Figure S1)  we did not consider it in further analyses. A separate GWAS was performed for each trait in GenABEL []  fitting sex  intake  and replicate as fixed effects and the GRM as a polygenic effect to correct for genetic relationships. The -log value from the Wald test was corrected for possible inflation of lambda []. Thresholds for genome-wide (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) and suggestive (i.e. accounting for one false discovery per genome-scan; significance levels were calculated using the Bonferroni correction for multiple-testing  i.e. -Log (0.05/total number of SNPs) and -Log (1.0/total number of SNPs)  respectively. To determine the effects associated with significant SNPs identified in the GWAS  single-marker association analyses were carried out using ASReml v 4.1  as in Eq. (). Predicted trait values for each SNP genotype  represented by    and   and SNP allele frequencies  and  were used to estimate the additive (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>(AA<U+2009>-<U+2009>BB)/2) and dominance (d<U+2009>=<U+2009>AB<U+2009>-<U+2009>[(AA<U+2009>+<U+2009>BB)/2] effects and the variance at the SNP (]  assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium genotype frequencies. The heritability of each SNP was then calculated as  divided by the  of the trait. To identify candidate genes  the significant SNPs identified by GWAS were converted from the --4.0 to the --5.0 assembly using the LiftOver tool [] Then  genes located 250 kb up- and down-stream were annotated using the data mining tool BioMart []. Data from the six replicates (2 replicates for 3 intakes) were pooled according to the assigned infection status. The numbers of birds falling into each category are summarised in Table S1 (see Additional file : Table S1). Significant differences were found between the unadjusted weights of control and infected birds data (Fig. ). Univariate analysis of mean-adjusted phenotypic data revealed significant differences (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) between control and infected chickens for body weight at d-2pi (WT)  d4.5pi (WT)  and d6.5pi (WT) and for weight gain (Fig. a; see Additional file : Table S2). Mean weights and mean weight gains were also significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) different between the three experimental intakes (see Additional file : Table S2). Males were significantly heavier than females for all measures (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; Fig. b; see Additional file : Table S2). Mean weight (g) of control (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>200  dashed-line) and infected (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>942  solid-line) birds throughout the trial period  with standard error bars. See also (Additional file : Table S2) for full details Box plot of body weight for  control and infected birds and  the two sexes at d6.5pi No caecal pathology was detected in the control chickens (CLS score<U+2009>=<U+2009>0). Phenotypic variance in CLS was observed in infected chickens  with the full spectrum of scores (0–4) observed across both sexes (Fig. a). Both intake and replicate explained some of the variance in CLS (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; see Additional file : Table S2). Distribution of  caecal lesion score and  IL-10 for male (M) and female (F) infected birds Serum IL-10 concentrations in the control chickens were below the assay limit of detection but were elevated to varying extents in birds challenged with   as previously described []. The difference between male and female infected chickens in the production of IL-10 was not significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.54; Fig. b; and (see Additional file : Table S2). A linear model multivariate analysis was used to estimate phenotypic correlations () between the three measured traits (<<U+2009>0.001  Table ). WG was negatively correlated with both CLS (-<U+2009>0.37<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03) and IL-10 (-<U+2009>0.35<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03)  while the correlation between CLS and IL-10 was positive (0.39<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03; Fig. ). Overall  birds with high CLS tended to have high IL-10 and low WG. Visualisation of the relationship between caecal lesion score and IL-10 (pg/ml) in infected birds. *<<U+2009>0.05; **<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 Using the univariate linear mixed model (Eq. )  genetic variance and heritability were evident for WG and CLS but not for IL-10. Only the heritability estimate for WG was significantly different from zero (0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09; Table ). The multivariate linear mixed model and the bivariate models that included IL-10 as a response variable did converge  likely due to the absence of detectable genetic variance for IL-10. The estimate of the genetic correlation between WG and CLS was negative and significant (-<U+2009>0.94<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.32). The modest phenotypic correlations between traits were investigated further using an eigen decomposition of the phenotypic covariance (Fig. ). Trait weightings of the first eigenvector  (EV1  eigenvalue<U+2009>=<U+2009>59%)  were low WG  high CLS and high IL-10  and likely represent a susceptible spectrum  as defined in Fig. . In these birds  it is assumed that the low WG is a consequence of the parasite-induced caecal pathology. The second and third eigenvectors (EV2  22%; high WG  low CLS and high IL-10  and EV3  19%  high WG  high CLS and low IL-10) separate birds that may be considered as resistant/resilient or tolerant  respectively. The birds with high values for EV2 may produce an effective immune response  including production of IL-10  that either prevents pathogen invasion/replication or mitigates the pathology  i.e. they are either resistant or resilient; these alternatives cannot be distinguished. The birds with high values for EV3 gain weight despite caecal pathology and the lack of an innate immune response (low IL-10)  i.e. they are phenotypically tolerant. Plotting the trait loadings for each EV  as in Fig.   enabled a visualisation of the multivariate distribution of partly overlapping immune categories which include susceptible  resilient/resistant and tolerant. Eigenvector decomposition of the phenotypic covariance matrix. Vector loadings for the three measured traits [weight gain (WG)  caecal lesion score (CLS) and serum interleukin-10 (IL-10)] are presented in standard deviation units on the y-axis. The percentage of variance explained by each eigen vector (EV) is in brackets on the x-axis Following quality control of the data  921 of the 942 infected birds were available to detect significant associations between SNPs and the analysed traits. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and adjustment for the test inflation factor  two suggestive SNPs were identified for the derived trait  WG  during the period of infection. Both were located on chromosome 11 (Table ; Fig. a). These SNPs were 7.76 Mb apart (i.e. at opposite ends of the microchromosome) and not in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The strongest association with CLS was observed for a SNP on chromosome 12 (Table ; Fig. b). However  after correction  this association was not significant. Lastly  one SNP was associated with IL-10 level at the height of infection  on chromosome 4 (Table ; Fig. c). Given the lack of detectable genetic variance for this trait  this is likely a false positive. Corresponding quantile–quantile (q–q) plots for the three GWAS analyses are in Fig. a  b and c. Small additive effects (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.003) were estimated for the significant SNPs  (Table ). Estimates of dominance effects were not significant. The effect of the significant SNPs were also found to be significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) in the univariate linear mixed models. Manhattan and corresponding QQ plots from the GWAS for:  weight gain;  caecal lesion score;  serum IL-10. The log value is plotted for each SNP on the relevant chromosome (x-axis). Bonferroni corrected thresholds were set as <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.1×10 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>2.1×10 for genome-wide (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) and suggestive (i.e. one false discovery per genome-scan) levels  corresponding to -log values of 5.97 (blue) and 4.67 (red) lines The objective of this study was to estimate the variance and investigate the genomic architecture of chicken response to  infection  using the Cobb500 commercial broiler. GWAS of the three analysed phenotypic traits revealed the presence of suggestive significant SNPs for body weight gain (WG) but not for caecal lesions or IL-10. Significant genetic variance and heritability was detected for WG only. For CLS both these estimates had large standard errors. We could not detect genetic variance for IL-10  and the reasons for this may be complex. In addition  it was clear that IL-10 production was not strongly correlated with caecal pathology. A future study will focus on the relationship between quantified pathogen load and circulating IL-10 to determine whether IL-10 production is an independently heritable trait. Based on estimates of variance and the extensive heterozygosity of the four-way crossbred population  it is now clear that our study was underpowered to identify the genetic control of the response to  challenge. The Cobb500 genotype was selected deliberately to establish whether substantial phenotypic variation exists in response of commercial broiler chickens following a defined infection with   the cause of caecal coccidiosis. The phenotypic results indicate that this is clearly the case. We were  however  unable to estimate heritabilities that were significantly different from zero  but it is unclear if this was a result of the four-way cross or that variance in CLS and IL-10 has no underlying genetic basis. Further investigation is required to determine if the assays used here could be applied to pedigree lines to select for the desired phenotype(s). Innate immune response is highly conserved across chordates and IL-10 is known to be critical for resistance to gastrointestinal parasite infections in mice []. As noted above  selection for enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been reported to increase resistance to  [] and increased expression of these cytokines in the intestinal mucosa of birds infected with  has been documented e.g. []. However  the published studies have assessed neither the utility of these responses as biomarkers  nor their variance on a population scale in commercial chicken lines. Here  we focused on the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 that was previously reported to be significantly elevated in the serum of  challenged birds []. Although the function of IL-10 in host defence in  infection is unclear  there is evidence that it contributes to the pathology in some manner  as the use of oral antibodies against IL-10 has been reported to mitigate the growth rate suppression that occurs in broiler chickens infected with  [  ]. Another reason for our focus on IL-10 was to identify a quantifiable phenotype in the early stage of disease challenge that could provide a biomarker for genetic selection. Quantification of individual disease severity was assessed - by scoring caecal lesions  with males exhibiting  on average  less damage compared to females. Interestingly  a previous study [] found that significantly more male embryos survived infection with   suggesting that innate coccidiosis resistance differs between sexes. In line with our hypothesis that birds with high WG have  on average  lower CLS and IL-10  the estimated phenotypic correlations of WG with CLS and IL-10 were negative (-<U+2009>0.37<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 and -<U+2009>0.35<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03  respectively)  indicating that birds failed to thrive due to  at least in part  the direct effects of  infection. These phenotypic correlation estimates are consistent with other reports e.g. [] (-<U+2009>0.14)  [] (only a negative direction is indicated) and []. The positive phenotypic correlation between CLS and IL-10 (0.39<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03) was consistent with the relationship between susceptibility and high IL-10 mRNA production in mucosa among inbred chicken lines []. A weakness of our study is that circulating IL-10 was measured at a single time-point only. In that sense  the 0.39 phenotypic correlation with caecal lesion score is remarkable. We concentrated on the use of eigenvalue decomposition of the phenotypic variance–covariance matrix among traits  rather than principal components because the eigenvector trait loadings provide population evidence for variance in the immune categories described in Fig.  []. If phenotypic immune response was a simple susceptible/resistant axis  then all the variance should be explained by the first eigenvector. However  this was not the case  with 41% of the variance shared between eigenvectors 2 and 3. Trait loadings for EV1 reflected the estimated between-trait correlation directions that are indicative of susceptibility: i.e. the ability/inability of a host to control pathogen invasion or replication  resulting in a lack of weight gain  a high level of pathology and a strong response from the innate immune system. In the most affected birds  a high level of circulating IL-10 is likely to be the consequence of pathology and local immune responses  and is consistent with the variation observed among inbred birds that differ in resistance []. Certainly   infection impairs normal caecal function such as fermentation of complex carbohydrates  nitrogen absorption  and water retention. In field situations  haemorrhagic disease induced by  causes diarrhoea  leaves birds weak and dehydrated with reduced appetites and the damaged intestine susceptible to secondary infection by opportunistic intestinal bacteria. EV2 displayed no loading for WG  and a negative loading on CLS  thus indicating that part of the variation in CLS is independent of WG. Nevertheless  the high IL-10 loading for EV2 indicates that there was a strong response to the pathogen  and we interpret this vector to be indicative of resistance/resilience. Finally  the EV3 trait loadings displayed severe pathology while simultaneously retaining growth performance although the loading on IL-10 was very low  thus our biological interpretation is that this eigenvector represents a tolerant phenotype. We speculate that elevation of IL-10 could induce systemic immunosuppression that may underlie the observed negative correlation of serum antibody titres against bacterial and viral pathogens with parasite load in field studies of native birds in Africa []. In mammalian species  there is strong evidence that polymorphisms in the - and - genes are responsible for susceptibility to gastrointestinal inflammatory disease []. As noted above  the population used in this study may not be ideal for a genetic analysis due to its four-way cross construction. Other studies that reported significant SNP associations with WG and  infection used larger populations of the same broiler [] and/or different population structures [      ]. Two suggestive SNPs on chromosome 11 were associated with body weight. Putative candidate genes  () and  () for these SNPs are associated with gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases  and with the development of the digestive system and disorder networks  [  ]. A separate study that used Cobb500 broilers infected with the small intestine parasite   found several significant QTL for disease resistance but none of these were identified in our study []. This could be due to one or more of the many differences between these two studies  including those relating to the pathology and immune responses induced by  versus  the phenotypes measured  sample size  sex ratio  age of birds at infection  and density of SNP information available. Keeping the birds for a further 7 days may have elucidated the difference between resistance and resilience by enabling measurement of the extent of recovery  but it would have precluded collection of CLS that must be scored between 5 and 7 days post-infection [] since pathological lesions resolve after this time. Two previous QTL mapping studies on resistance to  infection used a Fayoumi  White Leghorn intercross rather than a commercial line  measured phenotypes that  apart from WG  could not be compared to our study  [  ]. Only one of these studies [] located QTL on chromosomes 4 and 11 but none of these were located in similar regions or were linked to phenotypes of the suggestive SNPs found our study. Resilient birds are attractive to industry since they are able to overcome disease  acquire immunity  and return to their original healthy condition. However  pathogens can mutate rapidly to overcome host resistance that can lead to a selective advantage of mutants in resistant individuals. It is unclear whether tolerance would be a desirable production phenotype without information on other commercially important traits such as feed conversion efficiency. Genetic change of the pathogen may be smaller if it can complete its life cycle in tolerant birds []  but birds that can tolerate disease could also be “super-shedders” that drive environmental oocyst numbers upward. IL-10 production may be beneficial or detrimental to the host. Other studies have suggested that IL-10 is directly involved in the reduced body weight gain observed in -infected birds [  ]. The existence of birds that produce high levels of IL-10 but gain weight normally argues against such a direct role. We anticipate extending our studies to pedigree lines where a simpler genetic relationship matrix can be established  and to natural infection  over a longer time course  where we can also measure the trajectory of circulating IL-10  pathogen load  shedding  and feed conversion efficiency. There is also a need to test whether circulating IL-10 is specific to the parasite infection or could provide a more general indication of intestinal health. We have confirmed the existence of substantial variance for weight gain in birds infected with   a trait that is used traditionally as a measure of resilience/resistance to coccidiosis caused by this pathogen. Our data indicate that breeding for increased weight gain under challenge alone would not distinguish between resilience/resistance and tolerance. Eigen analysis of the phenotypic variance–covariance structure among weight gain  caecal inflammation/pathology and production of IL-10 separated the phenotypic impact of the defined challenge with  into three major eigenvectors  indicating that the susceptibility-resistance axis in this population is complex. We were unable to demonstrate significant genetic basis for the variation in CLS and IL-10. However  suggestive SNPs identified by the GWAS for body weight were located in close proximity with two genes known to be involved in innate immunity ( and ). Shirley M  Smith A  Tomley F.

In addition to these empirical analyses  a simulation study was performed to evaluate the potential impact of adding RLFV in the model on the reliability of prediction. Three sets of causal RLFV (containing 21 468  1348 and 235 RLFV) that were randomly selected from different numbers of genes were generated and accounted for 10% additional genetic variance of the estimated variance explained by the 50 k SNPs. When genic RLFV based on mapping results were included in the prediction model  reliabilities improved by up to 4.0% and when the causal RLFV were included they improved by up to 6.8%. Using selected RLFV from whole-genome sequence data had only a small impact on the empirical reliability of genomic prediction in dairy cattle. Our simulations revealed that for sequence data to bring a benefit  the key is to identify causal RLFV. Due to the progress in sequencing technology  whole-genome sequence data has become available for large numbers of dairy cattle [  ]. Using this resource  individuals with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip genotype data can be imputed to whole-genome sequence variants [  ]. Causal variants are expected to be better identified by using whole-genome sequence data  and therefore  can be used to improve the reliability of genomic prediction []. Brondum et al. [] found that the reliability of genomic prediction increased by up to 4% and 0.5% for milk yield traits and fertility  respectively  when quantitative trait loci (QTL) derived from whole-genome sequence data were used. However  in dairy cattle  van Binsbergen et al. [] observed no increase in reliability of prediction when all imputed whole-genome sequence variants compared to only the QTL derived from sequence data were used. The SNP chips that are routinely used in genomic prediction in dairy cattle include mostly SNPs with a relatively high minor allele frequency (MAF) that can efficiently tag common variants. However  the ability of these chips to tag rare and low-frequency variants (RLFV) is limited. There are several indications that RLFV make an important contribution to genetic variance. For instance  nonsynonymous SNPs are expected to make a larger contribution to genetic variance than synonymous SNPs []. In the human genome  non-synonymous variants tend to have a lower MAF than synonymous variants []. More generally  functional variants are much more likely to be rare than common variants []. Rare variants are more often deleterious variants and  therefore  more prone to being purged from the population. Therefore  including RLFV in genomic prediction  through (imputed) sequence data  might increase the reliability of genomic prediction. This may be especially the case for fitness traits  since alleles with deleterious effects are expected to strongly affect fitness and to be rare due to purging from the population. To date  the question about whether the inclusion of subsets of RLFV from imputed whole-genome sequence that are selected by different strategies  in addition to e.g. 50 k SNP chip data  improves the reliability of genomic prediction in dairy cattle has not been investigated. There are various ways to select a subset of RLFV from whole-genome sequence for inclusion in genomic prediction [  ]. One approach is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for RLFV  which allows to select those that are significantly associated with the trait of interest  under the condition that the existing sample size and the effect of the RLFV are large enough to be identified. Although the effect of RLFV is expected to be small  the power to detect RLFV can be improved when combining RLFV within a gene or region. The power to detect causal RLFV can be considerably increased by using methods that are specifically designed to map RLFV instead of the commonly used mixed linear models  as shown in a simulation study in dairy cattle []. In addition  for fitness-related traits  variants with a lower MAF are expected to have a larger effect []  which suggests that for genomic prediction of fitness-related traits  RLFV may be more relevant  in spite of their low MAF. An alternative approach is to use the annotation of variants that predict the biological impact of variants in general [  ]. It can be hypothesized that RLFV with high impact annotations  e.g. protein altering variants  probably have a larger effect on phenotypes  and therefore should be included in genomic prediction. Gonzalez-Recio et al. [] explored the contribution of rare variants in the genetic variance of milk-related traits and fertility  and examined the accuracy of genomic prediction using all the rare variants from transcripts for these traits. Their study and our previous data [] suggested that the relative contribution of RLFV to the total genetic variance might be somewhat higher for health-related traits such as fertility  disease susceptibility and longevity than for milk production traits. Therefore  in this study  we made the hypothesis that the reliability of genomic prediction can be increased by including selected subsets of RLFV for three fitness-related indices  i.e. fertility  health  and longevity  in dairy cattle. The objective of this study was to test the above hypothesis and to empirically examine the impact of using selected RLFV from imputed whole-genome sequence data on the reliability of genomic prediction in dairy cattle. We also undertook a simulation study to evaluate what are the critical factors that increase the reliability of genomic prediction as a result of using RLFV in the model  depending on the amount of genetic variance explained by causal RLFV. In total  6337 Holstein sires with de-regressed proofs (DRP) were genotyped using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (50 k) version 1 or 2 (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) []. The following quality criteria were applied for selecting SNPs: minimum call rates were set to 85% for individuals and 95% for SNPs  and monomorphic SNPs or deviating from Hardy–Weinberg proportions (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001) were excluded. Thus  43 415 autosomal SNPs remained for the analyses. The genome position of the SNPs were based on the UMD3.1 Bovine genome assembly []. The 50 k genotypes of the 6337 animals were imputed to the sequence level by a two-step approach that was developed by Brondum et al. []. They showed that this strategy yields the highest imputation accuracy with optimal computation time for this particular type of data. The bulls’ 50 k genotypes were first imputed to a high-density SNP array (HD  734 077 SNPs) using a multi-breed reference of 3383 animals  which were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD chip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) by using IMPUTE2 software []. These imputed HD genotypes were subsequently imputed to the whole-genome sequence level with 22 232 889 variants (SNPs  short insertions and deletions) by using a multi-breed reference of 1228 animals from  of the 1000 bull genomes project [] and from Aarhus University [  ]. The reference genotype probabilities that had an imputation quality (the R value) at imputed markers lower than 0.9 were removed from the original sequence data []. Both the 50 k and the whole-genome sequence genotypes were pre-phased with BEAGLE v3.3.2 []. The subsequent imputation step was performed using the Minimac2 software []. Imputed variants with a MAF lower than 0.001 were filtered out  which removed SNPs that had less than 13 copies of the minor allele from the data  considering that the total number of alleles is equal to twice the number of animals (6337). The average imputation accuracy (the estimated value of the squared correlation between imputed genotypes and true genotypes from Minimac2) was equal to 0.850 with a standard deviation of 0.233 for rare variants (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) and 0.873 with a standard deviation of 0.215 for low-frequency variants (0.01<U+2009><<U+2009>MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). All called variants were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and ENSEMBL (v.67) databases []. Any sites with multiple transcripts that resulted in multiple annotations were annotated only once using the - option in VEP [] and annotations of the non-reference alleles were classified  as explained later  according to SIFT scores of the variants []. VEP determines the effect of the variants (SNPs  short insertions and deletions) on genes  transcripts  and protein sequence. SIFT predicts the potential effect that a non-reference allele has on encoded proteins  and integrates the effect of amino acid change  folding structure (predicted or known)  and conservation score []. RLFV were defined as the imputed sequence variants that had a MAF lower than 0.05 and were selected based on their genic or intergenic localization  annotation and association mapping. Depending on the amino acid change that results from having the rare instead of the alternative allele  rare variants are assigned to a different class of annotations (see classifications below). We selected four sets of RLFV in this study: RLFV in all 23 431 genes including non-coding genes; RLFV with annotations of ‘high impact’ from VEP and SIFT scores (frameshift variant  inframe deletion  inframe insertion  missense variant  protein altering variant  start lost  stop gained  stop lost  splice acceptor variant  splice donor variant  splice region variant) according to how much the amino acid can be changed; RLFV from set (2) in addition to those with annotations of ‘medium impact’ (3 prime UTR variant  5 prime UTR variant  downstream gene variant  synonymous variant  upstream gene variant) according to how much the amino acids can be changed; RLFV in genes that were associated with the analyzed index trait by considering only the individuals included in the training population using the MONSTER software []. The details for mapping genic RLFV by the famSKAT approach [] are described in Zhang et al. []. Briefly  famSKAT models the effects of all genic RLFV in a genetic region such as a gene  as random effects with the same variance  without making any assumption about the direction of the effects of the genic RLFV across the loci considered. The genes with a  value lower than 0.01 from famSKAT approach were selected and the RLFV within these genes were extracted. Briefly  the model is: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is a design matrix for fixed covariates including the intercept   is a vector of unknown covariate effects   is an incidence matrix relating phenotypes to the corresponding random polygenic effect   is a vector of random polygenic effects that follows a multivariate normal distribution )  where  is the pedigree-based additive genetic relationship matrix and  is the polygenic variance   is a vector of random residuals     is a  matrix that encodes the genotype at the  tested variant loci and  is the number of individuals with  representing allele dosage (0  1 or 2) of the minor allele at the th variant of individual   and  is a vector of random effects of the  variants  . Finally  we examined a scenario that randomly sampled a similar number of RLFV when RLFV with medium-to-high impact annotations were included in the prediction model. This analysis was done for the health index because it showed the largest improvement in reliability of prediction compared to when 50 k SNPs were used in the prediction model. Three fitness-related index traits (fertility  health and longevity) were studied  for which the phenotypes were DRP. In total  5043  4926 and 4673 bulls with DRP  imputed sequence data  50 k data and pedigree information were available for fertility  health and longevity  respectively. The fertility index is a linear combination of breeding values for interval from first to last insemination  number of inseminations for heifers and cows and interval from calving to first insemination for cows. The health index is a linear combination of breeding values for diseases other than clinical mastitis  which describe the genetic risk of reproductive  metabolic and feet-and-leg diseases. These breeding values are based on recorded treatments by veterinarians during the first three lactations. The longevity index describes the genetic potential for the cows’ productive longevity. For details regarding the index traits  recording procedures and models used to estimate their breeding values  see . Simulations were undertaken to evaluate the (potential) impact of including selected RLFV in the prediction model on the reliability of genomic prediction  assuming that rare causal variants explained a small proportion of the genetic variance. In these simulations  quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) were simulated by randomly drawing RLFV from genes based on the assumption that the power of detecting RLFV can be improved when combining RLFV  each with a supposedly small effect  within a gene or genomic region. Three scenarios were simulated: SQTN (QTN simulated with a small effect): seven to ten genes were randomly selected per chromosome and the RLFV from these genes were simulated as QTN. MQTN (QTN simulated with a medium effect): one gene per chromosome was randomly selected and the RLFV within these genes were simulated as QTN. LQTN (QTN simulated with a large effect): nine genes were randomly selected across the whole genome and the RLFV in these genes were simulated as QTN. From scenario (1) to (3)  the number of simulated QTN decreased  while the variance explained by each QTN increased. Therefore  we expected a gradual increase in the power of detection of the simulated rare QTN from scenario (1) to (3). Effects for the rare QTN were sampled from a normal distribution . The true breeding values for the simulated rare QTN for all individuals [denoted as a column vector ()] were calculated as: where  is the genotype matrix including the rare QTN (one row per animal)  and  is the column vector of QTN effects. Then  the values in  were scaled such that the variance jointly explained by the rare QTN was equal to 10% of the estimated genetic variance explained by the SNPs on the 50 k chip. Finally  the scaled  for each individual was added to the fertility DRP to obtain the simulated phenotypes i.e.   where  is the simulated phenotype and DRP is the observed phenotype. The total variance explained by these simulated QTN was equal to 10% of the estimated genetic variance explained by the markers on the 50 k chip  i.e. 14.5. Thus  for the simulated data  a heritability of 0.485 (i.e. (14.5<U+2009>+<U+2009>145)/328.8) was obtained and used  since the observed heritability for fertility was 0.441. For each of the three simulation scenarios  we tested three strategies for selecting RLFV to include in the subsequent genomic prediction step: Genotypes of the simulated QTN were used to compute the second GRM used in prediction model  and thus we assumed that the QTN were known without error. The RLFV from 10 randomly selected genes per chromosome were added to the simulated QTN to construct the second GRM in the prediction model  with none of these variants having a simulated effect. The second strategy mimicked real situations more closely  i.e. in which false positive associations add noise in the prediction model. The RLFV were selected based on significance of association mapping (see subset (4) in “” section). Each simulation scenario was replicated 10 times  thus the reported reliabilities and the measure of bias estimated by the slope of the regression of the sum of DRP and  on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) were averaged across replicates. Standard errors of these average values were calculated as the standard deviation of the results across the 10 replicates divided by . Due to computational limitations  the simulations were undertaken only for fertility  and the rare variant association mapping (second strategy) was applied only to one randomly selected replicate. The GBLUP model was used to predict genomic breeding values using the following model: where  is the vector of phenotypes   is a vector of 1s   is the general mean  and  is the design matrix which allocates  to . Vector  contains random additive genetic effects with a variance of   where  is the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) calculated following VanRaden’s method 1 []: where  is the allele sharing matrix with the number of copies of the second allele.  is a vector with allele frequencies ( is the frequency of the second allele at locus ) and  is a vector of 1s. The factor  scales  to be comparable to the pedigree-based relationship matrix. An alternative GBLUP model is: which is used in the analysis when two GRM were fitted simultaneously. The symbols in Model (2) were the same as in Model (1). The vectors  and  were the two random additive genetic effects corresponding to the two GRM. The two GRM are computed with the same formula as in Model (1). Model (1) with the GRM built using 50 k genotype data was used as the reference model for comparisons with other approaches. Genomic prediction with selected RLFV were done using Model (2) in which the first GRM was based on 50 k data and the second GRM was built using the RLFV selected by one of the strategies as described above. Estimation of variance components and prediction of breeding values were carried out using the DMU software []. For each index trait  the 1000 youngest bulls with a birth date between 23/07/2005 and 14/01/2009 were used as validation bulls. The remaining bulls (4043 for fertility  3926 for health and 3673 for longevity) born before 23/07/2005 were used as training data. The reliability of genomic prediction was measured as the squared correlation between GEBV and DRP divided by the mean reliability of DRP for validation individuals  i.e. . Standard errors for the accuracies  i.e. the square roots of the reliabilities  were approximated using   where  is the size of the training data []. A measure of bias was estimated by the slope of the regression of DRP on GEBV in the validation dataset: i.e. . Any deviation from 1 in this regression slope is an indication of bias of the scale of the GEBV. The total number of genic RLFV ranged from 1 585 116 to 1 605 553 across the three index traits (see Additional file : Table S1). Based on the association test  0.4–1.2% genic RLFV of the total number of RLFV were selected across the three index traits. Less than 1% of the RLFV had high impact annotations  while less than 3% of the total RLFV had medium-to-high impact annotations (see Additional file : Table S1). The reliabilities of genomic prediction obtained by using different sets of selected RLFV are in Table . The reliability of prediction obtained with the 50 k data was used as the reference scenario to compare alternative scenarios for each index trait. Reliabilities are presented on a scale from 0 to 100%  and hereafter absolute changes in reliabilities  i.e. changes in percentage points  are reported. Adding an additional component with either all genic or a subset of selected RLFV into the model to the 50 k component changed the reliability by -<U+2009>2.2 to 1.1%. Thus  on average the prediction reliability hardly changed  regardless of how the RLFV were selected (Table ). For the scenario that showed the largest improvement in reliability of prediction (i.e. 0.7% obtained by adding RLFV with medium-to-high impact annotations for the health index)  we tested whether the improvement of the reliability of prediction was the result of simply increasing the number of RLFV in the model. We observed that adding a similar number of randomly selected RLFV increased reliability on average by 0.6% across 10 different random subsets. This suggests that the observed small improvement for the health index is due to the addition of a considerable number of genic RLFV  and not necessarily to the addition of RLFV with medium-to-high impact annotations. When RLFV with high impact annotations were added as an additional genetic component  the reliability of prediction decreased for all three index traits. To gain more insight into these observations  we compared the estimates of variance components using different marker sets in the prediction models (Table ). For all three index traits  the variance explained by the RLFV was largest when all genic RLFV were included in the prediction model  followed by the scenarios with RLFV with medium and high impact annotations  while the genic RLFV selected by association mapping always explained the smallest genetic variance. We observed that the bias of the GEBV measured by regression slope for health and longevity was reduced by adding increasingly more RLFV  regardless of how they were selected (Table ). However  the bias of the GEBV measured by regression slope was increased for fertility when adding increasingly more RLFV (Table ). Across all three index traits  these results show that adding increasingly more RLFV  leads to an increasingly larger variance of the GEBV. To validate the potential impact of including rare causal variants in the model on the reliability of genomic prediction  we simulated genic RLFV as QTN and re-estimated the reliabilities of prediction using similar strategies to select RLFV used for prediction. In our study  only one replicate was randomly selected from each simulation scenario (Tables    and )  because computational limitations prohibited the mapping of genic RLFV for all 10 replicates. Results across all 10 replicates for all scenarios  except that based on association mapping of genic RLFV  are in Tables S2  S3 and S4 (see Additional file : Tables S2  Additional file : S3  Additional file : S4). The numbers of selected genic RLFV in the different scenarios from one replicate are in Table . The number of genic RLFV simulated as QTN ranged from 235 to 21 468. When all simulated QTN were included with the 50 k SNPs  the prediction reliabilities improved from 3.4% for the MQTN simulation scenario to 6.8% for the SQTN simulation scenario (Table ). Adding randomly selected genic RLFV (without a simulated effect) to the simulated QTN  decreased the reliability from 1.2% in the SQTN simulation scenario to 4.3% in the LQTN simulation scenario compared with all simulated QTN included in the prediction model (Table ). Across all simulation scenarios  adding genic RLFV from significant association mapping improved the reliability of prediction from 1.3% for the MQTN simulation scenario to 4.0% for the SQTN scenario compared to when 50 k SNPs were included in the prediction model (Table ). We observed that the bias of the GEBV measured by regression slope was smallest when all QTN and the 50 k SNPs were included in the model (Table ). Similar to the observed increase in prediction reliability when all simulated QTN and the 50 k SNPs were included for one replicate  the average prediction reliabilities improved from 1.9% for the SQTN scenario to 4.3% for the MQTN scenario across 10 replicates of each simulation scenario (see Additional file : Table S3). When randomly selected genic RLFV (without a simulated effect) were added to the simulated QTN  reliabilities decreased from 1.9% for the SQTN scenario to 3.0% for the MQTN scenario compared to when only simulated QTN (see Additional file : Table S3). Moreover  we observed that the bias of the GEBV measured by regression slope averaged across the 10 replicates decreased for all simulation scenarios when genic RLFV were added in the prediction model regardless of how they were selected (see Additional file : Table S4). Earlier studies showed that using all imputed whole-genome sequence variants did not improve the reliability of genomic prediction []  but it increased when using QTL derived from whole-genome sequence data [    ]. Specifically  our aim was to examine empirically the impact of using selected RLFV from imputed whole-genome sequence data on the reliability of genomic prediction. We expected an improvement in the reliability of genomic prediction for the fitness-related traits fertility  health and longevity index by including imputed RLFV that jointly explained 13.3 to 24.6% of the explained DRP variance for these index traits in Nordic Holsteins []. Across the selection strategies applied here  the RLFV explained 4.0 to 31.1% of the explained DRP variance  but this was not reflected by changes in genomic prediction reliabilities  which varied by -<U+2009>2.2 to 1.1%. This result is in line with the observation that the 50 k SNPs are able to capture most of the variance explained by the RLFV (Table ). This lack of improvement  and even decrease  in prediction reliabilities when using such selection strategies may be due to differences in imputation accuracy for the different selected subsets. An average imputation accuracy of 0.79 was found for the high impact annotation variants and of 0.81 for medium-to-high impact annotation variants  both these values being lower than the average value for all RLFV (0.85). However  it is unlikely that the decrease in prediction reliability using the high compared to the medium-to-high impact annotated RLFV is due to either this small difference in imputation accuracy or to a difference in MAF (the MAF for high impact annotation variants was on average 0.0162 and the MAF for medium-to-high impact variants was on average 0.0166). The main difference between the medium-to-high and high impact variants  is that the former group contained<U+2009>~<U+2009>19 times more variants compared to the latter group. The fact that the reliabilities achieved with the medium-to-high impact variants were closer to those obtained in the scenario using all genic RLFV suggests that the benefit of this scenario may be due simply to the inclusion of many more RLFV. This is also in line with results of Hayes et al. [] and Do et al. []. Low MAF levels imply that RLFV are only observed in a relatively small number of individuals  and some RLFV may be segregating only in either the training or validation population. Thus  such RLFV may contribute only slightly to the predictive ability at the population level. However  when we investigated this issue  we found that  in all cases  more than 92% of all genic RLFV were segregating in both the training and validation populations (see Additional file : Table S5). Thus  although the RLFV may be family-specific  in our data  they did have the potential to contribute to the predictive reliability. Previous studies also showed that using sequence variants or preselected sequence variants  regardless of their MAF  yielded no or only marginal improvements in the accuracy of genomic prediction in dairy cattle [    ]. Related to this  Caballero et al. [] showed that rare variants contribute little genetic variation to the phenotypic variation and are difficult to detect by GWAS. In the latter study  simulations were used to show that the common mutations of large effects are responsible for most of the genetic variation for quantitative traits except fitness []. However  we did observe that the bias of the GEBV measured by regression slope was slightly reduced when adding selected RLFV regardless of how they were selected for the health and longevity traits (Table ) and also for the simulated datasets (see Additional file : Table S4). This result was also in line with the findings in [  ]. The selection scenario based on association mapping to identify the genic RLFV to be included in the prediction model  did not outperform predictions based on the 50 k data  in the analyses of the empirical data. This apparently low power of the selection scenario based on association mapping may have several causes. We used composite indices as phenotypes and these indices are a combination of several traits  and therefore the power to detect rare variants may be lower than for “ordinary” traits. Even if there was sufficient power to detect rare variants  their contribution in the prediction of composite indices may have been diluted in the index. As previously mentioned  using imputed rather than actual sequence data also reduces power. Moreover  the power to identify rare variants is low unless these variants or the combined RLFV in a gene or region have a large effect and a large sample size is used. For example  for a rare QTL that explains 0.1% of the total genetic variance  the power is not sufficient to identify it with the existing sample sizes of e.g. 5000 in dairy cattle []. In human studies  a very large sample size was used to detect associations of rare variants with phenotypes or diseases such as 60 564 individuals used for association mapping of rare variants with type 2 diabetes [  ]. In our study  only<U+2009>~<U+2009>5000 cattle individuals were available. It should be noted that the phenotypes used in this study are DRP based on large progeny groups  which have a minimal residual variance  and thus provide much stronger detection power than the own phenotypes used in human studies. Meanwhile  the number of detected genes containing RLFV was relatively large (see Additional file : Table S1)  which suggests that it includes many false positives. Thus  the power to detect rare QTL for the real data of health-related traits was relatively low  and consequently adding selected RLFV in the prediction models did not only add extra information  but also noise. Previously  Perez-Enciso et al. [] showed that the potential benefit of including causal loci in genomic prediction quickly disappears when there are too many incorrectly identified loci. This is supported by the results from our simulation scenarios that showed a small gain in reliability from using the mapped genic RLFV. Finally  the common SNPs genotyped on the 50 k array are  apparently  able to explain part of the trait variance due to the genic RLFV  leaving little room for improvement when adding genic RLFV to the model. The small effective population size in dairy cattle results in long range linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the whole genome and the common variants may be able to capture part of the effect from the genic RLFV due to co-segregation of QTL and marker alleles because of close family relationships []. We used a simulation to study these issues with selected RLFV in genomic prediction. Our results confirmed that adding non-causal RLFV to causal RLFV in the prediction model  indeed adds noise and considerably reduces the predictive ability. When significant genic RLFV from gene mapping were selected in the prediction model  the estimated variance component for genic RLFV was similar to the variance explained by the simulated QTN for all scenarios  in line with the improvement in predictive ability (see Additional file : Table S6). However  inclusion of the simulated QTN in the prediction model resulted in a larger improvement of the reliability compared to when significant genic RLFV from gene mapping were used (Table ). These results suggest that improvement in prediction reliability can be achieved  provided that data with sufficient power is available to identify the causal RLFV affecting complex traits. We compared genomic prediction reliabilities using either only 50 k SNPs  or both 50 k SNPs and genic RLFV that were selected based on their association with the index trait studied or annotations of RLFV. Using either a selected subset of RLFV or all the genic RLFV  at best  marginally improved the reliability of genomic prediction  but decreased it in several cases (the change in reliability ranged from -<U+2009>2.2 to 1.1%). Several reasons can explain these results  including low imputation accuracies for RLFV  a limited power to map genic RLFV with the existing sample size  and the fact that common variants on the 50 k chip are able to capture a large proportion of variance due to genic RLFV. However  we showed by using simulations that prediction reliability increased slightly when significant genic RLFV from association mapping were included in the prediction model and increased substantially when the known rare QTN were added as a separate genetic component in the model  but this added benefit was much reduced when adding additional random genic RLFV. This indicates that prediction reliability can be improved by using both 50 k data and selected genic RLFV  provided that the RLFV that explain a sizable variance in the index traits of interest are identified  without adding too many false positives that cause noise in the model.

Local breeds  which are well adapted to a range of agro-ecological conditions  contribute to ensuring the sustainability of livestock farming in marginal and difficult areas in both developed and developing countries. Compared to other livestock species  goats have been domesticated in a single region and subject to a limited amount of hybridization between breeds  thus they represent one of the best species for the study of genetic diversity and adaptation.The International Goat Genome Consortium (IGGC  ) was created in 2012 with the general goal of increasing the range of genomic tools and publicly available information for the goat. In 2013  the 50 K goat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel was developed (; []) by combining whole-genome sequencing and reduced representation libraries from eight breeds/populations from Europe and Asia through the cooperation of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Inra) in France  Utrecht University in The Netherlands  the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) in Malaysia  and DNA Landmarks in Canada.Several large projects took advantage of this newly-developed SNP panel to genotype many goat populations across the world with a range of objectives and hypotheses: genome-wide association analyses across a spectrum of research and production traits  germplasm characterization and diversity studies  and genetic prediction for selection in commercial populations.The AdaptMap project started as a voluntary consortium in 2014  with the aim of improving coordination among these otherwise independent projects for genotyping  resequencing and phenotyping of goat breeds. AdaptMap was promoted by the International Goat Genome Consortium (IGGC)  the African Goat Improvement Network (AGIN)  which is a group resulting from the USAID Feed the Future (FtF)  the USDA Livestock Improvement Project  the European Union sponsored  3SR—Sustainable Solutions for Small ruminants and NEXTGEN projects."

Local breeds  which are well adapted to a range of agro-ecological conditions  contribute to ensuring the sustainability of livestock farming in marginal and difficult areas in both developed and developing countries. Compared to other livestock species  goats have been domesticated in a single region and subject to a limited amount of hybridization between breeds  thus they represent one of the best species for the study of genetic diversity and adaptation. The International Goat Genome Consortium (IGGC  ) was created in 2012 with the general goal of increasing the range of genomic tools and publicly available information for the goat. In 2013  the 50 K goat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel was developed (; []) by combining whole-genome sequencing and reduced representation libraries from eight breeds/populations from Europe and Asia through the cooperation of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Inra) in France  Utrecht University in The Netherlands  the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) in Malaysia  and DNA Landmarks in Canada. Several large projects took advantage of this newly-developed SNP panel to genotype many goat populations across the world with a range of objectives and hypotheses: genome-wide association analyses across a spectrum of research and production traits  germplasm characterization and diversity studies  and genetic prediction for selection in commercial populations. The AdaptMap project started as a voluntary consortium in 2014  with the aim of improving coordination among these otherwise independent projects for genotyping  resequencing and phenotyping of goat breeds. AdaptMap was promoted by the International Goat Genome Consortium (IGGC)  the African Goat Improvement Network (AGIN)  which is a group resulting from the USAID Feed the Future (FtF)  the USDA Livestock Improvement Project  the European Union sponsored  3SR—Sustainable Solutions for Small ruminants and NEXTGEN projects. To collect  store and standardize data from many different sources  input tools and a relational database were developed and made accessible to all consortium partners. Provision of data was regulated by a data transfer agreement and uploading was facilitated through a user-friendly graphical interface that allowed users to drag and drop files to the server. A special focus was placed on security to ensure that the data were not compromised in any way. The first phase of submission and study  to which the series of AdaptMap papers in GSE refer to  accepted data until November 2015. At that point  the AdaptMap raw dataset included 4653 animals sampled from across the world and represented 148 populations  35 countries and five continents. Figures          and  illustrate the geographical distribution of the sampled breeds. In Europe (Fig. )  43 populations were sampled  which comprise commercial international transboundary breeds (e.g. Alpine  Saanen)  large populations of locally-adapted transboundary breeds (such as Sarda) and local breeds with small population sizes. A wide range of geo-climatic environments was represented  including the alpine region  productive prairie areas of central Europe  UK and Ireland  the mostly hot and arid regions of southern Spain and small islands and the Carpathians. In Africa (Fig. )  70 populations were sampled. The sampling locations comprised a wide range of agro-ecological zones  climates and geographical features. The contribution from the AGIN project was substantial. Both arid climates of North Africa (e.g. Egypt  Tunisia  and Mali) and more humid areas of Sub-Saharan Africa were included. The 21 populations sampled in Western Asia (Fig. ) included the Bezoar and local goat breeds sampled near the putative centre of domestication (Iranian goat) and along important paths of diversification towards Europe. Pakistani breeds were also represented. The samples from North America (Fig. ) included both original local breeds  such as La Mancha  exotic breeds such as the New Zealand Kiko  and some populations with peculiar characteristics such as the island goat San Clemente  summed to six breeds. Climates varied from the arid region of Texas to the more temperate northern east coast. South American (Fig. ) contributions totalled six breeds from Brazil and Argentina  which originate from very different latitudes  including the local Canindè and Moxoto. Finally  Australia and New Zealand (Fig. ) samples from three breeds were provided  with rangeland uniquely represented in the dataset by sampling sites in the western part of the continent. For 11 breeds  populations sampled in more than one geographical location. In particular  the Boer and Saanen represented seven and six populations  respectively. Samples were available from four Angora populations and three each from Alpine  Landrace and Small East African breeds. Admixed Boer  Malya  Nubian  Toggenburg and West African Dwarf were each sampled from two populations. Geographical distribution of the sampled breeds in Europe Geographical distribution of the sampled breeds in Africa Geographical distribution of the sampled breeds in Asia Geographical distribution of the sampled breeds in North America Geographical distribution of the sampled breeds in South America Geographical distribution of the sampled breeds in Oceania The Illumina GoatSNP50 BeadChip [] that includes 53 347 SNPs was used to genotype all the animals. Prior to analyses described in the papers of this series  marker positions were re-mapped on the new goat reference sequence ARS1 []. After populating the database  quality control was performed on the whole set using the Plink 1.9 software []. Individuals and SNPs that did not pass the following thresholds were removed: individual genotype call rate higher than 0.96  SNP call rate higher than 0.98  and identity-by-state (IBS) between genotypes (compared pairwise based on all markers) less than 0.99. Moreover  SNPs that were completely monomorphic over the whole dataset were also removed. To identify individuals with high relatedness (e.g. parent–offspring pairs)  we calculated the number of Mendelian errors (ME) in pairwise comparisons of all individuals with a locally-developed script. Animals that were most frequently found in pairs with less than 100 ME were removed. The dataset included 12 crossbred populations: admixed Boer  Galla x Saanen  Matabele cross  admixed Mubende  Old Irish Goat cross  Saanen x ANB  Saanen x Creole  admixed Small East African  Small East African x Alpine  Small East African x Galla  Small East African x Saanen  and Small East African x Toggenburg. These populations were excluded from the analyses for the study of diversity and selection signatures but they do represent an interesting resource for further investigation on adaptation and performances. Similarly  six populations (Bagot  Gishu  Myotonic  Old English  San Clemente  and Tete) were represented by fewer than three animals; for this reason  they were not considered in the study on diversity. Breeds with large populations from multiple locations (Alpine  Angora  Boer  Landrance  Nubian  Saanen) were split to account for the area of origin. Populations with more than 50 individuals were randomly thinned to 50. The general scope of the AdaptMap project was to investigate diversity in the goat with a focus on the impact of domestication  adaptation associated with local environmental conditions  and adaptation in response to selection for production systems. The ultimate goal is to enable sustainable breeding by leveraging the use of genomic information. Towards these aims  study groups were organized to make best use of the available genotypic information  and by analytical themes. The first phase of the project addressed by the AdaptMap consortium focused on population genetics analyses and population history  selection signatures  landscape genomics  visible genetic profiles  and the identification of a panel of parentage SNPs. The series of papers published here provide the first reports of the major results from these investigations. Among the major results obtained  perhaps the most striking was the corroboration of prior observations and results  and of our hypothesis that close associations exist between the genomes of goat breeds and geographical measures. On a large scale  the studied populations could be partitioned quite distinctly into groups according to continental origin. Three major gene pools were clearly identified  corresponding to goats from Europe  Africa and western Asia. Within these three pools  the patterns of variation were consistent with measures of “distance” in geography  human history and common animal husbandry practices. Specifically  the greatest genetic variability was observed for populations from western Asia  near to the putative center of domestication  with relatively little differentiation among breeds within these regions. Within the other two gene pools  patterns of variation obeyed geographical rules  both on “macro” and “micro” levels. On the macro level  both overall genetic variation and similarity with the western Asian populations tended to decrease for populations sampled from regions located further from western Asia. On the micro level  the variation observed was consistent with expectations associated with recognized paths of human migration out of the Fertile Crescent region. Comparing the European and African gene pools  European breeds tended to be more discreet  which is consistent with the practice of creating breeds through active human-controlled genetic isolation  rather than allowing breeds to form as a result of climatic influence and geographic barriers. Greater gene flow among populations was observed in Africa. Within both these pools  the genetic impacts of particular instances of geographic isolation were clearly observed  inasmuch as populations from Iceland  Madagascar and the Canary and Balearic Islands tended to have longer and more numerous runs of homozygosity. Various putative “hotspots” of runs of homozygosity were observed  and occasionally these hotspots were unique across continental groups. Geography-based signatures of selection were also identified  the strongest of which was associated with mean annual temperature. Some of the signatures of selection observed correspond to signatures that were reported previously in independent analyses of goats. Finally  a highly informative panel for parentage assessment was developed to assist breeding in goat populations worldwide. AdaptMap has now completed the first phase of its planned research but the cooperation generated from the shared objectives  collaborations and large accumulated data offer new opportunities to explore the goat genome. The discovery of additional geographical and ecological differences  individual mutations for traits  disease susceptibility and phenotypic differences will help to provide clues into the amazing adaptability of the goat worldwide and its importance to livestock production.

Using the goat SNP50 BeadChip  we genotyped 3171 goats belonging to 117 populations with a worldwide distribution. Our objectives were to characterize the number and length of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and to detect ROH hotspots in order to gain new insights into the consequences of neutral and selection processes on the genome-wide homozygosity patterns of goats.ResultsThe proportion of the goat genome covered by ROH is  in general  less than 15% with an inverse relationship between ROH length and frequency i.e. short ROH (<<U+2009>3 Mb) are the most frequent ones. Our data also indicate that ~<U+2009>60% of the breeds display low  coefficients (<<U+2009>0.10)  while ~<U+2009>30 and ~<U+2009>10% of the goat populations show moderate (0.10<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>0.20) or high (><U+2009>0.20)  values. For populations from Asia  the average number of ROH is smaller and their coverage is lower in goats from the Near East than in goats from Central Asia  which is consistent with the role of the Fertile Crescent as the primary centre of goat domestication. We also observed that local breeds with small population sizes tend to have a larger fraction of the genome covered by ROH compared to breeds with tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals. Five regions on three goat chromosomes i.e. 11  12 and 18  contain ROH hotspots that overlap with signatures of selection.ConclusionsPatterns of homozygosity (average number of ROH of 77 and genome coverage of 248 Mb; <U+2009><<U+2009>0.15) are similar in goats from different geographic areas. The increased homozygosity in local breeds is the consequence of their small population size and geographic isolation as well as of founder effects and recent inbreeding. The existence of three ROH hotspots that co-localize with signatures of selection demonstrates that selection has also played an important role in increasing the homozygosity of specific regions in the goat genome. Finally  most of the goat breeds analysed in this work display low levels of homozygosity  which is favourable for their genetic management and viability."

Finally  most of the goat breeds analysed in this work display low levels of homozygosity  which is favourable for their genetic management and viability. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) can be defined as genomic regions that display a series of consecutive homozygous genotypes []. Their length and frequency depend on a complex array of factors including demography  recombination  and selection []. There is convincing evidence that demographic history has had a key influence on the genomic patterns of homozygosity in several domestic animal species []. While long ROH reflect recent inbreeding  which can be caused by population decline  unbalanced paternal contributions and selection  short and abundant ROH are often due to ancestral family relatedness []. Local recombination rate is negatively correlated with ROH frequency because recombination events decrease the probability that an individual possesses two copies of the same long haplotype []. In pigs  the largest ROH are more frequent in regions of low recombination and ROH distribution is negatively correlated with GC content []. Regions of low recombination were also detected across the sheep genome []. Selection is another important evolutionary force that can increase homozygosity. Positive selection to improve productive/reproductive traits and maintain breed standards can also decrease variability in targeted regions of the genome  and therefore ROH might result from footprints of selection (signatures of selection) [  ]. The recent availability of a caprine high-throughput genotyping chip [] and a reference goat genome [  ] has made it possible to characterize the genomic patterns of homozygosity of several populations from Egypt []  Spain and Africa []  Switzerland [] and Italy []. Moreover  combining information provided by the genomic distribution of ROH and selection statistics (e.g.   iHS and hapFLK) has facilitated the identification of several genomic regions under positive selection in goats [    ]. However  a comprehensive picture of the genome-wide patterns of homozygosity in goats sampled at a worldwide scale is still lacking. By comparing a wide range of caprine populations that differ in geographic origin  inbreeding and admixture levels and that undergo different management and selection pressures  we investigated the impact of such factors on the abundance and distribution of ROH in the goat genome. The AdaptMap dataset was initially composed of samples collected from 4653 goats from 130 breeds and 14 crossbred populations that were genotyped with the Goat SNP50 BeadChip; SNP genomic coordinates were based on the ARS1 reference genome []. Animal and SNP quality filtering were performed with the PLINK software [  ] and in-house scripts by applying the following criteria of exclusion: (1) individual genotype call rate lower than 0.96; (2) SNP call rate lower than 0.98; (3) minor allele frequency<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 i.e. no monomorphic markers in the whole dataset; and (4) unmapped SNPs or SNPs on sex chromosomes. Highly related individuals (pairwise identity-by-state higher than 0.99) were also removed from the dataset. Moreover  in populations with more than 50 individuals  a random sampling selection procedure implemented in the BITE R package [] was used to retrieve representative samples of 50 individuals for use in further analyses. For additional details  see []. In all analyses  only populations with more than 10 animals were considered  except for the comparison of ROH patterns in purebred versus admixed populations  for which all crossbred populations were taken into consideration regardless of their sample size. After these filtering steps  the final dataset included 3171 animals belonging to 105 breeds and 12 crossbred populations (see Additional file : Table S1) and 46 654 SNPs. To investigate the factors that influence the patterns of homozygosity in the goat genome  we performed comparisons based on (1) population characteristics  (2) geographical origin and (3) sampling locations of transboundary breeds. This comparison was based on three population characteristics: (1) large versus small size populations  where breeds with a small population size include a few hundreds or thousands of individuals and breeds with a large population size have a census of at least 20 000 individuals  although most of them are in the range of hundreds of thousands of individuals or even millions; (2) traditional versus improved breeds: improved breeds are those that have undergone intensive programs of selection for milk i.e. Maltese  Murciana  Toggenburg or Saanen or meat (e.g. Boer); and (3) crossbreds versus purebred breeds  when available in the dataset. Goats were sampled from: (1) America (South America  no subgroups); (2) Oceania (no subgroups); (3) Asia (Central Asia and Near East subgroups); (4) Europe (Central Europe  North Europe  and South Europe subgroups) and (5) Africa (Central West Africa  East Africa  North Africa and South Africa subgroups). Transboundary breeds collected from multiple locations (Alpine  Boer  Angora  Nubian  and Saanen) were split into subpopulations according to the geographic area where they were sampled (all subgroups were represented by at least 10 animals). We used the Zanardi software [] for ROH analysis of each individual with the following parameters: ROH_SNP (minimum number of SNPs to call a ROH)<U+2009>=<U+2009>15; ROH_MAXMIS (maximum number of missing SNP per ROH)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1; ROH_MAXHET (maximum number of heterozygous SNP per ROH)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and ROH_MINLEN (minimum length—in Mb—of ROH)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1. For each breed  the average fraction of the genome that contains ROH was calculated () by considering the total length (2.92 Gb) of the most recent caprine assembly version ARS1 []. For each animal  we calculated the number of detected ROH and ROH coverage. Then  for Comparisons (1) and (2)  we used a generalized least squares model implemented in the  package (R software v.2.15.3) by assuming inequality of the variances associated with each one of the two parameters outlined above (ROH number and coverage) and each group: where  is a vector of the fixed effect “breed” ( levels)   is an incidence matrix relating  to   and  is a positive-definite matrix of the variances and covariances of the within-group errors. For full details of this methodology  see Pinheiro and Bates []. For both analyses of ROH number and genome coverage  the least square means of each subgeographical group were then compared on a pairwise basis with a Wald univariate test of significance [] and multiple testing was adjusted with the Bonferroni correction. In Comparison (2)  ROH were classified into seven length classes (0–3 Mb  3–5 Mb  5–10 Mb  10–15 Mb  15–20 Mb  20–25 Mb  and > 30<U+2009>Mb). For each subgroup and length class  ROH were summed and averaged according to the number of animals included in each subgroup. The –save option was used to retain the output derived from the analyses that provided  for each SNP  the percentage of animals that have a ROH in a given position ( score). This information was used to detect ROH hotspots across the goat genome by considering regions that contained at least three SNPs above the top 0.998 of the overall SNP distribution. The  score that represents this distribution varied between comparisons. Then  we performed a gene search within the common ROH hotspots by using the most recent available annotated genome version  ARS1 []. For transboundary breeds that were raised in multiple countries  the summary statistics of the percentage of animals that have a ROH in a given position were calculated for each country and breed and then standardized to compare the locus-specific divergence for each location based on  score: where  is the difference in  scores between two subpopulations  and   and () and () denote the expected value and standard deviation of  between the th and th sub-populations. These analyses were performed by using the R computing environment () and implementing the approach suggested by Akey et al. [] and modified by Bertolini et al. []. To provide a detailed view of the divergence between each country classification  we carried out the comparisons by contrasting the standard deviation of a subpopulation sampled in a given country versus all the subpopulations raised in the remaining countries where the transboundary breed was sampled. For the Nubian transboundary breed  which in our dataset was exclusively distributed in Egypt and Argentina  the comparison was made on a pairwise basis. Genomic regions that were represented by at least three consecutive SNPs and displayed the largest differences in  scores (SHD<U+2009>><U+2009>5) were considered in these analyses. The average fraction of the genome that contains ROH in each analyzed breed is provided in Additional file : Figure S1 and Additional file : Table S2. These data show that ~<U+2009>60% of the breeds display low  coefficients (<<U+2009>0.10)  while ~<U+2009>30 and ~<U+2009>10% of the populations show moderate (0.10<U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>0.20) or high (><U+2009>0.20)  values. A high variability in the magnitude of  coefficients within breeds was also observed in our dataset. It is interesting to note that several of the caprine populations with the highest  values are raised on islands and have undergone prolonged geographic isolation (see Additional file : Figure S1 and Additional file : Table S2)  and this is further discussed in an accompanying paper []. Other goat breeds with high  coefficients were four breeds from Pakistan: Kachan (KAC)  Kamori (KAM)  Bari (BRI) and Barbari (BAB) (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20–0.25)  and Boer (BOE)  one of the most improved goat breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.21). Figures      and  and Additional file : Table S3  show the number and length of ROH per individual (p.i.) divided by sub-geographical groups (Comparison 2). The average number and length of ROH calculated across all the animals in the comparison were equal to 77 ROH and 248 Mb. Results of the comparison of the least square means between the sub-geographical groups are in Additional file : Table S4. All the comparisons showed significant differences (P <<U+2009>0.05)  for at least one of the two parameters considered (ROH number and coverage)  except for Central_Asia-North_Europe  Central_Europe-North_Africa  Central_Europe-Oceania  Central_Europe-South_Europe  Central_Western_Africa-East_Africa  Near_East-North_Africa  North_Africa-South_Europe  North_Africa-Oceania and Oceania-South_Europe. It is interesting to note that the average ROH number and coverage for goats from Oceania (49 ROH and 182.19 Mb) were significantly lower (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) than those for goats from America (136 ROH and 333 Mb)  see Fig.  and Additional file : Table S3 and Table S4. This group of Oceania goats had also the lowest standard deviation for both ROH regions and ROH coverage among all comparisons (see Additional file : Table S3). For goats from Asia (Fig. )  the average ROH number and coverage were significantly lower in goats from the Near East (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  with 60 ROH and 210.64 Mb  than from Central Asia (90 ROH and 260.64 Mb). As shown in Figs.  and   several insular European (e.g. Icelandic) and African (e.g. goats from Madagascar) breeds showed large ROH numbers (><U+2009>400) and high ROH coverage (1000–2000 Mb).

Results of the comparison between continental breeds that have large population sizes (tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals  Murciano-Granadina  Malagueña  Carpathian  Saanen  etc.) and local breeds with relatively small population sizes are in Fig. a and Additional file : Table S5. In terms of ROH number  the difference between both groups is very significant with local breeds tending to have a larger fraction of the genome covered by ROH. The comparison of highly selected meat and dairy breeds versus traditional populations  in which selection pressure is much lower  highlights remarkable differences in ROH number and coverage (Fig. b) and (see Additional file : Table S5)  with the highest values found for the improved transboundary Boer  Saanen and Toggenburg breeds. In contrast  goats with the highest ROH coverage (><U+2009>750 Mb) belong to traditional breeds such as Valdostana and Landrace (Fig. b). This difference between crossbred and purebred populations (Fig. c) and (see Additional file : Table S5) demonstrates that  as expected  total ROH length and number are significantly smaller (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) in crossbred populations. Genomic patterns of homozygosity in a selected set of populations specialized in either dairy or meat traits with  small (blue) and large (red) size   subject to a moderate/strong (blue) or mild (red) selection and  crossbred (blue) and purebred (red) genetic composition.

Among the six ROH classes under consideration  short ROH (<<U+2009>3 Mb) are the most frequent ones in all populations  with a wide distribution that spans from an average of 33 ROH p.i. in Central European goats to 144 ROH p.i. in South African goats. The distribution of the 3–10 Mb and 10–30 Mb length classes ranged between 1.4 (Central West Africa) to 20 (South Africa) ROH p.i. and 2.2 (Central West Africa) to 24 (North Europe) ROH p.i.  respectively. Finally  the largest ROH class (><U+2009>30 Mb) was the rarest one  with frequencies ranging from 0.3 (East and South Africa) to 1.4 (North Europe) ROH p.i. Mean sum of runs of homozygosity per genotyped animal. For each animal  the sum of ROH for each length class (0–3 Mb  3–5 Mb  5–10 Mb  10–20 Mb  20–30 Mb  > 30<U+2009>Mb) was calculated and averaged across the different geographical groups Analyses across the continental and subcontinental divisions revealed several partial or complete ROH overlaps (top 0.998 regions) across all populations listed in Additional file : Table S4. Several ROH were exclusively present in goats from a single continent. For instance  on  chromosome (CHI) CHI18  the 1.7-Mb (14.64–16.38 Mb) and 842-kb ROH (26.83–27.67 Mb) were specific to Asian and American breeds  respectively. Moreover  six ROH ranging in size from 107 kb to 1 Mb on CHI3 (110.15–111.16 Mb)  CHI5 (95.67–96.54 Mb)  CHI7 (59.82–59.92 Mb)  CHI8 (43.94–44.62 Mb)  CHI11 (94.23–94.50 Mb) and CHI12 (48.30–48.44 Mb) were exclusively detected in goats from Oceania. Five regions on three chromosomes  i.e. CHI11  12 and 18  contained ROH that are present in the highest percentage of animals (Fig. ). A ROH on CHI11 (37.79–38.33 Mb) was particularly frequent in European and African goats. Three regions on CHI12 were also highly homozygous in a broad array of populations i.e. 43.63–44.53 Mb (Europe)  50.02–51.38 Mb (all continents) and 60.11–61.02 Mb (Europe  Africa  Oceania and Asia). Finally  one ROH on CHI18 (36.22–37.01 Mb) was highly frequent in goats from Europe  Africa  and Asia (see Additional file : Table S6). Overall  these regions contained 68 annotated coding genes (see Additional file : Table S6)  including  ()   ()  and  (). Incidence of each SNP in a run of homozygosity across the worldwide goat dataset. The red line indicates the threshold of 26% corresponding to the 0.998 percentile of the overall SNP distribution We compared the patterns of homozygosity in transboundary breeds raised in different locations based on the  scores derived from the locus-specific divergence analyses (see Additional file ; and Additional file : Table S7). In general  subpopulations from one transboundary breed did not show marked differences in their homozygosity parameters. However  several genomic regions diverged significantly between subpopulations. In the Alpine breed  sampled in Italy (IT)  Switzerland (CH) and France (FR)  two regions of about 760 kb on CHI3 (91.54–92.29 Mb) and 13 (62.90–63.69 Mb) were specific to Alpine goats sampled in Switzerland. In contrast  a 1.12-Mb region on CHI11 (94.31–95.44 Mb) was exclusive to Italian Alpine goats. In the Angora breed  one 241.77-kb region on CHI14 (53.14–53.38 Mb) and two longer regions of 2.28 and 1.75 Mb on CHI23 (20.44–22.29 Mb and 15.05–16.80 Mb) differentiated animals sampled in South Africa. In Saanen goats  a 247.22-kb region on CHI6 (29.89–30.14 Mb) was specific to Swiss Saanen goats and a 688.71-kb region on CHI13 (50.40–51.09 Mb) was exclusive to French Saanen goats. The patterns of homozygosity that were identified in a worldwide sample of goats are similar to those previously reported in 891 cattle from multiple breeds [] and in 3191 sheep from six commercial populations []  i.e. the proportion of the genome covered by ROH is  in general  less than 15% and there is an inverse relationship between ROH length and frequency (Fig. ). In this regard  it is worth mentioning that low-density chips (as that used here) do not detect small ROH accurately []  which are the most frequent ones in outbred domestic animals [  ]. This means that the true levels of homozygosity of the caprine breeds analyzed in the current work may be underestimated. The levels of homozygosity were remarkably low (Fig. ) in Near Eastern breeds except for a few Angora individuals  and in the European group. These findings agree well with previous studies that indicated Eastern Anatolia as a primary domestication center for goats  which subsequently dispersed into Europe  where breed formation was probably more systematic than in western Asia [  ]. In humans  a worldwide analysis of ROH patterns revealed a positive correlation between proportion of short and intermediate ROH and distance to Africa  the birthplace of humankind []. These results are consistent with the idea that  in populations undergoing serial founder effects (during successive range expansions)  homozygosity tends to increase. In Pakistan  four breeds (Bari  Barbari  Kamori  and Kachan) displayed  values higher than 0.20 (see Additional file : Table S2) and large ROH numbers  which might be explained by an ancient founder effect associated with the initial dispersal of goats from their domestication center in the Fertile Crescent []. An alternative  but not mutually exclusive  explanation would be the occurrence of random consanguineous matings due to an open village breeding system  as reported in certain African bovine breeds []. The ROH pattern detected in Oceania populations was similar to that detected in several European and African groups  confirming the findings reported by Colli et al. [] that goats from Oceania possess African or African<U+2009>×<U+2009>European genetic backgrounds. The patterns of homozygosity in goats from Oceania and America are quite different although these two populations were founded around 200 and 500 years ago  respectively. According to our data  ROH number and length are much smaller in goats sampled in Oceania than in those sampled in America. In principle  a recent founder effect should have resulted in a larger number of ROH  as observed for American goats (many individuals with more than 100 ROH) but not for Oceanian goats. The most likely explanation for these unexpected results is the extensive crossbreeding of goats from Oceania. For instance  Rangeland goats are composed of a mixture of Angora  Cashmere  Anglo-Nubian  British Alpine  Saanen and Toggenburg breeds []  and Kiko is a synthetic breed recently created by crossing New Zealand feral goats with multiple improved exotic breeds (). As we will explain in the next section  population admixture and crossbreeding both contribute to the disruption of long homozygous stretches and decrease in global autozygosity levels. Regarding the transboundary breeds  in general we detected no major differences across subpopulations through locus-specific divergence analyses  which is probably mainly due to the recent worldwide dispersal of these breeds because of the intensification of goat production  artificial insemination and the existence of an efficient transportation network across the globe. Hardiness and robustness of goats also facilitate the shipment of improved breeders to distant countries. However  ROH regions of high divergence were identified in several comparisons. For example  Alpine goats that were sampled from a limited and close geographical area (Italy  France  and Switzerland) showed different ROH distributions particularly on CHI3 (91.54–92.29 Mb) and 13 (62.90–63.69 Mb) for the subpopulation sampled in Switzerland  and on CHI11 (94.31–95.44 Mb) for the subpopulation sampled in Italy. Differences in the genome-wide diversity patterns of the Alpine goats sampled in these countries were also observed in the admixture analyses that were carried out by Colli et al. [] and covered the whole AdaptMap dataset. These admixture analyses revealed at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>50 a clear genetic differentiation between Alpine goats sampled in Switzerland versus those sampled in Italy and France. In the Angora breed  regions of high divergence were detected on CHI14 (53.14–53.38 Mb) and 23 (20.44–22.29 Mb and 15.05–16.80 Mb) for animals sampled in South Africa. This result is consistent with the genome-wide analysis of diversity mentioned before []  where the admixture analyses at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>50 revealed the existence of genetic differences between Angora goats from South Africa and those sampled in other countries. For the Boer breed  no major regions of divergence were detected in our analyses  which is concordant with the admixture analyses performed by Colli et al. [] who observed genetic differences between Boer subpopulations (e.g.  Australia vs. Switzerland) but they tend to be more tenuous than those observed in other transboundary breeds. The effects of population admixture on homozygosity patterns are illustrated in Fig. b. It is evident that total ROH length is much shorter in crossbred goats than in their purebred counterparts. Iberian cattle  that have been significantly introgressed with African breeds  also show a lower ROH abundance than British breeds that have a single European ancestry []. Moreover  a direct relationship between admixture and ROH length has been documented in African cattle populations  such as Kuri and Sheko  which were generated by crossing <U+2009>×<U+2009> []. Szpiech et al. [] reported that  in humans  long ROH are enriched in variants with a predicted damaging effect. Similarly  in cattle  ROH are more enriched in predicted deleterious variants than non-deleterious variants []  but  in contrast with humans  this enrichment is more significant for short and medium ROH. Demography is another important factor that shapes the genomic patterns of homozygosity []. Our results indicate that insular goat populations  such as those raised in Iceland or Madagascar  display increased levels of homozygosity  which is discussed in detail in a companion paper [] and thus not further developed here. It is worth noting that most of the continental populations with a ROH coverage higher than 750 Mb correspond to local breeds such as Valdostana  Pyrenean and Mallorquina (Fig. a). One common feature of these breeds is that they have suffered sharp population declines due to competition with more productive transboundary breeds and the progressive abandonment of low-income farming activities. For instance  during the second half of the twentieth century  the Pyrenean breed almost disappeared  while currently it comprises 2800 individuals ( Pyreneenne_anglais.pdf). With 640 registered individuals  the Valdostana breed is at risk []  and the Mallorquina breed  with only 16 bucks and 141 does  is critically endangered (). Population reduction often involves a global increase in the levels of inbreeding and autozygosity. For instance  Williams et al. [] analyzed the genetic diversity of a herd of Chillingham cattle  which has been maintained reproductively closed for 350 years  and found that 90% of the SNPs on the 770K chip were monomorphic. Although autozygosity is often associated with inbreeding depression in domestic animals []  no decrease in fertility or viability of this cattle herd was observed  probably because artificial selection that was exerted during three centuries has purged damaging alleles []. Artificial selection generally results in an increase of the ROH frequency and coverage in the genomes of livestock species (e.g. []). The comparison between improved and traditional breeds (Fig. c) showed that ROH numbers are larger in highly selected breeds such as Saanen  Toggenburg and Boer. The case of the Boer breed is interesting because its production performance in terms of growth is excellent and  thus  it is used for meat production. Since 1970  this breed is incorporated into the National Mutton Sheep and Goat Performance Testing Scheme []  which makes Boer one of the first goat breeds routinely involved in a performance test for meat production. Saanen and Toggenburg goats  which have been subjected to artificial selection to improve dairy performance  are well known for their high milk yields. In contrast  local goat breeds  such as Valdostana  display longer ROH probably as a consequence of demographic decline and recent inbreeding. One of the goals of our study was to detect regions of the genome where ROH were more abundant and to investigate if they coincided with the signatures of selection reported by Bertolini et al. []. It should be noted that the ROH analyses do not account for population stratification. Thus  some of the signals may correspond to differentiation between groups of breeds as reported in sheep []. However  the vast majority of the genomic regions detected across all comparisons mapped to CHI11  12 and 18 (see Additional file : Table S4). The homozygous region on CHI12 (60–61 Mb) overlaps with a signature of selection that was detected with FLK/hapFLK statistics in several geographical subgroups []. In our analyses  this ROH is shared by almost all the continental and sub-continental groups excluding America  Oceania and Central Europe. Indeed  American and Oceanian breeds showed some distinctive and unique hotspot regions. The ROH on CHI11 (37–38 Mb) is shared by goats from three continents (Europe  Americas and Asia) and  interestingly  a signature of selection related to milk production has been detected in the same genomic region in caprine populations from America  East Africa and Central Europe []. The other two ROH hotspots on CHI18 (36–37 Mb) that are shared by goats from Europe  Africa and Asia  were reported as possible signatures of selection for fiber production  but the number of SNPs that support these signatures is small []. Two other ROH regions on CHI12 (43–44 Mb and 50–51 Mb) overlap or are close to signatures of selection reported in Barki goats [] on CHI12 at ~<U+2009>49–52 Mb and 44–46 Mb (regions updated on the ARS1 genome version). It is interesting to note that these putative signatures of selection were also reported in Barki sheep []. These regions contain genes that are related to ectodermal  nervous system and hearing functions  such as  and  [  ] and gonad development such as  []. Patterns of homozygosity can be similar in populations from different geographic areas. Moreover  reduced population size  strong founder effects and geographic isolation are associated with increased levels of homozygosity in goats  while population admixture has the opposite effect. The existence of three ROH hotspots that co-localize with signatures of selection demonstrates that selection has also played an important role in increasing the homozygosity of specific regions of the goat genome. Our results will be useful to define future strategies that aim at ensuring the genetic management of goat resources with a broad geographic distribution and a remarkable impact on the economy of developing countries.

We analysed genome-wide 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 144 populations to describe the global patterns of molecular variation  compare them to those observed in other livestock species  and identify the drivers that led to the current distribution of goats.ResultsA high degree of genetic variability exists among the goat populations studied. Our results highlight a strong partitioning of molecular diversity between and within continents. Three major gene pools correspond to goats from Europe  Africa and West Asia. Dissection of sub-structures disclosed regional gene pools  which reflect the main post-domestication migration routes. We also identified several exchanges  mainly in African populations  and which often involve admixed and cosmopolitan breeds. Extensive gene flow has taken place within specific areas (e.g.  south Europe  Morocco and Mali-Burkina Faso-Nigeria)  whereas elsewhere isolation due to geographical barriers (e.g.  seas or mountains) or human management has decreased local gene flows.ConclusionsAfter domestication in the Fertile Crescent in the early Neolithic era (ca. 12 000 YBP)  domestic goats that already carried differentiated gene pools spread to Europe  Africa and Asia. The spread of these populations determined the major genomic background of the continental populations  which currently have a more marked subdivision than that observed in other ruminant livestock species. Subsequently  further diversification occurred at the regional level due to geographical and reproductive isolation  which was accompanied by additional migrations and/or importations  the traces of which are still detectable today. The effects of breed formation were clearly detected  particularly in Central and North Europe. Overall  our results highlight a remarkable diversity that occurs at the global scale and is locally partitioned and often affected by introgression from cosmopolitan breeds. These findings support the importance of long-term preservation of goat diversity  and provide a useful framework for investigating adaptive introgression  directing genetic improvement and choosing breeding targets."

These findings support the importance of long-term preservation of goat diversity  and provide a useful framework for investigating adaptive introgression  directing genetic improvement and choosing breeding targets. Goats () are the most important livestock species for poverty alleviation and rural development []. More than 90% of goats are farmed in Asia and Africa []. On the one hand  their smaller size and lower management requirements compared to cattle means that rearing goats can be afforded also by low-income farmers in remote areas. Many goat breeds can withstand harsh conditions and survive primarily by scavenging for nourishment  and  thus  require little investment for maintenance. On the other hand  when investment capital is available  goats can yield handsome returns []. Thus  goats are present in a wide variety of production environments. For these and other reasons  e.g.  limited formal crossbreeding and presence of only a few cosmopolitan breeds compared to other livestock species []  goats are also among the best animals for studying genetic diversity and adaptation. Goats are among the “big five” livestock species (cattle  sheep  goats  pigs and chickens) recognized by the FAO [] and are considered as the first to have been domesticated. Domestication occurred around 10 000 years ago (YBP year before present) in Southwest Asia  with at least four distinct domestication events []  which all involved the bezoar () as wild ancestor. Following domestication  goats accompanied humans in their migrations and dispersed throughout the world. As in other domestic species  goats migrated into Europe and arrived at the far north and west edges of the continent by about 5000 YBP []. Expansion southwards to Africa and eastwards into Asia occurred at the same time []. Goats were present in North Africa around 6000–7000 YBP []  and in the Sahara and Ethiopia around 5000 YBP [  ]. The presence of trypanosomiasis in Central Africa slowed the expansion southwards  and goats reached south sub-Saharan Africa only around 2000 YBP. In Asia  available evidence indicates that goats were present in China around 4500 YBP []  and that they moved further south and east during the subsequent millennia. Local domestication events in Asia have been hypothesized [  ] to support the Asian origin of cashmere goat breeds  but these hypotheses are not supported by recent molecular evidence []. Goats reached the Americas and Oceania approximately during the 15th and 18th century of the common era (CE)  respectively  along with European migrations []. Hence  goats have colonized a wide variety of different geographic and agro-ecological areas around the world. Following colonization  genetic drift  reproductive isolation  together with natural and human-mediated selection led to the development of nearly 600 breeds []. These breeds differ by a range of characteristics: body size and weight; hair type and colour; ear shape; horn shape  size and number; milk  meat and fibre production  adaptation to husbandry and environmental conditions. Genetic variation underlies the differences that are observed for these traits. The molecular genetic characterization of breed diversity provides information useful for assessing and mitigating inbreeding  for the proper management of animal genetic resources [  ]  the reconstruction of breed origin  the investigation of the genetic bases of relevant phenotypes  and the prioritization of breeds for conservation []. If biological samples are geo-referenced  molecular data can be integrated with climatic and socio-economic data into geographic information systems (GIS) to allow for a greater range of inferences to be drawn [  ]. Previous genetic studies that explored the variation of sheep populations worldwide revealed a low degree of differentiation (2.98% of total variation) between continents and high levels of haplotype sharing []. In contrast  cattle populations are highly structured into continental groups that mirror the different ancestry contributions from the gene pools of  and – (13% of variation) and  within taurine cattle  between European and African  (3.2%) [  ]. Although several goat breeds have already been characterized genetically []  most studies have involved only a few breeds analysed in a national context (e.g. [  ]). Two large-scale investigations based on microsatellite markers highlighted the occurrence of a number of regional gene pools  together with a clinal reduction in variability from the domestication centre in Southwest Asia towards North Europe []  Indonesia and China []. Contrary to the weak population structuring found within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages due to the high frequency (><U+2009>90%) and worldwide distribution of haplogroup A []  a clear geographical differentiation between continents was revealed by Y-chromosome haplotype analyses [    ]; in addition to the widely distributed haplotype Y1A  haplotypes Y2A and Y1B have been reported in Europe  North Africa and the Near East  whereas haplotype Y2B was found in Asia and haplotype Y2C in Turkey. A recent study based on ancient DNA (aDNA) data showed that both mitochondrial and nuclear molecular variation of Neolithic goat herds was strongly structured []. This evidence supported the hypothesis of multiple wild origins for early domestic goat populations that was already suggested from analyses of modern mtDNA data [    ]  and further indicated that recruitment from different local bezoar populations was extensive. In addition  according to nuclear aDNA evidence  early goat populations from the western  eastern and southern regions of the “Near East” contributed differently to the European  African and Asian modern goat populations. Subsequently  post-Neolithic migrations and trade led to an increase in animal movements and exchanges  with resulting admixture and reduction of genetic partitioning []  which weakened the phylogeographic structure of mtDNA  as testified by the fact that haplogroup A had already become predominant in samples from the Chalcolithic age [7100–5700 before common era (BCE)]. Taken together  the available evidence points at a lack of geographical partitioning of modern maternal lineages  the existence of highly structured variation for the Y-chromosome  nuclear DNA and neolithic mtDNA data  and the occurrence of a number of local gene pools within different geographical regions. However  a comprehensive description of the worldwide distribution of present day goat diversity is still lacking. The commercial goat 52 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip has been available since approximately 5 years []  and has already been used for national and multi-country goat diversity studies [    ]. Using this standardized tool for genotyping  the AdaptMap initiative [] gathered a dataset that includes genotypes of 148 goat populations. The aims of this study were to (i) investigate the distribution of goat genetic variation around the world  (ii) compare the present-day diversity patterns to those observed in ancient goat samples and in other ruminant livestock species  and (iii) reconstruct admixture and migration events that have shaped goat post-domestication history. The AdaptMap raw dataset includes 4653 animals representing 169 populations from 35 countries across six continents (see Additional file : Table S1 and Fig. ): 46 populations from Europe  83 from Africa  21 from West Asia  seven from North America  eight from South America and four from Oceania (for further details on the geographical distribution of breeds see []). We used the Illumina GoatSNP50 BeadChip [] that includes 53 347 SNPs to genotype the animals. Original SNP genomic positions were remapped to the new goat reference sequence ARS1 []. Geographical distribution of the goat breeds included in the AdaptMap project on the world map We performed data quality control (QC) by using Plink 1.9 [  ]. Individuals and SNPs that did not pass the following thresholds were removed: individual genotype call rate higher than 0.96  SNP call rate higher than 0.98  and pairwise identity-by-state between genotypes (based on all markers) less than 0.99. SNPs that were completely monomorphic across the whole dataset were also removed. To identify individuals with high relatedness (e.g.  parent–offspring pairs)  we used an in-house script to calculate the number of Mendelian errors (ME) in pairwise comparisons between all individuals []. Pairs of animals with less than 100 ME were considered as related []. Animals that occurred most frequently within the pairs of related individuals were removed. Twelve crossbred populations were omitted from the analyses (BOEx  GALxSAA  MTBx  MUBx  OIGx  SAAxANB  SAAxCRE  SEAx  SEAxALP  SEAxGAL  SEAxSAA and SEAxTOG  for the breed code legend see Additional file : Table S1)  together with five populations with less than three animals sampled (BAG  GSH  MYO  SCL  TET). Breeds for which a large number of samples was collected from multiple locations (ALP  ANG  BOE  LNR  NBN  SAA) were split according to their origin (see Additional file : Table S1). The size of the populations with more than 50 sampled individuals (ALP_CH  ALP_IT  ANG_AR  BOE_CH  BRK  BUR  CRE  LNR_DK  NBN_EG  OSS  RAN  SAA_FR  SEA  SID  WAD) was reduced to 50 through a representative random sample selection procedure implemented in the BITE R package []  which decreases the sample size to a user-defined number while maintaining the variance structure of the original set. The working version of the AdaptMap dataset (hereafter called “working dataset” or “WD”  3197 animals  144 populations and 48 827 SNPs) was used for subsequent analyses. Among the SNPs  46 666 were mapped on autosomes  1595 on chromosome X and 566 were unmapped. GenABEL [] and BITE R packages [] were used to estimate minor allele frequencies (MAF)  SNP and individual call rates. Phasing and imputing of missing data were carried out on 3197 animals and 46 654 autosomal SNPs with unique positions (hereafter called “phased dataset” or “PD”) by using Beagle v4.0 (r1399) []. To better explore the geographical partitioning of diversity both between and within the most represented continents  separate datasets were created for Africa (“African dataset” or “AD”<U+2009>=<U+2009>1183 animals  56 populations  48 827 SNPs)  Europe (“European dataset” or “ED”<U+2009>=<U+2009>995 animals  42 populations  48 827 SNPs)  and west Asia (“West Asian dataset” or “WAD”<U+2009>=<U+2009>555 animals  23 populations  48 827 SNPs)  and for the three continents together (“3-continent” dataset or “3CD”<U+2009>=<U+2009>2729 animals  121 populations  48 827 SNPs). Furthermore  for the 3CD and African datasets  individuals were grouped according to the results of the population structure analysis carried out on the working dataset in order to mirror gene pools rather than nominal breeds (see Additional file ). In particular  the 3CD dataset was compared to WD to evaluate the overall effect of the removal of admixed populations and of gene pool subdivision on the partitioning of diversity. To estimate within-population diversity and between-population differentiation  we used the software Arlequin version 3.5.2.2 [] to calculate (i) observed (H) and expected heterozygosity (H)  subsequently corrected over the number of usable SNPs  i.e.  those having less than 5% missing data  by applying the formulas H<U+2009>=<U+2009>H (number of polymorphic SNPs/number of usable SNPs) and H<U+2009>=<U+2009>H (number of alleles—1)/number of alleles  where number of alleles<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 (number of individuals in the WD); (ii) the inbreeding coefficient  F []  (iii) Wright’s F fixation index []  and their respective statistical significances. The composite-likelihood method implemented in Jaatha version 2.7.0 [  ] was applied to estimate gene flow as the number of migrants per generation that were exchanged between populations. For the analysis  the following parameter values were set: (i) split time t  which specifies how many generations ago the populations split  t is measured in units of 4Ne generations ago  where Ne is the (diploid) effective population size of the first population  and is comprised within the 0.02–5 interval; (ii) scaled migration rate M  given by M<U+2009>=<U+2009>4Nem  where m is the fraction of individuals of each population replaced by immigrants from the other population at each generation and varies between 0.01 and 25; (iii) mutation parameter <U+03B8>  which is linked to 4Ne times the neutral mutation rate per locus and ranges from 1 to 20  and (iv) recombination parameter  which is 4Ne times the probability of recombination between the ends of the locus per generation  equal to 20. Historical trends in effective population size (Ne) were estimated with the SNeP software [] with default settings and a correction to adjust linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r) values for small sample sizes. Since the large differences in population size within the WD set could negatively affect the estimations of SNeP  we fixed the number of analysed individuals per population to 22. Populations with fewer animals (19 populations from Europe  44 from Africa  13 from west Asia  three from North America  two from South America and one from Oceania; see complete list in Additional file ) were discarded  whereas populations with a sample size larger than 22 were sub-sampled using the aforementioned procedure implemented in the BITE R package []. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots based on kinship matrices were constructed with GenABEL [] and BITE R packages [] at the level of both single individuals and populations to investigate the relationships within and between breeds. Analysis of MOlecular VAriance (AMOVA) [] was carried out with the Arlequin software on the single continent datasets  and on the WD and 3CD sets to estimate the partitioning of variation within and between continents  and to understand how the presence/absence of admixed populations and gene-pool based grouping impacted the variance distribution. In all analyses  three hierarchical levels were considered  “within individuals”  “among individuals within populations”  and “among populations”. For the 3CD set  we added the “among groups” level corresponding to the subdivision of the populations into continental groups. To assess possible differences in the LD structure between continents  we used the phased data to calculate the pairwise LD between SNPs with PLINK 1.9 [  ] by considering a distance of up to 10 Mbp. For each population  SNP pairs with an r higher than 0.3 were selected. Then  we calculated the number of populations per continent for which a specific pair of SNPs was in LD. To assess reticulate relationships between populations  we used Arlequin to calculate the Reynolds unweighted distances  D  between populations []  which were subsequently visualized via a Neighbour-net graph with the software SplitsTree ver. 4.14.2 []. Population structure was assessed by the maximum-likelihood based approach implemented in the Admixture software v1.3.0 []. Analyses were run for K values ranging from 2 to 100 under the assumptions of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium  complete linkage equilibrium and under the ‘unsupervised’ mode (i.e.  no prior information on the population of origin of the individuals). To identify the best fitting number of hypothetical populations  for each K value  both fivefold cross-validation error values and the number of iterations needed to reach convergence were considered. To investigate fine-scale genetic differentiation  we ran Chromopainter and FineStructure software version 2.0.4 [] on phased data. Chromopainter was run on unlinked mode to calculate the chromosomal chunk donor frequencies using a uniform recombination map  and the coancestry matrix was then computed (using greedy optimization and default settings). FineStructure clustering for each analysis was repeated until independent runs broadly agreed  i.e.  until the difference in cluster number (K) reached 5. Convergence was assessed by inspection of the coincidence matrix of the final clustering of the runs. The occurrence of migration events was evaluated with the Treemix software [] on the unphased version of the WD set with the Bezoar (BEZ) population set as a root. Windows with 200 consecutive SNPs were used to account for the non-independence of SNPs located in close vicinity. Migrations from 0 to 11 were tested  with three replicates per  to assess consistency. To further assess the consistency of the migration edges found over the WD set  the Treemix software was also run on the 3CD set with the same settings as described above for a number of migrations between  and   and with three replicates per . The overall mean values of observed (H) and expected (H) heterozygosity  were equal to 0.356 and 0.366  respectively  whereas within-population H ranged from 0.135 (ICL_IS breed from Iceland) to 0.415 (SAA_IT from Italy)  and H from 0.151 (ICL_IS) to 0.425 (CRP_RO) (see Additional file : Table S1). Within-continent average heterozygosities calculated over the WD set were for: Africa  H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.354 and H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.360; Oceania  H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.349 and H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.378; Europe: H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.355 and He<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.379; West Asia  H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.375 and H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.348; North America: H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.317 and H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.399; South America: H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.362 and H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.379. Eighteen populations had statistically significant F values. The only population for which a significant negative value of -<U+2009>0.086 was obtained was CAN_BR  while the highest F (0.251) was found for BEZ_IR  the Iranian Bezoars (see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Figure S1). Among the 16 other populations with positive significant F values  eight were native to Africa (SEA_KE  SEA_MZ  SEA_UG  SID_EG  SOF_MG  WAD_NG  WAD_CM and OSS_EG)  three to Europe (LNR_DK  PYR_FR and CCG_IT)  two to West Asia (BEZ_IR and BRI_PK)  one to South America (CRE_AR)  while three were populations belonging to cosmopolitan breeds reared in Tanzania  USA and Argentina (MLY_TZ  MLY_US and SAA_AR). Wright’s fixation index F ranged from 0.000 (CRO_UG vs. NGD_UG) to 0.556 (ICL_IS vs. MAN_MZ) (see Additional file : Table S2 and Additional file : Figure S2). Most of the breeds that showed relatively high F values in pairwise comparisons were native to islands  such as ICL_IS from Iceland (F was always<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.3)  ARR_IE from Ireland  MEN_MG and SOF_MG from Madagascar  PAL_ES from the Canary islands  except for BAB_PK  KAC_PK  KAM_PK and PAT_PK from Pakistan. Most low F values were observed within specific geographical areas in Africa  e.g.  Morocco and North Africa in general  Uganda–Burundi–Kenya  Tanzania–Ethiopia  or Mali–Burkina Faso–Nigeria–Cameroon  etc. (see Additional file : Table S2 and Fig. ). Heatmap-like representation of between-population gene flow. Gene flow was estimated in terms of number of migrants between pairs of populations with the Jaatha software. The corresponding numerical values are in Table S1 (see Additional file : Table S1) Estimates of gene flow obtained with the Jaatha software were visualized via a heatmap (Fig. ) and the numerical values are in Table S2 (see Additional file : Table S2). They show extensive gene flow within well-defined geographical areas  as in the case of Southern Europe  Morocco  Ethiopia-Cameroon  Mali-Burkina Faso-Nigeria and Pakistan. Extensive gene flow among geographical areas involve mostly the Turkish breeds and a few breeds native to Zimbabwe  and also between the populations from South Europe and North Africa. In contrast  a marked lack of gene flow was highlighted for the wild goats from Iran  and the insular populations from Madagascar  Ireland  Iceland and the Canary islands  but also for the breeds from Pakistan  Malawi and Mozambique. Analysis of LD trends at the within-continent level identified clear differences between the African populations and those from Europe and West Asia (Fig. ). According to the numerical values that describe the between-breed within-continent distribution of the pairs of SNPs in LD (see Additional file : Table S3)  8 130 168  7 163 898 and 5 602 280 SNP pairs are in LD within the African  European and West Asian populations  respectively. Figure  shows that  for the European and West Asian populations  a specific pair of SNPs is in LD within one or two populations (mode value<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 in both cases)  and for the African populations  a specific pair of SNPs in LD is shared by three to five populations (mode value<U+2009>=<U+2009>4)  which possibly reflects their low degree of differentiation. Distribution of SNP pairs in linkage disequilibrium within continents. The Y axis indicates the number of SNP pairs found in LD and the X axis the number of populations in which a given SNP pair was found in LD The analysis of effective population sizes identified a general reduction over the last 1000 generations (see Additional file : Figure S3)  which corresponds approximately to the last 4000 years. Breeds are subdivided roughly into two groups  i.e.  with a smaller or larger effective population size. The plots of Ne values across generations (see Additional file ) show that the gap between these two groups  which is clearly visible in Figure S3 (see Additional file : Figure S3) up to ca. 200 generations ago  is still present until recently. A few breeds show different trends: KIL_TR experienced a more marked reduction in Ne compared to the other breeds of the same group. On the contrary  the decrease in Ne is more gradual for the PAT_PK  LND_MZ  MSH_ZW  MTB_ZW  SOF_MG populations. Finally  CRE_AG and RAN_AU gradually pass from the group with the smaller Ne to that with the larger Ne. Although Ne values that are calculated for large numbers of generations BP can fluctuate more  it is interesting to note that in the plot that refers to 959 generations ago (see Additional file )  the Ne size for populations from Turkey and Egypt (KIL_TR  KLS_TR  BRK_EG  SID_EG) was larger than that for all other breeds; this situation changes over time and by 366 generations ago  the Ne of these populations is already in line with that of several other African and European breeds. Several analyses (Figs.      and Table ) consistently pointed to remarkable subdivisions in goat genetic variation at the molecular level. A clear differentiation between continental groups of populations was initially highlighted by the plot of the first three dimensions (13.09  8.93 and 3.18% of the total variance  respectively; cumulated percentage 25.20%) of the multi-dimensional Scaling analysis. As shown in Fig. a  dimension 1 differentiated European breeds from the other ones  while dimension 2 separated the Pakistani populations (lower left corner) from the African populations and from another cluster including the Boer  Angora  Turkish and Iranian breeds (IRA_IR  ANK_TR  KLS_TR and KIL_TR). These subdivisions were consistent with the major splits in the structure of the Neighbour-network based on between-breed D distances calculated from the WD set (see Additional file : Table S4 and Fig. )  and the clustering obtained with Admixture software at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and 3 (Fig. ). Multi-dimensional scaling plot. Dimension 1 versus 2 () and dimension 1 versus 3 (). The population labels are coloured according to the continent of origin as follows: red<U+2009>=<U+2009>Africa  green<U+2009>=<U+2009>Europe  blue<U+2009>=<U+2009>West Asia  pink<U+2009>=<U+2009>North America  light blue<U+2009>=<U+2009>South America  orange<U+2009>=<U+2009>Oceania  black<U+2009>=<U+2009>wild goats.

To increase readability  the country codes are omitted from the population labels  with the exception of breeds sampled in multiple countries A more precise estimate of the amount of existing variation corresponding to different hierarchical levels was obtained by analysis of molecular variance (Table ); 8.69% of the variance was assigned to the “between-groups” level  which accounted for the geographical partitioning between continents (Table ); 15.19% was allocated to the “between-populations” level  but this percentage varied by continent when the AD  ED and WAD sets were analysed: 9.48% for Africa  10.17% for Europe and 12.58% for West Asia. Within-continent substructures were also identified by both the Neighbour-network analysis and Admixture software (Fig. ; K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5–8 in Fig. ). In particular the breeds from Pakistan were separated from the rest of the West Asian group  and within Africa  different sub-groups corresponded to Northwest Africa +Canary islands  East Central Africa and Southeast Africa  which are further subdivided into Madagascar and Malawi<U+2009>+<U+2009>Zimbabwe<U+2009>+<U+2009>Mozambique groups. In Europe  groups of populations consistent with Spain<U+2009>+<U+2009>Sardinia  France<U+2009>+<U+2009>Corsica  Ireland<U+2009>+<U+2009>Alpine breeds  North Europe (Netherlands  Finland  Norway  Iceland)  Central and South Italy were revealed (Fig. ; K<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 to 25 in Fig. ). CRP_RO from Romania  the only Balkan breed  had an intermediate position between South European (Central Italy) and West Asian populations. At high K values  including K<U+2009>=<U+2009>85 that was identified as the best-fitting resolution based on cross-validation error values (see Additional file : Figure S4)  several European and Pakistani breeds were individually assigned to distinct clusters. However  for African goats the inferred gene pools still corresponded to geographical areas rather than to single populations. Populations that are highly isolated due to geographical or demographic barriers were also highlighted by particularly long branches in the Neighbour-network and well-defined clusters in Admixture barplots (Fig. ; K<U+2009>=<U+2009>15 and 20 in Fig. )  such as the insular breeds from Iceland (ICL_IS)  Ireland (ARR_IR  BLB_IR  OIG_IR)  the Canary Islands (PAL_ES)  and Madagascar []. The populations from Pakistan  Brazil  Malawi and Mozambique were also highlighted as reproductively isolated  thus confirming the Jaatha software results (Fig.  and see Additional file : Table S2). In the case of the wild goats from Iran  BEZ_IR  the long branch in the Neighbour-network probably reflects the combined effects of ascertainment bias  reproductive isolation  bottleneck and distinctiveness. Remarkable admixture was also highlighted  particularly a strong introgression of African ancestry into the breeds of South America  Spain and Southern Italy (Fig.  and K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 in Fig. )  and also into the Palmera goats from the Canary Islands (Fig.  and K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 in Fig. )  which was particularly close to breeds from Northeast Africa (GUE_ ML and MAU_ML from Mali  and SAH_BF from Burkina Faso). The behaviour of transboundary breeds (Boer  Toggenburg  Saanen and Angora) and of those sampled in North America  South America and Oceania varied according to their ancestry (Figs.    and ): they were either close to other populations of their respective breeds (i.e.  Boer and Angora; Fig. a and b) or to African breeds (CAN_BR and MOX_BR)  while those that have an African<U+2009>×<U+2009>European background (SPA_US  KIK_US  LMN_US  NBN_AR) occupy an intermediate position between the clusters of the corresponding continental populations. In particular  Fig.  shows that breeds from South America occupy an intermediate position between those from Northwest Africa and South Europe (Spain)  whereas those from Australia (CAS_AU and RAN_AU) are close to the Turkish populations. In the MDS plot of individual genotypes (see Additional file : Figure S5)  the degree of scattering confirmed the variable genetic background of some populations of recent admixed origin  e.g.  CRE_AR  MOX_BR  RAN_AU. As expected  the coancestry matrix obtained with the fineSTRUCTURE software represented as a heat map (see Additional file : Figure S6 and Additional file : Figure S7) showed that the highest values of coancestry concentrated along the diagonal and corresponded to within-breed relationships. Larger blocks of high coancestry were also revealed  which involved the breeds from Pakistan and the European populations as a whole  and  within Europe  those from the Alpine region  the Pyrénées and some breeds from Ireland (see Additional file : Figure S6 and Additional file : Figure S7). Population clusters identified by the fineSTRUCTURE software agreed closely with breed labels  particularly in the case of European populations  and geographical areas of origin (see Additional file : Figure S7 and Additional file ). In the worldwide analysis  the consecutive levels of differentiation (see Additional file ) are consistent with the MDS  Admixture and Neighbour-net patterns and support the strong geographical partitioning and admixture described above. In particular  the first and second subdivisions (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and 3) separated European  African and West Asian breeds  whereas successive hierarchical levels split many South European populations from the other European populations (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5)  Pakistani goats (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>6)  and West African goats from the Southeast African ones (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>7). The Palmera goats from the Canary Islands clustered with populations that were sampled around the Gulf of Guinea (Cameroon  Nigeria  Mali  Burkina-Faso). Within Southeast Africa  subclusters corresponded to the breeds from (i) Malawi  Zimbabwe and Mozambique  (ii) Madagascar  (iii) Uganda and Burundi  and (iv) Kenya  Tanzania and Ethiopia. The variance explained by the Treemix software analysis increased from about 0.85 at 0 to 0.95 at 11 (see Additional file : Figure S8). However  this increase fluctuated between repeated runs for the same  value due to the complexity of the dataset and the high degree of admixture between the populations from specific areas (see Additional file : Figure S8). Thus  as  increased  alternative but recurrent migration edges were highlighted  which often involved admixed or imported breeds. The  graph (Fig. ) showed the most frequent high-weight edges which linked: (i) the Angora population from Madagascar ANG_MG with the basis of the clade of Madagascan populations (AND_MG  SOU_MG  DIA_MG  SOF_MG  MEN_MG); (ii) the West African Dwarf breed from New Guinea and Cameroon  WAD  with the Brazilian breeds  MOX_BR and CAN_BR; (iii) the breeds from Mozambique  and LND_MZ in particular  with Matabele from Zimbabwe  MTB_ZW; (iv) the basis of the branch that supports the clade of West Asian breeds from Pakistan with the basis of the Boer clade; (v) the population of goats of Norwegian origin reared in Tanzania NRW_TZ with the breeds from North Europe  LNR_FI  ICL_IS  LNR_NL; (vi) the Creole breed from Argentina  CRE_AR  with the basis of the clade that includes the populations from Morocco  the Canary Islands and West Africa; and (vii) the mixed Alpine<U+2009>×<U+2009>Boer breed from Malawi  ALB_MW  with the clade including the other populations from the same country  LGW_MW  THY_MW  DZD_MW  BAW_MW. Treemix software graph obtained from the complete dataset and featuring seven migration edges (7) When Treemix analysis was performed on the 3CD set  the fraction of variance explained was generally higher and the migration edges showed greater consistency across repeated runs at the same  value  in particular up to  (see Additional file : Figure S9a). Among the migration edges that were subsequently highlighted  we observed those that link the Pakistani breeds clade with MTB_ZW  MTB_ZW with the Boer populations from Zimbabwe and Tanzania  BOE_TZ and BOE_ZW  which are conversely linked to the Boer population from Uganda and Malya from Tanzania  BOE_UG and MLY_TZ; the basis of the clade that includes the West African populations SDN_ML  WAD  NAI_ML and DJA_BF is linked to the Spanish MUG_ES and MLG_ES breeds. The NOR_MO  RAS_ES and MAL_ES populations formed a clade  which show links with BEY_ES and the group formed by West African populations and the Canarian PAL_ES; the basis of the European group of breeds was linked with the Moroccan populations. SNPs have many advantages compared to microsatellites (e.g. [])  but are susceptible to ascertainment bias  which derives from an over-representation of SNPs that have high MAF in the populations used to identify the polymorphic SNPs (discovery populations). This ascertainment bias typically leads to an underestimation of the genetic diversity in other breeds  which becomes more evident as the relatedness between discovery and test populations decreases  and it affects measures of population differentiation  such as F []. For this reason  the SNP panel used in the AdaptMap project was developed based on sequence data from a diversified panel of goats  which included Saanen  Alpine  Creole  Boer  Kacang  and Savanna ()  and the resulting SNPs were tested on a large set of divergent breeds and populations []. In the case of our dataset  low H were scored in breeds that are isolated by geographical barriers (e.g. islands) or by strict management procedures. In addition  moderate differences in heterozygosity values between breeds from different continents showed that any potential bias did not appear to have a strong impact on the major outcomes of our analyses. However  we cannot exclude an effect over the slightly lower H that was scored for populations from specific geographical areas (Fig. a)  especially for the wild Bezoar (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.267). Geographical distribution pattern of:  observed heterozygosity  Ho; and  Chromopainter software clustering at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>13 In addition  the inclusion of the Boer breed in the discovery panel may have emphasized its distinctiveness  as suggested by the Admixture results (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4; Fig. )  and the third MDS dimension (Fig. b). Estimates of effective population size (Ne) globally indicated a gradual but constant reduction in size over time  as previously shown at a local scale [    ]. Interestingly  the trend in Ne also showed a difference between two groups of breeds  which roughly correspond to populations intensively or extensively managed. For example  the Angora  Boer  Nubian  Cashmere  and to a lesser extent Saanen and Alpine populations all generally showed small Ne values  irrespective of their geographical area of rearing. In contrast  local breeds  such as those from Africa  Spain and Central-Southern Italy  had larger Ne values (see Additional file : Figure S3 and Additional file ). Likewise  the patterns of gene flow as inferred from the results obtained with the Jaatha software correlated inversely with genetic distances  as represented in Fig.  (and Additional file : Figure S2)  and were generally consistent with both geographical isolation and husbandry regimes. Specifically  out-going gene flow was low for populations in small geographically isolated regions  such as islands and mountainous areas  and their surrounding regions  but higher for populations within these regions. In addition  gene flow seemed to be influenced by husbandry practices  particularly by the decision to establish and maintain populations as formally distinct “breeds”  as is the case in most of Europe and USA. However  these management choices allow maintaining stable breed phenotypes  which can be exploited in analyses of selection signatures to search for genetic variants and chromosomal regions that underlie phenotypic variability []. Observed heterozygosity showed a clear association with geography (Fig. a)  which reflects geo-climatic conditions  geographical isolation and management systems. Limited levels of heterozygosity in breeds from Madagascar  Iceland  the Canary Islands and Ireland are consistent with the hypothesis of lack of gene flow due to physical isolation (MEN_MG  SOF_MG ICL_IS DIA_MG PAL_ES ARR_IE). Similarly  geographical isolation can explain the slightly lower than average values scored for some breeds native to the valleys in the Alps (ORO_IT  VAL_IT also reported by []) and in the Pyrénées (PYR_FR). Breed segregation due to management practices is probably responsible for the low H that characterizes the Malawi populations (BAW_MW  DZD_MW  LGW_MW  NSJ_MW  THY_MW)  whereas the high H observed for populations in East Africa  such as Tanzania  Uganda and Sudan  most likely mirror admixture by cross-breeding. More generally  an increase in heterozygosity due to pastoralism and nomadism is frequently reported in sheep [  ] and is consistent with specific geographical patterns in Iranian goats []. In Europe  transhumance is still common in South Italy  which may explain the high H observed for GAR_IT and ION_IT []. In Central and East Africa  yearly changes in climate and pasture availability impose seasonal migrations across geographical areas with different cultures and livestock management practices  which further complicates the pattern of H. We performed different analyses that confirmed the occurrence of three main gene pools in goats corresponding to Europe  Africa and West Asia  which is similar to the between-continent partitioning of diversity previously observed in cattle [    ] and sheep []. According to our AMOVA analysis on goat populations  such a subdivision accounts for 8.69% of the global variation  which is higher than that calculated for worldwide sheep (2.98%) []  and for European versus African taurine cattle (3.2%) [  ]. Frequently  continental subdivisions are interpreted as the legacy of gene pool divergence between ancestral populations that migrated out of the domestication centre along different routes []. In the case of goats  this view is substantiated by evidence on aDNA that indicates a relationship between the present-day continental gene pools and the highly structured Neolithic populations from different regions of the Fertile Crescent []. Thus  compared to sheep  the stronger subdivision observed in goats can be explained either (i) by the hypothesis that the level of population structure in Neolithic ancestors was higher in goats than in sheep  or (ii) that in spite of their similar size  these species have undergone quite different population dynamics at the global scale  with goats experiencing a lower level of post-domestication gene flow compared to the extensive exchanges documented in sheep []. In the following section  the finer details of population structure and inferred migration events  obtained here  are combined with previous evidence from archaeological findings  written records and genetic data  to formulate hypotheses on the post-domestication worldwide spread of goat populations. Goat domestication took place ca. 10 500–9900 YBP in the region that covers present-day East Anatolia and Northwest Iran [  ]. In general  breeds from the areas close to the domestication centre are expected to have retained partial ancestral diversity  and indeed the goat populations from Turkey and Iran included in our dataset actually display a high level of diversity and a genomic composition similar to that of the wild ancestor  the Bezoar (Fig. ). Furthermore  at ca. 1000 generations ago (see Additional file )  these populations had larger Ne than all the other breeds  which likely accounts for the greater genomic variation retained by the populations at that time  and derives from the original variability of the wild ancestors sampled at the time of domestication. Early domestic goats followed the spread of agriculture and farming by radiating from the Fertile Crescent to Asia  Europe and Africa. As shown by the diversity of aDNA  Neolithic goat populations from Southwest Asia possessed a remarkable genetic structure. Clear distinct gene pools characterized the populations in different areas surrounding the domestication centre  with early domestic goats from the west  east and southwest sides of the Fertile Crescent  respectively  showing genomic affinities with present-day populations from Europe  Asia and Africa []. Divergent migration waves  which involved distinct source populations  left their traces in the clear partitioning of diversity between continents  as highlighted by several of our analyses (Figs.     and  and see Additional file ). Subsequently  after the Neolithic spread of goats  a geographical within-continent structuring of diversity emerged  as illustrated by goat breeds in Africa and Europe (Figs.     and b) where the persistence of regional gene pools was further promoted by the high levels of gene flow that characterizes the populations in large areas within both continents (Fig. ). In the case of Europe  goat populations are partitioned locally into regions corresponding to the east Mediterranean  the central Mediterranean  the east Alps together with continental France  and Ireland and North Europe. The clusters revealed by Chromopainter and fineStructure software (Fig. b) differed slightly  which may be due to imperfect phasing of the 52 K genotypes. Within Africa  breed clusters correspond to West  Northeast  East  Southeast Africa and Madagascar. Interestingly  the geographical distribution of the African gene pools overlaps well with that of groups of breeds that share similar morphological characters []  i.e.  short-eared trypanotolerant breeds of the “West African Dwarf” group in the west-central Africa; lop-eared goats of near eastern ancestry in the northeast; short-eared breeds of the “Small East African” group distributed in the southeast; and lop-eared breeds in the far south. The genetic makeup of the European breeds  representing the south  west and north regions of the continent  according to Admixture pattern includes a number of local gene pools (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>15; Fig. ) that occur respectively: (i) in northern breeds at high frequency (LNR_DK  LNR_FI  LNR_NL  OIG_IE  BLB_IE  ARR_IE) but also in the Romanian breed from the Carpathians (CRP_RO) and in the breeds from the Alps (e.g. SAA and ALP populations); (ii) in the southwest populations mainly from the Italian peninsula (GGT_IT  ASP_IT  RME_IT  etc.)  but also those from Spain and France (e.g. MLG_ES  RAS_ES  MUG_ES and PYR_FR). In northern breeds  the gene flow was lower (Fig. ) and genetic distances are relatively greater (Figs.    and see Additional file : Figure S2). These breeds also tended to be positioned further from the centre of the Neighbour-net graph (Fig. ) or from the root of the Treemix trees (Fig.  and see Additional file : Figure S9b) compared to Mediterranean and Romanian goats. Presumably  this pattern mirrors the combined effects of the first Neolithic migration  which spread the “proto-European” goat gene pool into the continent  then the influences of African and Asian goats in South Europe (detailed below)  and the relatively reduced gene flow in populations in the North (Fig. ). Considering the distribution of the local gene pools in Africa and the dynamics of the spread of livestock into the continent as described previously in []  we propose the following scenario: after entering Africa via the Isthmus of Suez  the migration trajectory of goats subsequently bifurcated westwards and southwards along the North and East African coast  respectively. This hypothesis is fully compatible with the Neighbour-net and Treemix patterns and is corroborated by archaeological evidence  which suggests a rapid spread of small ruminants into north and east Africa between 7000 and 5000 YBP [  ] after their introduction from Southwest Asia []. The southbound migration route may have followed the same path already identified for the diffusion of cattle pastoralism to South Africa from the region of the Great Lakes to modern-day Uganda around 2000 YBP and subsequently southwards through the eastern part of the continent []. After the diffusion of goats into Africa  several subsequent waves of introgression occurred: (i) from Europe to Northwest Africa via Gibraltar and (ii) from Southwest Asia westwards to Northwest Africa along the Mediterranean coast and southwards to the eastern part of the continent. A contribution from the Iberian Peninsula into North African gene pools of livestock has already been identified in several species  including goats [  ]. It is interesting to note (Fig. ; blue cluster from K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 to 10) that the western and far-south African gene pools are clearly less influenced by introgression from the West Asian component than other African goats. Conversely  in the north-western and eastern parts of the continent the clearly detected West Asian influence gradually decreases from Egypt to Tunisia to Morocco in the North and from Egypt to Ethiopia  Kenya and Tanzania in the East. This may reflect the original Neolithic immigrations  but the post-domestication introductions of the zebu [] and the fat-tailed sheep in Eastern Africa indicate the existence of later intense contacts with West Asia  for instance during the spread of Islam into the African continent since the 7th century. Data on goats from the Arabian Peninsula and the regions surrounding the Fertile Crescent may allow to substantiate this hypothesis. The West African component is present at high percentages in the Palmera breed from the Canary Islands and in the South American breeds from Brazil and Argentina. The goats in the Canary Islands are generally considered to be descendants of Iberian domesticated goats that were introduced by the Spanish colonists during the last part of the 15th century of the CE [] and  thus  they subsequently influenced the formation of the South American Creole breeds [  ]. However  our results consistently confirm a West African origin (Figs.    and ) as already proposed by Capote et al. [] based on morphological features. Similarly  the South American goats (CRE from Argentina  but in particular CAN and MOX from Brazil) display a strong component of West African ancestry  which contradicts the usually invoked Spanish origin [  ]. This strengthens the evidence already reported for sheep [] for huge inputs of livestock from the Atlantic coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos into South America  which was mediated by the transatlantic trades since the 16th century. The same West African gene pool also occurs in Spanish breeds (ca. 40% of the genome) and to a lesser extent also in South European breeds from France and Italy  thus confirming previous evidence of introgression of African livestock gene pool into the Iberian peninsula and Southwest Europe []. Treemix migration edges (see Additional file : Figure S9b) and the Admixture software pattern (Fig. ) suggest the occurrence of frequent exchanges between Northwest Africa and the Iberian Peninsula  and interestingly the Admixture software pattern also indicates that this African influence originated from West Africa rather than from Morocco. This suggests a long-distance sea-borne mode of introgression rather than a mostly land route passing through Morocco and the Strait of Gibraltar. Besides the presence of the already mentioned West African influence  West Mediterranean goats from Spain and France share genomic components with breeds from Ireland (BLB  ARR  OIG) and North Italy (VAL in particular) (Fig. ; K<U+2009>=<U+2009>25). Interestingly  this matches well the diffusion of the proto-Italo-Celtic people during the Bronze Age  which started from ca. 4500 YBP  as described by the distribution of the S116 polymorphism of the human paternal lineages of the R1b haplogroup []. Central and East Mediterranean goats from south Italy and Romania were simultaneously influenced by West Africa and Southwest Asia (Fig. ; blue component at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 and Nubian-Egyptian emerald green component at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>10; and in the Neighbour-net graph of Fig.  their position is closer to the West Asian branches)  thus confirming the role of the central Mediterranean region as crossroads of trades and human migrations which had already begun during the prehistoric period. In particular  since the Middle Ages transhumance practices in south Italy [] may have contributed to spread this introgression into most of the breeds. Although we cannot provide reliable dates for such gene flow events  we can formulate some hypotheses: the West African influx may have reached Italy either directly from North Africa at the times of the Arab colonization of the West Mediterranean basin or later from Spain mediated by the Spanish Bourbons rulers during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. In contrast  the Southwest Asian influx may either date back to the cline established by the Neolithic introduction of domestic goats  or may have occurred in later ages e.g.  following the maritime trade routes that crossed the Mediterranean basin in the east–west direction already in prehistoric or early historic times  or during the spread of Islam that started in the seventh century. Since the 18th century  formation of goat breeds started in most of Europe and in several other countries with an organized agricultural infrastructure (e.g.  South Africa  North America)  via morphological standardization and systematic selection to improve production traits. At the genomic level  these practices caused a remarkably higher degree of LD in European and West Asian breeds than in the African populations  and the emergence of several single-breed clusters in the two high K reconstructions obtained with the Admixture software (Fig. ). They also resulted in reduced effective population sizes during the last 50 generations (ca. 200 years) which halved in a 22-generation interval (see the 23 and 45 generations panels in Additional file ). In contrast  during the same period  the African breeds do not seem to have undergone such a comparable reduction in effective population size. Several recent exports of highly productive or specialized breeds outside their areas of origin are also identified  such as for the European Norwegian  Toggenburg and Saanen goats introduced to Tanzania and Kenya  Boer goats in Oceania  Europe and USA  Nubian and Saanen goats in Argentina  Angora populations bred in several countries worldwide  and Cashmere goats in Australia. This is often followed by intermixing with local gene pools  such as the introgression of the African gene pool into all the European goat populations reared in Tanzania  and the highly admixed nature of the Malya goats reared in the USA  or the Nubian and Saanen goats in Argentina. An exception to this trend is represented by the Cashmere and Angora goats  which still possess a Southwest Asian background although they were exported to Australia  Europe and South America. The case of the Boer breed represents a remarkable example of introgression combined with human-mediated selective pressures changing over time. In fact  this breed is recorded as having received an input from Indian and European breeds during the 18th or 19th century in order to improve milk production [  ]  but during the 20th century  the breed was subjected to an intensive selection for meat production. Our study represents the widest assessment of goat diversity available to date. By investigating the patterns of population structure  gene flow and migration events  we highlighted a strong and ancient geographical partitioning of diversity between continents. In recent times  the introduction of cosmopolitan highly productive breeds to several countries across the world has led to genomic admixture and introgression into a number of local goat populations. In addition  we observed that geographical and reproductive isolation due to management practices account for gene flow reduction. We also outlined the major events that characterized the history of this livestock species: from their domestication centre in the Fertile Crescent  early domestic goats spread to Europe  Africa and Asia through divergent migration routes. This has determined the underlying genomic background and partitioning of the continental populations. During the subsequent centuries  geographical and reproductive isolation led to a regional sub-structuring of diversity. Additional and more recent migrations and/or importations spread domestic goats to the Americas and Oceania. At the global scale  our evidence reveals a remarkable level of diversity. Since introgression from cosmopolitan breeds and reduced gene flow may raise concerns about the long-term preservation of goat diversity  our results provide a useful framework for monitoring and protecting the farm animal resources represented by the goat world populations  and may help direct genetic improvement and breeding plans.

As a result  approximately 600 goat breeds have developed worldwide; they differ considerably from one another in terms of phenotypic characteristics and are adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions. In this work  we analyzed the AdaptMap goat dataset  which is composed of data from more than 3000 animals collected worldwide and genotyped with the CaprineSNP50 BeadChip. These animals were partitioned into groups based on geographical area  production uses  available records on solid coat color and environmental variables including the sampling geographical coordinates  to investigate the role of natural and/or artificial selection in shaping the genome of goat breeds. Several signatures of selection on different chromosomal regions were detected across the different breeds  sub-geographical clusters  phenotypic and climatic groups. These regions contain genes that are involved in important biological processes  such as milk-  meat- or fiber-related production  coat color  glucose pathway  oxidative stress response  size  and circadian clock differences. Our results confirm previous findings in other species on adaptation to extreme environments and human purposes and provide new genes that could explain some of the differences between goat breeds according to their geographical distribution and adaptation to different environments. These analyses of signatures of selection provide a comprehensive first picture of the global domestication process and adaptation of goat breeds and highlight possible genes that may have contributed to the differentiation of this species worldwide. The goat () is considered one of the earliest domesticated livestock species. The domestication process started around 10 000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent area from a unique wild and still living ancestor  the bezoar or  []. At present  there are more than one billion of goats that inhabit all types of ecological areas across the globe []. Compared with the other major livestock species such as pigs  cattle and sheep  goats have undergone the largest increase (+34%) in population since 2000  i.e. larger than pigs (+15%)  cattle (+14%) and sheep (+14%) (). Today  over 90% of the goats are distributed across Asia and Africa  followed by the Americas  Europe  and Oceania []. In the most rural areas of the world  goats are often considered the poor person’s cow. In fact  goats can be used for milk  meat  fiber  and leather production []  as well as transport. Moreover  they are easy to house and manage; goats can be raised by small families  women  and children and provide a fundamental source of food for millions of people. Several factors have contributed to the differentiation of goat breeds  which are classified mainly into two types: (i) adaptation to different breeding systems and/or purposes  i.e. in some countries  breeds have been selected for specific production traits such as milk (e.g. Saanen and Alpine)  meat (e.g. Landrace and Boer) and fiber (e.g. Angora and Cashmere); and (ii) adaptation to different environments  i.e. goats have adapted to various agro-climatic conditions. In addition  goat breeds have undergone differentiation through founder effects  and the processes of admixture and genetic drift. Thus  about 600 breeds have been developed and are distributed worldwide []. They differ from one another in terms of many phenotypic characteristics such as size  color  horn shape and dimension  reproductive and productive traits and are adapted to a wide range of bioclimatic conditions. Directional natural and artificial selection events have left footprints across the genome  which are known as signatures of selection. Signatures of selection are defined as the reduction  elimination or change of genetic variation in genomic regions that are adjacent to causative variants in response to natural or artificial selective pressure. Such variants usually affect several traits and contribute to shaping a breed []. The process by which the frequency of a selectively favored variant increases in a population is termed a selective sweep. The recent development of species-specific genomic tools (such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays) have allowed researchers to extend whole-genome analyses to livestock species  which cover many aspects of genetic diversity  including signatures left by selection processes []. In spite of the major economic importance of goats  high-throughput genomic resources for this species have become available only recently. In 2011  the International Goat Genome Consortium developed and released the first high-throughput SNP chip with more than 50 000 SNPs (Illumina CaprineSNP50 BeadChip)  which was built using 10 biologically and geographically different breeds []. The first complete assembly of the goat genome was released in 2013 by Dong et al. [] and a second version of the reference genome that exploits single-molecule long read sequencing (PacBio) has just been released (ARS1; []). With this new version  gene annotation has improved considerably and the position of the SNPs on the CaprineSNP50 BeadChip has been updated. With the availability of genomic and high-throughput SNP tools  there is an increased interest in identifying and exploring signatures of selection and the genomic diversity resulting from adaptation to environment and human selective pressure. These genomic tools were used to identify signatures of selection in circumscribed datasets. The CaprineSNP50 BeadChip was used to investigate and compare several Swiss goat breeds and genomic signatures of selection were detected in regions that affect variation in coat color  growth  and milk composition []. The combination of analyses of runs of homozygosity (ROH)   (fixation index)  XP-EHH (cross population extended haplotype homozygosity)  and the use of Bayesian methods allowed the detection of signatures of selection in a region that contains genes related to the immune system in another mountain breed raised in the North of Italy  the Valdostana Italian goat breed []. Other analyses of signatures of selection were performed in a reduced number of breeds  thus detecting regions that are linked to production and reproduction traits [] and in the Barki Egyptian goat breed  which is raised and adapted to hot/dry environments []. In the latter study  analyses of iHS (integrated haplotype score and pairwise  that identified selective sweeps led to the identification of genes related to thermotolerance  body size  energy metabolism and nervous and auto-immune response []. Furthermore  signatures of selection that were linked to dry and hot conditions and to metabolic traits were identified by using whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from Moroccan goat breeds through XP-CLR analysis []. WGS information was also successfully used to detect regions that are under different selection pressures in Chinese and Mongolian goats and are related to breeding or reproductive traits [  ]. Genomic changes that result from climate changes and are linked to adaptation to different environments can be analyzed with a landscape genomic approach  which was successfully applied in other livestock species  for example in Ugandan cattle []. To date in goats  this approach was applied only on a reduced number of SNPs or amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers [  ]. However  it would be interesting to apply it at the genomic level since it provides useful information on the environmental factors that shaped the genome. In this work  we used different approaches to identify regions under artificial and environmental selection across the AdaptMap goat dataset  which is composed of data from more than 3000 animals that were collected worldwide and genotyped with the CaprineSNP50 BeadChip. For this purpose  we considered several groups of animals that were partitioned based on geographical area  as done in Colli et al. []  production uses  available records on solid coat color and environmental variables in relation to the geographical coordinates of sampling. For the first time  we applied FLK and hapFLK analyses on goat data  which have been successfully used in analyses of high-throughput data from sheep [  ]. These methods increase the power of detection for signatures of selection  and they enable detection of soft or incomplete selective sweeps. Finally  we also applied landscape genomic approaches to this large goat dataset  to investigate the role of natural selection in shaping the goat genome. Prior to the application of methods for detecting signatures of selection  we applied several filtering steps to the AdaptMap goat dataset  which originally contained 4563 animals from 144 breeds that were collected worldwide and genotyped with the CaprineSNP50 BeadChip. This dataset was first edited by removing mixed breeds  related animals  SNPs that were monomorphic  unmapped  mapped to sex chromosomes or with low call rate  which resulted in a working dataset of 46 654 SNPs and 3197 animals []. Additional filtering steps were applied depending on the analysis performed  as described below. The main analyses are summarized as follows: (1) detection of signatures of selection based on the genetic diversity of subcontinental populations or breeds  and (2) detection of signatures of selection associated with specific phenotypes  traits or external variables (e.g. annual mean temperature based on global positioning system (GPS) coordinates). In general  each investigation was conducted using two complementary approaches. For each analysis  genes within selected regions or nearby detected SNPs (±<U+2009>100 kb) were identified using the Bedtools software [] and the most recent version of the goat genome assembly (ARS1; []). To detect signatures of major differentiation between populations  we used the FLK [] and hapFLK [] approaches. Briefly  these methods account for population structure and differences in effective population size by modelling the genetic divergence between populations as derived from drift and population division. Because these methods are not completely robust to strong bottlenecks and large admixture events  subsets of populations were selected starting from the working dataset  removing admixed animals and strongly inbred populations. This was done first by identifying genetic sub-structure in the initial diversity analysis which defined sub-continental groups []. Then  an admixture analysis was carried out to identify and remove admixed populations within each sub-continental group  which generated sub-continental filtered groups. This last step was performed using the Treemix software []  allowing for up to three migration events within each group. Graphical representations of the results of all Treemix analyses are in Additional file . The number of animals included in each sub-continental group is in Table . The final dataset comprised 2481 individuals that are grouped into 62 (61 <U+2009>+<U+2009>one ) populations. Following filtering of the data  FLK and hapFLK analyses were carried out on each of the sub-continental filtered groups  using the wild ancestor of domestic goat (Bezoar  ) as an outgroup to root population trees. For hapFLK  the cross-validation procedure was performed with the fastPHASE software []  which determined that 30 haplotype clusters were needed to capture haplotype diversity. For both hapFLK and FLK analyses  p-values were computed as explained in the hapFLK software documentation. False discovery rates (FDR) were estimated using the qvalue R package [] and SNPs corresponding to an FDR of 0.15 or less were considered significant. A genome scan for signatures of selection between sub-continental groups was also performed using FLK analysis as described by Fariello et al. []. Briefly  the frequency of the ancestral allele of each group was estimated from the within-group analysis. These ancestral alleles were then used to perform a new genome scan using FLK analysis. Frequencies of Bezoar alleles were used to root the population tree. Only the groups that corresponded to clear geographical clustering of goat populations were considered for this ancestral analysis  i.e. the Southwestern  Southeastern  Northern and Alpine European groups  the Central Asian group and the Northwestern  Easter and Southern African groups. The above-mentioned filtered dataset that was used for FLK and hapFLK analyses was also used to detect signatures of selection within the breeds using: (i) ROH and (ii) iHS statistic []. ROH analyses were performed using the Zanardi software [] by considering a minimum of 15 SNPs per ROH  a minimum ROH length of 1 Mb and allowing for one heterozygous SNP within an ROH to account for the possibility of genotyping errors. For each SNP  the proportion of animals that displayed a homozygous region at that SNP was calculated. Then  this measure was transformed by its empirical quantile for all SNPs across the genome ( the proportion of all SNPs with a higher or equal proportion of homozygous animals in the breed considered). The iHS analyses were performed in populations with at least 10 genotyped individuals. Within each population  phasing of individuals was performed using SHAPEIT2 []. For SNPs with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05  the ancestral alleles were randomly assigned. The iHS statistics were calculated using the rehh v2.0 R package []. Standardized iHS values were computed in allele frequency bins of 0.05 and then further corrected using robust estimations of their mean and variance using the rlm function from the MASS R package []. Because assessing significance of ROH and iHS values is less robust  ROH and iHS signals were reported only for significant FLK or hapFLK signatures of selection. Reduced subsets of the dataset were investigated to detect genomic regions associated with specific phenotypes. Reductions were performed according to the availability of the information for each animal or breed included in the dataset. Therefore  two reduced panels were created corresponding to differences related to production purposes and phenotypes (solid coat colors). A questionnaire that contained four possible production assignments (milk  meat  fiber  and leather) was circulated to all AdaptMap members who provided the samples  to obtain information on the main purpose of each breed. Pre-filtering was performed by considering only breeds with known and prevalent purposes. Since none of the breeds was described as being solely raised for leather production  this purpose was excluded from subsequent analyses. Then  another filtering step was performed on the working dataset to remove breeds that are raised for more than one purpose by using an in-house script that discarded animals belonging to different purpose groups that shared the same coordinates of the first component<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.5 of the overall quantile distribution (ee Additional file : Figure S1). The final filtered dataset included 192 animals (three breeds) for fiber  241 animals (12 breeds) for meat and 818 animals (23 breeds) for milk. Details on breeds and sample sizes are in Table a. Three types of analyses were carried out on the final filtered dataset: ROH   and XP-EHH. ROH analyses were performed for each separate purpose group using the Zanardi software [] by considering a minimum of 15 SNPs per ROH  a minimum ROH length of 1 Mb and allowing for one heterozygous SNP within an ROH to account for the possibility of genotyping errors  as previously mentioned. The  and XP-EHH analyses were carried out by comparing each group against all the others and using the script described by Talenti et al. [] in which 1-Mb windows with an overlap of 500 kb were considered for window-based  and the Selscan software [] for XP-EHH. The results were normalized with the norm normalization tool included in the software suite. For all three analyses (ROH  window-based  and XP-EHH)  the top 0.5% of SNPs based on marker or window distribution was retained as relevant. The Bedtools software [] was used to find consensus regions between two or all three approaches. Only regions detected by at least two approaches were considered for further analyses. Pictures representative of the breeds for each animal of the working dataset were provided by the AdaptMap members and were inspected to find common and unique patterns across each breed. Considering the high variability of patterns and the lack of availability of high-quality pictures for some breeds  only those with confident solid coat colors were considered. Three groups were created: a Black group (79 animals and three breeds)  a White group (375 animals and six breeds)  and a Red group (93 animals and three breeds). Breeds and samples sizes are in Table b. For each group  a  analysis was carried out by considering the following pairwise comparisons: White vs. Black and Red  Black vs. White and Red vs. White. These comparisons were performed using the script described by Talenti et al. [] for which 500-kb windows with overlaps of 250 kb were considered. For each comparison  the top four windows that contained at least four SNPs  corresponding to the 0.9996 percentile of the overall distribution were considered. The genes within these windows were screened using the coat color gene website of the International Federation of Pigment Cell Society () to investigate their direct or indirect associations with coat colors in mice and shades of skin color in humans. SNPs that were located on either side of candidate genes for both purpose and coat color panels (±<U+2009>5 Mb<U+2009>=<U+2009>short and<U+2009>±<U+2009>10 Mb<U+2009>=<U+2009>long) were used as sets of variables with the same animals for canonical discriminant analysis (CDA)  which was performed with the CANDISC procedure implemented in SAS-stat software (SAS Institute  Inc.  vers.9.4). These analyses allowed the identification of the SNPs that contributed most to the discrimination between groups. These contributions were summarized as canonical functions (CAN)  which were linear combinations of the original variables (discriminant SNPs). Visual inspection of the CAN1 vs. CAN2 scatter plot of the CAN1 and CAN2 values for each SNP was used to pinpoint the precise regions associated with the separation between groups. To study the influence of the environment on the distribution of adaptive genetic variation  a landscape genomic approach using the Samßada software [] and  analyses were applied to identify genotypes that are significantly associated with environmental variables. For this purpose  we used a reduced subset of samples with known geographic coordinates of the sampling point. This reduced dataset contained 2661 animals from 28 countries (Table ). Finally  an additional filtering step was applied before performing the  analyses (see below). The environmental conditions were characterized using the bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim database () (see Additional file : Table S1). These data were available worldwide at a resolution of one arc-second and represented an average of the conditions from years 1950 to 2000. The values of these variables were extracted for the coordinates of each sampling point using the QGIS 2.14.7 software and were centered-reduced. A buffer area around each sampling point was generated to integrate  into the model  the environmental variability of the area that could influence an individual. Here  a radius of 5 km was selected which assumed that the goat could move in a circular area of 10 km in diameter  centered on the sampling point. Within that area  in order to consider only the area corresponding to the potential home range of the goats  a land cover discrimination based on the Global Land Cover 2000 classification was applied []. On this basis  the areas corresponding to artificial surfaces (urban land cover) and water bodies were removed. For the remaining areas  the bioclimatic variables were retrieved and for each one  seven statistical measures (minimum  maximum  mean  standard deviation  range  median and mode) were computed. The Samßada software [] was used to compute the parallel processing of multiple univariate logistic regressions between each genotype versus each environmental variable. All univariate models were computed and filtered considering a significance threshold of 0.05 before Bonferroni correction. Then  a second step of filtering was applied to retrieve only the SNPs for which at least two genotypes were significantly associated with an environmental variable and showed simultaneously: (1) a very strong effect of the environment on the genotype (absolute value of the ß1 regression coefficient higher than the 0.99 percentile of all absolute values of ß1 of the significant models)  (2) a high statistical significance of the association (G and Wald scores higher than the 0.95 percentile of all G and Wald scores of the significant models) and (3) a strong goodness of fit of the models  with an Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) lower than the 0.10 percentile of all AIC of the significant models. The Enrichr database [  ] was used for the genes detected with the Samßada analyses to identify the major biological processes that involved the identified genes (GO biological process) by considering significant clusters with a P value lower than 0.05. Each animal of the working dataset with a known GPS geographic location was assigned to a Köppen climate group (Tropical  Dry  Temperate  and Cold; []) through the website climate-data.org. Then  we applied the following filters: (i) for each climate group  only breeds with at least 10 animals allocated were considered  and (ii) if the same breed was in two or more groups only the animals that belonged to the groups of known breed origin were considered and the others were discarded. The assignment of each individual to a Köppen group and the subsequent filtering of animals provided a dataset of 1689 animals (141 for the Tropical group  796 for the Dry group  632 for the Temperate group and 120 for the Continental group)  with no redundant breeds across the groups; assignments are summarized in Table . MDS (multidimensional scaling) of the filtered animals was performed using the Plink 1.9 software []. Single SNP  was performed by comparing each group to the remaining groups merged together. The top 20 SNPs of each comparison  corresponding to the 0.9995 percentile of the distribution were considered and compared with the previous results of the landscape genomics analysis that had been filtered based on a significance threshold of 0.05 before Bonferroni correction. Only the selected  SNPs with a G score or Wald score and ß1 regression coefficient higher than 0.99 quantile were retained for further analysis. Allele frequencies of the SNPs that were shared by different groups were calculated and compared using the Plink 1.9 software []. A dataset of goat breeds ensuring robust modelling was developed prior to FLK and hapFLK analyses. This dataset included 61 breeds  which overall represented all the genetic diversity present in the complete dataset (Fig. ). The genetic diversity in this set of breeds mirrored their geographical origin and was consistent with a radiation from the domestication center. Thus  each population was assigned to one of the 11 sub-continental groups  and each sub-continental group was analyzed independently. In Fig.   the root of the population tree  which is located at the center  corresponded to the ancestral population of all goat breeds   the ancestral domesticated population. Extant populations radiated from this ancestral population with populations that were geographically closer to the domestication center also usually genetically closer. The populations that were closest to the ancestor belonged to the “Angora” group  which originated from Turkey. A little further  in their own sub-group  there was a set of breeds from Pakistan (“Central Asia” group). The other two large sub-trees consisted of populations from Africa and Europe  which were split further into sub-continental groups. Populations used to detect signatures of selection. Populations are color-coded according to their identified geographical groups. Populations in black were not considered in the analyses signatures of selection (see details in the text) The FLK and hapFLK analyses detected 67 signatures of selection among the 10 population groups. Figures S2 and S3 (see Additional file : Figures S2 and S3) show the Manhattan plots for the FLK and hapFLK analyses and Figure S4 (see Additional file : Figure S4) shows the overview of the genomic distribution of all signatures of selection. The complete list of signatures of selection is in Table S2 (see Additional file : Table S2). Graphical representations of FLK  hapFLK  ROH and iHS signals for all signatures of selection are in Additional file . The northern European group was the only group for which no significant signatures of selection were detected. The populations that constitute this group display long terminal branches in the population tree (Fig. )  which indicates that they have all experienced a strong reduction in population size. Such a reduction in size creates extensive genetic drift  which alone can explain the genetic differentiation of these populations. Hence  such extensive genetic drift makes the detection of signatures of selection difficult  which can explain the lack of power observed for the northern European group. Most of the signatures detected were specific to one population. A total of 13 genomic regions were shared between at least two groups (see Additional file : Table S2). These regions were annotated by (i) listing the genes that were located<U+2009>±<U+2009>10 0 kb near the highest FLK or hapFLK signal and (ii) identifying the populations that showed an elevated ROH and/or iHS signal within the region. A signature of selection on chromosome 5 between 30 and 40 Mb encompasses the  () gene (see Additional file : Figure S5 and Additional file ). This genomic region matched with a ROH signal in the Pyrenean goat population of the southwestern European group and with an iHS signal in the Argentata dell’Etna breed of the southeastern European group. It also matched with ROH and iHS signals in the Sahel  Peulh and Thari breeds of the northwestern Africa group. These breeds were genetically quite homogeneous and clustered within the same population in the genetic diversity study  thus  they were combined for the ROH analysis. An iHS signal was present in the Murciano-Granadina population  but did not match with the position of the  gene  thus it may represent another selection target. A second signature selection on chromosome 6 harbors the  (-) gene in three population groups (see Additional file : Figure S6 and Additional file ). A ROH signal was detected in the Kacchan breed of the central European group  the Abergelle breed of the east European group and the Argentata dell’Etna breed of the southeastern European group. A third selection signature on chromosome 13 matched with the position of the  () gene (see Additional file : Figure S7 and Additional file ). In Pakistani breeds  a clear ROH signal  corresponding to a large fixed haplotype was detected in the Kacchan population sample from Pakistan and in several breeds of the Alpine group (Alpine  Poitevine and Valdostana). The most significant FLK signal in the Alpine group corresponded to the SNP that was closest to   however  the highest FLK signal in central Asian breeds did not correspond to the same SNP and the region spanned several genes. Another relevant signal was detected on chromosome 1 between 110 and 130 Mb in the Alpine and southwestern European groups (see Additional file : Figure S8 and Additional file ). This region seemed to match with an FLK signal in the Alpine Valdostana breed  which presents a high proportion of homozygous individuals for this region. An iHS signal also on chromosome 1  at<U+2009>~<U+2009>108 Mb was found in the Ciociara Grigia Italian breed of the southeastern European group (see Additional file : Figure S26). Another signal was detected on chromosome 6 close to the cluster of casein genes    and   in the groups of Alpine breeds and Eastern African populations (see Additional file : Figure S9 and Additional file ). The signature of selection detected for the Alpine populations clearly points to the casein genes while for the Eastern African populations  the FLK signals seem to point to a different cluster of genes that encode glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. A complex signature of selection on chromosome 6 was identified between 25 and 50 Mb (see Additional file : Figure S10 and Additional file ) and probably results from multiple signals in different genes and different groups. In the Egyptian group  the gene closest to the highest hapFLK signal was  (). This region clearly matched with an extended region of shared ROH in the Nubian goat population from Egypt (see Additional file ). Among the southwestern European populations  the Bermeya population presented an iHS signal at the same locus. This region in Egyptian populations overlaps with other signals detected in the southwestern and southeastern European groups. It contains the  () gene and matched with an iHS signal in the Murciano-Granadina breed of the southwestern European group and in the Argentata dell’Etna breed of the southeastern European group. In both population groups  the hapFLK signal is much stronger than the FLK signal and no clear ROH signal was observed in the breeds of these two groups. A possible explanation for these two observations is that the signature of selection is due to a soft selective sweep rather than a hard sweep. Another signature of selection was found on chromosome 12 in the southwestern European group and the central Asian group (see Additional file : Figure S11 and Additional file ). This region contained the  () gene. The two populations that showed a clear signature of selection in this region were the Thari goat from Central Asia (iHS signal) and the Blanca de Rasquera Spanish breed (ROH signal). Finally  a region on chromosome 25 (35.50-35.88 Mb) was detected in the FLK analysis in the Angora group and confirmed by ROH and iHS analyses (Fig. ). Signatures of selection on chromosome 25 in the Angora group. Left panel: FLK (points) and hapFLK (line) signals. Middle panel: ROH signals. Right panel: iHS signals FLK analysis on the filtered geographical dataset based on the estimated ancestral allele frequency of geographical groups detected 62 SNPs with evidence for outlying differentiation among groups (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Table S3). The phylogenetic tree seemed to confirm the relationship between sub-continental blocks. Among the 62 SNPs  two signatures of selection were found on chromosome 1 close to the  (-) gene and on chromosome 16 close to the  () gene. Another signature of selection on chromosome 5 is located within the  () gene cluster (see Additional file : Table S3).

Right: Manhattan plot of FLK p-values computed from the estimates of ancestral allele frequency and accounting for the ancestral tree structure The analyses performed on the group of “fiber-producing” goat breeds detected 18 regions on 11 chromosomes with ROH  88 regions and/or SNPs on 27 chromosomes with XP-EHH and 24 regions on 11 chromosomes with  (Fig. ). Among these  six regions on chromosomes 6  18 and 25  including 34 genes  were detected by all three methods (see Additional file : Table S4). The region on chromosome 25 (34.69-36.43 Mb) showed the highest values in all the three analyses (Fig. a). Among the three breeds that compose the “fiber-producing” goat breed group  only Angora and Ankara showed a signature of selection in this region with none being detectable in Cashmere (Fig. b). This signature of selection overlapped with the regions detected by FLK/hapFLK  ROH and iHS analyses within the Angora group (Fig. ) and contained 24 genes  including the  () and the  (---) genes. The window-based  analysis between Cashmere and Angora breeds pointed out several regions on chromosomes 2  5  6  8  9  12  13  14  17  20  25  28 (data not shown). The ROH analyses on the Cashmere individuals highlighted several major regions on chromosomes 2  10  22 (47-48 Mb)  3  5 and 8 (data not shown).

For the three analyses  the regions above the threshold are marked in red. The region of high homozygosity (chromosome 25: 35 240 726-36 394 939 bp) is highlighted in red. (b) The three different breeds are labelled with different colors: green (external)<U+2009>=<U+2009>Angora; blue (middle)<U+2009>=<U+2009>Ankara; violet (internal): Cashmere. For the three breeds  the part corresponding to the 35-36 Mb region is marked in red when above the threshold The analyses performed on the group of “meat-producing” goat breeds detected 25 regions on eight chromosomes with ROH  121 regions and/or SNPs on 27 chromosomes with XP-EHH and 24 regions on 16 chromosomes with  (see Additional file : Figure S12]. Among these regions  two regions on chromosomes 3 and 18 were detected by at least two of the three methods and contained 18 genes [see Additional file : Table S5)  including  ()   () and  ()  all on chromosome 3. The analyses performed for the group of “milk-producing” goat breeds detected 11 regions on eight chromosomes with ROH  286 regions and/or SNPs in all autosomes with XP-EHH and 24 regions on 15 chromosomes with  (see Additional file : Figure S13). Among these regions  four were on chromosomes 11  13 and 14  which included 20 genes that were detected by at least two of the three methods (see Additional file : Table S6)  among which the  () gene on chromosome 11. The ROH analysis revealed a region on chromosome 6 (75-120 Mb) that contains the cluster of casein genes  although it was not confirmed by the  and XP-EHH analyses (data not shown). The CDA  which was performed on the chromosomal regions surrounding the genes previously identified for the three groups  confirmed the results found in previous analyses. The region on chromosome 25 (34.69-36.43 Mb) that contained the  and  genes could separate individuals in the group of “fiber-producing” goat breeds from the other two groups on the CAN1 variable  and the SNPs that best separate the three groups were in the middle of these regions (see Additional file : Figure S14). The region on chromosome 3 that included the  and  genes could separate the group of “meat-producing” goat breeds from the remaining two groups on the CAN2 variable when considering the highest peak in the middle of the region (see Additional file : Figure S15). Finally  the region on chromosome 6 that contains the casein cluster could separate the “milk-producing” breeds from the other two groups on the CAN1 variable  with a high peak near to the  () gene (see Additional file : Figure S16). The distribution on the MDS plot of the single breeds using the medium-density SNP chip overlapped partially between the three groups of coat color. This probably reflects geography rather than coat color  with the Middle Eastern  Asian (Pakistan) and African goats being separated from all European goats on the first component (see Additional file : Figure S17). The Angora and Ankara (White) breeds and the Kil and Kilis (Black) breeds  which all originate from Turkey formed two clusters. For the “coat color” groups  we detected regions on chromosomes 5 (70.0–70.5 Mb)  13 (53.0–53.5 Mb)  and 18 (15.50–16.25 Mb) in the Black vs. White comparison  regions on chromosomes 5 (36.25–36.75 Mb)  9 (11.5–12 Mb)  and 13 (53–53.5 Mb and 62.75–63.25 Mb) in the White vs. Black and Red comparison  and regions on chromosomes 8 (27.0–27.5 Mb)  22 (2.25–3.0 Mb) and 29 (39.25–39.75 Mb) in the Red vs. White comparison. The list of genes within these regions is in Table S7 (see Additional file : Table S7) and includes  and  () on chromosome 5   (-) and  on chromosome 13  and  () on chromosome 18. CDA on the  gene showed that SNPs present on either side of this gene could distinguish the solid Red goats from the solid Black and White animals that were close on the CAN1 (see Additional file : Figure S18)  which disagrees with the above result that indicated that  could separate black and white individuals. Similarly  SNPs located near the  gene seemed to be able to distinguish the solid Red from the solid black and white groups (see Additional file : Figure S19). In the CDA  SNPs in the region surrounding the  gene could distinguish and separate all three groups on the CAN1 variable  and particularly the white group (see Additional file : Figures S20). The Samßada results showed that more than 80% of the SNPs appear in at least one significant association between a genotype and a bioclimatic variable. In addition  57 SNPs were involved in associations that respected the second series of filtering criteria (values for the ß1 coefficient  G score  Wald score<U+2009>><U+2009>0.99 quantile  AIC criterion<U+2009><<U+2009>0.1 quantile  and at least two genotypes associated with at least one environmental variable) (see Additional file : Table S8). The most significant associations (highest G score) obtained with these SNPs involved the environmental variable related to annual mean temperature (bio1) for 49 SNPs  mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bio11) for three SNPs  mean diurnal range (bio2) for three SNPs  precipitation of the driest month (bio14) for one SNP and isothermality (bio3) for one SNP. The results obtained with the sampling point variables were very similar to those obtained with mode  maximum  mean and median values computed within the buffer area  whereas the associations with range  minimum and standard deviation were less significant. One of the strongest associations was observed between the  genotype of SNP snp24965-scaffold2564-131990 located on chromosome 3:1091508 and the mean annual temperature (bio1). This association had the highest G and Wald scores of the models filtered using the criteria above and the highest Efron score of all significant models (using a threshold 0.05 before Bonferroni correction). The spatial distribution of the genotypes for this SNP showed that the  genotype is only present in Europe or in southern regions of high altitude. The  genotype showed a similar trend  even if it is slightly more frequent in the southern regions  while the  genotype was observed in the whole area of study (Fig. ). This SNP is located close to the - () gene. The list of genes that are located near (±<U+2009>100 kb) each of the 57 SNPs is in Additional file : Table S9 and the geographical distribution of the genotypes for the remaining 56 SNPs is in the Additional file . Analysis of the biological processes of the genes located in the vicinity of these SNPs (see Additional file : Table S10) highlighted genes that are linked to several pathways  such as the insulin and glucose signaling pathway and metabolism [( (-)]  glycogen metabolism  lipid biosynthetic processes  oxidative stress [ () and  () genes] and regulation of vasodilation. Two genes are involved in circadian rhythms regulation:  () and  (). Map of the worldwide distribution of genotypes for the snp24965-scaffold2564-131990 (3:1091508) The MDS analysis (see Additional file : Figure S21) showed an overlap between the Köppen climate groups  with Tropical and Continental being the smallest and most clustered groups. The  plots are in Fig.  and Figures S22 to S24 (see Additional file : Figures S22  S23 and S24) and indicate for each analysis the number of SNPs above the selected threshold. Twenty SNPs for each comparison met the threshold of the quantile<U+2009>><U+2009>0.9995  among which  13 are shared between the Dry and Temperate/Continental groups with opposite major alleles between these groups (see Additional file : Table S11). Interestingly  the Tropical group did not have any common SNPs with the other groups  which reduced the list from 80 to 65 SNPs. When these 65 SNPs were compared with the Samßada results  they all showed either high G scores  Wald scores or ß1 regression coefficients (quantile values considering only those obtained from the significant models<U+2009>><U+2009>0.99 of the empirical distribution) for at least one genotype in several environmental variables. These SNPs are summarized in Table S12 (see Additional file : Table S12). In the landscape genomic analysis  nine of these SNPs showed G scores  Wald scores and ß1 regression coefficients that were all higher than the 0.999 quantile. In total  197 genes were detected in the regions (±<U+2009>100 kb) close to these 65 SNPs (see Additional file : Table S13). For the Tropical group  a cluster of  genes ( and ) that are located near the three SNPs on chromosome 5 was detected. Analysis of the genes for the four Köppen climate groups revealed several genes such as  (-) for the Dry and Temperate groups   (-) for the Dry and Continental groups   ()   () and  (-) for the Dry and Temperate groups and  with a different SNP  also in the Tropical group   () and  ( (-) were found for the Continental group only but also detected in the landscape genomic analyses and in the FLK analyses for signature of early adaptation.  plot of the comparison of the Tropical group vs. the other groups. The threshold line in red represents the 0.995 of the percentile distribution (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.391) Detection of signatures of selection from genotype data alone is possible either by searching for genomic regions that show high levels of differentiation between populations or by looking for regions of low genetic diversity within a population. In this work  both approaches were used because they detect different kinds of selection events. Selection events that lead to the rapid fixation of an initially rare variant  i.e. hard sweeps  should lead to signals that can be detected by both approaches. However  in this case  within-population methods are more powerful than differentiation-based methods  but differentiation-based approaches can detect a greater diversity of selection signals  such as selection on standing variation (soft sweeps) or diversifying selection. Our analyses were not limited to searching for signals of selection within or among populations. We also exploited other available information  such as differences in production purposes  phenotypes  and geographical/bioclimatic coordinates to elucidate the mechanisms of selection. The detection of adaptive loci in the genome is an essential part of studies on environmental adaptation  since it can help understanding which regions of a genome and therefore which genes have been or are being shaped by natural selection. Spatial analysis with geographical information systems (GIS) and environmental variables  along with molecular data  were included in the landscape genomic analysis to uncover the genomic regions under selection and identify candidate environmental factors that cause this selection. Multiple univariate logistic regressions were carried out to test for association between allele frequencies at marker loci and environmental variables. The analyses considered variables that can be summarized by differences in temperature and precipitation  which could be indirectly correlated to water availability. The Samßada analyses showed that more significant associations and more selected SNPs were associated with differences in temperature than with differences in precipitation. Therefore  temperature appears to have played a bigger role in the adaptation processes of goat breeds. In addition  our analyses examined the signals that were detected in the genome after a detailed modeling of genetic divergence and population structure. Complex admixture and strong population bottlenecks can mimic the effect of selection by reducing local variability considerably. Therefore  to detect these signals  we applied the FLK and hapFLK approaches to individuals with a unique genetic background  without recent admixture or population bottlenecks. Finally  signatures of selection left by recent human selection on goat populations that are linked to production purposes or phenotypic standardization were analyzed. Taken together  these analyses contributed to provide a genome-wide picture of the genes and genomic regions that have been subject to selection and led to signatures of selection that concern different biological pathways or group of genes  which were detected by one or more types of analyses. Among all the genes that can contribute to milk yield  quality and processing  the casein genes are one of the most important gene families in ruminants  since they have a major role in the production of cheese products from milk. In the goat genome  this gene cluster is located on chromosome 6 between 85.95 and 86.25 Mb. Analysis of the ROH scores of the breeds selected for milking purposes showed that the longest region with loss of variability coincides with the casein region on chromosome 6 between 85.9 and 86.2 Mb. The goat breeds used for milk and cheese production belong mainly to the European breeds  particularly from Italy and France  which suggests that the signals identified are related to a common direction of selection within these breeds  i.e. that they are used mainly to produce whole milk (20% of production) and cheeses (80% of production) []. Many dairy goat breeds of Europe have been developed through breeding with the two most specialized dairy breeds  i.e. Saanen and Alpine from Switzerland []. Due to its popularity as a dairy breed  Saanen goats are distributed across more than 80 countries worldwide []. The genomic region that contains the cluster of casein genes was also detected by FLK analysis  which identified a region containing this gene cluster in the group of Alpine breeds and a region close to this cluster in the group of Eastern African populations. The different analyses and particularly the FLK and hapFLK analyses also detected other regions related to milk production. Chromosome 6 carries several genes that are related to milk production and found in several ruminant species. Another region on chromosome 6 that contains the  gene was detected in the Egyptian  southwestern and southeastern European groups  which was further confirmed by the iHS signal detected for the Murciano-Granadina and Argentata dell’Etna breeds. The  gene matched with a previously identified signature of selection in sheep [] and polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with milk yield and composition in cattle and sheep [  ]. The ROH/Fst/XP_EHH analyses detected another consensus region on chromosome 11 that contains the  gene  which is associated with conjugated linoleic lipid contents in the meat of Wagyu Angus cattle breed []. A region on chromosome 1 between 110 and 130 Mb that was detected in the Alpine and southwestern European groups is homologous to a genomic region in dairy cattle for which selective pressure was previously reported []. A separate signature of selection approximately 5 Mb away from this region was also found in the Italian local breed Ciociara Grigia  which is used for milk production. Brito et al. [] recently identified other genomic regions that may be associated with milk production  using a partially overlapping subset of breeds []. This difference may be due to a different breed composition of the dataset used and underlines the fact that there may be some breed-specific regions related to milk composition. Therefore  more tailored experiments are needed to decipher the genetics behind milk production in goat. For the group of “fiber-producing” goat breeds  the strongest signature of selection in all three types of analyses (ROH  XP-EHH and ) was detected in the genomic regions containing the  and  genes. The detected regions in Angora and Ankara were confirmed by the FLK and hapFLK analyses. These genes are associated with hair development:  is associated with wavy hairs and curly whiskers in mouse [] and  may play a role in the formation of hairs or in their texture []. The roles of these genes are consistent with the presence of a signature of selection only in the two Angora breeds (Angora and Ankara)  which have curly hairs  and not in the Cashmere breed  which has long and wavy hairs. For the Cashmere breed  Brito et al. [] proposed several alternative genomic regions. The  analyses comparing the Cashmere vs. the Angora and Ankara breeds that revealed a signature of selection on chromosome 25 did not show any overlapping regions with those reported in []  probably because the approach used in [] highlighted other genomic regions. The ROH analyses carried out on the data for the Cashmere breed revealed a region on chromosome 22 that overlapped with one of the regions reported by Brito et al. [] and was identified by a  analysis of Cashmere against several other breeds. Thus  this may be an interesting region to investigate further for fiber production in the Cashmere breed. In addition  it suggests that different genomic regions are involved with fiber production in Cashmere and Angora/Ankara breeds. In the analyses comparing breeds for meat production  some of the detected regions contain genes associated with muscle formation. On chromosome 3  we identified a region that includes the  and  genes  in agreement with previous findings in cattle and mice.  is involved in the deamination of AMP in skeletal muscles [] and its disruption was reported to influence the expression of neighboring genes  such as   in mice []. In addition  allelic variants of the  gene are associated with traits such as heart girth and body weight in Chinese beef cattle []. Another gene within the same region   may also be associated with muscular functionality.  encodes a subunit of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)  which plays a pivotal role in regulating thyroid activity  stimulating colloid reabsorption and in the release of the T hormone []. The role of thyroid function in growth is known  and different levels of TSH are associated with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism []. In fact  high levels of TSH are commonly found in obese human children and adolescents []. In goat  this gene has been characterized in relation with reproductive seasonality []. The main breed of the “meat-producing” group is the Boer breed  which is selected for meat production and for which several breeding programs have been developed. In spite of this  no evidence of strong selection in the Boer breed for genes related to meat production was detected in our analyses. A possibility is that variation in meat production traits in this population may have a highly polygenic basis (many alleles of small effects determine the trait). Because of the size of the samples and the availability of phenotype records  we used approaches that are not suited to detect such selection events. Other targeted studies on the Boer breed are needed to evaluate the possible genomic impact of breeding programs in this population. ROH analysis of the data for the three groups of solid coat colors detected signatures of selection near at least five genes that are known to be involved in the color and pattern definition of the coat:      and . Two of these genes ( and ) were specifically detected in the comparison between solid Black and solid White individuals  whereas the remaining three were identified in both solid Black vs. solid White and solid Black and Red vs. solid White groups. The well-known  gene is involved in the genetic determinism of color [] and located on chromosome 18 in goats. It plays a major role in controlling the switch from eumelanin (black and brown) to pheomelanin (yellow to red; []) produced by melanocytes. This gene has already been studied in several species []  such as cat []  horse []  dog []  pig []  cattle []  sheep [] and even in goat [   ]. Although described in other species  no direct association between  and red coat color is known in goat.  is a competitive antagonist of  () for binding MC1R  enabling the switch from eumelanin to pheomelanin []. Similarly to what we observed for SNPs within the region surrounding   SNPs within the region around  seemed to be able to distinguish the solid Red from the solid Black and White groups. The presence of an association with the Red/Black group in the region surrounding this gene seems to confirm its role also in goats  as hypothesized in several studies [  ]. Moreover  the signal on this gene was also found with the differentiation tests (FLK  hapFLK) in Alpine  Poitevine and Valdostana goats with black-and-tan pigmentation pattern. This further confirms the potential role of this gene in modulating the melanocyte activity in goats  in particular its involvement in the switch from black to red pigments  whereas the white color may to be caused by other gene(s). The third candidate gene identified is   which encodes a transcription factor that plays an important role in hair follicles and blood vessel development during embryogenesis in disheveled mice  a semi-dominant mutation characterized by coat sparseness [  ]. In addition  alleles of this gene seem to be responsible for a dark phenotype in mice [  ].  located on chromosome 5 encodes a highly conserved metalloprotease. This gene is required for melanoblast survival and mediating Kit signaling in skin colonization such as the belted white locus in inbred mouse colonies [  ]. It is also important in multiple biological functions  such as delayed palate closure [] and soft tissue syndactyly []. Another gene detected with these approaches    is known to inhibit the activity of metalloproteinases  and shows high specificity and selectivity for the ADAM and ADAMTS families [] that are involved in melanoma cancerous cell development []. A signature of selection that included this gene was also found in the Southwestern European goat group and in particular in the Pyrenean goat population  which is characterized by a piebald black and white pattern  in the Argentata dell’Etna breed  which is characterized by a silver coat colour  and in the group of breeds from Northwestern Africa where Sahel  Peulh and Thari breeds are characterized by white or white spotted coat colours. However  for the last three breeds  no reliable pictures were available to evaluate the coat color pattern. The signatures of selection near the  gene observed in the Kacchan and Abergelle breeds could be related to their spotted phenotypes (in this case  this phenotype is localized mainly on the anterior parts of the animals) as already observed in other species. It should be noted that the Argentata dell’Etna breed has a silver phenotype and that  in the fox  an analogous phenotype is caused by a mutation on an autosomal copy of the  gene []. In this work  a strong association was found between the results of the landscape genomics analyses and those obtained using independent analyses based on other types of more categorical classifications  such as the Köppen classification. Several signals were associated with environmental parameters and these loci behave atypically in comparison with the theoretical distribution for neutral loci. Among the 13 common SNPs that differentiated the Dry and Temperate/Continental groups  i.e. between hot-dry and temperate-cold areas  all showed a different major allele  and this may be the sign of natural selection that is driving alleles in opposite directions for the adaptation of the breeds to different environments. These SNPs were also confirmed by landscape genomics analyses  i.e. although they are not included in the top 57 SNPs  they displayed a high significance for one or more bioclimatic variables. Several of the genes around these 13 SNPs are associated with production traits in cattle.  encodes a hormone that acts as a ghrelin inhibitor and is  therefore  involved in the regulation of the appetite  as shown in rats []. This gene is also associated with feed intake and weight gain in cattle []. Other genes  such as  and  may play a role in pubertal development  as shown in Brahman cattle []. Regarding   it was shown to be differentially expressed in cows with different milk citrate contents []. A region detected by FLK and landscape genomics and which is unique in the Continental group through  analysis contains the  and  genes. Calpains are calcium-regulated proteases involved in cellular functions that include muscle proteolysis both ante- and postmortem. In livestock  they play important roles in muscle growth and development  myoblast fusion  and differentiation []. The early post-mortem cleavage of these proteins leads to the tenderization of meat and  thus   genes have been associated with meat tenderness [  ]. The  gene is differentially expressed in pigs with different muscularity traits []. FLK analyses detected the  gene in the Southwestern European group and the central Asian group  particularly in the Thari and Blanca de Rasquera breeds. This well-known gene is responsible for the polled condition in most domestic sheep populations and associated with horn phenotypes in the Soay breed  a feral archaic sheep from Scottish islands  but it has not been shown to be involved in the development of horns in goats []. This signature of selection suggests that the genetic determinism of horns in these two goat populations may be specific compared to other goat breeds. The  gene was present in a signature of selection detected in the Egyptian group  particularly in the Nubian breed. It has been associated with signatures of selection linked to animal size in cattle [  ] and in European commercial and local pig breeds []. Temperature variation detected by the Samßada analyses can operate as a primary environmental stressor. A major cellular effect caused by multiple environmental stressors is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that leads to oxidative stress. This was reported in livestock species such as cattle and chickens. In goats  it could be supported by genes that are involved in pathways linked to temperature changes  such as insulin or glucose pathways and oxidative stress response. The  gene is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and has a role in protecting primary astrocytes against oxidative stress []. Another gene related to oxidative stress is the  gene  its level in pancreatic cells changing in case of oxidative stress []  which stimulates the  () gene in cardiac tissue []. The  gene is also the target of other important pathways related to insulin production  response of the organism to insulin and glucose metabolism. These biological processes are the most predominant in the landscape analyses. Heat stress can also affect the response of an organism to insulin stimulus  which in turn affects lipid and carbohydrate pathways [  ]. Several of the genes involved in pathways related to temperature changes were close to SNPs identified in our analyses and are associated with production traits in several species. For example   that is present in pathways related to insulin  glucose  glycogen  lipid  and carbohydrate processes is one of the most important genes for meat production and heat stress response in several species [  ]. Three SNPs located on chromosome 5 were detected by  analyses in the Tropical group. SNPs with the highest  value were included in the  cluster  and in the landscape genomics analysis they were associated with the bioclimatic variables defined as “isothermality” and “temperature seasonality”. A genome scan between geographical groups to detect signals of early adaptation identified the same region. The  gene family (     and  clusters) controls the body plan of the embryo along the craniocaudal (head–tail) axis. The  gene family was recently associated with mating/sexual behavior in Drosophila   and mice [  ]. Selective pressure on some  genes was also detected in bats and aquatic mammals [  ]. Recently  a signature of selection near the  and  gene clusters was also reported in sheep []. One of the strongest associations in the Samßada analysis was detected close to the  gene  which is involved in the morphological development of several parts of the body and tissues.  interacts with  gene clusters  which includes the  gene [  ]. It is interesting to note that most of the breeds assigned to the Tropical group were characterized by a smaller size (e.g. Cameroon goat  Naine  Small east Africa  and African Dwarf). It has been reported that that the small body size of Zebu cattle in tropical areas can contribute to heat tolerance  since small animals have a higher surface to body mass ratio  together with the fact that small size correlates also with low nutritional requirements []. These observations may apply also to goats and such genes can determine an adaptation towards a smaller size and therefore better heat management in areas where hot temperatures are constant. The genome scan for signatures of selection between geographical groups and the landscape genomics analysis detected several genes that are linked to circadian clock rhythm suggesting a possible association with adaptation at different latitudes. These included      and .  is required to drive the development of a functional network supporting light-circadian behaviors [].  encodes a circadian deadenylase expressed at high levels during the night in several mammalian tissues and was recently implicated in circadian control of metabolism [].  has an important function in the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity. In humans  it is crucial for normal regulation of circadian rhythms  lipid metabolism and neurotransmitter function []. This gene disrupts the transcription of the  gene  a key component of the mammalian circadian oscillator that regulates many other critical genes involved in metabolism  physiology  and behavior. A chromosomal deletion of  in mice is associated with a short circadian period  whereas in humans it is associated with the Smith-Magenis syndrome  a pathology that is characterized by an inverted melatonin rhythm  sleep disturbances  abnormal feeding  and cognitive disturbance [  ]. Finally   is involved in the production of tyrosine hydroxylase  which is important for the nervous system to function normally. Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamine  and hence plays a key role in the physiology of adrenergic neurons and receptors. It is involved in the production of neurotransmitters that control physical movements and involuntary body processes  such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. Moreover  in the response to photoperiod  it is well known that tyrosine hydroxylase neurons have estrogen receptors that are involved in the physiological cyclic activity induced by photoperiod []. Another gene that could be linked to the reproductive seasonality is   which has been reported to be associated with meat production and reproductive seasonality in goats []. The goat is one of the most adaptable livestock species distributed worldwide across a large variety of climatic and geographical areas and used by humans for different purposes. Natural and artificial pressures have led to different genomic signatures of selection across the genomes of many goat breeds. By applying different kinds of analyses  we were able to detect (1) different allelic distributions worldwide that are associated with bioclimatic variables and groups  (2) signatures of selection that differentiate breeds raised for different economical purposes  and (3) population structure clustering that represent sub-continental groups We were also able to identify several genomic regions that contain genes related to processes such as milk-  meat- or fiber-related production  coat color  glucose pathway  oxidative stress response  size and the internal circadian clock. These results provide a first comprehensive picture into the global domestication process and adaptation of the goat and highlights several genes that have contributed to the differentiation of this species worldwide.

In this study  we examined the effect of geographic isolation on caprine genetic diversity patterns by genotyping 480 individuals from 25 European and African breeds with the Goat SNP50 BeadChip and comparing patterns of homozygosity of insular and nearby continental breeds.ResultsAmong the breeds analysed  number and total length of ROH varied considerably and depending on breeds  ROH could cover a substantial fraction of the genome (up to 1.6 Gb in Icelandic goats). When compared with their continental counterparts  goats from Iceland  Madagascar  La Palma and Ireland (Bilberry and Arran) displayed a significant increase in ROH coverage  ROH number and  values ( value <<U+2009>0.05). Goats from Mediterranean islands represent a more complex case because certain populations displayed a significantly increased level of homozygosity (e.g. Girgentana) and others did not (e.g. Corse and Sarda). Correlations of number and total length of ROH for insular goat populations with the distance between islands and the nearest continental locations revealed an effect of extremely long distances on the patterns of homozygosity.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the effects of insularization on the patterns of homozygosity are variable. Goats raised in Madagascar  Iceland  Ireland (Bilberry and Arran) and La Palma  show high levels of homozygosity  whereas those bred in Mediterranean islands display patterns of homozygosity that are similar to those found in continental populations. These results indicate that the diversity of insular goat populations is modulated by multiple factors such as geographic distribution  population size  demographic history  trading and breed management."

In this study  we examined the effect of geographic isolation on caprine genetic diversity patterns by genotyping 480 individuals from 25 European and African breeds with the Goat SNP50 BeadChip and comparing patterns of homozygosity of insular and nearby continental breeds. Among the breeds analysed  number and total length of ROH varied considerably and depending on breeds  ROH could cover a substantial fraction of the genome (up to 1.6 Gb in Icelandic goats). When compared with their continental counterparts  goats from Iceland  Madagascar  La Palma and Ireland (Bilberry and Arran) displayed a significant increase in ROH coverage  ROH number and  values ( value <<U+2009>0.05). Goats from Mediterranean islands represent a more complex case because certain populations displayed a significantly increased level of homozygosity (e.g. Girgentana) and others did not (e.g. Corse and Sarda). Correlations of number and total length of ROH for insular goat populations with the distance between islands and the nearest continental locations revealed an effect of extremely long distances on the patterns of homozygosity. These results indicate that the effects of insularization on the patterns of homozygosity are variable. Goats raised in Madagascar  Iceland  Ireland (Bilberry and Arran) and La Palma  show high levels of homozygosity  whereas those bred in Mediterranean islands display patterns of homozygosity that are similar to those found in continental populations. These results indicate that the diversity of insular goat populations is modulated by multiple factors such as geographic distribution  population size  demographic history  trading and breed management. The advent of next-generation sequencing and high throughput genotyping techniques has made it possible to identify  in the genomes of multiple species  continuous homozygous stretches of sequence  which are named runs of homozygosity (ROH) []. The genomic distribution  abundance  and length of ROH are modulated by multiple factors including local recombination rate  guanine-cytosine content  positive selection and demography [  ]. A high frequency of long ROH is often caused by recent inbreeding  whereas a high frequency of short ROH can be explained by the occurrence of an ancient founder effect or population bottleneck. After the first pioneering study of Ferencakovic et al. []  the patterns of ROH have been characterized for multiple domestic species and breeds with the goal of making inferences about their history and demography as well as of identifying the genomic footprint of natural and artificial selection []. Geographic isolation of populations may lead to a considerable loss of diversity  an increase in inbreeding and vulnerability to stochastic events []. For instance  human populations with a history of prolonged isolation on the Orkney or Dalmatian Islands or in Sardinia have longer ROH than continental populations  which indicates an elevated relatedness [  ]. A high frequency of ROH can have detrimental effects on biological fitness and reproductive success because ROH are often enriched in deleterious mutations []. Indeed  mitochondrial encephalomyopathy is relatively frequent in people from the Faroe Islands due to homozygosity of the  gene []. In cattle  Zhang et al. [] reported that deleterious variations are overrepresented in ROH regions  particularly in those longer than 3 Mbp. However  geographically isolated populations may have retained ancient alleles or variants that are not found in other populations [  ]  which reflects adaptation to harsh environments and/or a practice of breed management that are not common for mainland populations [  ]. Recently  genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for a comprehensive panel of goats breeds has become available []. For the same panel of breeds  signatures of selection [] and the effects of population size  breed management and crossbreeding on the patterns of ROH as well as chromosomal ROH hotspots have been reported []. The aim of our study was to investigate if goat breeds that are raised in islands have higher levels of homozygosity than their continental counterparts. In order to achieve this goal  we compared the number and genomic coverage of ROH in 25 caprine breeds from 16 European and African islands with those of nine continental populations. Goats were sampled and genotyped as part of the AdaptMap project [] and see Table . The geographic distribution of the breeds investigated in this study is illustrated in Figure S1 (see Additional file : Figure S1). Genomic DNA was extracted with standard protocols and goats were genotyped with the Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip [] by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Monomorphic and unmapped SNPs in the whole dataset  and SNPs with a call rate lower than 98% were eliminated. Individuals with a genotype call rate lower than 96% were removed. Quality control was performed by using the PLINK program []. The final dataset included 46 654 SNPs and 480 goats with 260 and 220 individuals from insular and continental populations  respectively (Table ) and (see Additional file : Figure S1). In order to calculate allele-sharing distances (ASD)  linkage disequilibrium-pruning of SNPs was implemented (plink option—indep-pairwise 50 5 0.03) []  which retained 19 879 SNPs. The Zanardi software [] was used to identify ROH. Runs of homozygosity were defined as homozygous genomic stretches that are at least 1 Mb long and that contain a minimum number of 15 SNPs. We allowed one heterozygous SNP per ROH to account for genotyping errors. Coordinates of principal component analysis (PCA) and allele-sharing distances (ASD) were calculated with the PLINK program []. A neighbor-joining tree was built and visualized with the Splitstree program []. Genomic inbreeding derived from ROH coverage () was calculated by dividing total ROH length per individual by total genome length across all 29 autosomes (2456.50 Mb). Inbreeding coefficients i.e.      and  were calculated with the PLINK software [] for populations with at least 20 individuals. On the one hand  the—het command of PLINK [] was used to compute observed and expected autosomal homozygous genotype counts () and on the other hand  we used the—ibc command of PLINK [] to calculate    and  parameters. Observed heterozygosity (H) and effective size (N) parameters were retrieved from estimates provided by Colli and coworkers []. Statistical analyses were performed by using the R software v.2.15.3 []. The values and statistical significances of Spearman’s rank correlations (<U+03C1>) of  with H and N were computed. We also calculated Spearman’s rank correlations (<U+03C1>) of number and total length of ROH for insular goat populations with the distance between each island and the nearest continental location. We used a generalized least squares model implemented in the  package (R software v.2.15.3  []) to infer whether  and total ROH length and number differed significantly between continental and insular populations. We considered six groups of breeds and performed statistical comparisons between the breeds contained within each group (all breeds against each other within each group). We did not perform statistical comparisons between groups or between breeds belonging to different groups. The following groups of breeds were taken into consideration: (1) Icelandic goats  Danish  Dutch and Finnish Landrace; (2) Arran  Bilberry  Mulranny  and Fosses; (3) Argentata  Aspromontana  Ciociara Grigia  Corse  Girgentana  Maltese Sarda and Sarda; (4) Mallorquina and Blanca de Rasquera; (5) Moroccan goat and Palmera; and (6) Androy  Diana  Menabe  Matebele  Sofia and SudOuest. On the basis of exploratory analyses of the data (results not shown)  we used a model which assumes inequality of the variances (heteroscedasticity) that are associated with each of the three parameters taken into consideration ( and total ROH length and number) and each population: where  is a vector of the fixed effect “breed” (m levels)   is an incidence matrix relating  to   and  is a positive-definite matrix of the variances and covariances of the within-group errors. For full details on the methodology  see Pinheiro and Bates []. The least square means of each parameter and population were contrasted on a pairwise basis with a Wald univariate test of significance [] and multiple testing was adjusted with the Bonferroni correction. Our panel of goat breeds included insular breeds from different regions (see Additional file : Figure S1): Iceland (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>11) and Ireland (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>31) in northern Europe; Corsica (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>29)  Sardinia (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>39)  Sicily (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>48) and Mallorca (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>18) in Southern Europe; and La Palma (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>15) and Madagascar (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>69) in Africa. Each of these was compared to the nearest continental populations. Among the continental populations  the Finnish  Danish and Dutch goats belong to the Nordic type and are also subject to genetic isolation either because they are bred on a peninsula (Finland  Denmark) or managed under the scope of a strictly closed herdbook (Netherlands). The PCA first factorial map is shown in Fig. a. The first two coordinates PC1 and PC2 highlight the separation between Malagasy and Icelandic goats  respectively. These two breeds and the goat populations from La Palma and Iceland  also have extreme positions on the PC1-PC3 and PC1-PC4 plots (see Additional file : Figure S2)  but this was not observed for goats from Southern European islands (Mallorca  Corsica  Sardinia and Sicily).  PCA plot of individuals from 25 insular or continental populations. Red and dark blue indicate insular and continental breeds  respectively  with a high level of homozygosity. Pink and light blue indicate insular and continental breeds  respectively  with a low or moderate level of homozygosity.  Neighbor-joining tree based on allele-sharing distances representing the genetic relationships among insular and continental goat populations A neighbor-joining tree of ASD distances (Fig. b) shows a clear clustering of goats from the same breed  except for two Maltese Sarda goats that cluster with the Sarda and vice versa. Girgentana  Palmera and Sofia are nested within the Aspromontana  Morocco and Diana populations  respectively  while both Menabe and Sud-Ouest populations are within the Androy population. Most breeds appear to be homogeneous  except for Danish Landrace  Mallorquina and Aspromontana  which show some heterogeneity. For Icelandic  Irish  Palmera and Malagasy goats  we observed a decrease in genetic distances between individuals from the same breed (Fig. b) but not for goats from Mediterranean islands. Apart from the extremely inbred Icelandic goats []  genetic isolation was most intense for the Irish Arran  Dutch  Palmeran (Canary Islands) and Malagasy (Androy  Sofia  Diana  Menabe and Sud-Ouest) populations. As shown in Figure S3 (see Additional file : Figure S3)  the within-breed ASD distances correlate closely with H  which indicates that a tree as that shown in Fig. b faithfully illustrates the diversity patterns and at the same time reproduces the regional clustering of breeds []. The number of ROH and the total ROH coverage are displayed in Fig.  and the means and standard errors of these two parameters are in Fig.  and Table . Significant differences in ROH coverage  ROH number and  (P-value < 0.05) were observed between goats from Iceland  Madagascar  La Palma and Ireland (Bilberry and Arran) and their continental counterparts (Fig. ). Goats from Mediterranean islands represent a more complex case because certain populations display a significantly increased level of homozygosity (e.g. Girgentana) while others do not (e.g. Corse and Argentata).

In the Icelandic  Arran (Ireland)  Malagasy and Palmeran goat populations  the number of ROH and their total length range from 147 to 455 and from 423.28 to 1979.66 Mb (Fig.  and Table )  respectively  which correspond to extremely high inbreeding coefficients in Icelandic (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.66)  and Malagasy goats (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.19–0.35). The genetic isolation of the Dutch goats [] is evidenced by a high ROH coverage ranging from 133.11 to 889.28 Mb (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25) rather than by the number of ROH (41–102). Inbreeding coefficients are also high for the Palmeran (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23)  Bilberry (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.22) and Arran (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.30) populations (Fig.  and Table ). In contrast  Mediterranean insular goats have at most 122 ROH with a mean total length of 47.1–363.6 Mb (Fig.  and Table )  these values being similar to those observed for nearby continental goat populations (Fig. ). A total length of ROH greater than 500 Mb was observed only for a few Girgentana and Mallorquina goats.

The following codes are used (insular populations in bold): AND   (Madagascar); ARG   (Sicily); ARR   (Ireland); ASP  Aspromontana; BLB   (Ireland); CCG  Ciociara Grigia; CRS   (Corsica); DIA   (Madagascar); DKL  Danish Landrace; DUL  Dutch Landrace; FIN  Finnish Landrace; FSS  Fosses; GGT   (Sicily); ICL   (Iceland); MAL   (Mallorca); MEN   (Madagascar); MLS   (Sardinia); MOR  Moroccan goat; MTB  Matebele; MUL   (Ireland); PAL   (La Palma); RAS  Blanca de Rasquera; SAR   (Sardinia); SOF   (Madagascar); SOU   (Madagascar) In most breeds  we found an inverse relationship between ROH size and frequency (Fig. ). However  ROH longer than 1–5 Mb are relatively frequent in the genome of Icelandic  Irish  Dutch  Danish and Mallorquina goats. For the extremely inbred Iceland goat  an average of 366 ROH were detected  286 of which were longer than 1 to 5 Mb. We also investigated the relationship between  and several population parameters including (H  N and the inbreeding coefficients      and  calculated with PLINK [] i.e. (see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2). On the one hand  Spearman correlations coefficients between  and N and H were negative (<U+03C1><U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.87) and significant ( value <<U+2009>0.002)  which reflects that populations with smaller N undergo more genetic drift than larger populations [] and  in consequence  they tend to be more homozygous. On the other hand  Spearman correlations coefficients between  and the four inbreeding coefficients calculated with PLINK [] were positive (<U+03C1><U+2009><<U+2009>0.64–0.88) and significant ( value <<U+2009>0.01) or very significant ( value <<U+2009>0.0001). Previous studies have reported similar trends for correlations between  and a wide range of inbreeding coefficients [  ]. Distribution of ROH according to their size in African  European and Mediterranean insular and continental goat populations. The following codes are used (insular populations in bold): AND   (Madagascar); ARG  ; ARR   (Ireland); ASP  Aspromontana; BLB   (Ireland); CCG  Ciociara Grigia; CRS   (Corsica); DIA   (Madagascar); DKL  Danish Landrace; DUL  Dutch Landrace; FIN  Finnish Landrace; FSS  Fosses; GGT   (Sicily); ICL   (Iceland); MAL   (Mallorca); MEN   (Madagascar); MLS   (Sardinia); MOR  Moroccan goat; MTB  Matebele; MUL   (Ireland); PAL   (La Palma); RAS  Blanca de Rasquera; SAR   (Sardinia); SOF   (Madagascar); SOU   (Madagascar) We also calculated Spearman correlations coefficients of ROH length and number with the distance of insular goat populations to the nearest continental coastal site. For goats raised in distant islands  such as Iceland (1277 km from Norway) or Madagascar (1051 km from Mozambique)  ROH number and total length had the largest values. Spearman correlation coefficients of the distances with ROH number (<U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.54 and   value =<U+2009>0.023) and total length (<U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.63 and   value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007) were positive and significant. In insular and other isolated populations  homozygosity is often increased by founder effects and geographic isolation. In our study  the larger numbers and longer total lengths of ROH and higher  in goats from Iceland  Ireland  La Palma and Madagascar than in their continental counterparts illustrate this increase in the level of homozygosity (Table  and Figs.    and ). In contrast  Mediterranean insular and continental populations form a tight cluster. Although goat populations that are raised in remote islands tend to have higher levels of homozygosity  other factors are also involved  such as breed management  history and demography  which could have strong effects on breed diversity. We were not able to analyse the impact of some of these factors because of lack of information (historic and demographic records are scarce or completely absent for most of the breeds under analysis). The analysis illustrated in Fig. a reveals a strong separation between Malagasy and Matebele (Zimbabwe) and between Icelandic and Nordic Landrace goat populations and  to a lesser extent  between Palmeran and Moroccan goats. This result probably reflects the extreme geographic isolation of these three insular populations. Indeed  we found that ROH number and total length were correlated positively with distance between each island and the nearest continental location. Effects of insularization and/or small effective populations sizes were previously reported in a comparison between Japanese wild boars and Asian mainland pigs []  and for several insular and/or inbred cattle populations []. We observed the most extreme combined effects of founder events  geographic isolation and small population size for the Icelandic goats with 324 to 455 ROH that cover between 1263 and 1979 Mb  a high frequency of very long ROH (><U+2009>30 Mb) and a very high  of 0.66 (Table  and Figs.     ). Icelandic goats have a North-European (most likely Norwegian) origin and were imported during the colonization of Iceland over 1100 years ago [  ]. The lack of evidence for subsequent goat importations suggests a scenario of strong geographic isolation. Moreover  there were less than 100 Icelandic goats at the end of the nineteenth century and again in 1960  but  in 1994  the estimated census was equal to 348 heads distributed over 48 flocks []. Small population size combined with a fragmented distribution probably favoured the maintenance of high levels of inbreeding in this goat population. Old Irish goats  most notably those from Arran and Bilberry  also show increased ROH coverage  but not as extreme as that observed in Icelandic goats (Figs.     ). The extremely small population (27 in 2006  []) of Bilberry goats has led to the emergence of relatively long ROH (Figs.   )  which indicates recent consanguinity. Old Irish goats have been subjected to casual hunting and indiscriminate culling of feral herds  which has led this population to the verge of extinction []. Increased homozygosity was also observed in goat populations that have large population sizes but  as for the Icelandic and Irish goats  have endured a prolonged geographic isolation. For both Palmera and Malagasy goats  a relatively large number of ROH  high ROH coverage (Fig. ) and elevated  (0.19–0.35  Table ) were found  but short ROH (1–5 Mb) were predominant (Fig. ). This is probably the consequence of an ancient founder effect and geographic isolation  whereas their large population size (1.2 million in Madagascar and more than 6000 in La Palma) prevents consanguinity and the generation of long ROH. Madagascar  the fourth largest island in the world  was settled by Austronesians  who arrived from Borneo during the fifth to seventh centuries  and subsequently by Bantu people []  but it is clear that Malagasy goats are of African origin (Fig. ). The patterns of ROH observed in our study suggest that  after an initial founder effect  Malagasy goats were subject to a history of prolonged geographic isolation  with the distance of 1000 km between Madagascar and the African landmass constituting an effective barrier to gene flow. La Palma  in the Canarian archipelago  was settled 2500 YBP by colonists with probably a Berber ancestry and remained isolated from the main maritime routes until its colonization by the Spanish in the fifteenth century []. This North African ancestry of Palmeran goats is reflected in the neighbor-joining tree shown in Fig.   with Palmeran goats displaying a close relationship with Moroccan goats. In the La Palma island  a limited number of founders in combination with geographic isolation resulted in a low level of diversity of caprine mtDNA [] and a high ROH coverage. The above results are in strong contrast with the majority of the Mediterranean insular goat breeds showing ROH patterns and  values that are similar to those observed in nearby continental populations (Table  and Figs.       ). Mallorca  Corsica  Sicily and Sardinia are relatively close (5–300 km) to continental Europe and are located along maritime routes that were used intensively by the Phoenicians  Carthaginians  Greeks  Romans  Arabs and many other seafaring civilizations []. This situation probably favoured the recurrent admixture of goat populations with different genetic backgrounds  thus counteracting the decrease in genetic variation produced by the initial founder effect. This is also illustrated by the segregation of the mtDNA G haplogroup in Mallorquina goats  which so far has only been identified in goats from Egypt  Iran and Turkey []. Furthermore  a mixed ancestry with a major influence of Maltese goats has been mentioned for Sarda goat []. However  Mallorquina and Girgentana goats are exceptions with a high frequency of long ROH (><U+2009>30 Mb  Fig. ) and  values of 0.14 and 0.15  respectively. The highly endangered Mallorquina goats have suffered strong population bottlenecks (current census<U+2009>=<U+2009>150 individuals) []. The Girgentana breed has also experienced a strong demographic recession from 30 000 individuals in 1983 to 461 in 1993 []. Thus  for both these breeds  long ROH (><U+2009>30 Mb) are explained by population bottlenecks and recent inbreeding. As illustrated by the Finnish  Danish and Dutch Landrace breeds  genetic isolation may also occur in continental populations that are raised in remote locations from Finland and Denmark or subject to a strict breeding management and selection in combination with the occurrence of founder effects (Netherlands). The Dutch goat population has been revived since 1958: it started with two remaining individuals  involved undocumented crossbreeding and resulted in the current population of ca. 2000 animals []. Genetic distances show a relatedness to the Danish and Finnish Landrace populations  which was not detected by a panel of 26 microsatellites []. Remarkably  the numbers and length distributions of ROH for these populations are similar to those reported for British cattle breeds Angus  Hereford  Jersey and Guernsey []  and larger than those reported for central European continental goats (this study) or European continental cattle []. A common finding in several studies of ROH [    ] is the considerable variation in patterns of ROH within breeds. We observed this also in our dataset  in spite of the high level of within-breed homogeneity (Fig. b). The genomic coverage of ROH—up to 1.6 Gb in the Iceland breed and less than 100 Mb only for three breeds—indicates that a substantial part of the genes are homozygous  which may have detrimental consequences on the biological viability of isolated populations due to inbreeding depression and increased frequency of recessive hereditary diseases [    ]. However  small population sizes promote the loss of recessive gene defects. Thus  future work should investigate the consequences of high ROH coverage based on whole-genome sequence data. Our data show that insularization generally involves increased levels of homozygosity. At the same time  patterns of ROH are highly divergent among insular (and also continental) goat breeds: whereas goats that are raised in Madagascar  Iceland and La Palma  show high levels of homozygosity  those bred in Mediterranean islands display homozygosity patterns that are comparable to those found in continental populations. These results indicate that the effects of isolation are modulated by a complex network of factors including population size  breed history and demography  geographic distribution  trading and breed management  which either maintain strict isolation or allow cross-breeding.

However  such a resource is still lacking in goats. The application of a cheap tool for PA would help the management of goat populations by improving the reliability of pedigree registration and  consequently  allow a better implementation of breeding schemes or conservation programs. Using data from the current GoatSNP50 chip  starting from a worldwide dataset of more than 4000 animals belonging to more than 140 breeds and populations from the AdaptMap initiative  we selected a panel of 195 SNPs. The assignment rate of this panel was up to 100% on an additional dataset that included 2000 Alpine and Saanen animals and highly related candidate sires. In this study  we defined a highly informative SNP panel  which will be publicly available to worldwide breeders and laboratories. Its development on such a large number of breeds and populations  together with validation on a second set of cosmopolitan breeds  makes it a promising and important genomic tool for the goat species. Reliable genealogical information is essential for accurate genetic evaluation and the success of genetic improvement programs. Such goals can be achieved either by managing individual mating or by using artificial insemination  strategies that are time-consuming  expensive and sometimes difficult to incorporate into existing management practices such as summer pasturing in open areas and collective nurseries of kids. An approach to overcome this limitation is to determine genealogy after birth by a parentage tool that determines either both the dam and sire for a kid or only the sire (if the dam is recorded reliably). In sheep flocks using natural mating  a recent study [] showed that this can lead to an improved annual genetic gain. There are about 1 billion goats in the world  with ~<U+2009>1000 breeds []. Goats are genetically diverse  adapted to various landscapes  climates  and raised for meat  milk or fiber. They are quite easy to breed including in intensive rearing conditions and in the harsh conditions of developing countries []. Thus  although the design of an international parentage-testing tool is challenging  it is the best way to deliver a cheap and widely available tool for species with a comparatively low economic value. Molecular markers have been used for decades for this purpose in goat [  ]  for which the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG) recommends the use of a validated panel of microsatellites for such analyses []. The recent availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies allowed the production of dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips. In goat  the identification of ~<U+2009>12 million SNPs led to the design of a 53 K SNP chip  the GoatSNP50 chip  which is extensively used across the world []. SNPs have many advantages  which explain why they are replacing microsatellites in several parentage marker sets [  ]. In goats  a recent study proposed a method to select SNPs for this purpose  even when using only a few breeds and animals []. The AdaptMap initiative (; []) has collated 53 K genotypes from more than 140 breeds from 17 countries  providing an international dataset. Starting from AdaptMap SNP data  our aim was to select a panel of SNPs with high performance for both parentage assessment and assignment for 3887 animals belonging to 91 breeds. Two approaches were used: first  a method based on detecting the SNPs that best distinguish related pairs of individuals from all pairwise comparisons (relationship-based procedure)  and second  a method that selects the SNPs that maximize the minor allele frequencies (MAF) in the largest number of populations (MAF-based procedure)  respectively. The starting dataset for this study was produced under the scope of the AdaptMap initiative. After initial quality control filtering (based on the following criteria: SNP call rate higher than 98%  animal call rate higher than 96%  removal of animal duplicates that had a proportion of genotypes identical-by-state (IBS) higher than 99%) []  the dataset included 4261 individuals from 156 breeds and 48 895 SNPs from the Illumina GoatSNP50 chip []. Crossbred animals and populations with less than 15 individuals were removed. Cosmopolitan breeds were considered at the country level and thus split into different populations (e.g. Alpine breed from Switzerland  France and Italy were considered separately). A total of 106 populations were considered in the subsequent analyses  and all unmapped SNPs  according to the ARS1 SNP map version () []  were removed. After data screening  we proceeded with the construction of the SNP panel for parentage assessment. We applied two methods that aim at detecting different subsets of SNPs: (i) a relationship-based procedure that detects the SNPs that best distinguish between related and unrelated pairs of animals; and (ii) a minimum allele frequency (MAF)-based procedure that detects the highly variable SNPs within the different populations. All SNPs mapping to the X chromosome were excluded from the analysis. Then  a parentage test was performed on all pairwise comparisons of individuals by the detection of discordant homozygotes (also known as mendelian errors<U+2009>=<U+2009>ME) that were calculated using an in-house script at all 46 732 autosomal SNPs. All pairs of individuals that shared a small number of ME (<<U+2009>100) were considered as parent–offspring (PO  mean ME<U+2009>±<U+2009>SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>6.2)  whereas the remaining were treated as not PO (NPO  mean ME<U+2009>±<U+2009>SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>6561.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>1206.6). The most informative SNPs for parentage assessment were detected by using a newly developed procedure  based on the method for handling a large number of pairwise comparisons  published by Talenti et al. []. This new approach includes three steps that allows the reduction of highly complex datasets: (1) detection of the informative SNPs on each autosome; (2) detection of discriminant SNPs; and (3) reduction to the smallest panel size. Step (1) was performed on the quality-checked dataset and consisted of a first reduction of the panel size using: the exclusion probability (Pe)  i.e. the probability of observing opposing homozygotes at a SNP between a random eligible adult and a random offspring []; and the probability of a coincidental match (Pi)  i.e. the probability of a random coincidental match at a SNP between random animals []) that was calculated using an in-house script. In this step  we selected SNPs that had a Pi less than 1.0 and a Pe greater than 0.0 in a maximum of seven populations in order to keep a large number of informative SNPs. Step (2) included a recursive linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using the  package in R [  ]. LDA was performed on the pairwise comparisons between  individuals at each genotype  considering the PO/NPO labeling as the classifier. This created a dataset composed of  rows  and columns equal to the number of SNPs. Briefly  each SNP was evaluated for genotypic concordance at each pair of individuals  with the genotypes as the number of shared alleles (0/1/2). This dataset was analyzed through LDA analysis to detect the SNPs that best distinguish PO and NPO pairs of individuals. Since the analysis includes a large number of individual comparisons (><U+2009>7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  we developed a procedure to compare all available PO pairs with a large number of randomly chosen subsets of NPO pairs. The number of LDA performed was equal to the number of PO pairs  and then NPO pairs equal to 10 times the number of PO pairs were randomly selected. The best 200 SNPs resulting from the recursive LDA were considered for the subsequent analysis  with the number chosen to correspond to the size of the bovine ISAG panel []. After selection of the 200 best SNPs  step (3)  i.e. a final reduction was performed by evaluating each SNP separately  excluding the SNPs the removal of which did not increase the number of false positives. Although the 200-SNP size is equivalent to the official ISAG panel for the cattle species  this additional reduction was done to define the smallest subset of SNPs that can be used to obtain reliable results. Because estimation of MAF is sensitive to population size and relationships between animals  a population-reduction approach was applied for populations with more than 50 animals  and highly related animals were removed based on ME []. By using PLINK 1.9 []  MAF were computed for each SNP in each population. Then  two successive minimum MAF thresholds were applied to the SNPs on the 29 autosomes: the first threshold  i.e. MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.10  was applied to all 106 populations  and the second one  i.e. MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.20  was applied only to the 30 populations without related pairs of animals. For the X chromosome  SNPs were retained if they had a minimum MAF higher than 0.05 in each of the 106 populations. In the end  a linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based pruning step using PLINK’s simple pairwise model  was performed to remove SNPs that were in LD (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01) with each other by considering 50-kb windows and a 5-SNP step (command: –indep-pairwise 50 5 0.01). No minimum threshold for the minimum distance between markers was set. The two panels  which were selected either with the relationship- or the MAF-based procedure  were pooled. Then  we calculated: (1) MAF for all populations and SNPs; (2) Pe and Pi  at each SNP and for the whole panel  for all populations; (3) LD between SNPs; (4) the performance of the joint panel in all populations; (5) the assignment rate of the joint panel; and (6) the power of sex determination of the joint panel. The Pe and Pi statistics were estimated for each of the 106 populations to evaluate the ability of the SNPs to exclude individuals as potential parents or the probability of having a match at that genotype by chance. Finally  the P statistics for the whole panel were calculated as shown in []. Pe values for each population were reported as -<U+2009>log(Pe) to facilitate interpretation of the results and for populations that had a Pe<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  the value was set to a default value of 16. Similarly  Pi were reported as -<U+2009>log(Pi)/10  to make them comparable to the Pe scores (see Additional file : Table S1). Pairwise LD between all SNPs included in the resulting 195-SNP panel was estimated using PLINK 1.9 []. After estimating LD levels in the whole dataset  we evaluated the exclusion ability of the panel based on the direct genotypic exclusion. In this case  a pair of individuals was defined as unrelated if they had two or more discordant homozygotes (1% of all SNPs). Two French populations from a quantitative trait locus (QTL) study [] were used to assess the assignment efficiency of the SNP panel. The genotypes for the SNPs in this subset were extracted from 53 K genotypes for 810 Saanen and 1175 Alpine females  and highly related candidate sires: the true sires (9 and 11  respectively  in the Saanen and Alpine breeds) and half-sibs or sires of the true sires (62 and 70  respectively  in the Saanen and Alpine breeds). Genotypes were missing for all of the dams. Then  an in-house script  based on a maximum likelihood approach and exclusion [  ] was applied to infer paternities. A LOD score was computed as the log of the ratio between the likelihood given the genotype of both parents and the likelihood given the genotype of the dam (or allelic frequencies of the parental population if the dam was missing). For each female  all candidate sires were tested  including the true sires. The sire with the best results was kept according to the LOD score (><U+2009>0)  the number of missing SNPs (<<U+2009>50)  the number of SNPs showing Mendelian errors (<<U+2009>2) and the posterior probability of the candidate being the true sire (=<U+2009>0.99). The sire identified from this panel was compared to the true sire  determined by the 53 K genotypes. Two parameters that indicated the efficiency of the parentage test were computed: the specificity—as the ratio of the number of nonparents excluded over the total number of nonparents; and the sensitivity—as the ratio of true parents assigned over the total number of true parents. Because no SNPs were mapped to the Y chromosome  we used the SNPs on the X chromosome to test the probability that an animal was simultaneously homozygous at all the SNPs  and thus  the probability that a female is confused with a male. We checked that none of the SNPs mapped to the pseudo-autosomal region (data not shown). This probability was computed for each population as:   where  is the MAF. After removing unmapped SNPs  48 161 SNPs distributed across all chromosomes were retained in the dataset. Three hundred and seventy-four individuals belonging to 50 populations with less than 13 animals and 102 animals from 12 crossbred populations were removed. Seven cosmopolitan breeds were divided into 22 different populations based on their country of origin. The final dataset consisted of 3887 animals from 106 populations corresponding to 91 different breeds (see Additional file : Table S1). After exclusion of SNPs mapping to the sex chromosomes  46 732 SNPs distributed over the autosomes were retained in the dataset and used to perform the relationship-based selection. A total of 7 552 441 pairwise comparisons between individuals were performed; 802 pairs of individuals were found as PO (0.01% of the total pairwise comparisons). Among the 106 populations  76 were found with PO pairs (see Additional file : Table S1). The number of PO pairs per population ranged from 1 to 188  with an average of 11. The first step  excluding uninformative SNPs in more than seven populations based on Pe/Pi  led to the removal of 45 553 SNPs  leaving only 1179 markers (i.e. 2.5% of all SNPs). This is the strongest selection step performed on the whole dataset  since it is difficult to identify SNPs that have a Pe greater than 0 in a large number of populations. A more stringent threshold would lead to a larger number of SNPs removed  which is not directly comparable with the ability to discriminate between PO and NPO pairs. The second step selected a 200-SNP set  which was further reduced by removing SNPs that did not affect the number of false positives detected. This procedure reduced the size of the panel to 147 SNPs (see Additional file : Table S2)  which performed equally well as the 200-SNP panel. Among the 3887 animals of the shared dataset  2854 were retained after population reduction to compute MAF (see Additional file : Table S1). The size of the populations ranged from 13 to 50  with an average of 27 animals per population. The selection based on MAF thresholds led to retaining 31 SNPs that mapped to the 29 autosomes and 27 SNPs that mapped to the X chromosome. Among these  eight SNPs on the X chromosome were removed after the LD-based pruning  leading to a 50-SNP panel. The two approaches used different thresholds and methods to select the SNPs that were necessary to assess or assign parentage among individuals. This may result in the stringency of thresholds being higher in one method compared to the other  and therefore lead to the identification of panels with different sizes. The 147-SNP panel selected in the relationship-based procedure and the 50-SNP panel selected in the MAF-based procedure were pooled to create a unique panel of SNPs with either a high discrimination power or a high variability in the different populations. After removing two SNPs that were present in both panels  195 SNPs were retained (see Additional file : Table S2). The presence of such a small number of shared SNPs between the two methodologies confirm that they are based on different principles  with the first one focusing on the SNPs that distinguish mainly the pairs of related and unrelated individuals and the second one identifying the SNPs that vary mainly within the different breeds. These 195 SNPs were not distributed uniformly along the genome. The largest absolute number of SNPs was on the X chromosome (<U+2009>=<U+2009>19  1.19% of the initial SNPs on that chromosome)  which were also retained for their usefulness in sex determination. Among the autosomes  the largest number of SNPs was on chromosome 22 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>13  1.18% of the initial number of SNPs on that chromosome)  whereas chromosome 16 was the only one with no SNPs left after reduction. One hundred and fifty-nine SNPs belonging to the joint panel had a MAF higher than 0 in all populations  31 SNPs were monomorphic in one population  three SNPs in two populations and two SNPs in three populations. The average MAF value for each population ranged from 0.277 (Madagascar Menabe) to 0.413 (Egyptian Barki breed). The number of populations that had no exclusion power at the identified SNPs (number of populations with Pe<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 at a single SNP) ranged from 1 to 12 (1 to 11% of all populations)  as shown in Additional file : Figure S1a. Among the SNPs  for 92.8% of the SNPs there were more than seven breeds with Pe<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  as expected since this parameter is one of the major criteria used to select the SNPs during the first step of the relationship-based procedure. The average Pe for each breed ranged from 0.072 for the Pakistan Barbari breed to 0.152 for the Italian Ciociara Grigia (see Additional file : Figure S1b). The -<U+2009>log(Pe) values ranged from 6.5 for the Pakistan Barbari breed to 16 for 15 breeds (Saanen  Oasis  Blanca de Rasquera  Alpine  Corse  Fosses  Poitevine  Pyrenees  Aspromontana  Ciociara Gricia  Nicastrese  Sarda  Red Sokoto and Spanish). The number of populations that had a probability of 1 of a coincidental match at the identified SNPs (number of populations with Pi<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 at a single SNP) ranged from 0 to 3 (0 to 3% of all populations)  as shown in Additional file : Figure S1a. For 81% of the SNPs  there were no breeds with Pi<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  confirming the ability to distinguish between individuals. The average Pi for each breed ranged from 0.385 for the Egyptian Barki breed to 0.516 for the Spanish Palmera breed (see Additional file : Figure S1b). As shown in Additional file : Table S1  the -<U+2009>log(Pi)/10 values obtained on the 195-SNP panel ranged from 5.9 for the Palmera breed to 8.1 for the Saidi breed. Pairwise LD between all SNPs included in the 195-SNP panel was estimated (Fig. )  with values  ranging from 5.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to 0.03  with an average (±<U+2009>SD) of 0.0016<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.0024. Linkage disequilibrium between the 195 SNPs of the reduced panel  calculated as  values for each pair of SNPs (blue dots). In red  we report the LD decay as the average in the following windows: 10–100 kb  100–250 kb  250 kb–1 Mb and then every 1 Mb After the estimation of LD levels in the whole dataset  an evaluation of the exclusion ability of the panel was performed based on the shared discordant homozygotes (<<U+2009>1% of all SNPs). The performances were then reported as: the ability to assign true relationships correctly (sensitivity)  the ability to exclude unrelated pairs correctly (specificity)  the overall ability to assign a pair of individuals to its group (accuracy)  the probability of being related having a positive result (positive predictive value; PPV) and of being unrelated having a negative response (negative predictive value; NPV). Performances were estimated for the cleaned dataset using the 195-SNP panel with and without the SNPs on the X chromosome (Table ). As shown in Table   the panel including SNPs on the X chromosome displayed a strong ability to exclude unrelated individuals as parents  with only two false positive among the 7.5 million pairwise comparisons. However  it shows a low sensitivity  excluding a large number of pairwise comparisons among related individuals. All but one of these unassigned related pair involved at least one male. Thus  exclusion ability differed between pairs that involved males compared to female-only pairs. In fact  performing an assignment without the SNPs on the X chromosome resulted in a slightly lower specificity (four false positives instead of two) but to a much higher sensitivity (four false negatives instead of 174). This confirms the need to remove the SNPs mapped to the X chromosome in comparisons involving males  since they are uninformative and can lead to a large number of false negatives. The assignment efficiency was evaluated on an independent dataset from a QTL design which included the true sires  and consisting of 57 510 father-offspring combinations in the Saanen breed and 95 175 in the Alpine breed. For 752 combinations in the Saanen breed and 1143 in the Alpine breed  no Mendelian inheritance conflicts were found  which corresponds to 93 and 97% of the total number of offspring  respectively for the Saanen and Alpine breeds. The LOD score was positive for 840 combinations in the Saanen breed and 1222 in the Alpine breed  which is more than the number of single father-offspring combinations. The posterior probability reached a threshold of 99% for all the offspring in the Saanen breed and for 1173 pairs (99.8% of the total number of offspring) in the Alpine breed. Among the 1175 females of the Alpine breed and the 810 females of the Saanen breed  all were assigned to their true sires if these were included  which corresponded to a power of 100%. The sensitivity is also 100% since no females were assigned to an incorrect sire  whether the true sire was included or not. The MAF for each SNP on the X chromosome (<U+2009>=<U+2009>19) and each population (<U+2009>=<U+2009>106) ranged from 0.10 to 0.50 (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35). Based on these MAF  the probability of being homozygous simultaneously at the 19 SNPs was estimated. On average for the 106 populations  this probability reached 2.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  which indicates that a female can be detected with a very high reliability  using our SNP panel. This probability varied according to the population but remained very low regardless of the population: the best result was obtained for the Barki breed (probability<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and the worst for the Palmera breed (probability<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Our findings suggest that the panel of SNPs identified here is suitable and readily applicable for parentage and sex assessment and assignment for a large number of worldwide goat breeds. In addition  this panel was validated on a large  independent dataset that includes French Saanen and Alpine goats. Although this tool could be of great value for breeding and genetic variability management  the on-field application is still limited due to the high cost of the technology which  compared to the value of the individuals  is still unaffordable. However  the fast and strong improvement of genotyping technologies will probably allow cost-effective genotyping of small sets of SNPs in the near future. This would provide the opportunity to apply this technology to goats and allow a better management of the biodiversity and genetic improvement of this economically important species  especially in marginal areas of the world.

Rainbow trout () is a freshwater fish farmed in almost every continent  with production estimated at around 813 000 tons in 2014 (FAO). With the increase in production  resistance to diseases has become a major field of research in order to limit economic losses associated with diseases.  is the causative agent of bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD) also called rainbow trout fry syndrome in small fish [  ]. BCWD occurs worldwide and  according to []  it is the second most important trout disease that affects French farms. It causes high mortalities (up to 70%) and deformities may occur in surviving fish [    ]  with important economic impacts. In spite of intensive research to develop efficient vaccines [  ] and the recent commercialisation of a vaccine in some countries (ALPHA JECT  IPNV-Flavo 0.025 PHARMAQ)  the usual way to combat the disease remains the use of antibiotic treatments  which raises environmental concerns and issues about the emergence of antibiotic resistance [  ]. Therefore  there is a crucial need for other methods to control the disease. Selective breeding for natural genetic resistance to  is a promising approach since previous studies have revealed the existence of genetic variation for this trait. Moderate heritabilities were estimated in European and North American domestic broodstocks [  ]  and Leeds et al. [] demonstrated that genetic gain could be obtained in experimental conditions after two generations of selection. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance measured as time to death or survival have been detected using linkage or association studies [     ] in which resistance to  was assessed using injection protocols for experimental infection. Madsen and Dalsgaard [] and Garcia et al. [] compared injection (intraperitoneal or intramuscular)  immersion  immersion combined with stress (skin lesion or formalin treatment) and cohabitation with infected fish as infection challenge methods with . They concluded that the injection method was more reproducible than immersion and observed a higher mortality rate after injection challenge (70–90%)  than after immersion challenge (30–55%). However  injection is a route of infection that bypasses the physical and immune barriers of skin and mucosa  and likely modifies the tissues that are targeted by the primary infection within the host. Similar differences between infection routes were also reported for other bacterial and viral pathogens that affect rainbow trout  such as  []  the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus []  and the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus []. Infection with  seemed to be more efficient when fish were stressed by formalin treatment or when the skin was damaged prior to immersion [      ]  which suggests that external barriers hinder entry of the bacteria.  has been observed in the skin mucus  in gills  and in connective tissue of the fins and operculum of salmonid fish [  ]  but the precise sites of entry of the pathogen remain unknown. Epithelia (skin  gills  nasopharynx and gut) are considered important portals of entry of pathogens [  ]  even if the mucus layer constitutes an efficient barrier. Mucus contains multiple antimicrobial factors  such as lysozyme  proteins of the complement system  heat shock proteins or immunoglobulins  which are involved in specific or non-specific defence mechanisms [   ]. In fact  many bacteria  both commensal and pathogenic  are commonly found in the mucus  and adhesion to mucus is a classical virulence factor [  ]. Composition of the skin microbiota  which plays a protective role against infection [  ]  is partly under genetic control  and QTL that are associated with abundance of some bacterial genera that are known to provide protection against pathogens have been identified []. Immersion challenge with  probably reflects natural infection of rainbow trout better than injection. Thus  we developed a reproducible immersion challenge that does not involve preliminary stress [] and used it to investigate the genetic variation of trout resistance to . Compared to injection challenge  immersion challenge may reveal QTL that drive defence mechanisms associated either with the entry of the bacterium into the host or with the host response once the pathogen has entered via the “natural” route  expanding the possibility of investigation of host antibacterial response. In this study  we took advantage of homozygous doubled haploid (DH) trout lines with contrasting susceptibilities to  to search for resistance-associated QTL  using both routes of infection  as a first step towards a better understanding of the host response to infection and the identification of candidate (causative) genes. Investigating the resistance to  is difficult since the establishment of reproducible experimental challenges  especially with immersion protocols  is very complicated. DH isogenic lines with contrasting resistance levels to  represent a very useful resource to perform such experimental challenges and to identify susceptible versus resistant genetic backgrounds. Moreover  the use of DH lines allows powerful and simple genetic analyses [  ] with designs that are relevant to investigate interactions between QTL. Such interactions likely contribute to the variability of complex traits [] but  to date  have been scarcely investigated. At INRA  we have established a collection of 16 isogenic homozygous rainbow trout lines that were derived from the INRA SY rainbow trout population after two generations of gynogenetic reproduction and further propagated by within-line single pair mating []. The lines have been screened for resistance to various diseases including several viruses [  ] and more recently  for resistance to   using either injection or immersion as routes of infection [  and unpublished results]. In this study  we selected two lines (B57 and AP2) with contrasting resistance to  as F0 grandparents to produce the QTL family. Overall  line AP2 ranked among the most resistant of the 16 lines whereas B57 was consistently more susceptible (see Additional file : Figure S1). One B57 female was mated to one AP2 sex-reversed male to produce a F1 isogenic family  consisting of all females that share the same genetic background and that are heterozygous at loci for which different alleles were fixed in the two F0 isogenic lines. One single F1 female was reproduced using mitotic gynogenesis in order to produce the QTL mapping family. Eggs were fertilized with UV-genetically inactivated milt and heat-shocked soon after fertilization in order to produce DH progeny by inhibition of the first embryonic mitosis []. Thus  the resulting offspring carried only one grandparental allelic variant at each locus. Males that were homozygous for a dominant body colour variant (golden phenotype) were used as milt donors for gynogenesis. The lack of golden fry in the progeny and of surviving fry in the haploid control (no heat-shock after fertilization with irradiated milt) served as control of the efficiency of the irradiation process. Since DH progeny are homozygous  the power of QTL detection is increased by accurate evaluation of the effect of allelic substitution [    ]. In the context of the recent whole-genome duplication event that occurred in the salmonid ancestor  DH individuals can also facilitate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and genotyping in rainbow trout  and decrease the false discovery rate of paralogous sequence variants (PSV) as putative true allelic SNP variants []. F0 and F1 breeders were reared and spawned at the INRA PEIMA experimental farm (Sizun  France). The F2 progeny were incubated at the PEIMA farm. Eyed eggs were transported to the INRA IERP facilities (Jouy-en-Josas  France)  iodine disinfected  and placed into rearing units that were supplied with recirculated  de-chlorinated tap water at a constant temperature of 10 °C. In total  558 F2 progeny were produced  among which 372 were used for QTL detection (genotyping and phenotyping in infectious challenge). The 186 remaining un-phenotyped progeny were added to the genotype dataset in order to construct a more precise linkage map. At about three months post-hatching  the 372 QTL progeny were anaesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol (0.2 mL/L)  individually tagged (intraperitoneal implantation of a micro chip “Biolog-Tiny ID”) and reared under standard conditions (constant 10 °C and a commercial diet) until infectious challenges. Two different routes of infection  i.e. immersion and intramuscular injection  were compared. In both cases  fish were inoculated with  FRGDSA 1882/11  a strain that was isolated in 2011 from a diseased rainbow trout during a severe outbreak in a trout farm in the South-West of France and belonging to the clonal complex CC-ST90 []. For both immersion and injection challenges   was grown at 18 °C in TYES broth on a rotatory shaker at 200 rpm until late exponential phase (OD approximately 1). Broth cultures were used for infection experiments following a posteriori bacteria counting by inoculation of serial dilutions on agar and counting of visible colonies after 48 h of incubation at 18 °C. The immersion challenge was carried out when fish were about 5 months old  with a mean body weight of 4.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.3 g. Prior to infection  225 fish were randomly sampled from the QTL progeny and equally distributed into three 10-L aquaria. Each fish was weighed and its individual tag was recorded. After a few days of acclimation  fish were infected by immersion for 4 h in a bacterial suspension (approximately 8.10 cfu/mL) in static water maintained at 10 °C with vigorous aeration. Bacteria were counted in water as above. Preliminary tests had revealed that  strain FRGDSA 1882/11 is highly virulent when inoculated by injection and causes extremely high mortality in young fish. In order to fine-tune the level of the infectious dose and to be able to discriminate between susceptible and resistant fish for QTL detection  the injection challenge was performed when fish reached a larger size (around 8 months old with a mean body weight of 21.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>6.9 g). For the injection challenge  the broth culture was centrifuged and bacterial cells were rinsed once in saline buffer. Drops (25 µL) of serial dilutions of bacterial suspension were inoculated on agar for counting. As for immersion  147 F2 progeny were randomly distributed into three 10-L aquaria (47–50 fish per aquarium). After a few days of acclimation  fish were anaesthetized and received an intramuscular injection of 50 µL of bacterial suspension  corresponding to approximately 145 CFU/fish  close to the dorsal fin. After infection (immersion or injection)  fish were kept at 10 °C with adequate water flow. Two fish that died within the first 2 days after infection were discarded (one for each challenge). Mortality was monitored twice a day. Dead fish were identified individually by tag recording. When mortality reached a plateau (49 and 35 days for the immersion and injection challenge  respectively)  surviving fish were sacrificed by anaesthetic overdose  weighed and identified. A piece of caudal fin was clipped from all individuals at the time of identification and stored in 100% ethanol for DNA extraction. Two fish from the immersion challenge and three fish from the injection challenge were discarded because tag recording was not possible. For each challenge  the post-challenge dataset included body weight at the time of challenge  survival status of each fish (dead or alive at the end of the challenge) and time to death (in days after infection  for dead fish only). In total  DNA was extracted from 555 fin samples using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) with an RNAse step. Total DNA was quantified by measuring optical density at 260 nm (OD) with a Qubit fluorometer. DNA quality was assessed by the OD/OD ratio and by visual control on gel electrophoresis. All samples were diluted to 100 ng/µL before they were sent for RAD sequencing. Samples included the two F0 grandparents (AP2 and B57)  the F1 female parent (and another isogenic F1 individual as backup) and 551 F2 DH progeny  among which the 365 progeny used for QTL detection (222 for immersion and 143 for injection  respectively) and the 186 additional F2 progeny that were genotyped only to strengthen SNP calling and the linkage map. To ensure sufficient sequencing depth of breeders  samples of the F0 and F1 parents were replicated (four replicates for F0 and eight replicates for F1). DNA samples were sent to the GeT-PlaGe sequencing platform ([]  Toulouse  France ) for restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) according to the protocol in []. Each DNA sample was digested with the  restriction enzyme and then barcoded by adding P1 adaptors  which contained a 5-bp nucleotide barcode that differed by at least three nucleotides. Twelve sequencing libraries were generated with 48 pooled samples. Libraries were subsequently cut to a size of less than 800 bp by sonication. After size selection (250 bp on average) on agarose gel  the pooled libraries were purified  ligated to a P2 adaptor  and amplified by PCR. RAD libraries were paired-end sequenced (100 bp paired-end reads) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer at the GeT-PlaGe sequencing platform. First  sequencing reads were demultiplexed and assigned to a single individual allowing no mismatch in the P1 barcode and one mismatch in the restriction site. Data from seven samples from F2 progeny that had less than one million reads were removed from the analysis. In order to facilitate detection of PSV []  the dataset was supplemented with 20 DH individuals that were used as external controls. These DH individuals were sequenced in previous projects using the same RAD-sequencing methodology and restriction enzyme (unpublished data). For SNP calling  sequence reads were processed through a de novo analysis using the  pipeline of the software Stacks version 1.19 [  ]. PCR duplicates were removed using the Stacks clone-filter program. Reads from replicates of the F0  F1 and F2 individuals were merged into a single sequence file per individual. In a first step  the ustacks program was used to identify putative loci for each sample. The minimum depth of coverage required to create a stack (group of identical reads or putative allele) was set at 3 (-m option)  while the maximum distance allowed between stacks  was set at 2 nucleotides (-M option). These nucleotide differences take potential SNP and sequencing errors into account. Only primary reads were used (-N option equal to 0). The maximum number of stacks (i.e. maximum number of alleles) at a single de novo locus was set at 2 (max_locus_stacks option) in order to allow detection of putative duplicated loci. Next  the cstacks program was used to create a catalogue of loci by setting the number of mismatches allowed between samples to 1 (-n option). Finally  genotypes of all individuals (F0  F1  F2 and DH controls) were called using the sstacks program that matches individual stacks against the catalogue. The Stacks population program was used to calculate the frequency of genotypes at each locus. Sequence data from the two F1 individuals were used to identify polymorphic and monomorphic loci. To be consistent with the pedigree of the QTL family (DH progeny of a cross between two DH homozygous grandparents)  only bi-allelic loci were considered (17 460 out of 20 305 polymorphic loci identified in the Stacks catalogue).  The two F0 grandparents and the 20 external DH individuals served as controls to detect putative duplicated loci. Since all DH individuals are expected to be homozygous  a heterozygous genotype at a given locus indicates a PSV rather than a true allelic variant. Therefore  all loci that appeared heterozygous in at least two DH control individuals were discarded (list provided in Additional file : Table S1).  Sequence data from 37 individuals were removed because of technical problems. Filtering of loci and individuals was based on call rate and call frequency as follows: F2 individuals with genotype calls for less than 20% of genotyped loci and loci with genotype calls for less than 70% of F2 individuals were discarded. Homozygosity for each F2 individual was checked on the 11 570 remaining loci and 24 fish were found to have a heterozygosity rate higher than 1%. Previous studies performed on isogenic lines [  ] assumed that residual heterozygous loci may be due to unreduced ova  donor milt contamination  mutation or sequencing errors. We did not find any F2 individual that was heterozygous at loci where the two grandparents shared the same allele  so contamination by donor milt was excluded. Spontaneous retention of a second polar body is suspected to be at the origin of unreduced ova. Under this hypothesis  a number of loci will retain the heterozygosity of the mother  at a frequency that depends on recombination during meiosis [  ]. Since recombination rates are higher in telomeric than centrometric regions of chromosomes [  ]  a higher residual heterozygosity level is expected in telomeric regions. For the 24 fish that had an overall heterozygous rate higher than 1% (min: 1.12%; max: 65.04%)  a gradient of heterozygosity rate was observed along the chromosome arms  which was consistent with the proportion of heterozygous loci being higher in telomeric regions than around the centromere (see Additional file : Figure S2). This supports the hypothesis that the 24 F2 progeny that exhibited a high frequency of heterozygous loci probably originated from spontaneously unreduced ova. Those individuals were discarded from the analysis. The remaining F2 fish had a heterozygosity rate lower than 1% and were considered as true doubled haploids. The remaining heterozygous loci were considered to result from sequencing errors or mutations and were set to missing genotypes before the last filtering step based on minor allele frequency (MAF) and individual coverage. Since the F2 fish were produced by mitotic gynogenesis from a single F1 female  a 1:1 ratio was expected for the alternative F0 alleles (AP2 and B57). Therefore  the remaining loci with a MAF lower than 0.30 were filtered out. In the end  only fish with more than 90% of called genotypes were kept for further analysis. The 1.2 version of the CarthaGène software [  ] was used to build the F2 family linkage map. The DH progeny were described as a backcross in the CarthaGène software. The group command was used  with the thresholds for two-point distance (Haldane/Ray) and logarithm of odds (LOD) set at 0.3 and 15  respectively. Linkage groups were assigned to trout chromosomes by blasting the sequences of RAD markers on the most recent published reference trout genome  Omyk_1.0 []. QTL mapping was performed by chromosome with the QTLMap software [] (version 0.9.8). For each chromosome  the hypothesis that one QTL (H1) versus no QTL (H0) affects the trait of interest was tested with the interval mapping method described in []  using an approximate likelihood ratio test (LRT []) and scanning the chromosome in intervals of 1 cM. To take into account the fact that the F2 individuals are gynogenetic doubled haploids  they were coded as half-sib from a single sire (F1) and an unknown virtual dam that was different for each F2 fish []. The two challenges  injection and immersion  were analysed separately. The effects of body weight at challenge and aquarium on survival were tested with the average-to-average method (ANOVA) model on time to death and the logistic regression on the status as the end of the challenge with the R software  version 3.4.2 []. The effect of body weight was never significant but the aquarium effect was significant in all cases. Using a model  that included aquarium as the only fixed effect  RESISTANCE was assessed using the unitrait Cox model option (calcul<U+2009>=<U+2009>7; []) in QTLMap. Cox model fits a survival analysis model that makes no assumption on the trait distribution and that takes time to death and censoring into account [  ]. Surviving fish at the end of the period of survey corresponded to ‘censored’ observations   the expected event (death) was not observed during the observation period. In this analysis  the QTL effect is calculated for each genotype (allele) as a relative risk  with the B57 line origin taken as the reference (relative risk<U+2009>=<U+2009>1). STATUS (dead/alive) was also analysed as a trait of practical interest for breeders  using the unitrait discrete distribution option of QTLMap (calcul<U+2009>=<U+2009>2; []) with value 1 for survivors and 0 for dead fish. Using the variable STATUS  it was also possible to refine the model to search for additional QTL that might have been masked by effects of the main QTL and/or by epistatic interactions between QTL. A new model () was applied  in which aquarium and the QTL detected for STATUS with model  were considered as fixed effects  along with interactions between the QTL used as co-factor and the newly detected QTL. To control the false discovery rate due to multiple-testing  the  values associated with interactions were corrected with the Benjamini–Hochberg method (BH) [] implemented in the R software  version 3.4.2 [] (stat package version 3.6.0  option p.adjust). Finally  ENDURANCE  which was defined as the time until death for fish that died during the experimental period []  was investigated as a complementary description of possible host–pathogen interaction during infection. ENDURANCE was measured in dead fish only and was analysed using the unitrait Gaussian distribution option of QTLMap with model . For each chromosome  when a QTL was suspected  the empirical distribution of the LRT was obtained with QTLMap from 1000 simulations (for STATUS and ENDURANCE) or permutations (for RESISTANCE) under the null hypothesis with trait heritability fixed at 0.5 for each chromosome. Then  we estimated the type-I error rejection threshold of H0 at the chromosome-wide level using the method described by Harrell and Davis []. A QTL with a chromosome-wide <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01 was considered significant. For each QTL that was chromosome-wide significant at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001  the genome-wide level significance threshold was tested with 10 000 simulations/permutations under H0 and a Bonferroni correction to adjust the type-I error for number of chromosomes. Under H1  the QTL effect was estimated as the allelic substitution effect in a standard F2 progeny. Because progeny were doubled haploids  this effect corresponds to half the difference between the mean values of the trait in the two alternative homozygous progeny. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the QTL were obtained using the method of Li []  in which the distribution of QTL locations is approximated from likelihood. For each significant QTL and each trait  we identified the grandparental origin of the allele at the QTL position  and thus determined the line origin of resistance/susceptibility. For all traits and each QTL  the maximum likelihood ratio test (LRTmax) curves were inspected visually. When the LRTmax curves showed two peaks  the hypothesis of two QTL (H2) versus one QTL (H1) was tested. Because the test was available only for the unitrait model for the time to death  fish that survived were given a time of death at d<U+2009>+<U+2009>1  with d the day of death of the last fish that died  but it never reached the chromosome-wide significance level. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by a QTL in the DH progeny was calculated with the R software []  using ANOVA for ENDURANCE and logistic regression for STATUS. Fish from the QTL family were challenged with  via two modes of infection: after the immersion challenge  the overall survival rate was 77% at day 48 (out of 225 infected fish) whereas after the injection challenge  it was 55% at day 34 (out of 147 infected fish) (Fig. ). These values were in the range of survival rates recorded in previous challenges with the  strain FRGDSA 1882/11. Regardless of the route of infection  individual body weight at the time of infection had no significant effect on time to death or on the final survival rate (STATUS). Fish that survived and died following the immersion protocol had the same mean body weight at the time of challenge (4.6 g). Accordingly  the mean body weight at the time of infection using injection was 20.9 g and 22.6 g (not significant) for surviving and dead fish  respectively (see Additional file : Table S2). Survival curves after  infection of DH fish used for QTL detection. Kaplan–Meier estimation of survival functions after infectious challenges for the QTL family. The pink curve corresponds to the hazard function of DH progeny challenged by immersion (225 fish  3 aquaria  49 days) and the blue curve corresponds to the Hazard function of DH progeny challenge by intramuscular injection (147 fish  3 aquaria  35 days) The catalogue of polymorphic loci  established with 511 individuals (507 unique F2’s  2 F1’s and 2 F0’s)  contained 17 460 bi-allelic loci of which 2867 were discarded from further analysis since they were putative duplicated loci (i.e. they were heterozygous in at least two DH controls  see list in Additional file : Table S1). After removing fish with a genotype call rate lower than 20% (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>444) and markers with more than 70% missing genotypes (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11 570)  24 additional individuals that exhibited a rate of heterozygous loci higher than 1% were removed before the last filtering step based on MAF (><U+2009>0.30) and marker call rate (><U+2009>90%). The final dataset was composed of 9715 polymorphic loci and 427 F2 progeny (including 310 QTL progeny that were challenged with  and 117 individuals with no phenotypic record). Of the 9715 markers  9654 were mapped to 30 linkage groups (see Additional file : Table S3). The total length of the linkage map was 2645.2 cM. Linkage groups were successfully assigned to chromosomes using the genome assembly Omyk_1.0 []. As previously described [  ]  chromosome 25 (Omy25) is separated into two chromosomes in the INRA SY population. In this paper  Omy25a corresponds to the short arm of Omy25 and Omy25b to its long arm. The 9654 markers accounted for 2130 distinct positions on the genetic map (see Additional file : Table S4). At each position  only the marker with the best call rate was kept for further QTL detection (see Additional file : Table S3). The final dataset for QTL detection included 310 F2 progeny  one F1 and the two F0 individuals  and 2130 markers. Using the  model  survival analysis with the Cox model revealed two genome-wide significant QTL associated with RESISTANCE after the injection challenge (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005 at the genome-wide level) on Omy3 and Omy29 (named Omy3-QTL and Omy29-QTL  respectively). Two other QTL were chromosome-wide significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) on Omy10 and Omy26. For all QTL  the risk ratio was less than 1 (0.22–0.38  Table )  which indicates that the allele for resistance originated from the AP2 (resistant) grandparent. The final survival rate ranged from 67 to 76% for individuals that were homozygous for the resistance (AP2) allele at all four QTL versus 34 to 50% for individuals that were homozygous for the susceptibility (B57) allele. Omy3-QTL and Omy29-QTL had the strongest effects (see Table ). For STATUS (analysed as a binary trait)  one chromosome-wide significant QTL was found on Omy25a and two genome-wide significant QTL on Omy3 and Omy29. These two QTL were the same as those detected for RESISTANCE (same location  same favourable (resistance) allele transmitted by AP2). They explained 14 and 12% of the phenotypic variation of the trait in the DH progeny  respectively  whereas Omy25a-QTL explained 7% of the phenotypic variation. Strikingly for this QTL  the susceptible grandparent (B57) transmitted the favourable allele. Likelihood ratio thresholds and flanking markers at each QTL are in Table S5 (see Additional file : Table S5). Figure S3 (see Additional file : Figure S3) presents the likelihood ratio profiles for each chromosome (1 cM interval) for the two resistance traits after the two types of infectious challenges. For ENDURANCE  which was measured as time to death (hence  using only fish that died)  two chromosome-wide significant QTL were detected on Omy15 and Omy29. Omy29-QTL explained 11% of the phenotypic variance of the trait in the DH progeny. Omy15-QTL is a new QTL  whereas Omy29-QTL is likely the same as that detected for RESISTANCE (close location  overlapping 95% confidence intervals  one flanking marker in common). For both QTL  the favourable allele originated from the resistant grandparent (AP2)  and fish that carried the favourable allele at both QTL died on average 5 days later than fish with the unfavourable allele. For the immersion challenge and with model   survival analysis with the Cox model revealed three QTL associated with RESISTANCE (Table ). Two new chromosome-wide significant QTL located on Omy2 and Omy21  respectively. One genome-wide significant QTL on Omy3 matched the QTL that was detected in the injection challenge analysis (similar position   88 and 89 cM for the immersion and injection challenge analyses  respectively  and resistance transmitted by AP2 in both cases). The risk ratios of the two newly detected QTL (3.73 for Omy2-QTL and 3.08 for Omy21-QTL  respectively) indicated that the favourable (resistance) allele originated from the susceptible grandparent (B57). Omy3-QTL had the largest effect  with 94 versus 53% survival for individuals that were homozygous for the AP2 and B57 allele  respectively. For Omy2-QTL and Omy21-QTL  the absolute difference in survival between alternative homozygotes was around 20% (Table ). The QTL detected for STATUS (binary trait) provided results that are fully consistent with the results obtained for RESISTANCE. Omy3-QTL had the largest effect (explaining 18% of phenotypic variance in DH progeny)  whereas Omy2-QTL and Omy21-QTL had the smallest effects (6 and 7% of phenotypic variance in DH progeny  respectively). For ENDURANCE after the immersion challenge  two new chromosome-wide significant QTL were detected on Omy20 and Omy27. Fish that carried the B57 allele at the two ENDURANCE QTL survived longer (about 10–11 days more) than those that carried the AP2 allele. The immersion or injection challenge had no common QTL associated with ENDURANCE. Since QTL may have been masked by the major QTL described above and/or by possible epistatic interactions between them  analyses were refined using STATUS as the resistance trait. Model  was used  in which QTL detection was computed with the effect of each chromosome-wide and genome-wide significant QTL detected for STATUS with model  being fixed as co-factors alternatively. As shown in Table   use of model  revealed five additional chromosome-wide or genome-wide significant QTL (absolute effects of QTL on survival rates are in Additional file : Figure S4). In the analysis of the injection challenge  including the effect of Omy3-QTL as co-factor in model  allowed identification of an additional QTL on Omy29 (named Omy29.2-QTL). This Omy29.2-QTL was located at 23 cM  just at the limit of the confidence interval of the first QTL on Omy29 detected for RESISTANCE and STATUS with model  (see Table ) for the injection challenge. The hypothesis that there were two QTL for STATUS was tested by fitting both Omy3-QTL and Omy29-QTL in the model; Omy29.2-QTL remained chromosome-wide significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  which supports the existence of two different QTL on Omy29. Including Omy29-QTL in the model allowed the role of Omy26-QTL to be extended to STATUS (previously chromosome-wide significant for RESISTANCE only). Finally  new QTL were detected on Omy17 by fitting Omy25a-QTL or Omy29-QTL  respectively. Because Omy17-QTL and Omy17-QTL were very close to each other  they were considered as a single QTL. For the immersion challenge  fitting the effect of the Omy2-QTL revealed two new QTL (Omy7.1-QTL and Omy24-QTL). Fitting the effect of Omy3-QTL revealed a new QTL on Omy17 (Omy17-QTL) and a QTL on Omy25a (Omy25a-QTL). Interestingly these two QTL were detected on the same two chromosomes in the injection challenge analysis. Although their positions in each challenge were distinct  confidence intervals overlapped largely. Hence  we favour the hypothesis of a single QTL on each of these chromosomes. Taken together  these results support the idea that the functions encoded by the genes represented by the QTL on Omy17 and Omy25a could play a role in resistance regardless of the route of infection. Finally  fitting Omy21-QTL revealed another QTL on Omy7 (Omy7.2-QTL). This QTL was considered as distinct from Omy7.1-QTL since it was located far away (7 vs. 61 cM) and outside its confidence interval. Most of the newly detected QTL defined above were detected only after the interactions between QTL were taken into account in the analysis with model . As shown in Table   interactions were suggestive (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) for two pairs of QTL and highly significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) for 11 other pairs of QTL. Since both grandparents (AP2 and B57) can transmit the allele for resistance depending on the QTL  the resistance/susceptibility alleles at QTL will be referred to as the R/S allele for the discussion of interactions between QTL  irrespective of their AP2 or B57 origin. The detected interactions could be classified into two main types and a third type that contained only one pair of epistatic QTL  as described in the following. The first type of interaction  which was recorded for six pairs of QTL  was associated with a larger effect of one QTL when the other QTL was fixed at the S allele (see Table  for details). For these six pairs of epistatic QTL  the survival rate was significantly lower when both QTL carried the S allele than when at least one QTL carried the R allele (see Additional file : Figure S4). Therefore  each QTL alternatively contributes to resistance  depending on the allelic status at the other QTL. A typical case for such interaction is the Omy21_Omy3 QTL pair in the immersion challenge. Indeed  when one QTL was fixed at the S allele and the other QTL changed from S to R  the survival rate increased by 39 and 55%  respectively for Omy21-QTL and Omy3-QTL. In contrast  when one QTL was fixed at R allele  changing the allele of the other QTL from S to R resulted in an increase in survival of only of 4 and 20%  respectively. An intriguing feature was that for three epistatic QTL  Omy29.2-QTL and Omy17-QTL in the injection challenge and Omy7.2-QTL in the immersion challenge  the origin of the favourable allele changed depending on the allele fixed for the QTL used as co-factor. For instance  origin of the favourable allele at Omy7.2-QTL was AP2 or B57  depending on the allele at the QTL on Omy21 (R or S). The second type of interaction  detected for four pairs of QTL  resulted in a larger increase in survival rate when one of the two QTL was fixed at the R allele (see Table  for details). This interaction can be illustrated by the significantly greater survival rate when both QTL of a pair carried the R allele compared to any other combination of alleles (see Additional file : Figure S4). The Omy3_Omy25a QTL pair in the injection challenge is an example of such an interaction  with an absolute increase in survival rate by 53 and 59%  respectively  when Omy25a-QTL and Omy3-QTL changed from S to R. For Omy17-QTL in the injection challenge and Omy24-QTL in the immersion challenge  the large increase in survival rate was combined with an inversion of the origin of the favourable allele at the QTL when the QTL fitted in the model  carried the R versus the S allele. In the immersion challenge  the absolute effect of Omy7.1-QTL on survival did not depend on the allele at Omy2-QTL (+<U+2009>19%) but the origin of the favourable allele changed from B57 to AP2 depending on the R/S allele at Omy2-QTL. In a previous study []  we analysed the transcriptome response to  in the pronephros of two trout isogenic lines (B57 and A3) with contrasting susceptibilities to   using micro-arrays. A list of 571 differentially-expressed genes after  injection in at least one of these lines was generated ([] and supplementary material in [  ]). All probes corresponding to these genes were mapped on the rainbow trout genome []  to test whether the differentially-expressed genes are located close to a QTL. Probe positions were compared to the rainbow trout annotation [] to name the corresponding proteins. Sixty-four probes (corresponding to 49 genes) were located within or close to the 95% confidence intervals of the QTL detected in the current study (see Additional file : Tables S5 and S6). Among these 49 genes  14 had functions that suggest that they may be involved in the resistance controlled by the respective QTL. These genes can be classified into four functional categories: (1) bacterial sensors and damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules ( and other --  ; and ); (2) inflammatory factors (; ; and ); (3) effectors killing bacteria (; ) or affecting the host (); and (4) interferon stimulated genes (ISG) (    and ). A detailed description of these genes and their function is in Additional file . In this study  we investigated the genetic architecture of resistance to  in rainbow trout using a cross between two isogenic grandparental lines with contrasting susceptibilities to the bacterium. Two different infection modes  immersion and injection were used to detect QTL that were in segregation in the two grandparent isogenic lines. Although injection is commonly used in protocols of experimental infection with   immersion is more relevant since it likely mimics the natural infection more closely. However  reliable and reproducible immersion challenges are more difficult to establish than injection challenges  especially if a large number of fish are to be infected. Using a DH QTL family produced from isogenic lines with well-established susceptibility was a unique way to facilitate the genetic analysis. Interestingly  QTL detected in both infection models overlapped partly  which supports the hypothesis that a core set of immune mechanisms is recruited  while others can be specific to the infection route. This study also provides the first evidence of epistasis among QTL associated with resistance to . Finally  we also investigated endurance of the fish ( time to death after infection) and detected four QTL associated with this trait. It should be noted that only one endurance QTL was also defined as a resistance QTL (Omy29-QTL)  which indicates that these two traits are partly driven by different mechanisms. Altogether  we detected 12 QTL associated with resistance to  (see Table  for a summary). Three QTL were common to both routes of infection (Omy3-QTL  Omy17-QTL and Omy25a-QTL)  four were detected after injection only (Omy10-QTL  Omy26-QTL  Omy29-QTL and Omy29.2-QTL) and five after immersion only (Omy2-QTL  Omy7.1-QTL  Omy7.2-QTL  Omy21-QTL and Omy24-QTL). Three of these QTL (Omy21-QTL  Omy29-QTL and Omy29.2-QTL) had not been detected in previously published studies [      ]. Some QTL could be detected only after taking the effect of—or the interaction with—another QTL with strong effect into account. Among the QTL that govern resistance for both types of challenge  Omy3-QTL was the most significant and explained 14 and 18% of the phenotypic variation in survival rate of the DH progeny following injection and immersion  respectively. We identified several QTL that seem specific to a given route of infection. One cannot exclude that these QTL contribute to resistance regardless of the mode of infection but that they were not detected in one challenge because of lack of power of the experiment. However  the observation of QTL specific to the route of infection is consistent with our unpublished results  that show a moderate genetic correlation between the survival of standard trout families after immersion or injection challenge. The five QTL that were detected only after immersion could drive protective mechanisms that are related to entry of the bacterium into the host at the skin or mucosa level  or mechanisms that would be triggered significantly only when the bacterium has entered the host after an immersion challenge. For example  resident phagocytes that are located close to the<U+2009>«<U+2009>natural<U+2009>»<U+2009>entry sites could mediate such mechanisms. These cells can sense the pathogens  become activated  mediate a local innate response and/or migrate to the spleen or to other sites where the immune responses take place. In contrast  QTL detected only after injection could correspond to resistance mechanisms that become more critical when the first line of natural defence has been by-passed. Age of the fish at the time of immersion and injection challenges may also have influenced the relative effect of the QTL. Because the  strain used is highly virulent  it can induce very high mortality rates when injected to small fish even at low doses  which may prevent detection of QTL. Hence  we chose to carry out the injection challenge on 8-month-old fish  while the immersion challenge was performed on younger fish (5-month-old  to better simulate the natural infection at early stages)  having a potentially more immature immune system. Importantly  5-month-old fish already have a rather mature immune system. For example  they already have B and T lymphocytes  and can mount adaptive immune responses []. The same study showed that a strong transcriptional response to bacterial infection can be detected since the eyed egg stage. While drastic changes of this response were observed before the first feeding stage  fewer changes occur from first feeding and 3 weeks later. Thus  age-dependent changes in immune response that take place in trout after several months of independent feeding life correspond to maturation of an established immune system  rather than to a dramatic change  and we do not expect drastic differences in immune responses for 5- versus 8-month-old fish. Moreover  our experience with isogenic lines indicates that lines that are highly susceptible to  infection remain susceptible during their first year of life and often throughout life (unpublished). Along the same line  the general conclusion of comparisons of susceptible versus resistant lines across a range of sizes is that lines rank consistently regarding susceptibility to  ([] and unpublished results)  supporting the hypothesis that maturation of the immune system does not lead to drastic changes in the susceptibility/resistance status of the fish in this study. However  some pathways that are critical at young stages may become less critical as adaptive defence mechanisms get more effective at later ages. To get further insight into the mechanisms involved in host response  we combined the positional information obtained from QTL mapping with results of our previous functional study. This pointed to several key genes involved in antibacterial immunity  which are induced in the pronephros of fish injected with   and are located in the vicinity of the resistance QTL. These genes are potentially interesting for the validation of a repertoire of candidate genes in more restricted QTL regions. Few studies have addressed interactions between QTL  although it has been shown that epistasis may play an important role in the genetic variation of complex traits [  ] and that taking epistasis into account allows more QTL to be detected [    ]. In the current study  five of 15 QTL were detected only after epistasis was taken into account  which provides further insights into the genetic architecture of resistance to  and the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. Two major types of interactions were identified. In the first type  the effect of each QTL was present or enhanced only when the other QTL was fixed at the susceptibility allele. Consequently  each QTL alternatively contributes to the resistance (“compensation-like” effect). This phenomenon occurred between the three most significant immersion QTL and between two of the most significant QTL that were identified following injection. In particular  “compensation-like” interaction was detected between Omy2-QTL and Omy3-QTL that carry candidate genes coding for anti () and pro () inflammatory factors. The second type of interaction results in an “enhancing-like” effect of the resistance allele of one QTL on the effect of other QTL  resulting in a gain in resistance only when both QTL carry their resistance allele. Therefore  mechanisms associated with the R alleles at the two QTL may be synergetic or  alternatively  the presence of the S allele at one QTL may hinder the efficiency of the resistance mechanisms encoded at the other. This interaction was detected between Omy29-QTL and two other QTL (Omy26-QTL and Omy17-QTL). In other cases  as for the Omy2_Omy7.1 pair of QTL or in some cases among type 1 and 2 interactions  there was what may be called a “counter-acting interaction” with an inversion of the favourable allele at one QTL when switching the allele at the alternative QTL. Such a type of interaction was described in studies on lung [] or colon [] cancer in recombinant congenic strains of mouse for which QTL were expected to be important components of tumour susceptibility. Further investigations are needed in order to better understand the underlying immune pathways  which might correspond to negative feedback loops. Several QTL associated with resistance to  had a strong effect on resistance in the QTL family used in this study. Among those  the QTL on Omy3 is of particular interest because it controls resistance following both routes of infection. This QTL has also been detected in two American trout populations [] and might be relevant in other populations. Our study also confirms the role of several other QTL that were previously detected in American trout populations in response to infection with a different strain of  (CSF-259-93) [    ]. Hence  these QTL are not specific to a particular strain of  nor to a particular host population  which strengthens their potential interest for breeding purposes. It is noteworthy that the FRGDSA 1882/11 and CSF-259-93 strains both belong to the same mPCR type 2  which is one of the major types identified in  isolates from worldwide origins [  ]. Our results also suggested that a given type of infection challenge (route of infection and/or age of fish) may select for specific resistance mechanisms that may not be as relevant in other contexts. The challenge model used to select candidates may result in gene-environment interactions with less genetic progress than expected in the context of natural infection in farms. However  choosing the ‘best’ infection challenge for a selection programme should take into account not only genetic  but also practical and economic issues. From a practical point of view  an encouraging result of this study is that  within the range of fish size we investigated  individual body weight at the time of challenge had no or little effect on resistance  meaning that individual tagging to record fish weight may not be necessary when implementing an infection challenge. In this paper  we confirmed the complex genetic determinism of resistance to  in rainbow trout. Some QTL that drive a significant part of the phenotypic variance in different infectious contexts were detected and deserve further confirmation in standard trout families. Several genes involved in response to  infection were associated with the detected QTL  providing a preliminary list of relevant candidate genes. Finally  this study highlighted the role of epistatic interactions between resistance QTL (and thus between the underlying mechanisms) and for the first time  evidenced the effect of the type of infection protocol with  on the balance between different resistance mechanisms.

In this study  we performed CNV detection and functional analysis for 18 719 individuals from four pure lines and one commercial cross of layer chickens. Samples were genotyped on four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platforms  i.e. the Illumina 42K  Affymetrix 600K  and two different customized Affymetrix 50K chips. CNV recovered from the Affymetrix chips were identified by using the Axiom CNV Summary Tools and PennCNV software and those from the Illumina chip were identified by using the cnvPartition in the Genome Studio software.ResultsThe mean number of CNV per individual varied from 0.50 to 4.87 according to line or cross and size of the SNP genotyping set. The length of the detected CNV across all datasets ranged from 1.2 kb to 3.2 Mb. The number of duplications exceeded the number of deletions for most lines. Between the lines  there were considerable differences in the number of detected CNV and their distribution. Most of the detected CNV had a low frequency  but 19 CNV were identified with a frequency higher than 5% in birds that were genotyped on the 600K panel  with the most common CNV being detected in 734 birds from three lines.ConclusionsCommonly used SNP genotyping platforms can be used to detect segregating CNV in chicken layer lines. The sample sizes for this study enabled a detailed characterization of the CNV landscape within commercially relevant lines. The size of the SNP panel used affected detection efficiency  with more CNV detected per individual on the higher density 600K panel. In spite of the high level of inter-individual diversity and a large number of CNV observed within individuals  we were able to detect 19 frequent CNV  of which  57.9% overlapped with annotated genes and 89% overlapped with known quantitative trait loci."

Samples were genotyped on four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platforms  i.e. the Illumina 42K  Affymetrix 600K  and two different customized Affymetrix 50K chips. CNV recovered from the Affymetrix chips were identified by using the Axiom CNV Summary Tools and PennCNV software and those from the Illumina chip were identified by using the cnvPartition in the Genome Studio software. The mean number of CNV per individual varied from 0.50 to 4.87 according to line or cross and size of the SNP genotyping set. The length of the detected CNV across all datasets ranged from 1.2 kb to 3.2 Mb. The number of duplications exceeded the number of deletions for most lines. Between the lines  there were considerable differences in the number of detected CNV and their distribution. Most of the detected CNV had a low frequency  but 19 CNV were identified with a frequency higher than 5% in birds that were genotyped on the 600K panel  with the most common CNV being detected in 734 birds from three lines. Commonly used SNP genotyping platforms can be used to detect segregating CNV in chicken layer lines. The sample sizes for this study enabled a detailed characterization of the CNV landscape within commercially relevant lines. The size of the SNP panel used affected detection efficiency  with more CNV detected per individual on the higher density 600K panel. In spite of the high level of inter-individual diversity and a large number of CNV observed within individuals  we were able to detect 19 frequent CNV  of which  57.9% overlapped with annotated genes and 89% overlapped with known quantitative trait loci. Copy number variations (CNV) refer to large-scale insertions  duplications  or deletions of DNA sequence segments compared to a reference assembly. CNV can range in size from 50 to millions of base pairs  but 1 kb is generally assumed to be the lower limit [  ]. Most genome-wide mapping studies of CNV have been conducted in humans  where CNV account for a significant proportion of genome variation and are associated with susceptibility to disease [   ]. According to Zarrei et al. []  4.8 to 9.5% of the human genome consists of CNV  while other studies in human and mouse found that CNV explained 18 to 30% of the genetic variation in gene expression [  ]. A better understanding of CNV in domesticated animal genomes will contribute to greater genetic improvement of production traits and animal health []. Several species of farm animals have been scanned for CNV  including cattle [  ]  sheep [  ]  goats []  and pigs [  ] and numerous studies have examined CNV in the chicken genome [             ]. Currently  the known CNV in chicken encompass approximately 8.3% of its genome  or 9.6% of the ordered genome assembly []. A number of other avian species have also been scanned for CNV  including duck [] and turkey []. Skinner et al. [] have analyzed CNV in 16 species of birds and found that the number of CNV per Mb was similar in birds and mammals but that their size was smaller in birds than in mammals. In addition  overlapping between CNV and genes in chicken seems to be at the higher end of the range observed in mammals []  which suggests that CNV may have functional effects in chickens. According to studies on the human genome  formation of CNV can be connected to differences in recombination rate across the genome [  ]. Based on this hypothesis  recombination hot spots should have a higher prevalence of CNV than other parts of the genome. Indeed  based on an analysis of the genomes of chicken and zebra finch  Völker et al. [] found a significant association between presence of structural variations such as chromosomal rearrangements and recombination rate. These data suggest a major role of recombination-based processes in the evolution of avian genomes. Copy number variations can be detected by a number of methods  including array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH)  sequencing  and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays []. Although SNP arrays are designed primarily for SNP genotyping  detection of CNV is possible because of the abnormal hybridization that occurs when a SNP is located within a CNV region. In general  the use of a 60K SNP [] chip for this purpose has resulted in low frequencies of detected CNV [  ]. The use of sequence data is much more efficient and yields the largest number of CNV detected [    ]  but using a 600K SNP array can increase the sensitivity of CNV detection significantly []. Four CNV detection studies based on the high-density Affymetrix 600K SNP array have been reported in chicken [    ] and have shown that  in general  CNV detection with this panel is more efficient than with lower density SNP chips. Our study aimed at (1) detecting CNV and refining the genome-wide copy number profiles for layer chickens; (2) comparing CNV detection across different SNP genotyping panels  in order to evaluate the utility of these panels for CNV detection; (3) characterizing in detail the differences in CNV detection rates between individuals and lines; and (4) assessing the frequency of detected CNV and their possible functional impact. To achieve this  genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) that overlap with the detected CNV were identified. Gene enrichment analysis was performed to identify overrepresented biological processes and pathways. The total number of individuals used in this study was 18 719  which included birds from four pure lines  two white shell (W) and two brown shell (B) lines  and from one commercial hybrid of white shell layer chickens  all provided by Hy-Line International (Table ). DNA was isolated from blood collected from the wing vein of each bird. For the pure lines  blood was collected in EDTA-coated anticoagulant tubes and genomic DNA was extracted following lysis of cells and subsequent digestion with proteinase K. For the commercial hybrids  blood was collected on FTA Elute cards (GE Healthcare) and DNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s recommendations. SNP genotypes were obtained from several platforms over multiple years and for multiple purposes (Table ). The SNP panels used included the publicly available 600K Affymetrix chip []  a 42K proprietary Illumina iSelecta BeadChip []  and two custom 50K Affymetrix chips  which were designed separately for white and brown lines by HyLine International. The choice of SNPs for inclusion in each panel was based on their uniform distribution across the genome. The 42K Illumina panel was optimized to capture the genetic variance that is associated with economically important traits  and thus contained more SNPs in close proximity of genes than the other panels. For both 50K panels  only SNPs with high-quality clusters according to the Axiom™ Analysis Suite were included. This could have led to the elimination of SNPs that overlapped CNV in the birds used for panel design since those SNPs may not form three discrete clusters when plotting allele-A intensity versus allele-B intensity in Axiom™ Analysis Suite. The Axiom™ Analysis Suite [] was used to call genotypes for the 50K and 600K Affymetrix panels. A minimum default quality control of 0.82 and a minimum call rate of 97% were used. The Axiom CNV Summary Tools software [] was used to extract log R Ratio (LRR) and B allele frequency (BAF) values for PennCNV 1.0.3 []. Genotype and CNV calling were performed separately for each 96-well genotyping plate because of the large differences in signal intensities between plates. Data from the 42K Illumina panel were processed in Genome Studio 2011.1 using the Genotyping module v 1.9 and the cnvPartition CNV Analysis Plugin v3.2.0 []. PennCNV  an integrated hidden Markov model (HMM)  was used for all Affymetrix panels. This algorithm incorporates multiple sources of information  including the signal intensity data of LRR and BAF values at each SNP  the distance between neighboring SNPs  and the population frequency of the B allele (PFB). Individual-based CNV calling was performed using the—test option with default parameters for the HMM model. The hhall.hmm file was used with the—test option for all panels. To adjust for genomic waves  the—gcmodel option with the chicken GC content file (GC content of 1-Mb genomic regions surrounding each SNP) was used. The PFB files were compiled separately for each panel from a large set of individuals  using the compile pfb script included in the PennCNV software. For filtering  standard deviations (SD) for LRR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35  BAF drift<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01  and waviness factor<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04 were used. The waviness factor accounts for the dispersion in signal intensity across the genome. Only CNV that consisted of at least three (for the 50K and 42K panels) or at least five (for the 600K panel) consecutive SNPs were included in the analysis. Individuals with more than 30 called CNV were excluded as unreliable (58 on the 600K  47 on the 50K brown  7 on the 50K white and 33 on the 42K panels). This number (30) was chosen as approximation of the mean number of CNV per individual plus 3 standard deviations across all panels. CNV were identified on autosomes (1 to 28) only because PennCNV calls for the sex chromosomes were unreliable and difficult to interpret. The identified CNV were merged and/or intersected with the BedTools software []  which combines CNV that overlap in one or multiple interval files into a single CNV region. The BedTools intersect tool was used to select only the region of a CNV that is common between individuals  i.e.  if a CNV was identified between 1 and 3 kb in individual 1 and between 2 and 4 kb in individual 2  only the region between 2 and 3 kb was retained in the sets and was referred to as a common CNV region (CNVR). The subsequent sets of CNVR used in this study were obtained as follows: For the list of all detected CNVR  a Bedtools merge was performed across all individuals and lines for all CNV that overlapped by at least 1 bp. This set is referred to as the merged CNVR. Bedtools merge was performed for variants that were present in at least two individuals within a line. This set is referred to as the common CNVR. Bedtools intersect was used for all CNV for a given panel and line combination  which were then merged across panels and lines. CNVR that were identified in at least two individuals within a line  were selected for further analysis. This set is referred to as common intersected CNVR. CNVR that were detected in only one individual are referred to as singletons. CNVR for which both deletions and duplications were observed are referred to as complex CNVR. Genes that overlapped with common intersected CNVR were identified with the Ensembl BioMart webtool based on the Galgal4 assembly and the Ensembl Genes 85 database []. Analysis of overrepresented GO terms and pathways was performed using PANTHER Classification System version 11 []. Known quantitative trait loci (QTL) that overlapped with the detected CNVR were identified based on the Animal QTL database [] release 33. In order to perform a comparison with previous studies  autosomal coordinates of the CNVR were migrated from galGal3 to galGal4 using the UCSC liftOver tool []. Common CNV were checked visually using available sequence data  which consisted of representative pools of 10 individuals per line. Details on the sequencing of these pools are in Kranis et al. []. The proportion of samples that passed quality control ranged from 89.4% in line B1 genotyped on the 50K panel up to 99.6% in line W1 genotyped on the 600K panel. For the latter  only one individual was excluded because of poor quality. The mean number of CNV per individual ranged from 0.50 on the 50K panel for line W2 to 4.87 on the 600K panel for line B1 (Table ). The commercial hybrid cross and line B1 had the largest average number of identified CNV per individual  whereas line W2 had the smallest average number of CNV per individual. The length of the CNV ranged from 1.2 kb to 3.2 Mb (Table ). CNV shorter than 1 kb and that included less than 3  3 or 5 SNPs for the 42K  50K and 600K panels  respectively  were excluded from analysis. The mean length of detected CNV was greater for the 50K panels  which most likely resulted from the low detectability of shorter variants due to the greater distance between SNPs compared to the 600K panel. The length of each CNV was calculated as the distance from the first to the last SNP included in the CNV region  which may  therefore  slightly underestimate the true length. Compared to the high-density 600K panel  the 50K SNP panels resulted in a smaller average number of detected CNV per individual (Table ) and a smaller number of CNVR with a frequency higher than 1% within a line (Table ). The highest average frequency of CNV detected from the lower density panels was observed for line B2 and the 42K SNP Illumina panel  for which few CNVR had a frequency higher than 1% and one CNV had a frequency higher than 10% (13.9%). The largest number of CNVR with a frequency higher than 1% was observed for the 600K panel (Table ). A list of the 19 CNVR with a frequency higher than 5% for the 600K panel is in Additional file : Table S1. The most common CNVR was detected in 734 individuals across three lines  on chromosome 5 between 19.60 and 19.72 Mb. The number of deletions and duplications detected differed between lines (Table ). The number of duplications exceeded the number of deletions for line W2 and the commercial hybrid  while for line B2 more deletions were detected. For lines W1 and B1  the ratio of duplications to deletions differed between panels. In some regions  complex CNVR were observed  but the number of complex CNVR identified was significantly larger for the lower density panels than for the 600K panel (Table )  which probably resulted from the poorer variant separation with the lower density panels. The proportion of each chromosome that was covered with deletions  duplications  or complex variants for common CNVR is shown in Fig. . The fraction covered with complex CNVR was greater for the microchromosomes (6% on average) than for the macrochromosomes (on average 3% of the total sequence). Although the number of duplications exceeded the number of deletions for most lines  both types of variants covered a similar fraction of the chromosomes. Fraction of each chromosome covered with deletions  duplications and complex CNVR for 2139 common variants The distribution of CNVR differed between chromosomes  with microchromosomes having a higher density of CNVR than macrochromosomes (Table ). The log10 of chromosome size was inversely correlated with the fraction of chromosome covered by CNVR  with a Pearson correlation of -<U+2009>0.80. Chromosome 16 is the shortest chromosome in the chicken genome with a large fraction covered with CNV. However  results for chromosome 16 should be treated with caution  since the reference sequence for this chromosome is of poor quality  probably because it carries the major histocompatibility complex  which has a high level of variability  multiple gene families  and a high GC content. In total  2687 CNVR were identified after merging CNV across all samples and lines (Additional file : Table S2). The total length of these CNV was equal to 493.3 Mb  which corresponds to 53.7% of the analyzed genome sequence. Of the merged CNVR  73.4% overlapped with genes  which accounted for 45.9% of the total CNVR sequence. The number of common CNVR  which resulted from merging CNV that were found to be shared by at least two individuals within a line  was equal to 1264  with a total length of 375.8 Mb. Of these CNVR  82.0% overlapped with genes  which encompassed 46.2% of the total CNVR sequence. More than 97.2% of the merged CNVR and 96.8% of the common CNVR overlapped with known QTL. Of the 1264 CNVR  447 CNVR that cover 252.8 Mb  were detected by more than one SNP panel. Intersecting CNVR across all lines and panels resulted in 4131 CNVR. Since the CNV that were observed once require further confirmation  CNVR  which were identified in at least two individuals within a line after intersecting within panels  were selected for further analysis (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2139). The total length of these common intersected CNVR was equal to 117.3 Mb  which corresponds to 12.7% of the genome. In total  29.8% of these CNVR overlapped with 3510 Ensembl gene ID  for which 2322 gene names were available  including 94 miRNAs and 29 LOC genes (Additional file : Table S3). Of the 3510 Ensembl gene ID  2994 genes mapped to Panther biological categories. GO enrichment analysis of these genes revealed significant terms involved in antigen processing and presentation  and cellular defense response  which may represent biological processes that are influenced by CNV (Table ). Each line was characterized by its own CNV profile. Since only the high-density 600K panel was used for more than two lines  the comparison of CNV profiles between lines was based on this panel only. The number of CNVR that were common between lines is in Table . The largest overlap was observed between line W2 and the commercial hybrid line  which may be related to the fact that these lines had the largest number of individuals and CNV detected. As expected  line B1 had a relatively small number of common CNV with the white lines and the hybrid cross  which can be explained by the relatively large genetic distance between white and brown egg shell lines. This difference was most pronounced with line W1  for which the number of genotyped individuals was smallest. To determine whether CNV are associated with specific biological processes  we identified the genes within CNVR that were detected in at least two individuals within a line. In total  682 genes overlapped with 465 merged CNVR for the 600K panel and 602 of these were mapped by Panther with 257 CNVR not classified in any GO term. Two terms were significant after Bonferroni correction  phagocytosis (p-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0250) and cellular defense response (p-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0127)  with enrichments of 5.71 and 3.25  respectively. Then  we performed the Panther GO overrepresentation test for genes that were identified within each line separately. No significant GO terms were identified for line W1  probably because of the small number of genotyped individuals and the small number of detected CNVR. For all the other lines  we detected several significant GO terms  but these were mostly connected to genes that overlapped with a single CNVR. For the hybrid cross  the most significant GO terms were: antigen processing and presentation  phagocytosis  B cell immunity  and cellular defense response. The antigen processing and presentation term was connected to CNVR that were identified on chromosome 16  which consisted of 13 CNV that covered almost the entire chromosome. The B cell immunity and cellular defense response terms  which were significant for lines B1  W2  and the hybrid cross  were connected to a region on chromosome 27  where a single copy deletion was observed between 0.19 and 0.33 Mb (Table ). Information about the confirmation of CNVR based on sequence data of pooled DNA is provided in Additional file : Table S1. Due to lack of individual sequence data  only CNV with a relatively high frequency could be detected based on sequence information. In addition  because of the small number of individuals in each pool of sequenced data  even relatively frequent CNV may be indistinguishable from noise. Examples of CNV that were confirmed by sequence data are in Fig.  and in Additional file : Figures S1 to S8. The sequence data enabled confirmation of selected variants but did not provide a means for identifying false positives because sequenced individuals represented only a limited number of individuals of the genotyped lines and no individual had both sequence and SNP genotype data. CNV on chromosome 9 (between 1.968 and 1.978 Mb) within line B1 In this study  we used 17 706 individuals from four pure lines and one commercial multi-line cross to detect CNV using genotypes provided by four SNP panels with different densities. In total  19 525 CNV were detected  which resulted in 2687 CNVR after merging across individuals  lines  and panels. This result shows that CNV detection is possible by using commercially available SNP genotyping platforms. In addition  19 high frequency CNVR were detected using the 600K panel  of which 57.9% overlapped with annotated genes (Additional file ). We hypothesize that the CNV  which segregate within the lines at relatively high frequencies  may have an impact on the traits that are under selection in these lines. Similar to other studies on the detection of CNV  duplications were more abundant than deletions [  ]  although there were some differences between lines. For line B2  the number of losses was almost equal to the number of gains  which may be specific of this line or of the 42K panel  which was initially developed to exclude SNPs that did not perform well (thus some SNPs within CNV may have been eliminated). For line B1  the 600K panel  the number of losses was almost six times larger than the number of gains when the 600K panel was used  whereas interestingly  when the 50K panel was used  we obtained the opposite result  although most of the gains were due to singletons. These results may be due to the large difference in the number of line B1 individuals genotyped for these two panels  the low detectability with the 50K panel  and the large number of singletons. Based on the literature  generally most of the detected CNV have low population frequencies  although the use of relatively small numbers of individuals can result in sampling bias. According to Jia et al. []  among the 315 CNV that they detected in an analysis of 746 chickens with the 60K SNP array  only four had a frequency higher than 5% and none had a frequency higher than 10%. In addition  more recent studies have reported that most of the detected CNVR are singletons (occurring only in one individual)  i.e. 76% in Han et al. []  69% in Yi et al. []  and 75% in Strillacci et al. []. In our study  we detected several common CNVR with a frequency higher than 5%  although most of these were detected only with the 600K panel (Table ). The lower frequency of the CNVR detected when using the 50K and 42K panels confirm the advantage of higher SNP densities for CNV detection as previously reported [    ]. Among all the detected CNVR  46% were observed in a single individual across all lines. This observation  combined with the large number of individuals used in this study  confirms previous observations that a large fraction of CNV are singletons. However  such a large number of singletons could also result from the stringent quality control criteria that were applied in this study  including plate-by-plate detection  which could result in some CNV being overlooked. The number of common CNV (present in at least two individuals within a line) that were detected within and across lines is shown in Fig. . The number of CNVR that were shared between the four pure lines and between SNP panels was rather small  which could be due to the relatively small number of CNV per individual that was obtained with the 50K panels and to the large number of singletons. Among the lower density panels  the largest number of CNV per individual was found with the 42K Illumina panel  which may be related to differences in genotyping technology or line specificities. – Comparison of the number of CNVR detected with different SNP panels within pure lines The stringent quality control criteria that were applied when selecting SNPs for the 50K panel may have excluded SNPs in CNV regions. This hypothesis is supported by the larger number of CNV per individual  which were detected for the white layer line W1 when using the 50K panel that was developed specifically for brown layers compared to the 50K panel that was developed specifically for white layers (Table ). To summarize  although all panels enable the detection of CNV  it is possible that a proportion of the CNV that could be detected by more accurate data such as sequence data are missed when using SNP panels  especially lower density panels. In addition  a number of characteristics should be taken into account when calling CNV with SNP panels. First  distance between SNPs on the panel and their coverage have a clear effect on the length of the detected CNV. Second  it is necessary to have genotypes for a relatively large number of individuals to detect CNVR that are segregating within populations and to estimate their frequency. The pre-selection strategy for the SNPs placed on the panel also needs to be taken into account  since the SNPs that are located within CNV are more likely to be excluded as non-performing. Finally  the panel used can influence the ratio of detected deletions to duplications. In light of these results  our recommendation is that CNV detection using SNP genotypes can be used on a larger scale for commercial populations with large sample sizes  but keeping in mind the limitations. The number of CNV detected varied between chromosomes  with the microchromosomes being characterized by a higher density of CNV. In general  microchromosomes are known to have a higher gene content  which directly contradicts the observation that the majority of CNV are in gene-poor regions and gene deserts []. Our results suggest the opposite  i.e. that microchromosomes are more CNV-rich than macrochromosomes and thus more frequently associated with genes  which is consistent with the findings of Skinner et al. []. One of the most interesting cases is chromosome 16  which was covered at 98% by CNV  these being present in 53 individuals across all lines. This confirms a number of previous studies [  ]. The reason for this high density of CNV on chromosome 16 could be that it carries the major histocompatibility complex and has a high recombination rate  but the poor reference genome sequence for this chromosome could also be a cause. Details on the recombination rate and CNV located on chromosome 16 are in Fulton et al. []. Rao et al. [] reported that only 38% of the 383 CNVR that they identified in chickens overlapped with genes. We observed a similarly small percentage (30%) for the 2139 intersected CNVR  which is probably related to the relatively short length of the intersected variants that fall within intergenic regions. These results support the hypothesis that a majority of CNVR is associated with genes and may have functional effects. In contrast  in a study on 16 bird species  Skinner et al. [] determined that 70% of the detected CNVR overlapped with genes. We obtained a similar result for merged CNV  of which 73.4% overlapped with genes  and this percentage was even higher for the 1264 common CNVR (82.0%). These results support the hypothesis that the majority of CNVR is associated with genes and may have functional effects. In addition  GO analysis showed that genes that overlapped with CNV were enriched with a number of biological functions  in particular related to immune response. This is consistent with the results of Jia et al. [] who suggested that this type of polymorphism might be prevalent in immune-related genes. Additional file : Table S4 includes the list of the CNVR that were detected in this study and that overlap with previously detected CNVR. Of the 2687 CNVR that we detected  70% overlapped with previously detected CNV  but these only comprise 28% of the total sequence length for all CNVR detected in this study. Of the 1264 common CNVR  169 were novel and covered 2.4% of their total sequence (375.8 Mb). The total sequence overlap of common CNVR with previously known CNVR was equal to 32.6%  which can be related to the large length of merged CNVR. For both all and common CNVR  the sequence coverage with previously detected CNVR was around 30%. This observation  combined with the large number of singletons  leads to the conclusion that the occurrence of CNV is specific for each individual and inter-individual differences are more pronounced than between-line differences. Our results show that the use of the high-density 600K panel greatly improves the detection of CNV compared to that of low-density panels. Four studies have already used this 600K panel to detect CNV in various breeds or lines of chickens  and these are summarized in Table  [    ]. On average  the number of CNV per individual was larger in those studies than in ours  probably because of the higher level of genetic variability in indigenous breeds than in highly selected commercial lines  such as those that we investigated. This was confirmed by Yi et al. []  who found that the average number of CNV detected in commercial breeds was equal to 3.3 versus 5.1 for Chinese indigenous breeds. The populations used for CNV detection by Gorla et al. [] and Strillaci et al. [] were also characterized by higher genetic variability. We detected a larger number of CNV per individual in the brown line B1 (4.87)  which is close to what was reported for some non-commercial breeds [    ]. In contrast  the smallest number of CNV per individual was detected in line W2 for the 600K panel  which has a relatively high level of inbreeding (results not shown). Overall  we found a larger total number of CNV and a higher proportion of the genome covered by these CNV than previous studies in chickens [    ]. These differences are likely due to the much larger number of individuals analyzed in this study (Table )  which allowed a better characterization of within-line CNV variability. Of the 19 CNVR that were identified (based on the 600K panel) with a frequency of at least 5% within one line  11 overlapped with at least one gene and 17 overlapped with a previously detected QTL (Additional file : Table S5). Among the QTL that overlapped with these common CNVR  26 were involved in body weight and 13 in growth. The largest numbers of overlapping QTL were found for CNVR on chromosomes 2  3  4 and 5. The deletion on chromosome 8 overlapped with the largest number of genes (14) and with one QTL  for body weight. The GO terms that were enriched for the 600K CNV were mostly related to immune-response genes. This observation  along with the large number of singleton CNV identified  suggests a large inter-individual variability among the genes involved in immune response. The high-frequency CNVR located at 179 Mb on chromosome 1 overlapped with a number of QTL for body weight and Marek’s disease related traits  and with the  gene. Wang et al. [] had already reported this CNVR on chromosome 1 between 184 874 498 and 184 879 098 bp in build 3 of the chicken genome and predicted 45 candidate transcription factor binding sites for this region by WWW PROMOTER SCAN. This suggests that amplification of this upstream locus might affect expression of the  gene  which codes for tRNA methyltransferase and is involved in tRNA modifications and regulation of gene expression. The second interesting high-frequency CNVR is a single copy deletion on chromosome 6 (12.47–12.54 Mb). This deletion does not overlap with a gene but it is located in close proximity to a number of genes  downstream to  and upstream to  and   which are all involved in immune response. This region also overlaps with 10 QTL  including one for antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The high-frequency CNVR deletion on chromosome 23 (between 2.34 and 2.35 Mb) overlaps with the gene  (Rh blood group CcEe antigens). Previously detected QTL located within this region are involved in body weight and shank length. A duplication on chromosome 2 between 129.10 and 129.17 Mb overlaps with two genes   and   which are both connected to immune response. A CNV that overlaps with the  gene was previously reported by Yan et al. [] and was associated with Marek’s disease resistance. This CNV also overlaps with two QTL in the Animal QTL database that are related to Marek’s disease and with cloacal bacterial burden following challenge with Salmonella. Our results support previous findings that a large proportion of all detected CNVR are singletons  but we were able to detect several common CNVR  which may have important functional impacts. In addition  the large number of CNV that overlap with genes suggests that chicken CNV can impact agricultural or disease-related traits. In this context  the detection of structural variants such as CNV in chicken should be performed on a wider scale. The use of SNP genotypes on a large number of individuals enabled a better characterization of the CNV  both within and between lines. The list of CNVR presented here provides an additional resource for further studies in chicken. We observed pronounced differences between SNP panels and a clear advantage for the dense 600K SNP panel  both regarding the total number of CNV detected and their population frequencies. Although the use of SNP panels does not allow all the CNV that are present in an individual to be detected  these results show that they are a valuable source of CNV information by allowing the screening of large numbers of individuals at relatively low cost.

Analytical properties of cross-validation measures are presented. We present a new method named LR for cross-validation that is automatic  easy to use  and which yields the quantities of interest. The method compares predictions based on partial and whole data  which results in estimates of accuracy and biases. Prediction of observed records may yield biased results due to precorrection or use of incorrect heritabilities. Models for genetic evaluation are an oversimplification of reality that usually holds only in the short run and in closely-related populations. Their properties are rarely well known  which can lead to unexpected results. For instance  initial applications of genomic predictions of breeding values (GEBV) in dairy cattle led to biases  with young “genomic” selected bulls with high GEBV being overpredicted  as verified by posterior progeny testing [  ]. As a result  further use of GEBV in the dairy industry required extensive cross-validation and a more formal analytical framework [  ]. The introduction of new methods for genetic or genomic evaluation raises the question of model choice (comparing across models) and model quality (features of a particular model). Thus  we need tools to rank  understand and quantify the behavior of prediction models in an “animal breeding” context. The need for these tools has dramatically increased with the implementation of genomic selection  given its built-in encouragement to take riskier decisions such as selection of unproven young candidates  in particular in dairy cattle. The method that is most commonly used to check genomic predictions is some form of cross-validation  a test that was rarely used in pedigree-based genetic evaluation studies  which relied primarily on progeny testing (but see [  ]). In genomic prediction  cross-validation studies are indeed the norm [    ]. Cross-validation tests rely on either one of two approaches: (1) comparing (G)EBV or predicted phenotypes to (pre-corrected) observed phenotypes  deregressed proofs  or yield deviations []; or (2) comparing (G)EBV to highly accurate EBV from progeny testing. Another approach  which is in between the two above approaches  is based on daughter yield deviations (DYD; [])  which are close to highly accurate EBV if heritability is high and the number of daughters is large. Cross-validation is very useful but there are some concerns about the quality or adequacy of these approaches for several reasons  including: (a) the need to pre-correct phenotypes; (b) the growing difficulty to obtain unbiased estimates of DYD with the increasing use of non-progeny tested bulls selected based on GEBV; and (c) their inadequacy for indirect predictions such as those of maternal effects  for which there is no direct observation related to the animal. Apparent contradictions exist  such as lower accuracy of GEBV than that of pedigree EBV [  ]  or accuracies higher than 1 for lowly heritable traits. For a detailed review of cross-validation in animal breeding and its metrics  we refer the reader to our review []. Cross-validation is a good tool but has some limitations as discussed above. Thus  there is an increasing need for a simple general tool that can be used in several complex scenarios  including for traits with a low heritability (e.g. reproductive and fitness traits)  for indirectly observed traits (random regression coefficients  maternal effects  GxE interactions)  and with limited size of progeny test groups (e.g.  pigs). Here  we propose to complement cross-validation approaches with semiparametric procedures based on the classical theory of genetic evaluation. Semiparametric procedures based on the mixed model equations are appealing because they combine theory  which we know is approximately and/or asymptotically correct  with model-free evidence from data. In the 1990’s  there was some effort to develop such procedures []. Reverter et al. [] showed that the amount of change in EBV from one genetic evaluation to the next (i.e.  with the arrival of “new” data) was predictable. In parallel  bias in across-country predictions [  ] led to the introduction of the Interbull tests []  which draw on a similar idea. This family of methods has been used to check unbiasedness of predictions and  in the case of the Interbull tests  relies heavily on the availability of progeny tests based on large numbers of daughters. In this work  we draw on analytical results from [] and present theoretical features of semi-parametric procedures  namely method LR (from “linear regression”). These procedures are a series of statistics  which describe the change of predictions from “old” to “recent” evaluations that can be used to compute and compare population accuracies and biases of (genomic) predictions. We also explore analytical properties of the ability to predict future phenotypes  sometimes called “predictivity”. Then  we illustrate the method with deterministic results for simple designs and for experimental beef cattle data. This work proposes estimates of the “population” accuracy  which is the correlation between true (TBV) and estimated breeding values (EBV) across individuals in a population. Population accuracy is relevant to compare the predictive ability of models and to maximize genetic progress. This work does  propose methods to estimate individual accuracies  which are a measure of the risk when choosing a particular animal for breeding []. We propose to test the quality of evaluation methods using cross-validation tests based on successive EBV of a set of “focal” individuals (a validation cohort). These “focal” individuals can be the whole population [  ] or a set of “focal” individuals of interest  such as “genomic” candidates for selection []. We will use the convention that  refers to a scalar  the variance of a random element from a single realization of random vector  (in other words   where  is the size of )  whereas  refers to the variance–covariance matrix of elements in  during conceptual repetitions. We use a similar convention for  and   which are scalars that represent the covariance and correlation across elements in  and   whereas  is a matrix. Let  be the true breeding value (TBV) and  an estimated breeding value (EBV) of a single individual. The classical definition of accuracy is the correlation  for one individual across conceptual repeated sampling []  which is a measure of the expected magnitude of the change in EBV with increasing information. Accuracies are also used to forecast genetic progress in a selection scheme [    ]. This use applies to large unrelated populations  and made sense at the time of selection-index based selection (e.g. selecting boars based on family information). However  for the joint evaluation of all animals  the relevant measure according to Bijma [] is “the correlation between true i.e. TBV and EBV in the candidates for selection  which is a property of a population  not of an individual”. This “population accuracy” (we will use this term hereafter) is the correlation  across a series of individuals. Accordingly  bias is defined as the difference of means  and dispersion as the slope of the regression of  on : . Indeed  in practice  proxies to these empirical measures are used in cross-validation studies. In other words  accuracy measures the ability to rank individuals within the focal set of individuals  taking the possible relatedness within the sample into account [  ]  as well as the buildup of the Bulmer effect that reduces genetic variance and makes evaluation more difficult [  ]. Note that the three quantities accuracy  bias  and dispersion are defined as   i.e. and have distributions  i.e. over conceptual repetitions  have themselves a mean and a variance. We also use indicators of (self-)relationships and of genetic variances within the sample. If the relationship matrix across focal individuals is   then we use  where  is the inbreeding coefficient and  is the relationship between individuals ( can be understood as coancestry)  and the bar operators imply averages  i.e.  is the average across elements of . The statistic  was used by [] to describe the decrease in genetic variance due to relationships in a related but unselected population. For selected populations  even of infinite size  there is a further decrease in genetic variance due to the Bulmer effect [  ]  and we will use  where  is the reduction due to selection and  is the genetic variance at equilibrium in a population under selection. The equivalence between Henderson’s [] results for the decrease in genetic variance in a selected population and  was shown (in simplified settings) by [  ]. Consider successive evaluations with “partial” and “whole” data ( and   respectively)  which is based on the use of “old” () and “recent<U+2009>+<U+2009>old” ( from “whole”) phenotype data  respectively. Note that in the following   and  have the same dimension and may be a subset of “focal” individuals (e.g. the young candidates for selection) or the number of animals in the entire dataset (i.e.  in the relationship matrix). In general  the breeder is concerned with the population accuracy of candidates for selection  because higher population accuracy of selection candidates implies greater genetic progress. Typically  focal individuals have no phenotype (or offspring phenotyped) in  but have phenotype (or offspring phenotyped) in   but this is not a requirement for the proposed method. Reverter et al. [] described the amount of change that is expected in consecutive genetic evaluations of individuals as a function of their respective accuracies  and they proposed statistics to check biases in genetic evaluations. The proposed criteria were very beneficial because (1) they do not require knowledge of the TBV  only the EBV from successive evaluations  and (2) they do not require knowledge of adjustment factors to pre-correct phenotypes. In general  assumptions are:    and . Henderson [] proved that  even in the presence of selection  which when coupled with the results in [] yields . Intuitively  this holds if “old” errors in prediction () are uncorrelated with “new” information  which in turn holds if the model takes selection correctly into account. Another assumption  which will be shown later in this paper  is that the set of focal individuals is sufficiently large and “diverse” (for instance  there are several full-sib families and not just one). The derivations of Reverter et al. [] referred to the individual case (e.g. ) and not to  of individuals (e.g. ) that are used for cross-validation. We extend their results as shown below  which leads to the following main results. The statistic   has an expected value of 0 if the evaluation is unbiased. The regression of EBV obtained with “whole” () data on EBV estimated with “partial” () data  has an expectation   if there is no over/under dispersion. The correlation of EBV based on partial and whole data    is a function of their respective accuracies ()  with an expected value   where  is the population accuracy (correlation between TBV and EBV across animals). The covariance of EBV based on partial and whole data is a function of the squared accuracy (reliability) of the partial EBV    . The slope of the regression of EBV based on partial on EBV based on whole data   is  on expectation  a function of the respective accuracies  that is  the expectation of the slope is proportional to the relative increase in average reliabilities from EBV based on partial to EBV based on whole data. In the following  we prove that the statistics described above are related to bias  slope and accuracies. We make repeated use of the following results for biquadratic forms []: consider random vectors    such that . The expectation of the quadratic form  is . Empirical (co)variances (scalars) are quadratic forms  for instance  where  is the centering matrix []. Considering our problem  we make the hypothesis that the two genetic evaluations (e.g. males  (“partial”) and  (“whole”) progeny testing) have different means: Note that the meaning of the “expected mean of EBV ” is unclear under selection. For instance  the last generation is expected to have means higher than 0  but these means will differ for males (heavily selected) and females (less selected). We will assume that the focal individuals include sets of animals that are comparable  i.e. under repeated sampling they have the same  genetic level. For instance  if 1% of the elite females and 10% of the elite bulls are selected  offspring from these animals should have on average the same genetic level across conceptual repetitions of the breeding scheme; the actual animals that are selected will differ but the genetic gain will on average be the same. We also assume (as commonly done) that  because of selection   ( is a relationship matrix) instead of the non-selection case  . This implies that Henderson’s [] description of decrease in variance due to the Bulmer effect is correct and that it can be summarized by a single parameter  [    ]. Following classical notation:  and   and the matrix of prediction error variances and covariances (PEV and PEC) can be described as [  ]. where  and  are matrices of PEV and PEC for the partial and whole analysis  respectively. These expressions assume that genetic evaluation deals correctly with the decrease in genetic variance due to selection [  ] in which case . From here  we derive expectations of several possible quadratic forms that are combined to produce estimators of bias  dispersion and accuracy. In principle  genetic evaluation does not need to be based on mixed models (statistics can be computed regardless of the procedure)  but our results only hold if the variances and covariances of estimators and true values are as described above. Average inbreeding and relationships in  are also needed. Ideally  the evaluation is based on conditional means such that the properties described before hold. Precision of the estimators of accuracy and bias depends on the distributional properties of the EBV and TBV  which can be derived when assuming multivariate normality but we have not attempted to do so herein. It is straightforward to show that   . Thus   is a direct measure of bias. For the method R of covariance estimation  it is recommended that the dispersion (relationship) matrix  ( is included in the quadratic forms  especially in the presence of selection []: However  these weighted quadratic forms lead to estimators that are difficult to understand. Hence  in the following  we will use “unweighted” quadratic forms. The quadratic form using not-centered    has expectation: where  is the number of individuals   is the average self-relationship   is the average prediction error variance and  is the genetic variance. It is worth noting that the classical definition of individual accuracy is based on  []. Thus  the expression above for  is a function of individual expected average reliabilities   but also of means   . To remove dependence of the quadratic form above on means  it makes sense to use centered  and : where  is the centering matrix []. By its properties   and   and therefore is a function of the average self-relationships  minus the average relationship between individuals    and PEV minus PEC. Inclusion of relationships between individuals results in the corresponding reduction in genetic variance due to inbreeding to be accounted for  i.e.  if as usual   then   which shows the decrease in genetic variance [    ]. Similarly   considers the fact that estimates of  are correlated across individuals (the so-called “co-reliabilities” [])  showing that there is little value in having high individual accuracy if predictors are correlated across individuals. The remaining quadratic forms needed for our developments are: and In the remainder of this paper  we assume that the expectation of a ratio of quadratic forms is equal to the ratio of the expectations. The “” shows that this holds when the number of individuals included in the statistics is large (several hundred or more) or when they are not structured into very large sibships. Otherwise  as shown in the “”  both the true regression coefficient  and its estimator  have an expectation less than 1  even when the model is perfect and the EBV have the right dispersion. Here  we give an alternative definition of the population accuracy  i.e. the expected correlation of EBV and TBV in a sample  as a ratio of quadratic forms: Using and   this has expectation: The denominator  corresponds to the expected genetic variance in the focal population and takes the reduction in variance due to relationships  and selection () into account. With all these elements  we can compute the expectation of the derived statistics  as done in the following. The regression  is composed of two quadratic forms. When assuming that the expectation of the ratio is equal to the ratio of the expectations  Note that this expectation involves PEV and off-diagonal PEC. Importantly  it must hold that  (as usually assumed). This statistic is composed of three quadratic forms and assuming that the square root of the expectation is equal to the expectation of the root  it gives: Therefore   is a direct estimator of the increase in population accuracy of EBV from partial to whole data  . We can get a direct estimator of accuracy (and not of ratios of accuracies) from   from which we can derive the statistic: with expectation  as follows Thus   is a direct estimate of squared population accuracy of EBV based on partial data  which we call  since it is an estimator of the squared accuracy (a squared correlation) based on the covariance between  and . This statistic requires an estimator of  that can be obtained by modelling the selection scheme [] or be explicitly estimated []. with expectation: which is a function of squared population accuracies  i.e. . In addition    although  and  need not be equal for single realizations  i.e. for the analysis of one particular dataset. Statistics used to compute slopes and accuracies deal well with regular bias () because the  and  are centered. However  overdispersion (inflation) of EBV is a frequent phenomenon []. To consider a simple case  assume that EBV based on partial and whole data are uniformly scaled by regression coefficients  and   with  (i.e.  there is more overdispersion with less data or with old data)  resulting in: yielding  e.g.  The regression of EBV from whole on partial data    yields on expectation   which is not equal to 1 but equal to the ratio of dispersions. Thus  a value of  (as often observed for genomic predictions) may indicate overdispersion of EBV based on partial data but also underdispersion of EBV based on whole data. The reverse regression of EBV from partial on whole data   yields on expectation   which is a ratio of dispersions and reliabilities. Finally  the correlation  has the following expected value: retrieving a ratio of accuracies. Thus  the statistic  (correlation of “whole data” and “partial data” EBV) is an estimator of change in accuracy and is not affected by this very simplistic form of overdispersion. Note that equivalent biases result when   i.e. when there is more overdispersion with more data or with recent data. Thus  regression of EBV from whole on partial data informs about over/underdispersion  regression of EBV from partial on whole data can be interpreted as a function of accuracies  and the correlation of EBV from partial and whole data is useful as a ratio of accuracies. A very common strategy in cross-validation tests is to compare predictions of EBV with precorrected phenotypes for the predicted individuals [  ]  i.e. using   where  is the precorrected “new” data available in the whole data. It is  however  not clear whether this is a valid estimator of accuracy and what the effect of precorrection is. Here we derive some results that show that the use of precorrected data can be problematic in some cases: many levels of the main environmental effect or wrong variance components. Precorrected data are obtained with the whole dataset using   where  is typically a BLUE estimator of fixed effects. In fact   for  []  which leads to: where  is the PEV of fixed effects in  obtained from analysis of the whole dataset. Now  we will consider only new data that are not in the partial dataset and assume for simplicity one record per individual. We further assume that the new data are only affected by a single fixed effect (say contemporary group)  such that: The covariance of EBV with  can be obtained as follows: Because by orthogonality   ([] equation 5.28)  and where   and   the latter because EBV based on partial data do not influence  (again  assuming there is no effect of selection). Therefore    which yields the following expectations for  individuals: which is equal to 1 as expected  and the correlation is equal to: with expectation: Thus  the cross-validation correlation of EBV with precorrected phenotypes depends on population accuracy  heritability  and errors in estimates of fixed effects. If fixed effects are estimated with high precision  and off-diagonals (both in relationships and in PEV) are negligible  then: If we divide the square of this by the population heritability  (i.e. in the selected population  not in the base population): and therefore   Thus  if there has been no selection  we can estimate accuracy from cross-validation as:  where  is heritability in the base population []. However  if there has been selection  using  underestimates population accuracy because  and . Using the “dairy” example in []   and   such that . If the observed   this yields (biased)  and (correct) . The latter can  in turn  be translated to an “unselected accuracy” of 0.82 [  ]. There is a second and not negligible source of bias due to . For a single fixed effect  matrix  contains  (the variance of the estimate of the effect that affects the -th record) on the diagonal and  on off-diagonals (the covariance of the estimates of the effects that affect the -th and -th records). We will assume that covariances of estimates across levels of the fixed effect are negligible (this is not true if relatives are spread across fixed effects). For a balanced design with  records in    records for each of the  levels of the fixed effect  and with records ordered within level  the structure of  is: where . Also  we will assume that   in other words  relationships add little information to estimates of the fixed effect. This results in  and   which results in . Plugging this expression in  above and ignoring off-diagonals results in: This results in overestimation of the accuracy of   which does not disappear with high values of . Thus  if there are several levels of the fixed effect  the estimate of the cross-validation accuracy will have an upward bias  which is greater for a smaller number of records per contemporary group. This bias is due to the assumption that the precorrection is perfect. For instance  for  and 25 contemporary groups  the bias is an extra 5% apparent accuracy. For  “large” and  “not small”  bias is approximately   i.e.  inversely proportional to the size of the contemporary group  which does not disappear with increasing . The Interbull method [] uses a simple regression that can be written as   where  are daughter yield deviations (computed with the whole dataset) and act as pseudo-data for bulls. Elements of  are assumed to be independent across bulls with variance inversely proportional to the equivalent number of daughters (this can be viewed as DYD having different heritabilities across bulls). Thus  this setting is similar to the previous section on predictivity. The above proofs apply and the expected value of  is 1  although  using  does  yield a correct estimate of   i.e. bias  unless . Also  the expected value of  is   where  is the average reliability of the EBV of bulls based on progeny. Here  as in the analysis on predictivity  off-diagonals are ignored  which should not affect results if progeny numbers are large enough. The addition of marker genotypes to a pedigree-based BLUP genetic evaluation can also be viewed as having “more data”  e.g. on a correlated trait [  ]. Thus  a way to check the increase in accuracy from adding marker information (e.g. from BLUP to GBLUP) is to view the data with marker genotypes as “whole” and the data without markers as “partial”. Using  to refer to EBV with markers and  to EBV without markers  this yields: i.e.  the lower the correlation between genomic EBV and pedigree EBV  the higher the extra accuracy from genomic data. This assumes that   as assumed by []  which sounds reasonable but has been formally proved only for a single marker that is fitted as a correlated trait []. The procedure above uses the same phenotypes for the evaluations with either  or . An alternative procedure may be to compare the increase in accuracy from “partial” to “whole” in both approaches. In this case  to compare EBV from a genomic-based method (GBLUP or SSGBLUP) with EBV from a pedigree-based method (PBLUP)  we suggest the following procedure: Compute EBV with all data (“whole”) using the method that is deemed to be optimal; we will assume that this is GBLUP. Choose a cutoff date and create a partial dataset by setting phenotypes after cutoff date to missing; Compute GEBV based on the partial data using GBLUP; For “focal” individuals (i.e.  the validation cohort): compute statistics     and  that describe respectively bias  dispersion and accuracy of EBV from GBLUP; Compute PEBV based on “partial data” and using PBLUP; Compute statistics     and  that describe respectively bias  dispersion and accuracy of PEBV from PBLUP; The statistic  quantifies the inverse of the relative increase in accuracy from PBLUP to GBLUP in the partial data; The statistic  quantifies the inverse of the relative increase in accuracy from PBLUP to GBLUP in the whole data. The statistics described above were tested in a real-life dataset. We used genetic and phenotypic resources (for details see Table ) from Brahman cows (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>995) and bulls (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1116) that have been widely described in the recent literature [  ]. Yearling body weight (YWT) computed from the average of all body weights recorded between 300 and 420 days of age was used as the phenotype. The 2111 Brahman cattle were genotyped using either the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA; []) or the BovineHD panel (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) that includes more than 770 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Animals that were genotyped using the lower density array had their genotypes imputed to higher-density  as described previously []. The imputation was performed on 30 iterations of BEAGLE []  using 519 individuals genotyped using the BovineHD chip as reference. After imputation  we retained genotypes on 729 068 SNPs  of which 651 253 were mapped to autosomal chromosomes and had a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 1% and were used to build the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) according to Method 1 in []. The data described above comprised the whole dataset. One thousand partial datasets were generated by setting a random 50% of records missing. It is worth noting that these animals are contemporaries (the resource population spans a few years and animals are not descendants from each other) and  therefore  there are no issues related to selection. A simple breeding value mixed-model was used for the analysis of YWT with the fixed effects of contemporary group (combination of sex  year and location)  age of dam at birth in year classes  and age at measurement as a covariate  and the random additive polygenic effects and residuals as random effects. Variance components estimates and BLUPs of breeding values were obtained using the Qxpak5 software []. All datasets were analyzed using both the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix (NRM) and the SNP-based genomic relationship matrix (GRM). Table  lists the 16 statistics that were used to compare EBV from the whole and partial datasets. Note that in order to highlight the impact of the data partitioning  some of these statistics were computed separately for the individuals in the whole and the partial datasets  in the same context as ‘reference’ and ‘validation’ individuals  respectively. For instance   is the correlation between the EBV obtained using the whole dataset and the EBV obtained using the partial dataset  but computed only by using the validation individuals that have missing phenotypes in the partial dataset  i.e. the random 50% individuals with omitted phenotypes in the ‘partial’ dataset. The EBV of those animals are predicted in the partial dataset using parent average (i.e. using pedigree) or using genomic information from relatives (i.e. using the GRM). In the whole dataset  they are predicted using own records. Table  provides summary metrics (mean  standard deviation  minimum and maximum) for the 16 statistics across the 1000 partial datasets obtained using the NRM and the GRM. The means are also presented in the bar diagram of Fig. . Notable changes from using NRM versus GRM were the 66.5% increase in the estimated heritability (from 0.260 to 0.433)  the 21.4% increase in  (from 0.550 to 0.668) and the 4.1-fold increase in  (from 0.076 to 0.312).

Refer to Tables  and  for a description of the statistics and the actual values  respectively Figure  presents a heatmap of the correlation matrix among the 16 statistics obtained using the NRM and the GRM. The individual values are provided in Additional file : Tables S1 and S2. We observed a strong negative correlation ( in all cases) between the heritability estimates and the regressions of EBV from whole on EBV from partial data (i.e.    and ). This is consistent with the expectation of over- and under-dispersion for regression values<U+2009><<U+2009>1.0 and<U+2009>><U+2009>1.0  respectively. Heatmap of the correlation matrix among the 16 statistics obtained using the pedigree-based NRM (left panel) and the SNP-based GRM (right panel). Refer to Table  for a description of the statistics and to Supplementary Tables  and  for the actual correlation values One metric of interest is the correlation of EBV with precorrected phenotype (i.e.   denoted here as ) since this is one of the most frequent measures of accuracy in cross-validation studies. Quite encouraging is the high correlation observed between  and the regressions of EBV from whole on EBV from partial data (i.e.    and )  which ranged from 0.604 to 0.746  as well as the high positive correlation of  with the correlations between “whole’ on “partial’ (i.e.    and )  with a maximum correlation of 0.806 between  and . These results illustrate that the proposed metrics  particularly   are also estimators of the accuracy of EBV based on the partial (earlier) data (termed  in our algebraical derivations). Striking is the novel finding of the strong negative correlation of  (where  are “reference” animals in the training dataset) with . The former is bound to be high since it reflects the prediction’s goodness of fit when computed on the data that is used to build the prediction  and averaged to 0.849 and 0.898 when using the NRM and the GRM  respectively (Table ). However  the negative correlation of  with  indicates that when the breeding value model is particularly good at fitting the reference (‘old’) data (reflected in part by a high heritability estimate)  this strong fitting ability disappears when applied to the validation (‘new’) data  which seems to imply overfitting (by chance). Indeed  a very strong correlation (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.933) was observed between the estimate of heritability and   and a moderately strong negative correlation (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.543) between the estimate of heritability and  (Fig.  and Additional file : Table S2). Importantly  these problematic relationships were not observed with either  or . Finally  we explored the changes in ‘consecutive predictions’  which are represented here by the move from partial (old) to whole (new) data. We used the absolute difference between predictions (statistics  and ) and the variance of the difference of predictions ( and ) and explored the relationships of these with the previous 12 statistics. Please note the strong negative correlation (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.838) between  and . This contrasts with the not so strong correlation (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.548) between  and  (Fig. ). Scatter plot of the relationship of the absolute difference in EBV between the whole and partial datasets () with the correlation of the EBV based on the partial data with the adjusted phenotypes (; left panel) and the correlation between EBV based on the whole and partial data (; right panel) across the 1000 partial (random 50%) beef cattle datasets Between two competing measures of accuracy  the measure that is more closely related to changes in predictions will be preferred. Based on this and our results  we conclude that  is better than . Thompson [] outlined and discussed methods for the statistical validation of genetic models for genetic evaluation [    ]. He emphasized the need for the statistical models to be based on genetic considerations. Today  different genetic considerations (e.g. oligogenic vs polygenic models) may lead to different prediction models  in particular in the area of genomic selection. Thus  the question “which model is best?” is today more important than ever. In this work  we attempt to provide quantitative geneticists with a set of tools to make their own decisions. Why do animal breeders aim at having predictions that are unbiased in both senses  i.e.  and  ? Practically  to avoid suboptimal “biased” decisions  e.g. choosing too few or too many  or simply the wrong set of  young animals. Theoretically  best predictors  defined as conditional expectations  have optimal selection properties [  ]  and therefore we should aim for models (not necessarily linear) that yield such best predictors. In practice  unbiasedness is a property that holds on expectation: for any real dataset  from one evaluation to the next  there will be small deviations; for instance   may differ from 0 just because of small noises. However  it is important to ascertain if these deviations are large (and affect the practice of selection) or not. In selection  the expected genetic gain at the stage of selection is   i.e. the average EBV of the “” selected animals minus the average EBV of the “” animals candidates to selection. To avoid surprises (over- or under-estimation of selected animals)  we need   i.e.  the estimate of the mean and the true mean of breeding values should be the same for selected animals. For this to hold  we must avoid two kinds of systematic errors: bias (wrong estimate of genetic trend) and over-/under-dispersion  which is often incorrectly referred to as “bias” in animal breeding literature. If selection is by truncation on EBV  the true mean after selection  under multivariate normality  is   where  is the mean of all selection candidates and  is the genetic gain. This genetic mean is (implicitly) predicted before selection as . For  to hold  we need an unbiasedness condition (i.e.  among all selection candidates) and a second condition that is . The latter condition  however  only holds if   which amounts to the regression coefficient  to be 1. However  the equality  holds under quite restrictive conditions [  ]. In a frequentist context  Henderson [  ] proved that selection can be ignored if the model is correct  selection is contained “in the data”  and under the assumption of multivariate normality. In a Bayesian context  Sorensen et al. [] proved that selection can be ignored if the evaluation model is correct. However  models are rarely correct  at most they are robust. In particular  the widely used animal model that includes unknown parent groups [] is biased by construction  because genetic groups are due to genetic selection but fitted as fixed effects  which ignores established genetic theory []. It may be argued that for the results in [] to hold (roughly  future errors in prediction are not correlated to current errors in prediction)  future data does not need to depend on past data. This is  however  not the case if there is selection: unborn progeny of unselected animals do not yield data. In principle  models should consider selection correctly  if all information is included. A counterexample where  old data affect future errors of prediction is as follows. Consider EBV () of a young bull based on one record of the dam  with   and a subsequent EBV based on  progeny records () but not on maternal performance. Then    which is not equal to  because the dam performance was not included in . If there is no selection  there is no problem  but this is rarely the case  and it is actually selection that creates bias due to an increase in the genetic level of the trait and a reduction in genetic variance. Thus  we see the process of estimation of accuracy and bias of EBV by our proposed method LR as a double process. First   of the model in order to have a model that empirically has the “best” properties (estimation of bias); and then   of its accuracy. We propose the following two-step praxis approach. First  to ascertain as best as possible that models are empirically unbiased using the statistics  and  which should have values 0 and 1  respectively—perhaps using  if not all  many animals (as in the original paper of Reverter et al. []). Second  for all models that are empirically unbiased  accuracies can be compared based on the proposed statistics  which rely on unbiasedness. Still  there is a problem in method LR  and in all methods that rely on linear regression of “predictands” (pseudo-TBV from accurate progeny testing  less accurate EBV or precorrected records) on “predictors” (typically EBV). As shown in the “”  due to family structure and the not complete accuracy of EBV  the  value of the regression of TBV on EBV  i.e. the “true”   has an expectation lower than 1  . Accordingly  regression of “whole data” EBV (or of precorrected data) on “partial data” may seem to indicate bias:   for the “true”   . In other words  EBV may appear to be over-dispersed when they are actually not  which holds for method LR and for any other similar method such as “predictivity” or the Interbull tests  since it is a fundamental property of the crude regression of a vector of TBV  on a vector of EBV . It seems relevant to assess  in practice  the extent of this inequality   since evaluations are often scaled such that  (actually its estimate) is equal to 1  which implies that EBV may be too much deflated after the scaling. However  we will not address these points here  since this should be the subject of a simulation study that goes far beyond this paper. The deviation of  from 1 is important if the cohort  or focal group  is small and related  and it does not depend on the quality of the “predictand”. Therefore  our recommendation is to use large cohorts for validation. This bias inherent to cross-validation analysis deserves further examination in future studies. Fixing the models to observe constraints on estimated bias should be based on rigorous genetic or statistical arguments (i.e. re-estimating variance components and heritabilities)  rather than quick fixing procedures such as multiplying by constants  manipulating relationships or changing hyper-parameters of prior distributions. For instance  [] found empirically that equaling statistics of  and  provided unbiased predictions  but this has a genetic interpretation of modelling selection and drift from the base to the genotyped population [  ]. In the analysis of genetic trend for litter size in pigs  Sorensen et al. [] also emphasized “forward” cross-validation for model checking  using what we called in this paper “predictivity”  instead of relying solely on model-based predictions. Recently  Putz et al. [] tested by simulation several methods to validate accuracies by cross-validation. They reported poor performance of comparisons of (in our notation)  and   without realizing that  is not an estimator of accuracy but of ratios of accuracies. In addition  they did not simulate selection  in which case theoretical accuracy is equal to validation accuracies. We have shown that precorrection of phenotypes using whole data may bias the result of predictivity. This is particularly relevant for small contemporary groups such as in dairy or beef cattle as opposed to  say  sheep or aquaculture species. Some measure of error in precorrection due to estimation of contemporary groups should be reported in cross-validation results. Although the ranking of methods should be similar  estimates of population accuracies may be biased. Comparing  and   as we propose in this work  might be a better option  although it involves more parametric assumptions. One final consideration involves discussing the difference between population and individual accuracy. Quoting []: “For response to selection  the [population] accuracy should reflect the correlation between true and EBV in the candidates for selection  which is a property of a population  not of an individual. For the stability of EBV  the accuracy should reflect the standard error of an EBV  which can be defined for a single individual.” Our work deals with population accuracies  not with individual accuracies. The former are useful for model selection and for genetic gain; the latter are useful for individual decisions. The population accuracy is not a function of individual accuracies. For instance  consider full sibs that are evaluated by using parent average and for which their parents are known exactly: individual accuracy is 0.71. However  population accuracy is 0  since all full-sibs have exactly the same parent average. Thus  population accuracies involve both individual reliabilities and co-reliabilities [  ]. In this paper  we present properties of cross-validation measures obtained from successive genetic evaluations. These measures allow estimation of population accuracies and biases  which are of interest to quantitative geneticists in general  and animal and plant breeders in particular. We hope that with these tools  researchers can report and compare competing prediction models  in particular for complex cases such as for lowly heritable traits or for indirect genetic values such as maternal effects.

In this Appendix  we quantify the possible systematic error in   where X and Y are successive EBV  or EBV and TBV. Here  we show that this systematic error is small if the number of EBV in X and Y is large (in the hundreds or thousands). The second-order approximation of  is  []. Consider for instance  . The systematic error incurred in the approximation  is   where  where  and . To simplify notation  consider   . Thus  The expression for the covariance of bilinear forms is  ( is the covariance matrix across ; p 58 []). Applied to our case    this yields (as ): The terms linked to the means disappear  as before  because they have the form  which has a value of 0. The expression  can be computed explicitly for ideal cases. A slightly more enlightening expression is  after algebra  twice the average variance within rows minus the variance of rows means of . Putting all together results in: This is always positive  which means that the  estimated as the linear regression of   but also the “true”  of the regression of true EBV  on   has an expectation less than 1    contrary to common assertions. The expectation of  is actually . When the value of  is high (i.e. sufficiently larger than 0)  a punctual estimate of  with value equal to 1 means that the estimators  are deflated—too much regressed. This raises questions on the use of cross-validation to choose the best model for evaluation. The underestimation depends on the total number of individuals in the focal set  on their relationships (on ) and the accuracies and co-reliabilities on the “partial” dataset (on ) but it does not depend on the final reliabilities on  (which implies that the derivation applies for TBV). Inclusion of sibs increases systematic error. For instance   with half-sibs of size 10 and information in “partial” evaluation equal to 1 observation with   results in . Increasing to  results in . Setting  with families of five half-sibs results on . These systematic errors deserve further exploration (e.g. properties of the estimators for different accuracies and family structures)—but this is out of the scope of this paper.

Accuracy of phenotype-based best linear unbiased prediction of breeding values of selection candidates using sib-testing in C is low. Genomic prediction based on dense genetic markers may improve accuracy of selection. Stochastic simulation was used to explore the benefits of genomic selection in breeding schemes for broiler chicken that include birds in both B and C for assessment of phenotype. When genetic correlations () between traits measured in B and C were equal to 0.5 and 0.7  breeding schemes with 15  30 and 45% of birds assessed in C resulted in higher genetic gain for performance in C compared to those without birds in C.

When  was equal to 0.9  genetic gain for performance in C was not improved with birds in C compared to schemes without birds in C. Increasing the heritability of traits assessed in C increased genetic gain significantly. Rates of inbreeding decreased when the proportion of birds in C increased because of a lower selection intensity among birds retained in B and a reduction in the probability of co-selecting close relatives. If G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions ( of 0.5 and 0.7) are strong  a genomic selection scheme in which 30% of the birds hatched are phenotyped in C has larger genetic gain for performance in C compared to phenotyping all birds in B. Rates of inbreeding decreased as the proportion of birds moved to C increased from 15 to 45%. In commercial broiler chicken breeding programs  purebred lines are kept under strict bio-secure environmental conditions (B) to avoid the risk of losing the lines and to prevent spread of diseases []. In contrast  birds in a commercial production environment (C) live under less strict hygienic conditions and diseases can reduce performance  death  or dysfunction of birds. For example  diseases caused by pathogenic  are chronic problems in many commercial poultry flocks [] but these pathogens are completely eradicated in very big commercial breeding programs such as those of Aviagen and Cobb-Vantress []. The differences between environments B and C can affect phenotypic expression of traits and change the genetic ranking of breeding birds such that the best individual based on performance in B might not be the best based on performance in C  i.e. genotype by environment interactions (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) are expected in this situation. G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions for B versus C have been reported for a number of traits [   ]. Kapell et al. [] reported substantial G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions for bodyweight and foot-pad dermatitis; they found that genetic correlations () between traits measured in B and C ranged from 0.46 to 0.69 for body weight and from 0.78 to 0.82 for foot-pad dermatitis. N’Dri et al. [] found that  for performance in B versus C ranged from 0.74 to 0.82 for body weight and from 0.84 to 0.93 for meat quality traits. Long et al. [] and Ye et al. [] also found significant G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions for body weight  mortality  and other performance traits measured in B and C. Thus  a breeding program that is carried out under disease-free conditions  i.e. B  is expected to show reduced genetic gain due to G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions  since only gains obtained in C have substantial economic value. To improve the performance of commercial animals in the presence of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions  the classical method uses sib-testing for phenotypes in both B and C environments and pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) for prediction of breeding values. This method has been used successfully in pig and cattle breeding programs [  ]. In these studies  a fixed number of animals in B was assumed  with no limit on the number of animals in C. The result was a higher genetic gain when phenotypes were assessed in both B and C environments. However  when  was 0.9  the extra genetic gain was small and a large amount of information from C was necessary to increase genetic gains significantly. These studies did not investigate situations in which the number of animals available for phenotyping is limited. In broiler chicken breeding programs  the number of hens mated to a rooster is limited and facilities only allow for a limited number of offspring per hen to be hatched at the same time. In addition  birds in C cannot be used as selection candidates because they cannot be brought back to a B environment due to bio-security restrictions and are  therefore  used only as sources of information for relatives (sibs) in B. In the classical method of sib testing using pedigree  the accuracy of prediction of breeding values for selection candidate birds in B is low due to lack of information on Mendelian sampling terms. For these situations  genomic prediction based on dense marker genotypes can be an interesting option due to better modeling of relationships between individuals and better prediction of the Mendelian sampling terms [  ]. Several studies have shown that accuracy of selection can be improved considerably by genomic selection using high-density markers [  ]. Genomic selection applied in a pig breeding scheme that combines information of performance from purebreds and crossbreds can significantly increase genetic gain and reduce rates of inbreeding compared to a scheme that uses performance from purebreds only []. Modeling traits that are expressed in purebreds and crossbreds is similar to the G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E modeling of a trait expressed in B and C environments. In another deterministic simulation study  van Grevenhof and van der Werf [] investigated the impact of the proportion of purebred versus crossbred animals in the reference population  the  between purebred and crossbred traits  and economic weight on performance of purebreds versus crossbreds on genetic gain. They showed that with  equal to 0.5 and 0.7  increasing the proportion of crossbreds in the reference population from 0 to 100% increased genetic gain of the breeding program  but with an  of 0.9  inclusion of crossbred animals in the reference population reduced genetic gain. However  to our knowledge  no studies have explored genomic selection breeding programs using sib testing in B and C for broiler chickens. The proportion of birds phenotyped in B versus C and the level of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction are important factors to consider in designing broiler chicken breeding schemes [  ]. Birds in C provide information on animal performance in C but  given the limited number of birds hatched in a selection round  a high proportion of birds in C would reduce selection intensity among selection candidates that remain in B. Therefore  the key to improve genetic gain is to find the best compromise between selection intensity among selection candidates and phenotypes for the target environment. The level of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction also affects the optimum design of breeding schemes. The genetic correlation between trait in B versus C represents the magnitude of the G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction  and different heritabilities for traits in B versus C can be also important. The objective of this stochastic simulation study was to compare genomic selection broiler chicken breeding schemes when all selection candidates are kept in a B environment or a proportion of the birds hatched are phenotyped in a C environment. Three factors were investigated: (1) the proportion of birds in B  C; (2) the genetic correlation between the trait measured in B and C (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E); and (3) the heritability of the trait assessed in C. In addition  sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of genotyping strategy and breeding population structure. The breeding schemes were simulated in three stages: (1) generation of a historical base population; (2) simulation of the previous selection programs based on pedigree BLUP with phenotype testing in B only; and (3) application of genomic selection with birds in C and/or B environments for phenotype testing. The historical population (stage 1) was simulated using QMSim []  while the second and third stages were simulated using the stochastic simulation program ADAM []. The simulated genome consisted of 26 chromosomes  with a length ranging from 5 to 195 cM and a total length of 916 cM  representing the major chromosomes in chicken. In the first historical generation  approximately 1000 markers and 150 quantitative trait loci (QTL) per cM was simulated  and each marker and QTL had two alleles with an equal frequency of 0.5. The population was simulated for 950 historical generations in order to establish mutation-drift equilibrium []. Over the 950 generations  the population was gradually expanded in size from 1100 to 2400 animals with equal numbers of individuals from both sexes. The population had random mating with no selection or migration. A recurrent mutation rate of 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 was simulated for both markers and QTL. In descendants  markers and QTL were inherited from their parents following standard principles of Mendelian inheritance and allowing for recombination []  which was sampled from a Poisson distribution with scale parameter <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 for a 100 cM region. Positions of the recombinations along each chromosome were drawn from a uniform distribution. From the historical population  a base population was created  in which each individual had 40 k neutral marker loci and 2 k QTL  which were randomly drawn from segregating loci with a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05 and were  therefore  randomly distributed along the genome. The simulated breeding schemes had overlapping generations and in each generation  selection was applied over several time steps. A time step is a selection round  in which offspring are born and tested for phenotypes  and selection is applied. A generation was equivalent to 6.5 time steps. At each time step  a parental group of 16 roosters and 160 hens were randomly mated to produce 1280 offspring birds with 8 offspring per hen. Parents produced offspring for several consecutive time steps. The sex ratio among the offspring was 1:1. From the common base population  birds were chosen randomly to be parents from time steps 1 to 5. In time steps 6 to 8  the selected birds from time steps 1 to 3 were sufficiently mature to be parents  but the remaining parents were from the base population to make up the parental group of 16 roosters and 160 hens within a time step. From time step 9 onwards  the parents were no longer from the base population  but were selected in previous time steps. Different genetic parameters were used to simulate breeding values and phenotypes for birds in the base population. The breeding schemes were simulated for 40 time steps. In the first 20 time steps  all 1280 birds hatched in each time step were phenotyped in the B environment only and all birds were selection candidates. Selection during this stage was based on pedigree-based BLUP estimated breeding values (EBV) from records in B only. This stage was to mimic the situation of breeding programs in which broiler chicken are selected for a certain period using records in B and was the same for all simulated breeding schemes. From time step 21 to 40  the 1280 birds hatched in each time step were all genotyped and allocated to either the B or C environment for phenotype testing. The number of birds in B or C depended on the scenario of the breeding schemes. Thus  the birds in C were siblings of birds in B. After genotyping and assessment of the phenotype  single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) models [  ] were used in each time step to estimate the genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) for all birds. Instead of GBLUP  ssGBLUP was used to exploit all pedigree and phenotype information of birds from the previous time steps 1 to 20 when genomic information was not available. Based on GEBV rankings  breeding parents were always selected from birds in B; due to bio-security restriction  birds in C were not candidates for selection. In a broiler-breeding program  the overall breeding goal includes a number of traits with different economic weights. However  for simplification  only a growth performance type of trait was considered  which is the primary trait in the breeding goal for all broiler-breeding programs []. The simulated trait expressed in B and C environments was similar to growth performance in the two environments  and thus its genetic parameters were simulated based on parameters for growth performance in B and C from studies on broiler chicken [      ]. The trait expressed in the B environment was defined as the B trait and the trait expressed in the C environment was defined as the C trait. Theoretically  G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions can result in different ranking of breeding values of birds in B and C  different heritabilities  and genetic variances in each environment []. In this simulation  only the first two effects were accounted for because G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction was modelled through  and the heritability of the C trait. The mean (=<U+2009>0) and genetic variance (=<U+2009>1) were assumed to be identical in B and C because heterogeneity of genetic variance does not change rankings between selection candidates when the candidates are located in a single environment  their sibs are in another environment  and performances in the two environments are treated as correlated traits []. Non-additive genetic effects were not included in the simulation. The phenotype of the trait expressed in B or C for the th bird in the base population   was calculated as   where  is the true breeding value (TBV) of the th bird in the base population for a phenotypic record in B or C  and  is the environmental term for a phenotypic record in B or C. Each animal had TBV for both B and C traits  which were calculated based on genotype at 2000 QTL. The effects of QTL  were randomly sampled and then scaled to achieve an initial genetic covariance matrix of  in the base population. All genetic variance and covariance was explained by additive QTL variance and covariance. During the simulation of breeding scenarios  the effect of a QTL was kept constant  but the allele frequency at each QTL could change due to selection and drift. The environmental terms for the B and C traits were drawn from a random normal distribution   where  is the heritability of the B and C traits  respectively. Environmental variance was kept constant through the simulations. Environmental covariance between B and C traits was 0 since each bird has a phenotypic record in only one environment. For selection in time steps 21 to 40  the breeding goal had an economic value of 1 for performance of birds in C and an economic value of 0 for performance of birds in B. During time steps 1 to 20  to emulate the previous breeding program  the selection index had an economic value of 1 for performance of birds in B and 0 for performance of birds in C. Estimated breeding values were based on the following bivariate mixed linear model: where  and  are vectors of phenotypic records of birds in B and C;  and  are vectors of the fixed effect of time step for records in B and C;  and  are vectors of breeding values of the B and C traits;  and  and  and  are incidence matrices associating fixed effects and breeding values to the phenotypic records in B and C;  and  are vectors of random residuals in B and in C  respectively. Model (1) assumed <U+2009>~<U+2009>   where  and  are identity matrices corresponding to birds in B and C environments;  and  are environmental variances of B and C traits  respectively. For time steps 1 to 20  breeding values were estimated using bivariate model (1) with the pedigree-based BLUP approach []  although there were no phenotypic records for the C trait. In the BLUP model  breeding values were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution   where  is the matrix of additive genetic relationships based on pedigree;  is the 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 genetic covariance matrix of the B and C traits;  is the Kronecker product. The pedigree relationship matrix was constructed from pedigree traced back to the base population. For time steps 21 to 40  breeding values were estimated from the bivariate model (1) using the ssGBLUP approach [  ]  which assumes that   where  is a combined matrix of the pedigree relationship matrix  and a genomic relationship matrix  with a weight of 0.25 [  ] on pedigree relationships. The genomic relationship matrix was constructed based on marker data []. In each time step  EBV or GEBV were predicted for all individuals after all records in that time step were obtained. Both BLUP and ssGBLUP models used the true genetic variance components for prediction of breeding values. Computations were carried out using the DMU5 module of DMU package []. The prediction in each time step used all information (phenotypes  genomic data and pedigree) of all individuals since time step 1. Thus  although all birds were genotyped in time steps 21 to 40  ssGBLUP was used in order to use the phenotypic records from time steps 1 to 20. Selection of birds for use as parents was carried out right after genetic evaluation  although they were not yet sexually mature. The factors investigated in this study were the genetic correlation () between trait records obtained in B and C  heritability of the trait in C and the proportions of birds that were kept in B or transferred to C (Table ). Parameters  and heritability were used for trait simulation of birds in the base population. On average  selection intensity for breeding schemes with 0  15  30 and 45% birds transferred to C was 2.82  2.77  2.70 and 2.62  respectively  for males  and 1.97  1.90  1.81 and 1.69  respectively  for females. Combining these three factors yielded 36 simulated scenarios. Schemes without birds phenotyped in C included nine scenarios; the remaining 27 scenarios had a proportion of the birds transferred to the C environment. In the main simulation study  we assumed that all birds were genotyped when genomic selection was introduced in the breeding program. To ensure the general validity of our results  extra simulations were carried out to investigate sensitivity when not all birds were genotyped and/or the number of offspring per hen increased. The breeding programs used in the sensitivity analysis were similar to those described previously except for a few modifications  as specified in Table . For the sensitivity analysis  in all cases  only one level of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction was analyzed  i.e.  equal to 0.7 and heritability of the C trait equal to 0.15. In each time step  a random 50% of the total number of birds that hatched in each time step were genotyped. In sensitivity analysis simulation 1 (SS1)  only 50% of the birds in B and C were genotyped and the number of offspring per hen in each time step was equal to 8 or 10. Thus  SS1 included eight scenarios that had 1200 or 1600 birds with 0  15  30 and 45% birds in C. In sensitivity analysis simulation 2 (SS2)  breeding schemes with 15 and 30% of the birds in C differed in the proportion of genotypes allocated to birds in B versus C. The number of offspring per hen was 8 in each time step. For each scenario  50 replicates were simulated. For each replicate  genetic merit () at time step  was the average TBV of all birds hatched in time step  for the C trait. The difference between genetic merits at time steps 31 () and 40 () was used to compute the rate of genetic gain per time step : . The inbreeding coefficient of each individual was the proportion of homozygous identical-by-descent markers for the individual []. The average inbreeding coefficient  at time step  was equal to the average of the inbreeding coefficients of the 1280 individual birds hatched at time step . For comparison of our findings to those of other studies  rate of inbreeding per generation was used instead of rate of inbreeding per time step. Therefore  in the calculation of the inbreeding coefficient  time step  was translated to its corresponding generation. The rate of inbreeding per generation  [] for a replicate was computed as   where  is the slope of the linear regression of  on generation corresponding to time steps 31 to 40. The accuracy of GEBV was computed as the correlation between GEBV and TBV of the C trait for all B birds hatched at time step 36  using the GEBV obtained during that time step. Birds selected at time step 36 were the last selected parents that produced offspring at time step 40.  and  for each replicate were used for comparison of scenarios in the main simulation study  whereas only  was used to assess differences between scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. Descriptive statistics and standard ANOVA were used. Comparison tests for significance using Tukey’s HSD (honest significant difference  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) were used. For accuracy of ssGBLUP prediction  only the means are reported. In the main study  three factors were included in the ANOVA model: the proportion of birds in C    and heritability of the C trait. Their main effects and all two- and three-factor interactions were assessed. In the sensitivity analysis simulations  SS1 had eight scenarios  while SS2 had six scenarios. Rates of genetic gain for the eight SS1 scenarios and the four corresponding scenarios of the main study that had the same  and heritability were combined for analysis using a two-way ANOVA model  which included the number of birds genotyped  the number of offspring per hen (three levels)  and the proportion of birds in C (four levels). For SS2  a one-way ANOVA model was applied to compare six scenarios. The three-factor interaction between the proportion of birds in C    and the heritability of the C trait on  was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.099). Significant two-factor interaction effects on  were found between the proportion of birds in C and  (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and between the proportion of birds in C and heritability (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). The interaction between  and heritability did not have a significant effect on  (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.562). Figure  shows the genetic gain of breeding schemes for different  and heritability of the trait recorded in C. Genetic gain per time step () (mean over 50 replicates<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error) of scenarios with different proportions of birds in C (P %) for different levels of the genetic correlation () between the B and C traits and of heritability () of the C trait The effect of the two-way interaction between the proportion of birds in C and  on  was significant. With an  of 0.5 and 0.7   of breeding schemes without birds in C was significantly lower than that of schemes with birds in C. On average  schemes without birds in C had a  of 0.116 and 0.164 per time step with  equal to 0.5 and 0.7  respectively  while schemes with birds in C had  of 0.199 and 0.200 with  equal to 0.5 and 0.7  respectively. Among the schemes with birds in C  with  of 0.5 and 0.7   of the schemes with 30 and 45% birds in C was significantly higher than  of the scheme with 15% birds in C (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). With an  of 0.9   of the schemes with 0  15 and 30% birds in C were not significantly different from each other (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05)  but they were significantly higher than  of the scheme with 45% of birds in C (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Changes in  with increasing  varied for different proportions of birds in C. Increasing  increased  of schemes without birds in C significantly  and an increase in  with increasing  was also observed for the scheme with 15% birds in C. However   of the scheme with 30% birds in C did not change significantly as  increased. For the scheme with 45% birds in C   tended to decrease when  increased. Thus   of schemes with 30% birds in C were similar for different . The effect of the interaction between the proportion of birds in C and heritability on  was significant. With heritabilities of 0.15 and 0.25  a change in the proportion of birds in C led to significant differences in  between schemes with birds in C. With a heritability of 0.35  changes in  due to the proportion of birds in C were not significant between schemes with birds in C. More importantly   increased as heritability increased in schemes with birds in C. However   in the scheme without birds in C  as expected  was not affected by heritability of the C trait. On average   of scenarios with heritabilities of 0.15  0.25 and 0.35 were 0.161  0.163 and 0.161  respectively  for schemes without birds in C  while  was 0.191  0.200 and 0.210  respectively  for schemes with birds in C. In addition  the effect of the two-factor interaction between the proportion of birds in C and heritability on  suggested that schemes with birds in C had significantly higher  than schemes without birds in C regardless of heritability (0.15  0.25 and 0.35). However  if  had been not accounted for  these results could be misinterpreted. For example with an  of 0.9  a change in heritability did not cause differences in  among breeding schemes with 0  15 and 30% birds in C but with heritabilities of 0.25 and 0.35  schemes with 15 and 30% birds in C tended to have higher  than schemes without birds in C (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). Differences in  between breeding schemes with different proportions of birds in C depended on both  and heritability. The effect of the three-factor interaction between the proportion of birds in C    and heritability of the C trait on  was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.445). Significant interactions on  were found between the proportion of birds in C and  (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005) and between  and heritability (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.043). The effect of the interaction between the proportion of birds in C and heritability on  was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.085). The proportion of birds in C affected  differently as  changed (Fig. ). On the one hand  with increasing    of schemes without birds in C did not change. On the other hand   of schemes with birds in C decreased with increasing . On average   of schemes with  of 0.5  0.7 and 0.9 were 3.27  2.99 and 2.62% per generation  respectively. As the proportion of birds in C increased   decreased. With an  of 0.5   was lowest for schemes with 0 and 45% birds in C and highest for the scheme with 15% birds in C. With an  of 0.7   was not significantly different between schemes. With an  of 0.9  schemes without birds in C had the highest   followed by schemes with 15  30 and 45% birds in C. Rate of inbreeding per generation (%) (mean over 150 replicates<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error) of breeding schemes with different proportions of birds in C for different levels of the genetic correlation () between the B and C traits The effect of the interaction between the effects of  and heritability of C trait on  was found to be significant. With an  of 0.7  there were no significant differences in  between all levels of heritability (Fig. ). With an  of 0.5   tended to decrease with increasing heritability. With an  of 0.9   increased as heritability increased.  Rate of inbreeding per generation (%) (mean over 200 replicates<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error) for different levels of the genetic correlation () between the B and C traits and of the heritability () of the C trait In SS1  breeding schemes with 8 and 10 offspring per hen in each time step had 0  15  30 and 45% birds in C when only 50% of birds in B and C were genotyped. We found that the schemes of SS1 had lower  than corresponding schemes in the base situation. In SS1  schemes with 8 offspring per hen per time step had lower  than schemes with 10 offspring per hen. However  similar to the base situation  schemes without birds in C had the lowest  among all breeding schemes investigated in SS1 (Fig. ). In addition  the scheme with 30% birds in C had the highest   followed by schemes with 15 and 45% birds in C when the number of offspring per hen was 8.  tended to increase as the proportion of birds in C increased from 0 to 45% when the number of offspring per hen was 10 but the rate of increase in  decreased as the proportion of C birds increased. The scheme with 45% of birds in C had the highest  when the number of offspring per hen was 10. However  the difference in  between schemes with 30 and 45% birds in C was small. Genetic gain per time step () (mean over 50 replicates<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error) of sensitivity simulation 1 for breeding schemes with 8 (H8) or 10 (H10) offspring per hen per time step and different proportions of birds in C (P %) In SS2  genetic gain of breeding schemes with 15 and 30% birds in C that used different genotyping strategies was examined when the number of genotyped birds was kept constant (Fig. ). For breeding schemes with 15% birds in C  the scheme with 30% of genotyping allocated to birds in C yielded a higher  than the scheme with 15% of genotyping allocated to birds in C. For the breeding scheme with 30% birds in C  the strategy with 30% of genotyping allocated to birds in C resulted in the highest . For a constant number of genotyped birds   tended to decrease as the proportion of genotyping allocated to birds in C increased from 30 to 60%. Among the six schemes of SS2   was highest in the scheme with 30% birds in C and 30% of genotyping allocated to birds in C. Genetic gain per time step () (mean over 50 replicates<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error) of sensitivity simulation 3 for breeding schemes with 15 and 30% (P15 and P30) of birds in C and allocating 15  30  45 and 60% of genotyping to birds in C (GC15  GC30  GC45 and GC60) In this study  we investigated genetic gain () and rate of inbreeding () in different genomic breeding schemes for broiler chickens with varying levels of G  E interactions between the bio-secure breeding environment (B) and the commercial environment (C). We investigated schemes with 0  15  30 and 45% birds in C. The effects of G  E interaction were modelled by varying the genetic correlation () between the B and C traits (0.5  0.7 and 0.9) and the heritability of the C trait (0.15  0.25 and 0.35). Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to further investigate the effects of genotyping strategy and of the number of offspring per hen. Genetic gain in the main study was influenced by the proportion of birds in B versus C   between B and C traits  and heritability of the C trait. The proportion of birds in B versus C has an effect on the accuracy of selection and on selection intensity. Since only the performance in C has an economic value  a higher proportion of birds in C resulted in a higher accuracy of GEBV. For example  when  was 0.5 and heritability was 0.25  accuracies of GEBV were 0.369  0.718  0.777 and 0.804 for 0  15  30 and 45% birds in C  respectively. When  was 0.9 and heritability was 0.25  accuracies of GEBV were 0.745  0.809  0.819 and 0.837 for 0  15  30 and 45% birds in C  respectively. Even with an  of 0.9  increasing the proportion of birds in C resulted in increases in the accuracy of EBV. Therefore  genetic gain of a breeding program can be improved by producing records in the C environment if there is a significant level of G  E interaction in the population. This was illustrated also by Bijma and Arendonk [] and Mulder and Bijma []  who found that genetic gain was improved with extra information from C when  was less than 1. However  given limited hatching and reproductive capacities  increasing the number of birds in C reduces selection intensity in B due to a reduction in the number of selection candidates. In other words  there is a trade-off between additional accuracy of selection from records in C and a reduction in selection intensity. In our main study  30% of the birds in C resulted in the optimal balance between accuracy and selection intensity. The optimal breeding scheme in terms of the proportion of birds in B versus C depends on the extent of G  E interaction. Transferring birds from B to C did not improve  in all situations. The level of  changed the accuracy of GEBV in the scenarios investigated. For example  when the proportion of birds in C was 0 and heritability was 0.25  the accuracy of GEBV was equal to 0.369  0.534 and 0.745 for  of 0.5  0.7 and 0.9  respectively. The contribution of records on birds in B to the accuracy of GEBV increased as  between the two environments increased. In other words  the contribution of records on birds in C relative to the contribution of records on birds in B to the accuracy of GEBV decreased as  increased  which explains the increase in  with increasing  for schemes without birds in C. The difference in  between schemes with and without C birds was also smaller when  increased or when there was less G  E interaction. Dekkers [] concluded that with an  of 0.7  genomic selection could improve genetic gain if information from records on birds in B and C was combined. However  van Grevenhof and van der Werf [] implied that with an  of 0.9  transferring animals from the B to the C environment did not increase genetic gain. Therefore  when the level of G  E interaction is low (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9)  transferring birds from B to C is not necessary. Nonetheless  with a low level of G  E interaction  one possible benefit of including records on birds tested in C is to enable selection for disease resistance  especially diseases that exist in the C environment but not in B []. Apart from   heritability of the C trait had a significant effect on  for breeding schemes with birds in C. The level of  relates to the contribution of records in B to the accuracy of GEBV prediction while the level of the heritability of C trait relates to the contribution of records on birds in C to the accuracy of GEBV. As the heritability of the C trait increases  the contribution of records to the accuracy of GEBV increases. For example  with an  of 0.7 and 30% of birds in C  accuracies of GEBV were equal to 0.756  0.793 and 0.827 for heritabilities of 0.15  0.25 and 0.35  respectively. However  in schemes without birds in C  the heritability of the C trait was not important. Genetic gain in the C trait in schemes without birds in C depends on the amount of genetic variation  selection intensity and . In our simulations   is in genetic standard deviations and the genetic standard deviation was kept constant as the heritability of the C trait changed. Therefore  no change in  was observed in schemes without birds in C as heritability of the C trait increased. When designing breeding programs  effects of G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction are often modelled through   while heterogeneous heritability of traits across environments is often not taken into account [      ]. The value of  expresses the magnitude of the G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction but G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction can also result in heritabilities of the B and C traits being different. Heritability of the C trait can be lower or higher than heritability of the B trait. Kapell et al. [] reported that for three of the four studied pure broiler lines  the C trait had a lower heritability than the B trait for body weight at 5 weeks of age. Both higher and lower heritability for the C trait than for the B trait were also found by N’Dri et al. []. Heritability of the B trait can also have a significant effect on the design of a breeding program that takes G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interactions into account but this was not investigated in our study. The contribution of records on birds in B would increase with increasing heritability of the B trait. In addition to the proportion of birds in C    and heritability of the C trait  sensitivity analyses showed that the amount of genotyping  the number of offspring per hen and genotyping strategies can influence genetic gain of a genomic selection program for broilers. In the sensitivity analysis  only 50% of all birds that hatched were genotyped   was 0.7  and heritability of the C trait was 0.15. Genetic gain of the corresponding scenarios in the main study were higher than in the SS1 scenarios  even for SS1 scenarios that had 10 offspring per hen  compared to 8 for the scenarios in the main study  primarily because of the smaller number of birds genotyped in the SS1 scenarios: 640 and 800 for the schemes with 8 and 10 offspring per hen  respectively  compared 1280 birds genotyped in each time step in the main study. When the number of offspring per hen was 8  relative differences in  between the SS1 schemes with 0  15  30 and 45% birds in C were similar to those of the main study  and schemes with 30% birds in C had the highest . In the latter case  selection intensity was not changed when comparing the SS1 schemes with 8 offspring per hen to the corresponding schemes of the main study  and proportions of birds in B versus C among the schemes were the same as the proportions of birds in B versus C genotyped. When the number of offspring per hen increased from 8 to 10 per time step  schemes with 45% of birds in C had the highest . However  the difference between schemes with 30 and 45% of birds in C was very small. This implies that 30% birds in C is close to optimal when the number of offspring per hen is 8 and 10 per time step. In SS2   of the scheme with 15% of birds in C tended to increase as the number of genotyped birds in C increased  which suggests that a higher proportion of birds in C should be genotyped when the proportion of birds in C is less than optimal. Therefore  the scheme with 15% of birds in C for phenotyping and with all these birds genotyped was expected to yield a higher  than the scheme with 30% of birds tested in C and 50% of these birds genotyped. However  the decrease in  of the scheme with 15% compared to 30% of birds in C was not compensated by increasing the number of genotyped birds in C and increasing selection intensity. The scheme with 30% of the birds in C and 30% of genotyping allocated to birds in C has the highest  in SS2. Increasing the number of genotyped birds in C increases the amount of information from C. However  when genotyping resources are limited  increasing the number of C birds that are genotyped reduces the number of B birds genotyped. Information “brought” from the C to the B environment is less meaningful as the number of B birds genotyped decreases  which may explain the reduction in  as the proportion of genotyping allocated to birds in C increased from 30 to 60%. A genotyping strategy that was not tested was selective genotyping. Boligon et al. [] found that a selective genotyping strategy improves the accuracy of GEBV and that animals with the best performance are the most informative. Selective genotyping is possible in broilers because important traits such as body weight and feed efficiency can be measured before sexual maturity. When applying this strategy  it is necessary to consider whether selective genotyping should be applied to birds in B  C  or both. Especially in B  selective genotyping can be advantageous in order to increase genetic gain for a given investment in genotyping. Along with genetic gain  we investigated rates of inbreeding in the schemes of the main study. We found that the proportion of birds in C   and heritability of the C trait all affected . Among the schemes that used records from C   decreased as  increased or when the proportion of birds in C increased. Heritability of the C trait had different effects on  for different levels of . Transferring birds from the B to the C environment reduces selection intensity and increases the amount of information obtained from C. Reducing selection intensity reduces  because decreasing the number of selection candidates decreases the probability of co-selecting birds from the same family. Increasing the amount of information from C has two opposite consequences on . One consequence is an increase in the probability of co-selecting close relatives  which increases . For example  a group of closely related selection candidates receives similar information from C and  therefore  the probability of co-selecting close relatives increases. In addition  increasing the proportion of birds in C increases the weight or the contribution of C information to GEBV of birds in B  which increases . Another consequence of increasing the amount of information from C is an increase in the accuracy of prediction  especially because genomic information describes relationships between full-sibs better than pedigree information. As the amount of information from C increases  the accuracy of GEBV of birds in B increases and  therefore  the probability of co-selecting close relatives decreases. An extra simulation was carried out to test the effect on  when information from C increases and selection intensity remains constant. Heritability of the C trait was 0.15  and  was 0.5 or 0.9. The breeding scheme for this simulation was the same as in the main study  except that the number of offspring per hen was varied from 4  to 5  6  7 and 8  which is equivalent to 640  800  960  1120 and 1280 birds hatched in each time step. In each time step  640 birds were in B as selection candidates  and the remaining were transferred to C. With an  of 0.9   was 2.18  2.37  2.49  2.52 and 2.65 for schemes with 4  5  6  7 and 8 offspring per hen  respectively. With an  of 0.5   was 2.48  3.29  3.15  2.99 and 2.82 for schemes with 4  5  6  7 and 8 offspring per hen  respectively. These results confirm that increasing information from C has two opposite consequences on   as explained above. When  is equal to 0.5  the effect of the co-selection on  due to using information from C is substantial for schemes with 15 and 30% of birds in C  which leads to higher  of these schemes than schemes without birds in C  although the latter  indeed  has the highest selection intensity. As  increases  information from the B environment has more weight for GEBV prediction  which reduces the probability of co-selection due to using C information. Therefore  changes in  result in changes in probabilities of co-selection due to using C information. This explains the reduction in  of schemes with birds in C as  increases. Meanwhile   of schemes without birds in C is not affected by a change in . As heritability of the C trait increased  the pattern of changes in  depended on  because changing the heritability of the C trait has two opposite consequences on . One consequence is that an increase in heritability decreases the weight on information from relatives in BLUP  which reduces the probability of co-selection of relatives [  ] and . Another consequence of increasing the heritability of the C trait is that it increases the weight of C information  which increases . With a low  of 0.5  these increases in the weight of C information for prediction do not clearly show its effect  but it increases  with a high  of 0.9. Genetic gain and rate of inbreeding of genomic breeding schemes for broiler chickens were compared for different degrees of G  E interaction between breeding (B) and commercial (C) environments. We showed that the proportion of birds in B versus C for a breeding program that maximizes genetic gain depends on the genetic correlation between the trait assessed in B and in C ()  heritability of the trait measured in C  the number of offspring per hen  the amount of genotyping  and the genotyping strategy. With an  of 0.5 and 0.7  transferring birds from B to the C environment increased genetic gain for the breeding program and 30% of birds assessed in C was optimal. When the proportion of birds in C was optimal (30%) and genotyping efforts were limited  30% of the genotyping effort allocated to C birds was also the optimal genotyping strategy. When the proportion of birds in C was less than optimal  genotyping more birds in C increased genetic gain. Increasing the proportion of birds in C reduced the rate of inbreeding. The rate of inbreeding of schemes with birds in C increased when  increased  whereas that of schemes without birds in C did not change. In summary  if G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E interaction is strong ( equal to 0.5 and 0.7)  a genomic selection scheme that evaluates a considerable proportion (30%) of birds in C yields more genetic gain than evaluating all birds in B.

Similarly  principal components associated with the genomic information can be fitted explicitly as random effects in a single-step principal component BLUP (ssPCBLUP) model to remove noise in genomic information. Single-step genomic BLUP is solved efficiently by using the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method. Unfortunately  convergence issues have been reported when solving ssSNPBLUP by using PCG. Poor convergence may be linked with poor spectral condition numbers of the preconditioned coefficient matrices of ssSNPBLUP.

The second aim was to implement and test the efficiency of a DPCG method for solving ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP. For two dairy cattle datasets  the smallest eigenvalues obtained for ssSNPBLUP (ssPCBLUP) and ssGBLUP  both solved with the PCG method  were similar. However  the largest eigenvalues obtained for ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP were larger than those for ssGBLUP  which resulted in larger condition numbers and in slow convergence for both systems solved by the PCG method. Different implementations of the DPCG method led to smaller condition numbers  and faster convergence for ssSNPBLUP and for ssPCBLUP  by deflating the largest unfavourable eigenvalues. Poor convergence of ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP when solved by the PCG method are related to larger eigenvalues and larger condition numbers in comparison to ssGBLUP. These convergence issues were solved with a DPCG method that annihilates the effect of the largest unfavourable eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP on the convergence of the PCG method. It resulted in a convergence pattern  at least  similar to that of ssGBLUP. In general  genomic data for livestock animals include several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  which are used in genetic evaluations to obtain genomic estimated breeding values [  ]. Currently  the method of choice that simultaneously combines phenotypic and pedigree information of genotyped and non-genotyped animals with genomic information of genotyped animals is the so-called single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) []. ssGBLUP includes genomic information by combining genomic and pedigree relationships into a combined genomic-pedigree relationship matrix [  ]. However  a major inconvenience of ssGBLUP is that the inverse of a dense genomic relationship matrix () is required  which can be computed up to approximately 100 000 genotyped animals on current computers []. Thus  some methods were proposed to approximate the inverse of   such as the algorithm for proven and young animals (APY) []  or to compute its inverse implicitly based on singular value decomposition (SVD) [] or on the Woodbury decomposition []. Another approach to avoid the computation of the inverse of   or even  itself  is to fit the SNP effects explicitly  or principal components obtained from a SVD of the genotype matrix  as random effects in the model. Several equivalent models were proposed in the literature that enable simultaneous modelling of genotyped and non-genotyped animals as in ssGBLUP [        ]. Equivalent models that directly estimate SNP effects as random effects [      ] will hereafter be referred to as single-step SNPBLUP (ssSNPBLUP). It has been suggested that the dimension of SNP-based models can be considerably reduced by applying random regression to principal components (PC) of the SNP genotypes  and that the remaining noise of genomic information can be ignored []. To our knowledge  a linear system of equations of single-step principal component BLUP (ssPCBLUP) has never been solved with the PCG method for large datasets. The ssGBLUP  ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP models have linear systems of equations with sparse and symmetric positive (semi-)definite (SPSD) coefficient matrices. Thus  the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is the primary choice as iterative solver for solving linear systems of ssGBLUP  ssSNPBLUP [    ]  and of ssPCBLUP. The PCG method belongs to the family of conjugate gradient (CG) methods that are a realization of an orthogonal projection technique onto the Krylov subspace  which is generated by the initial residual and the system matrix (e.g.  the preconditioned coefficient matrix) to which the CG method is applied []. The convergence rate of CG methods is bounded as a function of the spectral condition number of the system matrix  which is the ratio between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the system matrix []. Preconditioning ensures faster convergence of the PCG method  compared to the CG method. Unfortunately  in contrast to ssGBLUP  convergence issues with the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP have been reported [  ]  which we have also experienced in our initial analyses. Furthermore  we experienced similar convergence issues with ssPCBLUP in our initial analyses. Taskinen et al. [] suggested that convergence problems may be due to a poor spectral condition number of the system matrix of ssSNPBLUP. Thus  to achieve faster convergence  improvement of this spectral condition number is needed and can be obtained through methods that have been developed for ill-conditioned linear systems of equations. One such method is the deflated PCG method  which is a two-level PCG method for ill-conditioned linear systems [  ]. The DPCG method has resulted in good performance in other contexts than genetic evaluations [  ]  and possesses interesting properties  such as its relatively easy implementation in current software based on a PCG method and its favourable properties for parallel computing []. To our knowledge  the DPCG method has never been applied in linear mixed models  whether for genetic evaluations or other purposes. Thus  the first aim of this study was to compare the properties of the system matrices of ssGBLUP of the ssSNPBLUP model that was proposed by Mantysaari and Stranden []  and to relate this to observed convergence patterns obtained with the PCG method. Our second aim was to implement the DPCG method and test its feasibility for solving ssSNPBLUP in large genetic evaluation models  and its re-parametrization into a ssPCBLUP model. The first part of this section describes the ssSNPBLUP model that was proposed by Mantysaari and Stranden [] and its re-parametrization into a ssPCBLUP model. The second part describes the CG  PCG  and DPCG methods. The last part describes the datasets used for comparing the properties of the system matrices of the different models  and for testing the DPCG method. In this study  we investigate the ssSNPBLUP model that was proposed by Mantysaari and Stranden [] and is similar to the so-called hybrid model proposed by Fernando et al. []. This ssSNPBLUP model fits three types of additive genetic effects: SNP and residual polygenic effects for genotyped animals  and additive genetic effects for non-genotyped animals. Originally derived as a univariate ssSNPBLUP model  we (readily) extended this to a multivariate ssSNPBLUP model for  traits. In the following   is an identity matrix with size equal to the number of traits   and the subscripts  and  refer to genotyped and non-genotyped animals  respectively. A standard multivariate mixed model for ssSNPBLUP can be written as: where  is the vector of records   is the vector of fixed effects   is the vector of additive genetic effects for non-genotyped animals   is the vector of residual polygenic effects for genotyped animals   is the vector of SNP effects  and  is the vector of residuals. The matrices     and  are incidence matrices relating records to the corresponding effects. Without loss of generality  the matrix  contains the SNP genotypes (coded as 0 for one homozygous genotype  1 for the heterozygous genotype  or 2 for the alternate homozygous genotype) centered by their observed means  and . Additive genetic effects for the genotyped animals for  traits    can be computed as . We assume a multivariate normal distribution for the additive genetic effects   the residual polygenic effects   and the SNP effects   with a mean equal to zero and covariance matrix   . The inverse of  required for the mixed model equations associated with Eq. ()  can be derived from the inverse of the (co)variance matrix associated with the vector     proposed by Liu et al. [] as follows []: where      is the inverse of the (co)variance matrix among traits   is the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix   is the pedigree relationship matrix among genotyped animals   is the proportion of variance (due to additive genetic effects) considered as residual polygenic effects  and  with  being the allele frequency of the  th SNP  and such that . Knowing that   and after some algebra to avoid the computation of  to form   we obtain: where . The linear system of mixed model equations of ssSNPBLUP is as follows: where  is the inverse of the residual (co)variance structure matrix. This ssSNBLUP model is equivalent to the following ssGBLUP model: with   and where  is the genomic relationship matrix modified for considering the residual polygenic effects [  ]. Due to linkage disequilibrium between SNPs  a small number of PC of the centered genotype matrix  likely explain most of the genomic variation  while the remaining PC associated with small eigenvalues may reflect noise in the genomic information [  ]. Principal components of  can be obtained by SVD: where  and  are unitarian matrices with the left and right singular vectors of   respectively; and  is a diagonal matrix with non-negative diagonal elements known as singular values (i.e.  square roots of the eigenvalues of  and ). The matrix  is known as the PC score matrix. Removing the noise can be performed by fitting explicitly only the PC associated with the largest eigenvalues that explain most (e.g.  99%) of the genomic variation  instead of fitting SNP effects  into a ssPCBLUP model as follows [    ]: where ; and  with  containing the largest singular values of  corresponding to the largest eigenvalues that explain  e.g. 99%  of the genomic variation. The linear system of mixed model equations of ssPCBLUP has the same form as the linear system of mixed model equations of ssSNPBLUP (2)  except that  is replaced by  in   i.e.  by . It is also worth noting that the number of columns of  (which is the number of PC kept) is smaller than the number of columns of  (which is the number of SNPs) due to rank reduction. The linear systems of mixed model equations of ssGBLUP  ssSNPBLUP  and ssPCBLUP have the form: where  is a SPSD coefficient matrix   is the vector of solutions  and  is the right-hand-side. Such linear systems of equations can be solved using direct methods []. A bottleneck of most of these methods is that they involve an explicit factorization of . The resulting matrix factor is often dense and might require excessive amounts of memory and computation. Therefore  direct methods are usually too expensive and  in some cases  even impossible for large linear systems. Instead of direct methods  iterative methods  i.e. methods that use successive approximations to obtain more accurate solutions for a linear system at each iteration step  are more attractive. With iterative methods  both memory requirements and computing time can be reduced  especially if  is large and sparse. Within the class of iterative methods  the CG methods are the best choice  especially when  is SPSD []. The purpose of CG methods is to construct a sequence    that satisfies   where  is a vector of starting solutions    and  is the Krylov subspace  equal to . After  iterations  the error is bounded by []: where  is the A-norm of   defined as    is the effective spectral condition number of the coefficient matrix  and is defined as  with  () being the smallest (largest) non-zero eigenvalue of  []. The more  is well-conditioned  the smaller is   the smaller is the error bound  which is expected to result in faster convergence of the CG method []. It is worth noting that the convergence of the CG method does not depend only on   since  affects only the upper bound of the error (i.e.  the worst convergence rate). Indeed  convergence also depends on the clustering of the eigenvalues of the system matrix  on the right-hand-side   and on floating point rounding errors. These factors may lead to different convergence patterns for two different systems of equations with a similar . To improve the performance of the CG method  the linear system of equations    is transformed into an equivalent linear system of equations for which the resulting system matrix  i.e. the preconditioned coefficient matrix  has an effective spectral condition number smaller than . This can be realized by preconditioning the linear system with a symmetric positive definite matrix   called preconditioner. The resulting preconditioned linear system of equations can be written as follows []: The preconditioned linear system can be solved with the PCG method using the algorithm given in Table . Equation () for the error bound of the CG method also applies to the PCG method by replacing  with . Thus  the preconditioner  must be chosen such that . A general rule is that the preconditioner  approximates  to obtain eigenvalues that cluster around 1. The preconditioner  must be also chosen such that inexpensive costs are required for its construction and for the multiplication of its inverse   with a vector  as this operation is performed at each iteration of the PCG method (Table ). For linear systems of equations resulting from mixed models  such as models (1) and (3)  a preconditioner  equal to the diagonal elements of   i.e.   is widely used [        ]. For multivariate analyses   is usually defined as a block diagonal matrix [        ]. The deflated PCG method is a two-level PCG method  which iteratively solves ill-conditioned linear systems of equations  i.e. linear systems of equations with a large effective spectral condition number [  ]. Large effective spectral condition numbers are obtained when very small  or very large  or both  non-zero eigenvalues are present in the set of eigenvalues  called spectrum  of . These very small or very large eigenvalues of a spectrum are called hereafter unfavourable eigenvalues. Deflation is used to annihilate the effect of the most unfavourable eigenvalues of the spectrum of  on the convergence of the PCG method by setting these unfavourable eigenvalues to 0 []. The deflation is performed by introducing a second-level preconditioner    also called deflation matrix  into the preconditioned linear system of equations    as follows [  ]: where  is the vector of deflated solutions and is related to the vector of solutions  of the system of equations  as ; the deflation matrix  is equal to ; the matrix  is the deflation-subspace matrix of rank  that contains  columns  called deflation vectors; and the matrix  is a symmetric positive definite matrix  called Galerkin or coarse matrix []  which can be easily computed and inverted  or factored if it is too large. Because Eq. () for the error bound of the CG method also applies to the DPCG method by replacing  with   choosing an adequate combination of   i.e. choosing a deflation matrix   and thus a deflation-subspace matrix   in combination with   should yield faster convergence. Ideally  matrix  should contain the eigenvectors corresponding to the unfavourable eigenvalues of  to achieve the fastest convergence [  ]. However  obtaining and applying such eigenvectors is computationally intensive. Therefore  the deflation vectors of the deflation-subspace matrix  should approximate the same space as the span of the unfavourable eigenvectors such that . The number () of deflation vectors should be chosen such that the deflation approach gives good results while the additional computational costs are limited as much as possible. Indeed  the size () of the Galerkin matrix should be limited so that it can be stored in memory  and the computational costs associated with the multiplication of  with a vector should be also limited because this operation is performed at each iteration of the DPCG method. For example  if   the computational costs are minimized since  is a vector and  is a scalar. However  in this case  the DPCG method is expected to hardly improve the convergence pattern. Contrariwise  if  is equal to the number of equations of the linear system (i.e.   is large)  then  and  are square matrices with the same size as . Furthermore  if  is defined as an identity matrix  the DPCG method is equivalent to a direct solver  since     and . In this case  the additional computational costs are equal to the costs of inverting   and the DPCG method will converge in one iteration. The algorithm for the DPCG method is in Table . The deflation vectors of the deflation-subspace matrix  can be defined following several techniques based on  e.g.  approximating eigenvectors []  recycling information of previous Krylov subspaces []  or subdomain deflation vectors []. All these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages [  ]. For example  some advantages of the subdomain deflation approach are that  is sparse  and that additional computations for the DPCG method (in comparison to the PCG method) can be implemented efficiently []. Due to these advantages and based on preliminary results  the deflation vectors of the deflation-subspace matrix  were defined following the subdomain deflation approach in this study []. This approach divides the computational domain  (with ) into  non-overlapping subdomains  with each -th () subdomain corresponding to the -th deflation vector. An entry of the deflation vector  is equal to 1 if the corresponding entry is included in the -th subdomain; otherwise the entry of  is equal to 0. Therefore  each row of  contains only one non-zero element. The subdomain deflation approach gives good results if  is large enough []. Multiple divisions of the computational domain of ssSNPBLUP (ssPCBLUP) into  non-overlapping subdomains are possible to define the required deflation-subspace matrix . The optimal division depends on the properties of the linear system of equations. For example  Vuik et al. [] defined the subdomains based on the properties of the eigenvectors associated with the smallest eigenvalues of  for a class of layered problems with extreme contrasts in . This approach could not be extended to ssSNPBLUP because we were not able to identify which model terms were associated with the most unfavourable eigenvalues of  (results not shown). However  based on the observation that fitting SNP effects explicitly led to an increase of the largest eigenvalues of  for ssSNPBLUP  in comparison to ssGBLUP (see sections Results and Discussion)  we hypothesized that grouping SNP effects in subdomains could enable the DPCG method to annihilate the effects of the most unfavourable eigenvalues. Thus  we divided the ssSNPBLUP domain per trait and then within trait as follows: (1) all effects associated with the same trait and other than the SNP effects were included in a separate subdomain; and (2) each set of  randomly chosen SNP effects associated with the same trait were included in a separate subdomain. Following this division  the number of subdomains   and therefore the rank of  and the size of the Galerkin matrix   is equal to   where  is the number of SNPs  and  is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to . It is also worth noting that the proposed division of the ssSNPBLUP domain with  SNP effect per subdomain leads to a system matrix  with zero entries for all equations associated with the SNP effects (see Additional file ). Because the behaviour of the PCG method applied to ssPCBLUP was similar to that of the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP (see the Results section)  we divided the ssPCBLUP domain with the same approach as for the ssSNPBLUP domain  except that each set of PC effects included  consecutive PC effects  which were sorted following a descending order of their associated eigenvalues. In this study  four different deflation-subspace matrices for ssSNPBLUP (ssPCBLUP) were defined by means of sets of  1  5  50  and 200 SNP (PC) effects. Because the PCG and DPCG methods are iterative methods  termination criteria must be defined to determine when the methods have reached convergence. In this study   and  were used as termination criteria for the PCG and DPCG methods  respectively  with  being the 2-norm  and  being the residual of the deflated system after  iterations. It has been shown that the residual of the PCG method is the same as the residual of the DPCG method []. Therefore  the two termination criteria are the same. Two datasets  a reduced dataset and a field dataset  were provided by CRV BV (The Netherlands). To achieve the first aim of this study  the reduced dataset was used to compare properties of the system matrices ( or ) of ssSNPBLUP and of ssGBLUP  and to relate this to observed convergence patterns. To achieve the second aim of this study  the field dataset was used to test the feasibility of the DPCG method for solving the linear system of equations associated with ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP applied to large multi-trait datasets. The reduced dataset and associated variance components were extracted from the Dutch single-step genomic evaluation from August 2017 for ovum pick-up (OPU) and embryo transfer of Holstein dairy cattle. After extraction of the OPU sessions  the data file included 61 592 OPU sessions from 4109 animals  and the pedigree included 37 021 animals. The genotypes of 6169 animals without phenotype were available. Bulls were genotyped using the Illumina 50 K SNP chip. Cows were genotyped using the Illumina 3 K chip and were imputed to 50 K density using a combination of the Phasebook software [] and Beagle []. Because some currently used (own) libraries cannot handle sparse matrices with more than 2–1 elements  and also to keep the system of equations at a reasonable size for subsequent analyses (e.g.  for the computation of all eigenvalues)  genotypes included 9994 segregating SNPs with a minor allele frequency higher than or equal to 0.01 and randomly sampled from (imputed) 50 K SNP genotypes. The univariate mixed model included random effects (additive genetic  permanent environmental  and residual)  fixed co-variables (heterosis and recombination)  and fixed cross-classified effects (herd-year  year-month  parity  age (in months)  technician  assistant  interval  gestation  session  and protocol) []. The field dataset and associated variance components were from the 4-trait routine genetic evaluation of August 2017 for temperament and milking speed of dairy cattle for the Netherlands and the Flemish region in Belgium [  ]. Performance in both countries were considered as different traits  with genetic correlations between Flemish and Dutch traits higher than 0.85. The data file included 3882 772 records with a single record per animal. The pedigree included 6130 519 animals. The genotypes of 15 205 animals without phenotype and of 75 758 animals with phenotype were available. Animals were genotyped in the same manner as described above. After removing non-segregating SNPs and SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.01  genotypes included 37 995 segregating SNPs. The four-trait mixed model included random effects (additive genetic and residual)  fixed co-variables (heterosis and recombination)  and fixed cross-classified (herd<U+2009>×<U+2009>year<U+2009>×<U+2009>season at classification  age at classification  lactation stage at classification  milk yield and month of calving). More details on this genetic evaluation can be found in [  ]. For both datasets  genetic groups were removed from the pedigrees (for simplicity)  the proportion  for residual polygenic effects was assumed to be equal to 0.05  and the centered genotype matrices  for ssSNPBLUP and the matrices  for ssGBLUP were computed with the software calc_grm []. For the field dataset only  a matrix  that contained PC kept for ssPCBLUP was also computed using the software calc_grm. The number of PC kept was equal to the number of the largest eigenvalues that together explain 99% of the genomic variation. Properties of the system matrices and convergence patterns of ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP were compared to those of ssGBLUP. For the reduced dataset  the spectrum of the preconditioned coefficient matrix    of both ssGBLUP and ssSNPBLUP  and of the preconditioned deflated coefficient matrix    of ssSNPBLUP with different deflation-subspace matrices  were computed using Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (MKL) 11.3.2 subroutines. For the field dataset  due to the large number of equations (><U+2009>10)  the smallest and largest positive eigenvalues of the different system matrices of ssSNPBLUP  and ssPCBLUP were approximated using the Lanczos method based on information obtained from the (D)PCG method [  ]. Performed with the (D)PCG method  the Lanczos method approximates the smallest and largest eigenvalues that influence the convergence. Because the null space of a system matrix never enters the iteration of the (D)PCG method  the corresponding zero eigenvalues do not influence the convergence and therefore are not approximated with the Lanczos method [      ]. It is also worth noting that the precision of the approximations of the eigenvalues may vary between analyses  which can partly explain the fact that the number of iterations to reach convergence may not be completely related with the associated effective spectral condition number. The different  and  were thereafter computed to compare the different systems of equations. Linear systems of equations of ssSNPBLUP  of ssPCBLUP  and of ssGBLUP  were solved by using the PCG method. Systems of ssSNPBLUP were also solved by using the DPCG method with sets of 1  5  50  and 200 randomly chosen SNP effects per subdomain for the reduced dataset  and with sets of 5  50  and 200 randomly chosen SNP effects per subdomain for the field dataset. The set of 1 SNP effect per subdomain was not used for the field dataset due to a Galerkin matrix of size 155 980  which was considered as too large for inversion. Similarly  systems of ssPCPBLUP were solved by using the DPCG method with sets of 1  5  50  and 200 consecutive PC effects per subdomain for the field dataset. For both the PCG and DPCG methods  the iterative process was run for a maximum of 10 000 iterations  or until termination criteria reached . In addition  for both the PCG and DPCG methods  the preconditioner  was equal to: where the subscripts  and  refer to the equations associated with fixed and random effects  respectively  and  is a block-diagonal matrix with blocks corresponding to equations for different traits within a level (e.g.  an animal). For the field dataset  diagonal elements of  were approximated using a Monte Carlo method [  ]. Linear systems of equations of ssSNPBLUP  of ssPCBLUP  and of ssGBLUP were solved by using a Fortran 2003 program exploiting BLAS and sparse BLAS routines and the parallel direct sparse solver PARDISO  all from the multi-threaded Intel Math Kernel Library 11.3.2  and OpenMP parallel computing. For the reduced dataset  the coefficient matrix  was held in memory using a compressed sparse row format  and the multiplication of  by a vector  required by the DPCG method  was performed as   where the brackets  indicate the order of the matrix–vector operations. The matrices  and  were readily computed from the coefficient matrix  held in memory. These matrices were computed before starting the iterative process and held in memory. The number of OpenMP threads was limited to 3 for the reduced dataset. For the field dataset  the coefficient matrix  was reconstructed using a matrix-free approach when required for its multiplication by a vector. The matrix  was held in memory. The computation of  was not as straightforward as for the reduced dataset because the coefficient matrix  was not held in memory. Therefore  the matrix  was computed following a suboptimal 4-step approach. The first step consisted of sequentially pre- and post-multiplying the coefficient matrix  by the first  deflation vectors of the deflation-subspace matrix   i.e.  the deflation vectors corresponding to the subdomains that included all effects associated with a same trait and other than the SNP effects. The second step consisted of computing each vector  sequentially with  being a sub-matrix of  with the row entries corresponding to the SNP effects  and  being the -th vector of  with . The third and fourth steps consisted of computing  and   respectively  with the matrices  and  computed explicitly beforehand. Furthermore  because the matrix  was too large to be held in memory for the field dataset  the multiplication of  by a vector  required by the DPCG method  was performed as . Due to this latter implementation of the multiplication of  by   each iteration of the DPCG method requires two matrix ()-vector products  instead of one matrix–vector product for the PCG method. The number of OpenMP threads was limited to 5 for the field dataset. All real vectors and matrices were stored using double precision real numbers  except for the preconditioner  which was stored using single precision real numbers. All computations were performed on a computer with 528 GB and running RedHat 7.4 (x86_64) with an Intel Xeon E5-2667 (3.20 GHz) central processing unit processor with 32 cores. Main random access memory (RAM) and time requirements are reported for the field dataset. All reported times are indicative  because they may have been influenced by other jobs running simultaneously on the computer. Estimates for all fixed effects  additive genetic effects  and other possible random effects  of ssGBLUP solved with the PCG method  of ssSNPBLUP solved with the PCG and DPCG methods  and of ssPCBLUP solved with the PCG and DPCG methods  were (almost) the same after convergence was reached. For example  Pearson correlations of all estimates of ssGBLUP solved with the PCG method and the corresponding estimates of ssSNPBLUP solved with the DPCG method using 5 SNP effects per subdomain were higher than 0.999 for both the reduced and field datasets (Table ) and (see Additional file : Figure S1). Regression of estimates of ssGBLUP on estimates of ssSNPBLUP solved with the DPCG method using 5 SNP effects per subdomain led to regression coefficients close to 1 and intercepts close to 0 (Table ). Similar results were obtained for ssPCBLUP solved with the DPCG method using 1 PC effect per subdomain for the field dataset (Table ) and (see Additional file : Figure S2). For the reduced dataset  the number of equations was equal to 41 949 for ssGBLUP and to 51 943 for ssSNPBLUP. Figure  shows the spectrum of  of ssGBLUP and of ssSNPBLUP  and the spectrum of  of ssSNPBLUP with 1 SNP effect per subdomain. All eigenvalues less than 10 were assumed to be non-zero due to  for example  rounding errors  and therefore they were set to zero for subsequent analyses. Similar patterns for the different spectra were observed. The smallest non-zero eigenvalues of the different  and  that influenced convergence  were equal to 1.1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  regardless of the model or the definition of subdomains. The largest eigenvalue of  was equal to 12 for ssGBLUP  and 181 for ssSNPBLUP (Table ). When deflation was applied  the largest eigenvalue of  varied from 6 with 1 or 5 SNP effects per subdomain to 99 with 200 SNP effects per subdomain. Deflation of the largest eigenvalues of  of ssSNPBLUP can be also observed in Fig. . After deflation  the effective spectral condition number of ssSNPBLUP decreased from 1.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to between 5.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with 1 SNP effect per subdomain and 9.3<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with 200 SNP effects per subdomain. Eigenvalues of different preconditioned (deflated) coefficient matrices for the reduced dataset. Eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrices of ssGBLUP and of ssSNPBLUP  and of the preconditioned deflated coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP with one SNP effect per subdomain are depicted on a logarithm scale. All eigenvalues less than 10 were set to 10. Eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order Both the PCG and DPCG methods reached the termination criteria within 10 000 iterations  and converged to the same solutions for all linear systems of ssGBLUP and ssSNPBLUP. When the PCG method was used  the number of iterations to reach convergence was more than 5 times larger for ssSNPBLUP compared to ssGBLUP (Table ; Fig. ). However  when the DPCG method with 1 SNP effect per subdomain was used  the number of iterations decreased by a factor 5  and was similar to the number of iterations needed for ssGBLUP. Five  50 and 200 SNP effects per subdomain also led to a decrease of the number of iterations by a factor 4.3  1.7 and 1.3  respectively (Table ). Figure  depicts termination criteria by iteration for the PCG and DPCG methods. A flat pattern is observed for the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP. The DPCG method allowed removing this flat pattern such that a pattern similar to that of ssGBLUP was observed. Termination criteria for the reduced dataset for ssGBLUP and ssSNPBLUP using the PCG method and for ssSNPBLUP using the DPCG method. Number of SNP effects per subdomain is within brackets Regarding the wall clock time per iteration  when the PCG method was applied  about 0.05 s and 0.46 s were needed for ssGBLUP and ssSNPBLUP  respectively. The wall clock time for the iterative process to reach convergence  i.e. excluding the time needed for I/O operations and computations of different matrices (e.g.        )  was about 11 s for ssGBLUP  and about 688 s for ssSNPBLUP solved with the PCG method. When the DPCG method was applied  the time per iteration for ssSNPBLUP slightly increased due to additional computations involving the deflation matrix . However  the total time for the iterative process decreased to a minimum value of 170 s with 5 SNP effects per subdomain (Table ). For the field dataset  the number of equations was larger than 25.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for all systems of equations. In total  13 803 largest eigenvalues of  explained 99% of the genomic variation. The smallest and largest non-zero eigenvalues that influenced the convergence were estimated using the Lanczos algorithm based on information obtained from the (D)PCG method. The smallest positive eigenvalues of the different  and  were estimated between 7.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 9.6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. The estimated largest eigenvalue of  was equal to 5 for ssGBLUP  to 1752 for ssSNPBLUP  and to 220 for ssPCBLUP (Table ). When deflation was applied  the estimated largest eigenvalue of  of ssSNPBLUP varied from 5 with 5 SNP effects per subdomain to 193 with 200 SNP effects per subdomain. Similar largest eigenvalues were obtained for ssPCBLUP when deflation was applied. After deflation  the effective spectral condition number of ssSNPBLUP decreased from 4.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to between 1.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with 5 SNP effects per subdomain and 1.6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with 200 SNP effects per subdomain (Table ). For ssPCBLUP  the effective spectral condition number decreased from 1.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to between 4.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with 1 PC effect per subdomain and 1.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with 200 PC effects per subdomain (Table ). Only the PCG method for ssGBLUP  the DPCG method for ssSNPBLUP with 5 and 50 SNP effects per subdomain  and the DPCG method for ssPCBLUP with 1 to 50 PC effects per subdomain converged within 10 000 iterations (Table ; Figs.   ). The other (D)PCG methods for ssSNPBLUP and for ssPCBLUP were stopped after 10 000 iterations. For ssSNPBLUP  the termination criteria at the 10 000-th iteration was equal to 8.0<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for the PCG method  and to 1.3<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for the DPCG method with 200 SNP effects per subdomain. For ssPCBLUP  the termination criteria at the 10 000-th iteration was equal to 3.9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for the PCG method  and to 9.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for the DPCG method with 200 PC effects per subdomain (Table ; Figs.   ). Termination criteria for the field dataset for ssGBLUP and ssSNPBLUP using the PCG method and for ssSNPBLUP using the DPCG method. Number of SNP effects per subdomain is within brackets Termination criteria for the field dataset for ssGBLUP and ssPCBLUP using the PCG method and for ssPCBLUP using the DPCG method. The number of principal components retained was equal to 13 803. Number of PC effects per subdomain is within brackets Regarding the wall clock time per iteration  when the PCG method was applied  about 5 s were needed for ssGBLUP and ssSNPBLUP  whereas about 3 s were needed for ssPCBLUP. When the DPCG method was applied for ssSNPBLUP (ssPCBLUP)  the time per iteration increased to about 9 (6) s  regardless of the number of SNP (PC) effects per subdomain was used. The wall clock time for the iterative process to reach convergence  that is excluding the time needed for I/O operations and computations of different matrices (e.g.        ) was equal to 7735 s for ssSNPBLUP solved by the DPCG method with 5 SNP effects per subdomain  and to 2402 s for ssPCBLUP solved by the DPCG method with 1 PC effect per subdomain (Table ). For comparison  the wall clock time for 10 000 iterations of the PCG method (i.e.  the iterative process that never reached convergence) was equal to 52 683 s for ssSNPBLUP and to 30 198 s for ssPCBLUP. Regarding RAM and time requirements for the field dataset during the solving process  the peak RAM was about 70 GB for ssGBLUP  about 34 GB for ssSNPBLUP  and about 17 GB for ssPCBLUP  when the PCG method was used (Table ). The peak RAM increased to a maximum of 51 GB when the DPCG method was used (Table ). Most RAM was used for storing dense matrices (e.g.        and some ; Table ). The time to compute the Galerkin matrix and its inverse () using a suboptimal approach varied from 430 to 9630 s (Table ). It is worth noting that the wall clock time required by calc_grm for the different computations and I/O operations  was equal to 17 071 s (using 7 threads) for the matrix   and 15 663 s (using 10 threads) for the matrix . Times are indicative  because different jobs were run at the same time and different approaches were used for I/O operations. The first aim of this study was to compare the properties of the system matrices of ssSNPBLUP and ssGBLUP  and to relate this to observed convergence patterns of ssSNPBLUP obtained with the PCG method. The second aim of this study was to implement and test the feasibility of a DPCG method for efficient solving of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP. These aims are important initial steps in the development of an efficient large-scale genomic evaluation system that can handle hundreds of thousands of animals and probably will use ~<U+2009>50 K SNPs. As far as we know  this is the first time that effective spectral condition numbers were computed and that the DPCG method was used in the context of quantitative genetics and of linear mixed models. The obtained results showed that larger eigenvalues were obtained for the preconditioned coefficient matrix  when SNP effects were fitted explicitly in the model  in comparison to ssGBLUP. Since the smallest eigenvalues of  of ssSNPBLUP were similar to those of  of ssGBLUP  larger effective spectral condition numbers were obtained for ssSNPBLUP solved by the PCG method  in comparison to ssGBLUP. Thus  this increase of the largest eigenvalues can be associated with the slow convergence of the PCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP. Deflating the largest eigenvalues allowed faster convergence of the DPCG method applied to ssSNPBLUP. Interestingly  similar  or slightly improved  condition numbers and convergence patterns were obtained for ssPCBLUP  while noise in the genomic information was removed by fitting explicitly PC effects instead of SNP effects. These results can be explained by the fact that the eigenvalues associated with the matrix  and the corresponding eigenvalues associated with the centered genotype matrix  are the same  and suggest that convergence issues with the PCG method are not (only) due to noise in the genomic information. The proposed definition of the deflation(-subspace) matrix allows to remove the unfavourable largest eigenvalues from the spectrum of the preconditioned coefficient matrix  of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP. However  the proposed definition of the deflation matrix did not affect  or very slightly  the rest of the spectrum of ssSNPBLUP  since the smallest eigenvalues remained similar among the different system matrices of ssSNPBLUP and of ssGBLUP. Similar results were obtained for ssPCBLUP. The deflation vectors spanned approximately the same space as the span of the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of  of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP. The proposed definition of the deflation(-subspace) matrix allows smaller effective spectral condition numbers  and therefore better convergence  as expected from the theory. Decreasing the number of randomly chosen SNP effects per subdomain from 200 to 1 or 5 led to effective spectral condition numbers and convergence patterns for ssSNPBLUP similar to those for ssGBLUP. Based on our results and when fitting SNP effects  including 5 randomly chosen SNP effects per subdomain gave similar performance as including 1 SNP effect per subdomain. This similar performance depends probably on the properties of the genomic information  such as the amount of noise (or redundancy) in the genomic information  or the kind of effects fitted (e.g.  SNP or PC effects). Indeed  when fitting PC effects  including 5 PC effects per subdomain gave worse performance than including 1 PC effect per subdomain  or even than including 5 SNP effects per subdomain (Table ). It is worth noting that these results are interesting for ssSNPBLUP because they allow smaller Galerkin matrices  and therefore less memory use and lower computational costs. For ssPCBLUP  the size of the Galerkin matrices remained small thanks to the dimension reduction from SVD of . Regarding computational costs  the proposed definition of the deflation matrix was based on a subdomain deflation approach  allowing cheap and efficient computations []. Ideally  the deflation-subspace matrix  should consist of eigenvectors associated with the unfavourable eigenvalues of  [  ]. However  the computation of these eigenvectors for large linear systems of equations can be very expensive  and these vectors might also be dense  leading to an increase of memory and expensive computations involving the deflation matrix . Therefore  defining sparse deflation vectors that approximate the same space as the span of the unfavourable eigenvalues of  is desirable  and can be obtained with the subdomain deflation approach described by Frank and Vuik []. This approach gave good performance in several fields [  ]  and leads to interesting properties. The deflation-subspace matrix  resulting from this approach is indeed sparse  is cheap to construct  involves a few additional and cheap computations  and has favourable properties for parallel computing []. For example  the deflation-subspace matrix in our implementation is stored as a vector of size of the number of equations of the system  and each entry of this vector contains the identification number of the subdomain associated with the corresponding equation. Moreover  the Galerkin matrix  was held in memory as a dense matrix in our implementation  which is possible on current shared-memory computers when the numbers of SNPs and traits are reasonable. Holding the Galerkin matrix in memory also allows efficient parallel computing using Intel MKL subroutines. Furthermore  while a suboptimal approach was used in this study to compute the Galerkin matrix   we expect its computation to be feasible within a limited amount of time and memory by taking further advantages of the symmetry of the coefficient matrix  and of the properties of the subdomain deflation approach. Improvement of the current definition of the subdomains for ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP could reduce further computational costs (i.e.  time and memory requirements). The definition of subdomains used in this study was arbitrary  that is the number of SNP effects assigned to one subdomain was the same for each subdomain  and SNP effects assigned to one subdomain were randomly chosen. It would be worth investigating whether assignments of SNP effects to a subdomain based on properties of the SNP genotypes  such as linkage disequilibrium  could reduce the number of subdomains while maintaining  or decreasing  the obtained effective spectral condition numbers. Indeed  the current definition of subdomains could lead to too large Galerkin matrices for ssSNPBLUP with a large number of traits. Furthermore  for the field dataset  the current definition of subdomains did not allow to hold in memory the matrix  for computation efficiency []. Instead  we had to perform the multiplication of  by a vector twice each DPCG iteration  leading to double wall clock times per DPCG iteration in comparison to the PCG method. For large datasets  a matrix-free approach (that is our second implementation) allows to solve ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP with a (D)PCG method on current computers and with limited amounts of RAM and of wall clock time. Indeed  large and dense matrices of the linear system of Eq. ()  such as  for ssSNPBLUP  are never computed explicitly. Instead  the matrix-free approach takes advantage of the fact that the (D)PCG method requires the multiplication of  by a vector. For example  the multiplication of  by a vector  is performed in three parts  i.e.  where the brackets  indicate the order of the matrix–vector operations. Also  when using a matrix-free approach  one of the largest computational costs of ssSNPBLUP (ssPCBLUP) solved with a (D)PCG method is  most likely  the multiplication of  () by a vector . Thus  it is expected that the main computational costs of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP will increase linearly with increasing numbers of genotyped animals. Such a linear increase of the computational costs is also observed for ssGBLUP using APY [] or ssGTBLUP based on a Woodbury decomposition of  []. While the solving process for ssPCBLUP seems to be more favourable than that for ssSNPBLUP in terms of memory and time requirements  the comparison between the two approaches should also consider additional computations  such as the SVD of the centered genotype matrix for ssPCBLUP. For the field dataset  the computational costs were quite substantial (i.e. ><U+2009>15 000 s with 10 threads)  and these will increase linearly with the number of genotyped animals and quadratically with the number of SNPs (assuming that the number of genotyped animals is larger than the number of SNPs). However  the time needed for SVD can be reduced by analysing different genome segments (e.g.  chromosomes) in parallel []. For example  using an own Coarray Fortran program with 5 images (processes) using each 2 CPU  performing the SVD of 5 genome segments (of the same size) in parallel took 1276 s  and 16 662 PC were kept (instead of 13 803 PC kept with the SVD to the full genotype matrix). Performing the SVD on 5 genome segments instead of on the full genotype matrix  only marginally increased time and memory required for ssPCBLUP using the DPCG method with 1 PC per subdomain (results not shown). Therefore  further studies comparing computational costs for the whole process of ssPCBLUP  of ssSNPBLUP  but also of ssGBLUP and related methods (ssGBLUP using APY []  and ssGTBLUP []) are needed. Such studies should consider costs of SVD  of computation of genomic relationship matrices  and of back-solving SNP effects from genomic estimated breeding values. Because both PCG and DPCG methods are CG-based methods  the DPCG method can be easily implemented in current software based on the PCG method for other ssSNPBLUP (ssPCBLUP) models  or even for pedigree- and ssGBLUP models  for which convergence issues are observed. Modifications of existing PCG software would be mainly associated with the multiplication of  by a vector  which can rely on existing code for the multiplication of  by a vector. Using the DPCG method with pedigree-BLUP or ssGBLUP could also improve their convergence patterns. For example  the number of iterations to solve the pedigree-BLUP of the field dataset decreased by about 30% (in comparison to the PCG method) after associating one subdomain with each of the 100 sires that had the largest progeny. While this approach could not be generalised to other available field datasets (results not shown)  it seems worthwhile to investigate the DPCG method in the pedigree- and ssGBLUP contexts for performing routine genetic evaluations with increasing datasets within a reasonable time. We showed that convergence issues observed with ssSNPBLUP and ssPCBLUP solved by the PCG method are related with larger eigenvalues and larger effective spectral condition numbers in comparison to ssGBLUP. These convergence issues of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP were solved with a DPCG method  which is a two-level PCG method for ill-conditioned linear systems. As defined in this study  the DPCG method treats the largest unfavourable eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix of ssSNPBLUP and of ssPCBLUP  and leads to a convergence pattern  which is at least similar to that of ssGBLUP.

For Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS)  one of the most devastating swine diseases worldwide  studies have identified substantial genetic variation in resistance of pigs  but evidence for genetic variation in tolerance has so far been inconclusive. Resistance and tolerance are usually considered as static traits. In this study  we used longitudinal viremia measurements of PRRS virus infected pigs to define discrete stages of infection based on viremia profile characteristics. These were used to investigate host genetic effects on viral load (VL) and growth at different stages of infection  to quantify genetic variation in tolerance at these stages and throughout the entire 42-day observation period  and to assess whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) WUR10000125 (WUR) with known large effects on resistance confers significant differences in tolerance. Genetic correlations between resistance and growth changed considerably over time. Individuals that expressed high genetic resistance early in infection tended to grow slower during that time-period  but were more likely to experience lower VL and recovery in growth by the later stage. The WUR genotype was most strongly associated with VL at early- to mid-stages of infection  and with growth at mid- to late-stages of infection. Both  single-stage and repeated measurements random regression models identified significant genetic variation in tolerance. The WUR SNP was significantly associated only with the overall tolerance slope fitted through all stages of infection  with the genetically more resistant AB pigs for the WUR SNP being also more tolerant to PRRS. The results suggest that genetic selection for improved tolerance of pigs to PRRS is possible in principle  but may be feasible only with genomic selection  requiring intense recording schemes that involve repeated measurements to reliably estimate genetic effects. In the absence of such records  consideration of the WUR genotype in current selection schemes appears to be a promising strategy to improve simultaneously resistance and tolerance of growing pigs to PRRS. Infectious diseases pose a considerable problem for livestock production. Where conventional control strategies  such as culling or vaccination  have limited success in controlling or eliminating an infectious agent  genetic selection for improved host response to infection challenge may be an attractive solution []. In livestock production  disease resilience  defined as the ability of a host to maintain high production levels when challenged with infectious pathogens []  has become a desirable breeding goal trait [  ]. Disease resilience comprises two alternative defence mechanisms under potential host genetic control: resistance  which is the ability of the host to inhibit or reduce pathogen replication [   ]; and tolerance  which is the ability of the host to limit the impact of the infection on host performance  without necessarily affecting pathogen burden [   ]. Hence  both tolerance and resilience measure how performance is affected by infectious challenge  but resilience does not take differences in within-host–pathogen burden (i.e. resistance) into account  whereas tolerance measures performance at given within-host–pathogen burden. Both resilience components  i.e. resistance and tolerance may harbour substantial genetic variation and covariation  and are thought to have different impacts on disease epidemiology and pathogen evolution [  ]. Furthermore  a recent theoretical study has shown that inclusion of both resistance and tolerance in the selection objective can lead to higher genetic gain in performance under pathogen challenge than selection on resilience []. Thus  identifying and quantifying genetic variation (and co-variation) in both these traits  host resistance and tolerance  is crucial for devising effective breeding programmes that maintain high health and production levels in the face of infectious challenges. Numerous disease challenge experiments have provided ample evidence for considerable genetic variance in host resistance []. In contrast  estimates for genetic variance in tolerance of farm animals to infections are still sparse  in part because tolerance is defined as the slope of reaction-norms of performance against within-host–pathogen burden []  for which reliable variance component estimates are difficult to obtain []. Genetic improvement of host resistance and tolerance has been considered as a viable disease control strategy for Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) []. PRRS is an endemic viral disease that causes respiratory problems and considerable reduction in piglet growth rate and sow reproductive performance [  ]  and has led to severe economic losses to the swine industry in countries worldwide [  ]. Large-scale PRRS virus (PRRSV) challenge studies carried out by the PRRS Host Genetics Consortium (PHGC) have demonstrated considerable genetic variation in resistance of growing piglets to PRRSV infection based on viral load (VL) (within-host VL  defined as cumulative log viremia until 21 days post-infection)  as well as in growth under infection  regardless of VL (i.e. resilience) [  ]. Furthermore  using the same datasets  a quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified on chromosome 4  where the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) WUR10000125 (WUR) explained 13.2 and 9.1% of the genetic variance for VL and growth  respectively [  ]. Pigs that were heterozygous  for the WUR locus had on average 4.5% lower VL and grew on average 2 kg more over the 42-day infection period than individuals with the unfavourable  genotype. Our previous study of the same PHGC data found inconclusive evidence for genetic variation in tolerance of pigs to PRRS  which was attributed to limited statistical power to disentangle genetic effects related to the overall growth response under infection  regardless of VL and those related to tolerance []. This previous study  which was based on VL and growth as single cumulative measures for each individual over time periods of 21 or 42 days  concluded that more measurements  in particularly a wider spread of individual VL measurements for fitting regression curves (e.g. including zero VL)  would potentially resolve this confounding and may permit accurate estimation of genetic variance in tolerance []. The hypothesis of the current research was that significant genetic variance in tolerance of pigs to PRRS exists and can be detected by partitioning the infection period into distinct stages of infection. This harnesses available longitudinal information of pigs’ responses to infection and builds on several independent studies  which indicated that tolerance changes over the time-course of infection [      ]. Hence  variance estimates for tolerance may also change over time. The specific aims of this research were to estimate genetic variation in tolerance at different stages following experimental infection with PRRSV  defined by viremia curve characteristics  and throughout the whole 42-day observation period  by using the PHGC data from the different infection stages in repeated measures models. Furthermore  this study investigated whether the previously identified WUR SNP  which is associated with resistance and growth under infection  was also associated with tolerance  and whether the strength of the association of the WUR SNP with resistance and growth changed during the course of the infection. The PRRS Host Genetics Consortium (PHGC) dataset used in this study was the same as that of a previous study that provided inconclusive evidence for genetic variation in tolerance []. Briefly  data from 1569 commercial crossbred growing pigs supplied by various breeding companies were collected from nine PRRSV challenge trials following an identical infection protocol []. The animal composition in each of these trials is in Additional file : Table S1. At weaning age (mean age was 26 days  and ages ranged from 17 to 32 days)  around 200 piglets in each trial were transferred from farms (free of PRRSV    and swine influenza virus) to a research facility at Kansas State University. Pigs were randomly assigned to pens of between 10 and 15 individuals. After a 7-day acclimation period  pigs were infected both intranasally and intramuscularly with 10 (TCID50) of NVSL-97-7985  a highly virulent PRRSV type-2 isolate []. Data were collected for body weight (BW) weekly and from blood samples at 0  4  7  11  14  21  28  35 and 42 days-post-infection (dpi). At 42 dpi  pigs were euthanized and ear notches were collected for genotyping. Due to facility availability  trials 7 and 8 were terminated at 35 dpi. As described in Boddicker et al. []  serum virus load  measured by a semi-quantitative TaqMan PCR assay for PRRSV RNA  provided repeated measures for log-transformed qPCR viremia. Across all trials  198 pigs died before 42 dpi. The primary cause of mortality was attributed to PRRS  except for trial 6  which had 46% higher mortality than the other trials due to secondary bacterial infections []. Nevertheless  data from these pigs prior to death were also included in the analyses [      ]. Pedigree and genomic information from Illumina’s Porcine SNP60 Beadchip v.1 [] was known for all pigs. The pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix () was constructed in ASReml 3.0 []. Each pig was assigned to one of three WUR genotypes  using the Illumina / genotype reference system (<U+2009>=<U+2009>689  <U+2009>=<U+2009>286 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>36  where allele  was known to confer higher growth and lower VL). As in the previous tolerance study []  only offspring from sires with more than 10 progeny with phenotypes were considered to reduce the risk of bias in tolerance estimates []. As such  the number of animals included was 1001 from 49 sires. In contrast to our previous study []  214 pigs that had experienced a rebound in viremia (i.e. a second period of increased serum virus load)  as identified by curve fitting []  were omitted from the analyses. Hence  all pigs considered in this study experienced a gradual viremia decline after peak viremia had been reached. This allowed the 42-day infection period to be partitioned into three distinct stages based on common viremia curve characteristics  as described in the next section. In contrast to most previous genetic studies of these PHGC data  which defined resistance and tolerance over 0 to 21 or 0 to 42 dpi periods [      ]  in this study the experimental observation period was partitioned into three stages  i.e. early-  mid- and late-stage of infection. Stages of infection were defined individually based on viremia profile characteristics obtained by fitting the mathematical Woods function described below to the repeated viremia measures of each individual pig  as illustrated in Fig.  [  ]. More specifically  the Wood’s function  which had previously been shown to be a good fit for the viremia data of an individual pig  that did not experience viremia rebound []  is given by   where  is the log scaled serum viremia of pig  at  dpi;  is a scaler quantity which defines the overall height of the curve;  governs the rate of increase to peak viremia  and parameter  is an indicator of the rate of decline after peak viremia. Using the analytical expression for   two critical time points can be derived by differentiation:   the time when viremia reaches its maximum value and   the time post-peak viremia when the rate of viremia decline reaches its maximum (i.e. the inflection point of the Woods function). These critical time points ( and   respectively) were used to define the lower and upper boundaries of each stage of infection in this study. Thus  stages of infection were defined for each individual from time of initial infection (0 days post-infection (dpi)) to  (early); from  to  (mid)  and from  to the end of the observed infection period  which was at 35 dpi for trials 7 and 8  and 42 dpi for all other trials (late). This way  the early-stage corresponds to the phase of rapid viremia increase towards individual peak viremia  the mid-stage corresponds to the initial phase of rapid post-peak viremia decline  and the late-stage corresponds to the phase where viremia continues to decline at a decreasing rate. Illustration of an individual viremia profile used to define stages of infection. Black dots represent log-transformed viremia measures  and the blue line represents the fitted Woods function over the time-course of infection (up to 42 dpi) for one individual. Early-stage of infection is defined from initial infection (0 dpi) to time when peak viremia () is reached ( in this example  approximately 6 dpi); mid-stage of infection is defined from  to  ( in this example  approximately 19 dpi); and late-stage of infection  defined from  to end of experiment (42 dpi  or 35 dpi for trials 7 and 8) Since the Woods function was fitted to each individual separately []  estimates for the parameters  and  were obtained for each individual. Table  shows the variation in the corresponding time-periods for each stage of infection. Average duration of each stage of infection was 6.90  9.19 and 14.26 days for early-  mid- and late-stages of infection  respectively  corresponding to average  and  of 6.90 and 16.16 days  respectively. In line with previous studies  resistance during a particular stage of infection was then quantified as the inverse of the cumulative log-transformed VL over the corresponding time-period [      ]. This was calculated as the area under the curve of the log-transformed viremia estimates throughout the observation period  obtained by numerical integration of the Woods function over the corresponding time-periods  yielding estimates for VL at early-  mid- and late-stages of infection. To calculate the corresponding ADG for each stage of infection  a linear spline curve was fitted through weekly body weights (BW) for each individual using the  function in R. BW was interpolated at time of peak viremia () and time of maximal viremia decay () using the  function in R. From this  ADG at early-  mid- and late-stages of infection were calculated by dividing the difference in smoothed body weight at the start and end of the stage in consideration by the corresponding duration. All statistical analyses were carried out using ASReml 3.0 []  with genetic relatedness described by the pedigree relationship matrix for consistency with our previous tolerance analysis of the same dataset [  ]. Replacing the pedigree relationship matrix with a genomic relationship matrix (which can capture differences between siblings due to Mendelian sampling) had only negligible impact on the variance estimates and on the goodness of fit statistics (results not shown). The first step in the analysis of the variation in resistance and tolerance to infection was to estimate heritabilities and correlations between VL and growth at each stage of infection using a conventional bi-variate animal model for VL and ADG for all individual stages of infection: where  and  are vectors of phenotypes for ADG ()  and VL ()  respectively  at the stages  and  of infection (e.g. ADG at stage   { <U+2009>=<U+2009>early  mid  late} and VL at stage   { <U+2009>=<U+2009>early  mid  late});  and  are the vectors of the trait means and fixed effects for the interaction of experimental trial and parity of the dam when offspring were born (trial-by-parity)  sex of the offspring  BW and age at the start of experimental infection included as additional fixed covariates to account for body weight at the initial infection and variation in age at the start of infection  respectively. Note that no breed effect was included in the model since trial and breed effects were fully confounded in this experiment;   and  are the vectors of additive genetic effects for each trait  with   where  is the genetic variance–covariance matrix and  the pedigree relationship matrix;  and  are the vectors of pen effects nested within a trial for each trait  with   where  is the identity matrix and  is the corresponding variance–covariance matrix of pen effects for the different traits;  and  are the vectors of litter effects for each trait  with   with the corresponding variance–covariance matrix ;   and  are the vectors of error terms for each trait  with   where  is the variance–covariance matrix for the residual effects for each trait; and  and    and    and   and  and  are the incidence matrices for the fixed  animal  pen and litter effects  respectively. In addition to the bivariate animal model  corresponding univariate models were also used to check the robustness of variance components. Since heritability estimates differed between models  heritability estimates from the univariate models are presented. To estimate genetic variance in tolerance  a random regression reaction-norm model was applied to the data. Information on performance in absence of infection was unavailable. To account for this  the origin of the reaction-norms (intercept) was centred at the mean VL for each stage of infection across all animals  referred to as ‘level.’ As described in a previous study []  the linear random regression sire model (RRM) for ADG on centred values of VL  which will be referred to as the level-slope model  was used to identify genetic variance in tolerance at each stage of infection  where ADG at early-  mid- and late-stages of infection were regressed either on VL at the corresponding or previous stages of infection (for example ADG at late-stage of infection regressed on VL at mid-stage of infection): where  is the vector of ADG at early-  mid- or late-stages of infection;  is the vector of fixed effects described in model (1)  where level (overall mean at centred VL) is fixed; and  is the population average tolerance slope (fixed VL);  and  are the sire effects on level (intercept at centred VL) and on tolerance slope  respectively  assumed to follow a multi-variate normal distribution with a mean of zero and   with  where  and  are the variance of   and   respectively   is the covariance between sire effects for level and slope; the random pen and litter effects  and  were fitted as described in model (1);  is the vector of error terms  with Var(  where  is the variance–covariance matrix  assumed to be independently normally distributed. Heterogeneous diagonal residual structures were also tested  but this was found to result in almost the same residual variance estimates and did not improve the model fit  as indicated by Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).  and  are the incidence matrices for population average tolerance slope and those associated with each sire  respectively  consisting of the VL of each pig at the chosen stage of infection;  is the incidence matrix for the fixed effects   is the incidence matrix for the random sire effect on level; and  and  are the incidence matrices for pen and litter effects  respectively. To test the significance of sire effects on level and slope  the model fit of the level-slope model was compared with that of nested models without any additive genetic effects (null model)  and with only sire effects for level (level-model). Significance of each random effect was assessed using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) []  with the LRT test statistics assumed to follow a  distribution with a mixture of 0 and 1 degrees of freedom for the inclusion of sire effects only (e.g. null to level model  including sire effect) and a mixture of 1 and 2 degrees of freedom for the addition of sire slope effects and covariance (for example  from level to level-slope model) [  ]. Next  to identify and estimate the genetic variance in tolerance across all stages of infection  ADG at the three stages of infection was considered as a repeated measure of the same trait and analyzed using the following univariate random regression sire model (level-slope repeated measures model): where  is the vector of repeated measures of ADG at early-  mid- and late-stages of infection (i.e. dimension 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>number pigs considered in the study) and the incidence matrices    and  contain VL measures of individual pigs of the same stage of infection as the ADG-measurement in . The same fixed and genetic and additional random effects were fitted as described in model (2)  with the addition of  and   denoting the vectors of permanent environmental effects for level and slope  respectively  for each individual  where   with   where  and  are the variance of   and   respectively  and  is the covariance between permanent environmental effects for level (overall mean at centred VL) and slope; with respective incidence matrices  and . As described above  evidence for significant genetic variation in tolerance was obtained by comparing the model fit with that of the corresponding null and level repeated measure models using the LRT. Associations of the WUR genotype with growth and resistance at each stage of infection were estimated by including the WUR genotype (coded as -<U+2009>1  0  1 for    and   respectively) as fixed covariate in model (1). Similarly  associations of the WUR genotype with level and tolerance at each stage or across all stages of infection was assessed by including WUR genotype and WUR genotype-by-VL as additional fixed covariates in models (2) and (3). Thus  a statistically significant WUR genotype-by-VL interaction indicates genotypic differences in tolerance. Significance of the associations of the WUR genotype with traits was assessed based on Wald test statistics  where p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 was the significance threshold  as well as the LRT. The additive variance explained by the SNP was calculated as   where  and  refer to the frequencies of  and  alleles in the population  respectively  and the allele substitution effect  for the trait in consideration was obtained from the corresponding models above. In this dataset   and  were equal to 0.82 and 0.18  respectively  and the corresponding observed proportion of pigs with    and  genotypes were 0.68  0.28 and 0.04. ADG for individual stages of infection ranged from -<U+2009>110 to 800 g/day  with the minimum (-<U+2009>110 g/day) and maximum ADG (800 g/day) observed at the early- and late-stages of infection  respectively (Table ). Mean ADG increased with stage of infection from 250 to 430 g/day at early- and late-stages of infection  respectively  indicating that individuals were  generally  able to grow faster at later stages of infection. Mean VL increased from 37.1 to 67.6 units from the early- to the late-stage of infection. This apparent increase does not reflect a higher virus load at a particular time point during the corresponding stages  but is primarily due to the longer time-period associated with the late-stage of infection (on average 14.3 days compared to 6.9 and 9.2 days for the early- and mid-stages of infection  respectively). The coefficient of variation for growth rate was largest at the mid-stage of infection  whereas for VL it was approximately stable across stages (Table ). Both ADG and VL were found to be moderately heritable for each stage of infection (Table ). Heritability of VL was highest at the mid-stage (between peak viremia and max viremia clearance (0.31)). Conversely  the heritability of ADG gradually decreased over subsequent stages of infection (from 0.28 to 0.16). Estimates of genetic correlations between stages of infection were generally high and positive for ADG (in the range from 0.70 to 0.84)  while phenotypic correlations were also positive but weaker (Table ). The bivariate models estimated genetic correlations for VL to be strong between consecutive stages of infection (0.75 to 0.82)  but close to zero between the early- and late-stages (0.01)  indicating that individuals genetically predisposed to experience lower VL early in infection did not necessarily have lower VL at the late stage. Phenotypic correlations for VL were moderate to strong between consecutive stages  but weak and negative between the early- and late-stages. Estimates of genetic correlations between ADG and VL varied in magnitude and sign depending on stage of infection  and had high standard errors. At the early- and mid-stages of infection  genetic correlations between ADG and VL were weakly to moderately positive (0.06 and 0.23 for early- and mid-stages  respectively). The strongest genetic correlation between VL and ADG (0.73<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.24)) was observed for ADG at mid-stage of infection with VL at early-stage of infection  implying that individuals with higher genetic resistance for the early-stage of infection tended to experience a temporary reduction in growth after peak viremia. However  by the late-stage of infection  the genetic correlation between ADG and VL became strong and negative (-<U+2009>0.74<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.21)  indicating that individuals whose genetic resistance led to lower VL at the clearance stage of infection tended to grow faster during that period. Phenotypic correlations between ADG and VL were typically weak across all stages of infection. The null reaction-norm model [i.e. model (2)]  which included VL as a fixed covariate but no genetic effects  identified a statistically significant linear association between growth and VL when late-stage ADG was regressed on mid-stage VL (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02) and when late-stage ADG was regressed on late-stage VL (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). No significant association was found between early-stage VL and growth at any stage of infection. As such  only models that included covariates for mid- and late-stage VL  respectively  are considered from hereon. In the null models  population averages for tolerance (slope) were negative  but generally very flat (close to 0): for mid- and late-stage ADG on mid-stage VL  growth rate only decreased on average by -<U+2009>1.4 (±<U+2009>0.47) and -<U+2009>2.4 (±<U+2009>0.5) g/day per unit increase in VL  respectively; for late-stage ADG on late-stage VL  the decrease in growth rate was -<U+2009>1.9 (±<U+2009>0.4) g/day per unit VL increase. The log-likelihood of the model significantly increased when genetic effects (random sire effects) were included in the model (level-only model) for all stages of infection (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  indicating significant genetic variance in growth rate of pigs infected with PRRSV. Indeed  heritability estimates in the level-only reaction norm models (not shown) were similar to the corresponding univariate models. Models that included sire effects for both level and tolerance slope and a genetic covariance between them  also yielded a significantly better fit than the null model for all stages of infection (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). However  a statistically significant improvement of model fit of the level-slope model over the level model (i.e. evidence for significant genetic variation in tolerance) was only observed when late-stage ADG was regressed on mid-stage VL (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) (Table   italic figures).  Estimates of genetic variance for level were relatively stable across stages of infection for both the level-only model and the level-slope model (Table ). However  estimates of genetic variance for tolerance slope differed greatly between stages of infection  by up to four orders of magnitude (Table ). As expected  genetic variance for slope was largest when late-stage ADG was regressed on mid-stage VL 16.4(±<U+2009>10.2). The corresponding genetic covariance between level and tolerance slope was not significantly different from zero. The average tolerance slope estimated by the repeated measures null-model was -<U+2009>0.46 (±<U+2009>0.28) g/day per unit VL decrease and not significantly different from zero (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35). BW at the start of infection ranged from 3.72 to 13.43 kg  with an average of 7.38 kg. A weak but significant association of BW at the start of infection with growth under infection was found (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  with a positive regression coefficient of 19.0 (±<U+2009>2.83) g/day per kg difference in BW. In other words  pigs that were 1 kg heavier at the beginning of the challenge experiment tended to grow on average 19 g/d faster during the 42-day infection period. The log-likelihood of the repeated measures model improved significantly when genetic effects for level (i.e. random sire effects) were included in the model (level model) (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) (Table ). Furthermore  a statistically significant increase in the log-likelihood over the level model was observed when genetic effects for level  slope and a covariance between the latter were included (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  indicating significant genetic variation in tolerance across all stages of infection. The WUR genotype was associated with VL at each individual stage of infection (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  but was only significantly associated with ADG at mid- and late-stages of infection (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). Individuals carrying the beneficial  allele at the WUR SNP generally had lower VL and higher ADG than  animals. The largest difference in ADG between genotypes was at the late-stage of infection  where  individuals grew  on average 45 g/day faster than  animals. However  the largest difference in VL occurred at the mid-stage of infection  where  animals had on average 3.6 AUC units lower VL than  animals. The WUR genotype explained 43.3 and 12.3% of the genetic variance of early- and mid-stage VL  respectively  but only 4.4% of the genetic variance of late-stage VL. In contrast  it had no significant effect on early-stage ADG  but explained 19.4 and 19.7% of the genetic variance of mid- and late-stage ADG  respectively. Importantly  the WUR genotype had no significant effect on tolerance at any stage of infection as indicated by non-significant genotype-by-VL interactions (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.80  0.20 and 0.37 for early-  mid- and late-stages of infection  respectively). Based on the repeated measures model  the WUR genotype was significantly associated with VL and ADG across all stages of infection.  individuals grew  on average  40 g/day faster than  animals and had on average 3.8 AUC units lower VL. In contrast to analysis of the individual stages of infection  the WUR genotype was also significantly associated with tolerance based on the repeated measures model across all stages of infection (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004)  where genotypic differences in tolerance were indicated by the significant genotype-by-VL interaction []. As with resistance  the  allele also conferred higher tolerance. Individuals with the  genotype grew on average by 10 g/d more per unit increase in VL than individuals with the  genotype. Although numerous studies have left little doubt that pigs vary genetically in both resistance to  and growth under  PRRSV infection [          ]  evidence for genetic variation in tolerance of pigs to PRRS has thus far been inconclusive [  ]. This study provides  for the first time  evidence for significant genetic variation in tolerance of pigs to PRRS. This was obtained by partitioning an individual’s infection into three distinct phases based on individual viremia profile characteristics  instead of considering resistance and performance as single cumulative measures over a 21- or 42-day infection period  as was the case in previous analyses [      ]. This partitioning helped to resolve the previously encountered statistical constraints for detecting genetic variation in tolerance of pigs to PRRS in two ways: first  it provided repeated measurements of virus load and growth to boost the statistical power of the reaction-norm models covering the entire 42-day infection period  and second  it helped to focus the analysis to a stage of infection where genetic differences in tolerance are most pronounced. Growth and resistance were heritable across all stages of infection  which implies that genetic selection for resistance to PRRS is expected to affect growth and viremia at all stages of infection. Estimates of heritability and genetic variance for resistance were greatest for VL during the highly immune-active time-period between peak viremia and maximal rate of viremia clearance []. This suggests that the phase associated with the most rapid viremia decline would be the most affected by genetic selection. For growth  heritability was highest at the early stage of infection. It is not clear whether this reflects heritable genetic differences in growth per se  or already captures different growth responses to infection. Genetic correlation between resistance and growth was strongest between pre-peak VL and post-peak ADG  which may indicate that growth response lags behind and may be affected by earlier viremia response. Other studies on pigs also observed that estimates of genetic associations between growth and some immune response traits become stronger when growth was recorded at a later stage than immune response measures  although this also depended on the type of immune measure considered []. With the univariate single-stage models  significant genetic variance in tolerance was only identified when late-stage ADG was regressed on mid-stage VL. This indicates that genetic variation in tolerance may be sensitive to the timing of measurements. In this case  a unit reduction in VL at the rapid phase of post-peak viremia decline corresponded to genetic differences in pig growth responses at the late-stage of infection  when virus load is low. Indeed  where some pigs may be genetically predisposed to experience compensatory growth  other pigs may be predisposed to suffer prolonged growth depression []. Adopting a repeated measurements model that included viremia and growth measures at the different stages of infection  provided further evidence for genetic variation in tolerance  as indicated by the considerably better model fit of the level-slope model over the level-only model. According to this model  genetic improvement of one genetic standard deviation in tolerance would correspond to a 3.5 g/day difference in growth per unit change in VL (Table ). This means that pigs with equal growth rate at mean VL (57.5 units of VL  at which the repeated measures model for tolerance was centred)  but one genetic standard deviation higher tolerance are expected to grow 159 g/d faster at the observed maximum VL of 99.3 VL units. In other words  pigs that have low resistance and  therefore  have high VL  would benefit from a genetically higher level of tolerance. It would be interesting to know whether such gain in tolerance is compromised by lower growth in the absence of infection. Comparable performance measures of the same pigs prior to infection or of non-infected relatives would help resolving this question []. In line with previous analyses of the same data  we found a significant and similar effect of genotype at the WUR SNP for both VL and ADG  where individuals with the favourable  genotype experienced lower VL and higher ADG [  ]. As in previous studies  we do not report the results with the  genotype due to the small number of individuals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36). Partitioning the infection period into distinct phases  further revealed that the WUR genotype had the strongest effect on VL at early- to mid-stages of infection. These results complement the findings of Boddicker et al. []  who identified a 13.3% reduction in VL between 0 and 21 dpi for individuals with the favourable  genotype. Furthermore  these results agree with those of Hess et al. [] based on the same data  who found that the  genotype was associated with lower and earlier peak viremia and faster post-peak viremia decline. In contrast  the WUR genotype effect on growth was not significant at the early-stage of infection  but strong (explaining almost 20% of the genetic variance in growth) at the stages of post-peak viremia decline  highlighting a possible lag effect of WUR on growth as a by-product of its stronger association with VL at earlier stages. Boddicker et al. [] previously identified a 9.1% increase in growth in individuals with the  genotype. This was identified for the entire period of infection (0–42 dpi)  which may have reduced the genetic signal due to the lag effect of VL on ADG. This may explain why a higher increase in growth for individuals with the  genotype was found in this study (19.4 and 19.7% for mid- and late-stages of ADG  respectively). The effect of WUR genotype on tolerance slope was not statistically significant at any single stage of infection  which either indicates lack of statistical power or suggests that the association between WUR and ADG at mid- to late-stage of infection is a direct consequence of the effect of the WUR genotype on resistance. However  the repeated measurements model identified a statistically significant association between WUR genotype and overall tolerance slope across all stages of infection  with the beneficial  allele not only conferring greater resistance but also greater tolerance. This indicates that resistance and tolerance  when monitored over a prolonged infection period  may share common genetic pathways that are partly influenced by the WUR SNP. One common pathway may be guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5)  the putative causative mutation for the observed associations of WUR  which was found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with the WUR SNP []. GBP5 is associated with innate immune response to infection  where  animals lack GBP5 functionality []. As such  it has been hypothesised that reduced viral replication (and thus reduced viral load) in  animals is due to the functionality of GBP5. However  the function of GBP5 with respect to tolerance mechanisms remains unknown. Given the association of the WUR SNP with both resistance and tolerance  as identified in this study  it is possible that GBP5 may also play a role in tolerance. One of the novelties of this study compared to previous analyses of the same dataset was the partitioning of the infection period into distinct viremia-profile phases. This resulted in two noticeable benefits: first  it provided repeated measurements for virus load and growth that boosted the statistical power of the random regression models  which was key for detecting genetic variation in tolerance of pigs to PRRS in this study. Second  partitioning the infection period allowed for the possibility that genetic mechanisms for resistance and tolerance differ over the time course of infection and provided the ability to focus on particular stages of infection where genetic differences in resistance or tolerance may be most pronounced. Using cumulative viremia over a prolonged period of time (e.g. over 21 or 42 days) provides a useful summary measure of an individual’s ability to cope with infection  but it does not capture the dynamic changes of the individual’s viremia curve that could result from the action of different immune functions at different stages of infection. For example  two individuals may have equal VL over the 21-day infection period  but one of the individuals may experience high viremia over a short time followed by rapid clearance  while the other may have moderate viremia over a prolonged time []. This may reflect different immune response patterns and may yield a blurred genetic signal when cumulative VL is used as phenotype []. By defining stages of infection based on underlying viremia curve characteristics  the corresponding VL measures may reflect the effect of different immune response mechanisms to PRRSV acting over time  and thus possibly different sets of genes associated with these. For example  the time of fastest rate of viremia clearance  which defined the boundary between the mid- and late-stage of infection in this study  may coincide with the time at which neutralizing antibodies start to be produced []. Thus  the mid- to late-stages of infection  for which significant genetic variance in both resistance and tolerance were identified in this study  are likely determined by the ability of the individual to mount an effective adaptive immune response [] and how it deals with the associated implications on growth []. Indeed  previous studies found considerable genetic variation in total antibody response (measured by serum IgG levels) of pigs to PRRSV at 6 weeks post-infection [  ]. Partitioning the infection period into distinct phases also revealed that genetic parameters for resistance  tolerance  and growth changed considerably over the time-course of infection. For example  the estimate of the genetic correlation was strongly positive between mid-stage ADG and early-stage VL (0.84<U+2009>+<U+2009>0.15)  indicating that genetically resistant individuals with lower VL earlier in infection have slower growth rate in the subsequent stage of infection. These results are consistent with resource allocation theory  where a temporary trade-off between fighting infection and growth may occur due to limited nutrient resources being available [    ]. At the late-stage of infection  the genetic correlation between ADG and VL shifted from strongly positive to negative (i.e. -<U+2009>0.74<U+2009>+<U+2009>0.21 between late-stage VL and late-stage ADG). This period is associated with return to homeostasis or even compensatory growth  where animals that managed to clear the virus faster can allocate resources to growth []. In summary  these results imply that selection for lower VL at the pre-peak viremia phase may lead to a reduction in growth during that phase but in faster growth at later stages of the infection period  and overall. Furthermore  our results suggest that genetic selection to increase tolerance would be effective only in the phase of rapid viremia decline. In this study  stages of infection were defined with the help of the mathematical Woods function  which allowed partitioning into distinct infection phases based on viremia profile characteristics  i.e. the phase associated with viremia increase towards peak viremia  the phase of rapid post-peak decline  and the later phase corresponding to more gradual viremia decline. The question arises on how sensitive the results are to the definition of infection stages according to the Woods function. Previous analyses of the viremia data from trials 1 to 8 had fitted a LOESS curve through the data and integrated to obtain area under the curve from 0 to 21 dpi [  ]. A subsequent study demonstrated similar heritabilities and high genetic and phenotypic correlations between viral loads established by both methods  and concluded that both methods describe the same biological trait []. Furthermore  the analyses of this study were repeated for an alternative definition of stages of infection  in which they were simply defined according to the following three fixed time-periods: from 0 to 7 dpi (early)  from 7 to 14 dpi (mid) and from 14 to 42 dpi (late). As shown in Additional file   the fixed time-periods provided similar evidence for genetic variation in tolerance: the repeated measurement model identified significant genetic variation in tolerance to infection and the single measurement models applied to VL and ADG at different stages of infection identified genetic variance in tolerance only for the late-stage of infection (although in this case when late-stage ADG was regressed on late-stage VL  rather than on mid-stage VL  as was the case when stages of infection were defined based on viremia characteristics). These results indicate that specification of infection stages according to individual profile characteristics is not essential for detecting genetic variation in tolerance. Nevertheless  time-periods that are based on individual infection profiles rather than on fixed measurement times would be expected to better reflect the dynamic behaviour of genetic resistance and tolerance mechanisms  as indicated by generally higher heritability estimates for VL and ADG (see Additional file ). Finally  it should be mentioned that partitioning data into distinct stages of infection has proven useful  but may not harness the full information about how resistance and tolerance mechanisms interact over time that is captured by the longitudinal viremia and growth data. Such information may be better portrayed through individual infection trajectories [    ]  although the methodology for genetic trajectory analyses is still in its infancy. The results of this study suggest that  in principle  genetic selection for greater tolerance of pigs to PRRS is possible and may indeed result in an increase in growth rate of pigs infected with PRRSV. However  in practical terms tolerance may be difficult to target for genetic selection  given that multiple repeated measures may be needed for each individual  and information of performance and within-host–pathogen load are needed for multiple offspring of each sire. This high demand in data for estimating tolerance suggests that genetic improvement of tolerance of pigs to PRRSV can only be achieved realistically with genomic selection and intense recording schemes that involve repeated measurements to reliably estimate genetic effects []. Furthermore  incorporation of tolerance into breeding programmes would require understanding the genetic correlations between resistance and tolerance  and how these both contribute to overall resilience of pigs exposed to PRRSV []. Note that we were not able to estimate genetic correlations between resistance and tolerance to PRRS in this study because VL was used both as a measure of resistance (i.e. response variable) and as predictor for tolerance in the random regression models. This sequential interdependence calls for more sophisticated methods such as structural equation models to estimate the true relationships between these traits [  ]. Perhaps the most relevant result of this study regarding practical pig breeding was that the genotype at the WUR SNP was found to be significantly associated with resistance  growth and tolerance  with the favourable  allele likely improving all three traits. This suggests that resistance and tolerance are partly pleiotropic and thus work together to improve host performance  and that selection for greater resistance may simultaneously improve tolerance  and consequently also growth of piglets infected with PRRSV. Based on the results of this study  consideration of the WUR genotype in genetic selection schemes appears to be a promising strategy to improve simultaneously resistance and tolerance of growing pigs to PRRS in the absence of intense data recording.

This improvement was further confirmed by results from a simulation study  with MBMG performing on average 23% better than MBSG with all markers fitted. With the MBMG model  it is possible to use information from numerically large breeds to improve prediction accuracy of numerically small breeds. The superiority of MBMG is mainly due to its ability to use information on pre-selected markers  explain the remaining genetic variance and weigh information from a different breed by the genetic correlation between breeds. The accuracy of genomic prediction (GP) depends on the size of the reference population. Therefore  accuracy of GP is limited in numerically small populations [  ]. Potentially  information from numerically larger breeds can be used to predict genomic breeding values (GEBV) of animals in numerically small breeds  through a method called across-breed GP. However  in practice  it has been shown that across-breed GP does not result in significant improvement in prediction accuracy  as compared with within-breed GP [   ]. In some cases  across-breed GP can result even in negative prediction accuracies [  ]. One of the suggested reasons for poor prediction accuracies across breeds is that breeds differ in patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between quantitative trait loci (QTL) and markers. Some studies suggested that increasing marker density  increases the probability that some of the markers are close to the QTL and have a consistent LD across breeds. Therefore  GP across breeds is expected to improve with increasing marker density [  ]. In contrast to these expectations  Van den Berg et al. [] and Raymond et al. [] showed that simply increasing the density of markers up to whole-genome sequence does not improve accuracy of GP across breeds. As an alternative to a simple increase in marker density  some studies suggested that across-breed prediction should be based on the QTL themselves  excluding potential non-causal markers [  ]. While the use of pre-selected markers or known QTL has been shown to significantly increase the accuracy of across-breed GP []  the magnitude of the increase in accuracy depends on the similarity of the effects of true QTL between the breeds [  ]. This similarity can be measured by the genetic correlation () between breeds [  ]  that can be estimated using a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GRM) [  ]. Accurately pinpointing QTL in the genome is often not trivial  and in most cases  the identified QTL explain only a fraction of the total genetic variance for the traits of interest. Our hypothesis is that the accuracy of GP in numerically small breeds can be improved using a model that uses all available markers  but weighs markers that have a significant effect on the trait differently from other markers. The model must also account for the  between breeds in the reference and validation breeds  and use it to weigh the contributions of the breeds in the reference population to predict the breeding values for individuals from the breed of interest []. The objective of this study was to test a multi-breed multi-GRM model (MBMG) that weighs pre-selected significant markers separately from unselected markers  uses unselected markers to explain the remaining genetic variance that can be explained by markers (RGV_m)  and weighs the information of breeds in the reference population by the genetic correlation between the reference and target breeds. To validate the performance of MBMG model in the analysis of real phenotypes  we also implemented the model for the analysis of simulated phenotypes. For this study  we used data on 595 New Zealand Jersey bulls (NZJ) and 5503 Dutch Holstein bulls (DH)  all of which had genotypes for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Illumina Bovine snp50 beadchip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA) with 48 912 SNPs remaining after quality control. These SNPs had at least ten copies of the minor allele in each of the considered populations. In a combined dataset of the DH and NZJ bulls  minor allelic frequencies (MAF) ranged from 0.009 to 0.5. This SNP set will be referred to as 50k. We used two additional sets of SNPs that were pre-selected based on their significance for stature in a meta-genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) analysis using imputed whole-genome sequence []. This meta-GWAS was performed on 17 populations from different countries  comprising eight breeds  including Holstein and Jersey. The DH population was included in the meta-GWAS  whereas the NZJ population was not included. The meta-GWAS across the populations identified 24 230 genome-wide significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10e-8) SNPs in 163 distinct QTL regions spread across 27 autosomes. The first set of pre-selected SNPs were the so-called TOP SNPs  which showed the highest level of significance in each of the 163 QTL regions identified in the meta-GWAS analysis []. These TOP SNPs accounted for 13.8% of the phenotypic variance for stature in the meta-GWAS. In our study  some of the TOP SNPs had either a very low MAF or segregated only in one of the two breeds and thus  after quality control  only 133 of these TOP SNPs remained. The second set of pre-selected SNPs were the COJO8 SNPs  which were those that showed independent significant effects (<U+2009><<U+2009>10e-8) in the meta-GWAS study. We selected these SNPs using the conditional and joint effect analysis as described in Yang et al. [] and implemented in the GCTA software []. From the 24 230 significant SNPs in the meta-GWAS  357 COJO8 SNPs were selected. TOP and COJO8 SNPs were selected from imputed whole-genome sequence data  and the 50k SNP set used for our analyses did not contain any TOP or COJO8 SNPs. Sixty-five SNPs overlapped between the COJO8 and TOP SNPs. For the analysis using real phenotypes  50k  TOP and COJO8 SNP sets were each fitted  one at a time  with a separate single GRM fitted in the prediction model. SNP sets were evaluated in terms of the estimated genetic parameters and prediction accuracy for stature. Furthermore  the TOP SNPs were combined with the 50k SNPs into a single set (50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>TOP)  and the 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>COJO8 SNP set was a combination of COJO8 and 50k SNPs. These combined sets; 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>TOP and 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>COJO8  were fitted via one GRM matrix and evaluated for the estimated genetic parameters and prediction accuracy for stature. For the analysis of real phenotypes  estimated breeding values (EBV) for stature and the effective daughter contributions (EDC)  which were the number of daughters on which the EBV were based  were available for all 595 NZJ and 5503 DH bulls. Data were provided by CRV BV (Cooperative Cattle Improvement Organization  Arnhem  The Netherlands). EBV and EDC for stature for all bulls were deregressed to obtain deregressed proofs (DRP) and deregressed effective daughter contributions (dEDC)  respectively  according to Calus et al. []. To obtain DRP  the deregression procedure  called matrix deregression  corrects for the contribution of information on parents  which also includes information on sibs  to an individual’s EBV. Similarly  dEDC were obtained by removing any EDC that are contributed by relatives in the dataset. The dEDC were used as weights for the DRP in subsequent analyses. Mean dEDC were equal to 52 for DH and 17 for NZJ. In the meta-GWAS []  3047 Jerseys from Australia were included. However  Australia and New Zealand do not have a joint genetic evaluation procedure for Jerseys  thus  the DRP of the NZJ bulls do not depend on information that went into the meta-GWAS. To validate the performance of the MBMG model in terms of prediction accuracy and genetic parameter estimation  we also performed a simulation study. Phenotypes for all 595 NZJ and 5503 DH were simulated  using the real genotypes for 49 045 SNPs (50k and TOP SNPs combined) in both breeds. A quantitative trait with a heritability () of 0.8 in both breeds was simulated. The TOP SNPs (<U+2009>=<U+2009>133) and 150 randomly selected SNPs were assumed to be causal in both breeds. Allele substitution effects of the causal SNPs were sampled from a bi-variate normal distribution with a mean of 0  a variance of 1  and a correlation of 1  0.5 and 0.25 between the breeds. Allele substitution effects were sampled independently from the allele frequency of causal SNPs. Therefore  the correlation between allele substitution effects was similar to the correlation between breeding values for performance in DH and NZJ  which is defined as the genetic correlation () between DH and NZJ. In both breeds  a true breeding value (TBV) for individual  was calculated as <U+2211>( * )  where  is the genotype of individual  at causal locus  (coded as 0  1  2)  and  is the allele substitution effect of causal variant . The corresponding phenotype was computed as <U+2009>+<U+2009>  where  is the residual effect of individual   sampled from a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance equal to   where  is the genetic variance of TBV for breed . Simulation of phenotypes was carried out in R [] and was replicated 100 times. For the analysis of simulated phenotypes  the following SNP sets were selected:  we considered this set of SNPs to be the default set  which included 283 causal and 48 762 non-causal SNPs.  this set included the 150 randomly selected causal and 48 762 non-causal SNPs.  this set consisted of the 133 causal SNPs that were the TOP SNPs in the empirical analysis  which were identified in the meta-GWAS analysis.  this set included 133 TOP SNPs and 150 additional randomly selected non-causal SNPs that represented random noise (RN).  this set consisted of all the 283 causal SNPs used in this study.  this set consisted of all non-causal SNPs. For both the empirical analysis and simulation  multi-breed GRM were calculated for all SNP sets according to the method proposed by Wientjes et al. [] as: where  and  are matrices containing centred genotype codes for all individuals from DH and NZJ populations  respectively  which were centred with breed-specific allele frequencies for all loci   is the allele frequency for locus  in the DH population and  is the allele frequency for locus  in the NZJ population. Two types of bivariate GREML models were implemented in the MTG2 [] software using the calculated GRM and phenotypes. This model is a bivariate  multi-breed  single GRM (MBSG) model. The bivariate model considers the phenotypes of DH and NZJ for the same trait as those from two different correlated traits and uses one GRM combining all markers. The model was as follows: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is the trait mean   is an incidence matrix linking observations in  to genetic effects in   and  is the residual. Genetic effects were assumed to be normally distributed as  and   where  and  are genetic variances in DH and NZJ populations  respectively  and  is the genetic covariance between the breeds. The GRM fitted in this model were those computed based on SNPs in the 50k  TOP  COJO8  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>TOP and 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>COJO8 sets for the empirical analysis. For the simulated scenarios  GRM based on 50k  TOP  TOP<U+2009>+<U+2009>RN  CAUSAL  NON CAUSAL and ALL sets were fitted. This model is a bivariate  multi-breed  multi-GRM (MBMG) model and is an extension of MBSG  in which instead of a single multi-breed GRM  two separate multi-breed GRM (formed from two different marker sets) were fitted simultaneously. The model was as follows: where subscripts 1 and 2 represents the first and second GRM fitted in the model  respectively   and  are identical incidence matrices linking observations in  to the two genetic effects   and . Here  genetic effects were also assumed to be normally distributed as: with  and . For the empirical analysis  the sets of GRM fitted together in the MBMG model were 50k and TOP  50k and COJO8. For the simulation analysis  the sets of GRM fitted together were TOP and 50k  TOP and NON CAUSAL  CAUSAL and NON CAUSAL. For both the MBSG and MBMG models  residual terms were assumed to be normally distributed as  in the empirical analysis  where  is the residual variance and  is a diagonal matrix that contains the inverse of dEDC  which were used as weights for the DRP. The dEDC in  were used to scale the residual of the animals in the model  such that animals with a high dEDC have effectively a small residual. For the analysis using simulated phenotypes  we assumed  where  is an identity matrix. For the multi-breed GP models described above  the reference population contained both DH and a subset (<U+2009>=<U+2009>476) of NZJ bulls. NZJ bulls were always used as validation individuals using fivefold cross-validation  where the NZJ bulls were randomly split into five sets of 119 individuals. The same validation sets were used for both the analyses using real and simulated data. The GEBV of bulls in a particular validation set were estimated based on the model obtained from the rest of the data  i.e. phenotypes of all DH bulls and the remaining 476 NZJ bulls. This was repeated five times (once for each validation set). In all models  accuracy of prediction was computed as the correlation between the GEBV of NZJ bulls in each validation set and their TBV  which in the analysis using real data were approximated by the DRP. The mean correlation across the five validation sets was used as the prediction accuracy. To assess the benefit of combining both breeds in the reference population compared to only a single breed in the reference population  we implemented alternative models to MBSG and MBMG in which only DH (across-breed) or only NZJ (within-breed) bulls were included in the reference population. The single-breed equivalent to MBSG was: where  is a vector of phenotypes for either DH (across-breed)  in which case the model is referred to as across-breed  single-GRM (ABSG)  or NZJ (within-breed)  in which case the model is referred to as within-breed  single-GRM (WBSG). All other model parameters are as described under MBSG. The single-breed equivalent to MBMG was: where  is a vector of phenotypes for either DH (across-breed)  in which case the model is referred to as across-breed  multiple-GRM (ABMG)  or NZJ (within-breed)  in which case the model is referred to as within-breed  multiple-GRM (WBMG). All other model parameters are as described under MBMG. The models ABSG  ABMG  WBSG  and WBMG were fitted using both real and simulated phenotypes and NZJ bulls were the validation candidates. In the analyses of real data  the calculated accuracies of prediction  which were the correlations between DRP and GEBV  were scaled by the mean accuracy of the DRP. The dEDC for all NZJ were converted into reliabilities () of DRP as   where   in this case  is the heritability of stature in NZJ. The mean  for the validation candidates (NZJ) was equal to 0.76. In the analysis using DRP for stature  we estimated  for both DH and NZJ using the MBSG and MBMG models  which in this case reflect the proportion of the explained variance of DRP. These estimates are in Table . The estimated  for DH and NZJ were similar between the bivariate multi-breed models and their equivalent univariate models (results not shown). Thus  estimates of  obtained with the MBSG model were similar to those obtained with the ABSG model for DH  and WBSG for NZJ. Likewise  estimates of  obtained with the MBMG model were similar to those obtained with ABMG for DH and WBSG for NZJ. In general  estimated  were lower for NZJ than DH  which reflected the smaller number of NZJ individuals in the reference population and their lower mean dEDC (17). The mean of dEDC for the DH bulls was equal to 52. When the GRM based on the TOP 133 SNPs was fitted in MBSG  estimated  were low  i.e. 0.26 and 0.27 for DH and NZJ  respectively. However  when using the GRM based on the 357 COJO8 SNPs  estimated  were significantly higher  i.e. 0.75 and 0.38 for DH and NZJ  respectively. Estimated  were highest with the 50k GRM  i.e. 0.97 and 0.71 for DH and NZJ  respectively.  did not increase further by adding either the TOP or COJO8 SNPs to the 50k set. Total  estimated when fitting two separate GRM simultaneously in the MBMG model did not differ significantly from those obtained by fitting only the 50k GRM. For example  for DH  the TOP and COJO8 SNPs fitted as the first GRM resulted in estimated  of 0.25 and 0.26  respectively  while the 50k SNPs fitted as the second GRM resulted in an  of about 0.70. Estimated  for stature between the DH and NZJ breeds  which can be interpreted as the correlation between the breeding values of individuals from the two breeds  are also in Table . With the MBSG model  in which a single GRM was fitted in a bivariate model   were higher when only the pre-selected SNPs (TOP or COJO8) were fitted in the model compared to when the 50k or 50k plus pre-selected SNPs were fitted. However  given the large standard errors of the   the differences in estimated  between the different GRM were not significant. With the MBMG model  estimated  resulting from the pre-selected SNP sets were significantly higher than those obtained with MBSG. For the TOP SNPs   increased from 0.41 when fitted alone in MBSG to 0.64 when fitted together with the 50k SNPs in MBMG. For the COJO8 SNPs   increased from 0.44 when fitted alone in the model  to 0.88 when fitted together with the 50k SNPs in MBMG. While the estimated  due to pre-selected SNPs increased when fitted simultaneously with the 50k SNPs in MBMG  the estimated  obtained for the 50k set did not change significantly  but tended to decrease compared to that obtained when the 50k SNPs were fitted alone in MBSG. In general  estimated  between breeds were much higher for the pre-selected SNPs than for the 50k or 50k plus pre-selected SNPs. The accuracy of GEBV for the NZJ bulls using single or multi-breed reference populations is shown in Fig. . When using a single GRM and a NZJ reference population (WBSG model)  accuracies of prediction were lower using the pre-selected marker sets (0.31 for the TOP and 0.34 for the COJO8 sets) than using the unselected 50k SNPs (0.43). Accuracy did not change by adding either the TOP or COJO8 SNPs to the 50k set. When using two separate GRM (WBMG model)  accuracies increased slightly compared to a single GRM  i.e. 0.46 when fitting the TOP and 50k SNPs in separate GRM  and 0.47 when fitting the COJO8 and 50k SNPs in separate GRM. Accuracy of predicting genomic breeding values (GEBV) for stature of New Zealand Jersey (NZJ) bulls from a reference population consisting of only NZJ or only Dutch Holstein (DH) or a combination of NZJ and DH bulls When using a single GRM and a DH reference population (ABSG model)  the highest prediction accuracies were obtained using the pre-selected marker sets  i.e. 0.27 when the TOP SNPs were fitted and 0.25 when the COJO8 SNPs were fitted. With the unselected marker sets (50k  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>TOP  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>COJO8)  accuracies were low (~<U+2009>0.14). When using two separate GRM (ABMG model)  accuracies were lower when fitting TOP and 50k SNPs in separate GRM (0.21) compared to the model with only the TOP SNPs fitted (0.27). Fitting COJO8 and 50k SNPs in separate GRM improved prediction accuracy slightly (0.27) compared to fitting only the COJO8 SNPs (0.25). When using a single GRM and combined reference population of DH and NZJ bulls (MBSG model)  prediction accuracies did not differ much from those obtained by using only NZJ in the reference population for the 50k  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>TOP and 50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>COJO8 sets. For the scenarios with pre-selected markers  accuracy of prediction increased compared to when only the Jersey bulls were included in the reference population. For the TOP and COJO8 sets  prediction accuracies increased from 0.31 to 0.32 and from 0.34 to 0.38  respectively  with a multi-breed reference population (MBSG) compared to only NZJ bulls (WBSG). When using two separate GRM in the MBMG model  prediction accuracies were always higher compared to the model with only one GRM or to the model with only NZJ in the reference population. For example  TOP and 50k GRM fitted in the MBMG model resulted in a prediction accuracy of 0.47  and COJO8 and 50k GRM fitted in the MBMG model resulted in an accuracy of 0.49. In the simulation study  a quantitative trait with an  of 0.8 was simulated in the DH and NZJ populations. The estimates of  are in Table . In general  estimated  were lower in NZJ than in DH  as was also observed for a real phenotype. With a simulated  of 1 for the trait in DH and NZJ  the unselected marker sets (50k  NON CAUSAL  ALL) captured almost the entire  in DH  ranging from 0.77 to 0.8  while these values were slightly lower in NZJ ranging from 0.71 to 0.76. The TOP SNPs resulted in an estimated  of 0.44 in DH and 0.38 in NZJ. Adding 150 randomly chosen non-causal SNPs  representing random noise  to the TOP (TOP<U+2009>+<U+2009>RN) set resulted in increased   i.e. 0.48 in DH and 0.44 in NZJ. When the TOP SNPs were fitted together with either the 50k or NON CAUSAL sets in MBMG  estimated  using the TOP SNPs decreased to 0.37 in DH and<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.30 in NZJ. The CAUSAL SNPs resulted in an estimated  of 0.8 in DH  both when fitted alone or together with NON CAUSAL SNPs. The NON CAUSAL SNPs resulted in an  of 0.76  when fitted with the CAUSAL SNPs. In general  there was no significant difference in the percentage of  captured between the scenarios with a simulated  of 1 and those with a simulated  of 0.5 or 0.25 (Table ). Estimated  using simulated phenotypes with a simulated  of 1 are also in Table . The estimated  obtained by fitting the CAUSAL GRM in MBSG was equal to 1. When all the SNPs (CAUSAL<U+2009>+<U+2009>NON CAUSAL) were fitted in MBSG  the estimated  was equal to 0.98 but decreased to 0.67 when only the 50k SNPs were fitted. When the TOP SNPs were fitted  the estimated  was equal to 0.85 and decreased to 0.77 when some 150 random noise SNPs were added to the TOP SNPs (TOP<U+2009>+<U+2009>RN). In general  estimates of  were more precise when the causal markers were isolated from the non-causal markers in a separate GRM (MBMG model)  but also when all the causal markers were present in the GRM. In general  estimated  were proportional to the simulated  (Table ). In the WBSG model  the unselected marker sets (50k  NON CAUSAL  and ALL) resulted in accuracies of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.60 (Fig. ). The TOP and TOP<U+2009>+<U+2009>RN sets also gave accuracies of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.60  although they consisted only of a fraction of the SNPs in the unselected marker sets. Except when fitting the CAUSAL SNPs in within-breed  single-GRM model  accuracies were significantly higher when two separate GRM were fitted simultaneously rather than those in which only a single GRM was fitted. Accuracy with standard errors of predicting the genomic breeding values (GEBV) of Jersey bulls from a reference population made of only Jersey or only Holstein or a combination of Holstein and Jersey bulls. Simulated genetic correlation between the breeds was 1 In the ABSG model  in which a DH reference population was used to predict NZJ GEBV  accuracies were much lower than those obtained in the within-breed single-GRM model for the unselected marker sets. However  accuracies were only slightly lower in ABSG for the TOP and TOP<U+2009>+<U+2009>RN SNP sets than those obtained in the within-breed single-GRM model. The only scenarios in which across-breed prediction outperformed within-breed prediction were the scenarios in which the CAUSAL SNPs were fitted in ABSG and the CAUSAL and NON CAUSAL SNPs were fitted simultaneously in ABMG  which reflects the larger reference population of DH than of NZJ and an  of 1. In general  across-breed prediction accuracies were by far higher when the pre-selected marker sets were used for prediction compared to when the unselected marker sets (50k  NON CAUSAL  and ALL) were used. Except when fitting the CAUSAL SNPs in ABSG  across-breed prediction accuracies were significantly higher with the ABMG model than with the ABSG model. Combining DH and NZJ bulls in the reference population to obtain NZJ GEBV (multi-breed prediction) resulted in slightly better prediction accuracies than when only NZJ were used in the reference population. As also observed with empirical phenotypes  the highest accuracies were obtained in MBMG  except in the unrealistic case that all causal SNPs could be identified with 100% accuracy and were all fitted in the MBSG model. Figures  and  show the prediction accuracies of the simulation with a  of 0.5 and 0.25 respectively  between DH and NZJ. In general  prediction accuracies of GEBV for the NZJ bulls were lower with a simulated  between DH and NZJ of 0.5 and 0.25 than with an  of 1  especially when only DH were included in the reference population. In almost all cases  accuracies were higher in scenarios in which two separate GRM were fitted simultaneously than those in which only a single GRM was fitted. One exception was when the CAUSAL GRM was fitted alone. In across-breed prediction  when only the DH reference population was used to obtain GEBV for NZJ  the accuracy of prediction was about 50% lower when the simulated  was 0.5 instead of 1 and 75% lower when the simulated  was 0.25 instead of 1. With a simulated  of 0.5 and 0.25  combining DH and NZJ in the reference population did not improve prediction accuracy compared to a reference population including only NZJ individuals  although the combined reference population was more than 10 times larger than the NZJ reference population. Accuracy with standard error of predicting the genomic breeding values (GEBV) of Jersey bulls from a reference population made of only Jersey or only Holstein or a combination of Holstein and Jersey bulls. Simulated genetic correlation between breed was 0.5 Accuracy with standard error of predicting the genomic breeding values (GEBV) of Jersey bulls from a reference population made of only Jersey or only Holstein or a combination of Holstein and Jersey bulls. Simulated genetic correlation between breed was 0.25 The objective of this study was to test the performance of a multi-breed  multi-GRM (MBMG) model in terms of estimated genetic parameters and accuracy of predicting GEBV of individuals from a numerically small population. The results of our analyses using both real and simulated phenotypes demonstrated the superiority of the MBMG model in terms of prediction accuracy in comparison with a single GRM fitted in within-  across-  and multi-breed prediction models. The MBMG model also outperformed a within-(WBMG) and across-breed (ABMG) GP model with two separate GRM fitted simultaneously. Three main distinguishing properties of MBMG are: (1) prioritisation of pre-selected functional markers over other types of markers  (2) use of the unselected markers to account for RGV_m in such a way that they do not dilute the effect of the pre-selected functional markers  and (3) appropriate weighting of information provided by each breed in the reference population by their  with the validation breed. Prioritisation of known QTL or pre-selected functional markers over other types of markers for the estimation of breeding values not an entirely new concept  and was already the main idea behind marker-assisted selection (MAS) [  ]. With MAS  pre-selected significant markers from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) are used to predict breeding values for a certain trait. One major pitfall of MAS for complex traits was that the pre-selected significant markers accounted for only a small fraction of the total genetic variance for the traits of interest []. As a result  there was little to no gain in using (only) MAS over phenotypic selection []  and therefore most applications have focussed on GP using many markers across the genome []. Even in this genomic selection era  a number of studies have advocated the prioritization of causal regions in GP models  especially as a result of the increasing availability and interest in the use of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data in breeding [  ]. For example  Brøndum et al. [] showed that when significant SNPs from a GWAS using WGS data are added to a low-density SNP panel (50k)  and used for GP  accuracy of within-breed prediction can be increased. Also  van den Berg et al. [] showed that adding SNPs that are near QTL peaks in a GWAS to a 50k panel improved the accuracy of within- and multi-breed GP as compared to the use of a 50k panel only. In the absence of additional markers  using only pre-selected markers has been shown to result in little or no advantage for within-breed GP []  which was confirmed in this study. In general  when we fitted only the pre-selected (TOP and COJO8) SNPs in a GP model and using real phenotypes  accuracies of within-breed GP were lower compared to when we fitted the unselected SNP sets (50k  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>TOP  50k<U+2009>+<U+2009>COJO8) (Fig. ). One reason could be that  for within-breed GP in which the training set is the same breed as the validation set  the unselected markers can still explain part of the genetic variance due to LD between markers and QTL that are not yet identified (Table ). Since long-range LD is present between markers and QTL within breed  it is less important to identify the true causal markers for within-breed GP. Across breeds  the LD phase between markers and QTL is not necessarily consistent [  ] Consequently  using non-causal markers that do not tag the QTL through LD  may result in poor across-breed GP accuracies  as was observed in this study for the unselected SNP sets and by others [    ]. This is mainly because the estimated effect of a non-causal marker is proportional to the extent of its LD with a QTL []. Thus  if LD phase between the non-causal marker and QTL is different between breeds  then the non-causal marker would have different estimated effects in different breeds  which is not accounted for in the prediction model. For across-breed GP  it is important to identify the QTL or markers close to QTL and use them for prediction []. Our results from the analyses of real and simulated phenotypes showed that when markers are pre-selected based on their causal effects and used for across-breed GP  the accuracy of prediction is significantly higher than when all markers  including non-causal or unselected markers are used. The obtained accuracies of across-breed GP agree with those of Saatchi and Garrick [] who found that across-breed genomic prediction resulted in accuracies close to 0  except for some traits due to the segregation of common large-effect QTL with conserved linkage phase among the different breeds. Pre-selection of markers based on their potential causal effect is not trivial []. This is especially the case when pre-selection of potential causal markers is carried out for traits with a complex genetic architecture within a single population using GWAS. In those situations  the power of GWAS methods to precisely identify the causative mutations for the traits of interest is hindered by the high relatedness between individuals  strong and long range LD between QTL and many non-causal markers within the genome  many QTL with very small effect sizes  low allele frequency of the QTL  and small sample size []. In the current study  we benefitted from the results of a large international meta-GWAS []  in which some of these limiting factors  such as small sample size  use of a single population  confounding effect of LD and family relationships were overcome by the use of multiple populations consisting of eight cattle breeds form different countries. Nevertheless  it is not guaranteed that all pre-selected SNPs are truly causal  but the ones that are not false positives are at least in high LD with and located close to the true causal loci. The large power in the meta-GWAS to identify the potential causal markers that we used in our study can probably explain the improved prediction accuracies in the across- and multi-breed GP scenarios using pre-selected markers. Another possible pitfall of pre-selection of markers based on the results of GWAS is the likely event of false positive findings. To investigate the effect of including random noise on prediction accuracy  our simulation study included a scenario (TOP<U+2009>+<U+2009>RN) in which 150 false positive SNPs were added to 133 causal SNPs. For across-  and multi-breed GP  our results showed very little to no effect of adding the random noise (53% of the SNPs) to the causal SNPs on prediction accuracy. When the non-causal markers outweigh very much the number of true causal markers in a set of markers  as was the case in the 50k scenario  accuracy of prediction becomes considerably lower than when using only the true causal markers. Also Wang et al. [] showed that reducing the number of non-causal markers from 12 000 to 1000 that were added to a set of 10 true causal markers resulted in higher prediction accuracy. In practise  a much lower proportion of false positive markers can be assumed  e.g. a 5% false discovery rate is commonly used. Our results showed that it is unlikely that pre-selected false positive markers (less than 53% of all pre-selected markers) will have a significant negative effect on prediction accuracy. In practice  pre-selected markers from a GWAS using whole-genome sequence data may not be found on the traditional 50k SNP chip. In order to use the pre-selected SNPs in routine genomic evaluations with the MBMG model  the pre-selected SNPs may have to be imputed in the populations of interest. However  some pre-selected SNPs  especially those with a low MAF  could be imputed with relatively low accuracy  which could  in turn  negatively impact the performance of the MBMG model. Still  the impact will most likely be small  given that  in general  SNPs with a low MAF explain only a small proportion of the genetic variance. One way that the imputation error of markers could be accounted for in GP is to use dosage scores rather than genotype calls  to calculate the GRM. A more practical solution for the breeding industry is to add known QTL or pre-selected SNPs to custom chips  as this will result in more accurate genotypes. The MBMG model uses the unselected markers to explain RGV_m that is not explained by the pre-selected markers. Thus  instead of fitting only the pre-selected markers  we fitted both pre-selected and unselected markers in two separate GRM  by using the multi-breed reference population. In this way  the model benefits from improved tagging of QTL by the pre-selected markers across breeds and  at the same time  benefits from additional genetic variance explained by the unselected markers within each breed. If all the QTL that underlie a trait are identified with 100% accuracy  there would be no need to include other markers in the prediction model  since the QTL could explain 100% of the genetic variance (the CAUSAL scenarios in our simulations). However  in practice it is unlikely to identify all the QTL for complex traits. For example  the top SNPs in the 163 QTL identified in the large meta-GWAS for stature explained only 13.8% of phenotypic variance for the trait []. This shows the importance of including multiple GRM in the MBMG model to maximise the proportion of total genetic variance explained within breed. Appropriate weighting of the information provided by each breed in the reference population by their  with the validation breed is an important feature of the MBMG model. Multi-breed GP can be implemented by simply pooling the information of different breeds in a univariate GP model  effectively assuming a  of 1 between the breeds in the reference population and between the reference and validation breeds. Assuming a  of 1 between breeds  especially between distantly related breeds such as Holstein and Jersey  can result in little to no advantage or even poorer prediction accuracies  as compared to a within-breed prediction model []. The MBMG model is a multi-trait model in which the phenotypes from different breeds are treated as those from different but correlated traits [  ]. The expectation is that multi-trait modelling only uses information from another breed that will improve accuracy or  in the worst case  will not affect the accuracy  but it will not decrease the accuracy either []. In the traditional multi-trait models used for multi-breed GP (MBSG)  an implicit assumption that is made is that  is the same across the entire genome. Due to differences in genetic background and breeding practices between breeds  traits might have evolved differently []. In such cases  it is expected that marker effects  including the effect of causal markers  have different covariance structures in the different breeds. In MBMG  we assumed that the  between breeds at the causal markers can be different from the  between breeds at the unselected markers. We believe that the assumption of different  for different regions in the genome is one of the factors that make MBMG superior to MBSG in both our empirical and simulation analyses (Figs.     ). In addition to accounting for the RGV_m  fitting a second GRM made from the unselected markers in MBMG allowed for a more precise estimation of the  between breeds at the pre-selected markers compared to fitting only the pre-selected markers in MBSG (Tables   ). For example  in the scenario with a simulated  of 1 between DH and NZJ  the estimated  at the TOP SNPs was 0.88 when only the TOP SNPs were fitted in the model (MBSG). However  by fitting the 50k GRM as a separate component in MBMG  the estimated  at the TOP SNPs was exactly 1  as simulated. The difference in the estimate of  at the pre-selected markers between MBSG and MBMG can probably be explained as follows: when the pre-selected markers are fitted alone in MBSG  they also explain RGV_m due to long-range LD within the breeds. However  when the pre-selected markers are fitted together with other markers in separate GRM (MBMG)  the pre-selected markers account for the genetic variance that is mainly due to the pre-selected markers  and the RGV_m is explained by other markers in the second GRM. The covariance between breeds (the numerator) at the pre-selected markers remains similar between both models (MBSG and MBMG)  since genetic covariance depends only on the conserved LD phase between breeds  which does not change between models (results not shown). Thus  the inflated genetic variance within breeds (the denominators) explained by the pre-selected markers in MBSG results in a lower estimated  at the pre-selected markers using MBSG than using MBMG. However  even in MBSG  we observed higher estimates of  at the pre-selected markers than at the unselected markers. This is because the precision of estimating  between breeds using markers depends on how accurately the marker-based relationships describes the relationships at the causal markers []. Hence  the estimated  is more precise for causal markers than for non-causal markers. The MBMG model follows a similar principle since it can be implemented in Bayesian models  for example  in the BayesRC method [] or the so-called multitask Bayesian learning model [  ]. Similar to MBMG  BayesRC incorporates prior biological knowledge in the prediction model by assigning different markers into different classes  for instance  a pre-selected marker class and unselected marker class  or even more classes. One of the differences between MBMG and BayesRC is that in MBMG  we assumed a priori that the effects of all markers in a certain class follow a normal distribution whereas in BayesRC  for each class of markers  there is a mixture of four normal distributions  which allows for pre-selected markers to have a large effect  an average effect  a small effect  or no effect (false positive). In addition to allowing for different effect sizes of markers and QTL as in BayesRC  the multitask Bayesian variable selection model for multi-breed GP allows for markers associated with a breed specific QTL to have a large effect in one breed and a small effect in another breed. Calus et al. [] showed that  compared to a multi-trait GREML model (MBSG) that assumes a single  across the genome  the multitask Bayesian variable selection model had similar accuracies of prediction for traits with a relatively high estimated  between Holstein and Jersey  but outperformed the MBSG model for traits with a very low estimated  between Holstein and Jersey. Our expectation is that Bayesian models will be more suited than MBMG for prediction of traits that are influenced by a few QTL with large effects and many additional smaller QTL  such as milk fat percentage with the  QTL. Otherwise  when traits are influenced by many QTL with small effects  we expect the MBMG and the Bayesian models to perform similarly. This is mainly because  in such case  the assumption of the GREML model that the effect sizes of QTL or markers linked to QTL follow a normal distribution holds. We presented a multi-breed multi-GRM model  MBMG  for genomic selection in numerically small breeds. The key features of MBMG are: (1) appropriate use of information on known QTL or pre-selected markers; (2) explanation of RGV_m by the unselected markers; and (3) use of the genetic correlation between reference and validation breeds to weigh the contribution of each breed in the reference population to the accuracy of prediction. Our proposed MBMG model can be applied to any case in which some form of prior information on markers exist  e.g. genome annotation information  experimental evidence  etc. By using this model  we are able to better combine information from numerically small and large breeds to improve prediction accuracy for the numerically small breed using both pre-selected and unselected markers. The MBMG model  together with the availability of whole-genome sequence data and accurate marker pre-selection strategies  can result in more accurate genomic prediction in numerically small breeds and thus improve their rate of genetic gain.

Our results revealed very few regions with significant dominance genetic effects across all the traits studied in the three datasets used. Regarding the SNPs that were detected with dominance associations  further investigation is needed to determine their relevance in crossbreeding programs assuming that dominance effects are the main cause of (or contribute usefully to) heterosis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer the opportunity to use available genotypes in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (50K; Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) to identify genomic regions that are associated with phenotypic variation in economically important traits in cattle [  ]. For several beef cattle traits  including feed efficiency  growth  carcass  and reproduction  the number of SNPs involved in their genetic variation and mapped to putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) has rapidly expanded [  ]. However  the genetic effects of the underlying QTL  which are captured by neighbouring SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  are generally modelled as additive effects []. The assumption of additivity in genetic evaluation models is made because the goal is to estimate breeding values for selection purposes. In reality  both additive and non-additive gene effects contribute to the total genetic variance for a given quantitative trait [  ]. One possibility to better understand and clarify the inheritance of complex traits is to decipher the contributions of non-additive gene effects including within-locus (dominance) and between-loci (epistasis) interactions. Few studies have investigated the importance of non-additive gene effects and these concluded that accounting for these effects in animal genetic evaluation models can improve genomic prediction in comparison to additive models [    ]. In beef cattle  thanks to the availability of genomic tools  attempts to estimate the proportion of the total phenotypic variation that is attributed to non-additive genetic effects for those traits that express heterosis [  ] have been made. For example  Bolormaa et al. [] estimated that the proportion of the variance explained by dominance ranged from 0 to 42% for growth  carcass  and fertility traits in beef cattle. In an earlier study  Akanno et al. [] reported estimates of the proportion of variance explained by dominance from 0 to 9% for growth and carcass traits in beef cattle. Both studies suggest that non-additive genetic effects may contribute to variation in beef cattle traits  which may be explained by specific loci across the bovine genome. Nevertheless  none of these studies evaluated the mode of inheritance and the magnitude of the non-additive effects across the genome. Here  we hypothesised that the non-additive genetic effects may be due to QTL with dominance  over-dominance or epistatic interactions  which are the suggested genetic mechanisms that underlie heterosis [        ]. Therefore  the objective of our study was to identify genomic regions or SNPs with simultaneously additive and non-additive effects that are associated with growth and carcass traits in beef cattle and to understand the mode of action of these associations. Data from 6796 multi-breed and crossbred beef cattle born between 1998 and 2012 were collated from various projects and research herds across Canada including: 3692 from the Phenomic Gap Project based at Lacombe Research Centre; 2350 from the University of Alberta’s Roy Berg Kinsella Research Ranch; and 754 from the University of Guelph’s Elora Beef Cattle Research Station. The population structure  breeds  and animal management were previously described in detail by Lu et al. []. Briefly  the whole dataset consisted of 968 Angus  572 Charolais  316 Hereford  17 Simmental  17 Limousine  1225 Angus-Hereford crossbred  484 Angus-Simmental crossbred  353 Charolais-Red Angus crossbred  1178 Kinsella composite  1105 Beefbooster TX composite  and 561 animals of other breed combinations. Kinsella composite is a dual-purpose hybrid that is strongly influenced by approximately 50% Hereford and 30% Angus breeds with 20% infusion of Holstein []. Beefbooster TX composite is predominantly Charolais-based (approximately 60%) with 40% infusion of other breeds including Holstein  Maine Anjou  and Chianina (). Phenotypic records including birth weight (BWT)  weaning weight (WWT)  pre-weaning daily gain (PDG)  average daily gain on feedlot (ADG)  yearling weight (YWT)  hot carcass weight (HCW)  back fat thickness (FAT)  rib eye area (REA)  marbling score (MBS)  lean meat yield (LMY) and yield grade (YG) were available. Yield grade was calculated according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) specification []. The data were edited to remove records with more or less 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean after correcting for systematic effects of sex  age of dam  data source  herd and year of birth. See Table  for details of number of animals with records  trait means and standard deviations. Pedigree data extending to purebred ancestors was available for all animals used in the study and assumed to be accurate. Pedigree records consisted of 11 905 individuals including 873 sires and 4483 dams across five generations. All animals with phenotype records were genotyped with the 50K SNP panel at Delta Genomics  Edmonton  AB  Canada. Quality control was performed to remove SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01  a call rate higher than 0.90 and that deviated significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium []. Missing genotypes were imputed using FImpute v2.0 []. In addition  two animals with a call rate lower than 90% were also removed  and only autosomal SNPs with a known genome position according to the UMD_3.1 bovine assembly map [] were used. After editing  42 610 SNPs and 6794 animals were used for the GWAS. Genomic breed fractions were predicted for all individuals using the ADMIXTURE software []. A ten-fold cross-validation procedure available in ADMIXTURE was performed to find the best possible  value with the smallest cross-validation error []  where  is the number of postulated ancestral populations. The resulting breed fractions at <U+2009>=<U+2009>6 identified six breed ancestries in the dataset including Angus  Hereford  Charolais  Kinsella Composite  Beefbooster TX Composite  and two- or three-way crossbreds. See Fig. 1 in Akanno et al. [] for the distribution of estimated genomic breed fractions in the whole dataset. The genomic breed fraction was used to designate animals as purebreds (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1467) based on having Angus  Hereford or Charolais breed fractions greater than 80% while the rest were designated as crossbreds (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5327). The same MAF threshold as that applied to the whole dataset was used to filter SNPs in the purebred and crossbred groups  which resulted in 42 270 and 42 536 SNPs  respectively  and these were used for GWAS in these two groups. Joint genome-wide association of additive and dominance SNP effects for weaning weight (WWT; left) and pre-weaning daily gain (PDG; right) evaluated in purebreds (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1467). The purebred group included individuals with more than 80% of Angus  Hereford and Charolais breed proportions  respectively. Significant SNPs were determined with a false discovery rate correction at 5% (red line) and 10% (blue line) In an earlier study []  assuming that heterosis is due to dominance and over-dominance  we investigated the contribution of additive and dominance effects to the total phenotypic variation in purebred  crossbred  and combined data  which underpins the motivation for the current study. Here  a single-SNP GWAS for the joint association of additive and dominance effects was performed on the studied traits in purebred  crossbred and combined data using the ASReml software [] based on the following linear mixed effect model: where  is a vector of phenotypic observation;  is the population mean and  is a vector of ones; depending on the trait analysed   is the design matrix that relates the fixed effects to the observation and  is a vector of fixed effects including linear covariates of dam age  weaning age  start age for feedlot test and genomic breed fractions  data source and contemporary groups based on herd  year  sex  and management groups. The genomic breed fractions were used for correction of possible population stratification and breed effects.  is a design matrix relating observations to random animal genetic effects;  is a vector of random additive polygenic effects that is assumed to be normally distributed as:   where  is the additive genetic variance and  is the additive relationship matrix constructed from pedigree data;  is a vector of SNP genotypes  coded as 0  1  and 2 for the number of a particular allele at the SNP;  is the allele substitution (additive) effect;  is a incidence vector of dominance coded as 1 for the heterozygous genotype () and 0 for the two homozygous genotypes ( and ) for each SNP;  is the dominance effect;  is a vector of random residual effects that is assumed to be normally distributed as   with  being an identity matrix. Vectors  and  were fitted as covariates. Random maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects were also fitted in the model for the analysis of pre-weaning traits (BWT  WWT and PDG). The GWAS model was parameterised to be able to test the significance of additive and dominance effects simultaneously at each SNP using the Wald F statistics available in the Asreml software []. As noted by Falconer and Mackay []  epistasis without the presence of dominance cannot cause heterosis by itself. Therefore  each of the SNPs with significant dominance effects identified in either the purebred  crossbred or combined data were tested for pair-wise epistatic interaction with the remaining SNPs across the genome using Model (2) and evaluated within the dataset in which the SNP was identified: where              and  are the same as in Model (1);  is a vector of the coded genotypes for one leading SNP with a significant dominant association;  is the allele substitution effect of the leading SNP;  is the vector of coded genotypes for one of the remaining SNPs across the genome;  is the allele substitution effect as above; () is a vector of element-wise multiplication of genotype codes representing the additive  additive interaction between one leading SNP and one of the remaining SNPs; and  is the epistatic interaction effects. The false discovery rate (FDR) [] implemented in the R package GenABEL [] was used to correct for multiple-testing. A maximum threshold of 10% for the genome-wide FDR was used to control for false positives and to declare associations as significant additive and dominance effects. The quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plots of the  values for each SNP were used to compare observed distributions of -<U+2009>log ( value) to the expected distribution under the null hypothesis for each trait. The Manhattan plots of  values for each SNP were also used to illustrate significant associations at the level of each chromosome and trait. All plots were completed using the R package qqman []. The SNPs with a significant dominance association identified from the GWAS analyses were mapped to their corresponding genes or near to the genes  i.e. at 100 kilo base pairs (kbp) on either side using NGS-SNP []  based on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [] and Ensembl Genome Browser [] databanks. The 100-kbp window was chosen because the average LD () between pairs of syntenic SNPs within this distance was around 0.20 in a related beef cattle population []. To determine the mode of action of SNPs with significant dominance effects  genotype effects were estimated according to Model (3): where          and  are the same as in Models (1) and (2);  is a vector of genotype class    and   i.e. the SNP genotype was fitted as a classification factor. The least square means of each genotypic class was determined and plotted to characterise the mode of action for significant associations with the traits of interest. Analyses were conducted in R statistical software using default package where applicable []. The number of significant SNPs with additive and dominance effects that were identified for growth and carcass traits in the purebred  crossbred and combined populations of beef cattle is in Table . At a FDR of 10%  14  294 and 369 significant additive associations were identified  while only 2  3 and 4 significant dominant associations were observed in purebred  crossbred and combined data  respectively (Table ). For both additive and dominance associations  the number of unique and significant SNPs identified was larger when using combined data than crossbred data and was much smaller with purebred data for all studied traits (Table ) and (see Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3). A representation of the Q–Q plots of the observed  values showed departures from the expected distribution under the null hypothesis of polygenic variation (see Additional file : Figures S1  S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10  S11 and S12) and the Manhattan plots that show the significant peaks for additive and dominance association for all studied traits and across the three datasets are in Figures S13 to S24 (see Additional file : Figures S13  S14  S15  S16  S17  S18  S19  S20  S21  S22  S23 and S24). Seven SNPs showed significant dominance effects for BWT  WWT  PDG  YWT and MBS across the three datasets at a FDR of 5 and 10% (Table  and Figs.     ). SNPs rs42779004  rs110704582  rs41596755  rs1090808526  rs29027109  rs110361335 and rs110564527 were identified in the purebred  crossbred and combined data. Two SNPs  rs110704582 and rs41596755 on BTA1 and 6 (BTA for  chromosome)  respectively  were associated with BWT. For WWT and PDG  two SNPs rs29027109 and rs42779004 on BTA3 and 21 showed significant pleiotropic dominance association for both traits. One SNP  rs109808526 on BTA4 was associated with YWT  while two SNPs  rs110361335 and rs110564527 on BTA4 were associated with MBS (Table ). The estimated effect of the minor allele ranged from 0.404 to 0.552 kg for BWT  from -<U+2009>4.016 to -<U+2009>0.361 kg for WWT  from -<U+2009>0.019 to -<U+2009>0.001 kg/d for PDG  -<U+2009>1.562 kg for YWT and from -<U+2009>8.023 to 8.315 for MBS  while dominance effects ranged from -<U+2009>0.942 to 1.012 kg for BWT  from 2.610 to 6.994 kg for WWT  from 0.016 to 0.037 kg/d for PDG  6.316 kg for YWT and from 13.88 to 15.37 for MBS (Table ). Six genes were mapped as putative candidates that underlie these associations (Table ). Two of the heterotic SNPs were located within an intron of the candidate genes  while four SNPs were in intergenic regions  and one SNP was not mapped to any known candidate gene (Table ). Joint genome-wide association of additive and dominance SNP effects for birth weight (BWT; left) and yearling weight (YWT; right) evaluated in crossbreds (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5327). The crossbred group included Kinsella composite  Beefbooster TX composite () and two and more way crosses involving Angus  Hereford  Charolais  Gelbvieh  Simmental  Limousin  and Piedmontese breeds. Significant SNPs were determined with a false discovery rate correction at 5% (red line) and 10% (blue line) Joint genome-wide association of additive and dominance SNP effects for weaning weight (WWT; left)  pre-weaning daily gain (PDG; center) and marbling score (MBS; right) evaluated in combined data (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6794). Significant SNPs were determined with a false discovery rate correction at 5% (red line) and 10% (blue line) The least square means of the genotypic classes are in Figs.     . SNP rs42779004  which was identified in the purebred data showed characteristics of over-dominance association with WWT and PDG  with genotypic values for the heterozygous individuals () being significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) higher than those for either of the two homozygotes ( and ) for both traits (Fig. ). SNPs rs41596755 and rs109808526  which were identified in the crossbred data  showed over-dominance association with BWT and YWT  respectively  while SNP rs110704582 showed characteristics of under-dominance for BWT since the heterozygotes had a lower birth weight than either of the homozygotes (Fig. ). The remaining SNPs rs29027109  rs110361335 and rs110564527 detected in the combined data exhibited over-dominance association with WWT  PDG and MBS because the least square means of heterozygotes were significantly (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) higher than those of either of the homozygotes across the three traits (Fig. ). Least square means for the genotypic class of significant heterotic SNPs on BTA21 associated with weaning weight and pre-weaning daily gain in purebreds. Purebred group included individuals with more than 80% of Angus  Hereford and Charolais breed proportions  respectively Least square means for the genotypic class of significant heterotic SNPs on BTA1  6 and 4 associated with birth weight and yearling weight in crossbreds. The crossbred group included Kinsella composite  Beefbooster TX composite () and two-way or more crosses involving Angus  Hereford  Charolais  Gelbvieh  Simmental  Limousin  and Piedmontese breeds Least square means for the genotypic class of significant heterotic SNPs on BTA3 and 4 associated with weaning weight  pre-weaning daily gain and carcass marbling score in combined data The numbers of additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>additive epistatic interactions between the seven leading significant dominant SNPs and the rest of the SNPs across the genome were examined for BWT  WWT PDG  YWT and MBS in the three datasets (Fig. ). At least one significant epistatic interaction was identified at a FDR of 10% for all leading SNPs (Fig. ). However  for MBS  290 significant epistatic interactions were found between the leading SNP rs110361335 (within the  gene) and the other SNPs. Similarly  the numbers of significant epistatic interactions between SNPs rs110564527  rs110704582  rs109808526  rs41596755  rs29027109 and rs42779004 with the other SNPs at a FDR of 10% were equal to 111  19  11  6  2 and 1 for MBS  BWT  YWT  BWT  PDG and PDG  respectively. Unfortunately  none of the identified SNPs showed a significant epistatic interaction for WWT. Pair-wise epistatic interaction between the leading significant dominant SNPs and the rest of the SNPs across the genome evaluated in purebred  crossbred and combined data. Only additive x additive interaction was tested. Significant interactions were determined by false discovery rate correction at 5% (red line) and 10% (blue line) Most of the studies on the genetic evaluation of beef cattle traits using genomic information have focused on the discovery or use of additive genetic effects [      ] because these genetic effects are passed from parents to offspring and are the basis of genetic selection and improvement programs. In the current study  many QTL regions with genome-wide significance for additive genetic effects were identified [see Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3]. For most of the traits studied  peaks for significant additive SNPs across the three datasets were on BTA6 followed by BTA7 and 14 (see Additional file : Figures S13  S14  S15  S16  S17 and S18)  which correspond to previously identified QTL [     ]. These additive SNPs can contribute to the process of building consensus beef cattle QTL effects and can also provide a starting point for mapping the underlying candidate genes. However  the motivation here was to identify and characterise QTL that are attributed to heterosis assuming a dominance model. Our results showed very few regions with evidence of significant dominance effects across all the traits studied in the three datasets used [see Additional file : Figures S18  S19  S20  S21  S22  S23 and S24]. The possible signals detected were associated with BWT  WWT  PDG  YWT and MBS (Table ) and peaks for significant dominance SNPs were on BTA1  3  4  6 and 21 (Figs.     ). The ability to identify QTL with large effects on any trait depends partly on the amount of trait variation that can be attributed to the different genetic sources. For example  in beef cattle  growth and carcass traits are moderately to highly heritable []  which results in the identification of several QTL with additive effects (see Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3). In the case of dominance and over-dominance  the percentage of phenotypic variation due to non-additive genetic effects for growth and carcass traits is small [    ]  which suggests that fewer dominance QTL may be identified. The results of our study indicate a lack of power in detecting heterotic QTL  which is also reflected by an even smaller proportion of dominance SNPs observed for the traits studied in an earlier study []. Furthermore  the rather small number of SNPs with significant dominance effects may be related to errors introduced by inconsistent LD across multiple populations [] and to the assumption that QTL effects are the same across multiple breeds. Nevertheless  our study demonstrates that dominance genetic effects may be polygenic (i.e. explained by multiple regions all with a small effect) for most growth and carcass traits of beef cattle. Most of the heterotic QTL identified in this study were associated with growth traits including birth weight  weaning weight  pre-weaning daily gain and yearling weight  which are known to express heterosis [   ]. Although  the genetic basis of heterosis is still a subject of scientific investigation  few studies have shown that dominance is an important factor contributing to heterosis [        ]  whereas epistasis has been implicated in other studies [    ]. As noted by Falconer and Mackay []  epistasis without the presence of dominance cannot cause heterosis by itself. Moreover  the power to estimate epistatic effects in segregating populations [] such as beef cattle populations may be low. Here  several peaks of significant epistatic interactions were associated with MBS followed by BWT  YWT and PDG (Fig. ) but none with WWT. In a similar approach  Bolormaa et al. [] observed a number of significant epistatic interactions for several beef cattle traits using 28 previously identified SNPs with additive effects. Therefore  epistatic interactions may have a role in the non-additive genetic variation of beef cattle traits  but this warrants further investigation. Growth traits such as birth weight  weaning weight  pre-weaning daily gain and yearling weight are economically important traits in beef cattle  which are traditionally included in the selection criteria of beef cattle breeding programs [] because they are moderately to highly heritable [] and are genetically correlated to carcass and meat quality traits []. Several QTL that underlie the variation of growth traits have been detected in several GWAS on different beef cattle populations (Table ) [      ]. SNPS were generally mapped to nearly all of the chromosomes  except BTA3  9  10 12  13  19  20 23  24 and 26 [  ] and were linked to several candidate genes that differed from those detected in the current study. These previous studies mainly considered additivity when evaluating effects of SNP genotypes. However  growth traits are known to express heterotic advantage [  ]  which suggests the implication of non-additive genetic effects  in particular dominance. To date  there is no record of an attempt to detect heterotic QTL for growth traits and to characterise the nature of this association. In this study  we identified two SNPs with significant dominance effects: rs110704582 and rs41596755 for BWT on BTA1 and 6  respectively. SNP rs110704582 is located in the intergenic region near the candidate gene   which is a known non-coding RNA involved in mRNA splicing  while SNP rs41596755 was not associated with any candidate gene. For WWT and PDG  two SNPs rs29027109 and rs42779004 on BTA3 and 21  respectively  were found to exhibit a pleiotropic effect on both traits  which is very likely due to the relationship between WWT and computation of PDG. SNP rs29027109 is located within an intron of the  gene  which encodes the ATP/GTP binding protein-like 4 []. This gene is not characterized in cattle. SNP rs42779004 is located in the intragenic region close to the gene ---  which encodes the microRNA 2888-1. This microRNA is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs []. In addition  for YWT  SNP rs109808526 on BTA4 was located in the intergenic region of the gene  at about 11 kbp. It encodes the replication initiator 1 protein  a zinc finger protein that plays a role in insulin sensitivity  body fat mass and lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of key genes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism []. As a further step  the modes of action of SNPs with significant dominance associations with growth traits were evaluated across the three datasets. In the purebred data  SNP rs42779004 showed characteristics of over-dominance association with WWT and PDG (Fig. )  which resulted in heterozygous calves at this locus having an earlier growth and a higher weight at weaning (251 kg) than either of the homozygous ones (241–248 kg). Unfortunately  this association was not observed in the crossbred or combined data. In the crossbred data  SNP rs110704582 exhibited under-dominance association with BWT (Fig. ) such that heterozygous calves at this locus had a lower BWT (41 kg) than either of the homozygous ones (42 kg). Consequently  a negative heterosis for BWT may be expected in crossbreds  assuming that dominance effects are the main cause of heterosis. This SNP may be useful if calves with a lower BWT are desired in order to decrease the incidence of dystocia. In addition  two SNPs rs41596755 and rs109808526 showed characteristics of over-dominance association with BWT and YWT in crossbreds (Fig. ) such that heterozygous individuals at these SNPs had a higher birth weight (43.7 kg) and yearling weight (360 kg) than either of the homozygous ones (41.5–42.7 kg for BWT and 356–359 kg for YWT). Therefore  depending on the breeding objective  selection at these loci may be useful for crossbreeding purposes in order to exploit hybrid vigour. In the combined data  one SNP rs29027109 also showed significant over-dominance association with WWT and PDG (Fig. ) such that heterozygous calves had an early growth and a higher weight at weaning (247 kg) than the homozygous ones (244–245 kg). Carcass marbling score (MBS) is an objective assessment of flecks of intramuscular fat evaluated at the 12th and 13th rib interface of the  muscle and is associated with the tenderness  flavor and juiciness of beef []. The greater the amount of marbling  the higher the quality grade of beef carcass. This trait is moderately to highly heritable and genetically correlated with most carcass traits [  ]. In a review by Williams et al. []  positive heterotic effects were observed for crosses involving taurine and indicine cattle breeds. Genome-wide association analyses for MBS identified a few additive SNPs on BTA3  5  15  16  18 and 25  that were associated with genes related to muscle development and lipid metabolism [    ]. In our study  we found two SNPs  rs110361335 and rs110564527  that showed over-dominance associations with MBS in the combined data such that heterozygous individuals at both loci had more carcass marbling than the homozygous ones (Fig. ). SNP rs110361335 on BTA4 is located within an intron of the  () gene  which is known to be associated with glucose regulation and type 1 diabetes in humans []  while SNP rs110564527 is located in the region near the candidate gene   which has no known association or characterization in cattle. Furthermore  several peaks of epistatic interactions were observed between SNPs rs110361335 and rs110564527 and the other SNPs. Because epistatic interactions were only tested for SNPs with significant dominance association  other important epistatic interactions between pairs of SNPs across the studied traits would not have been found. Therefore  interpretation of the extent of epistatic effects should be done with caution. However  the epistatic interaction between SNP rs110361335 and the other SNPs may be biologically plausible given that this SNP is located within the  gene  which has a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism []. Thus  it is necessary to investigate these SNPs in other populations to determine if their use in genomic selection would be beneficial in beef cattle crossbreeding program. In this work  we detected several SNPs with significant dominance (over or under) associations with growth and carcass marbling in multi-breed and crossbred beef cattle. The identified potential candidate genes within the vicinity of these SNPs (e.g. ---) need further investigation to determine their relevance for crossbreeding programs and their ability to predict heterosis.

Genetic improvement should aim at reducing the rate at which parasites spread across the farmed population. This rate is determined by the basic reproduction ratio  i.e.   which is the appropriate breeding goal trait. This study aims at providing a method to derive the economic value of .MethodsCosts of a disease are the sum of production losses and expenditures on disease control. Genetic improvement of  lowers the loss-expenditure frontier. Its economic effect depends on whether the management strategy is optimized or not. The economic value may be derived either from the reduction in losses with constant expenditures or from the reduction in expenditures with constant losses.ResultsWhen <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  the economic value of a further reduction is zero because there is no risk of a major epidemic. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and management is optimized  the economic value increases with decreasing values of   because both the mean number of parasites per host and frequency of treatments decrease at an increasing rate when  decreases. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and management is not optimized  the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reducing expenditures or losses. For sea lice in salmon  the economic value depends on a reduction in expenditures with constant losses  and is estimated to be 0.065€/unit /kg production.DiscussionResponse to selection for measures of disease prevalence cannot be predicted from quantitative genetic theory alone. Moreover  many studies fail to address the issue of whether genetic improvement results in reduced losses or expenditures. Using  as the breeding goal trait  weighed by its appropriate economic value  avoids these issues.ConclusionWhen management is optimized  the economic value increases with decreasing values of  (until the threshold of   where it drops to zero). When management is not optimized  the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reduced expenditures or production losses. For sea lice in salmon  the economic value is estimated to be 0.065 €/unit /kg production."

Genetic improvement should aim at reducing the rate at which parasites spread across the farmed population. This rate is determined by the basic reproduction ratio  i.e.   which is the appropriate breeding goal trait. This study aims at providing a method to derive the economic value of . Costs of a disease are the sum of production losses and expenditures on disease control. Genetic improvement of  lowers the loss-expenditure frontier. Its economic effect depends on whether the management strategy is optimized or not. The economic value may be derived either from the reduction in losses with constant expenditures or from the reduction in expenditures with constant losses. When <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  the economic value of a further reduction is zero because there is no risk of a major epidemic. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and management is optimized  the economic value increases with decreasing values of   because both the mean number of parasites per host and frequency of treatments decrease at an increasing rate when  decreases. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and management is not optimized  the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reducing expenditures or losses. For sea lice in salmon  the economic value depends on a reduction in expenditures with constant losses  and is estimated to be 0.065€/unit /kg production. Response to selection for measures of disease prevalence cannot be predicted from quantitative genetic theory alone. Moreover  many studies fail to address the issue of whether genetic improvement results in reduced losses or expenditures. Using  as the breeding goal trait  weighed by its appropriate economic value  avoids these issues. When management is optimized  the economic value increases with decreasing values of  (until the threshold of   where it drops to zero). When management is not optimized  the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reduced expenditures or production losses. For sea lice in salmon  the economic value is estimated to be 0.065 €/unit /kg production. Macroparasites  such as ticks  lice  and helminths  are a concern in livestock and aquaculture production worldwide. Macroparasites may reduce the wellbeing of the animals []  are transmitted from livestock to humans []  impose a threat to wild populations due to pathogen spillover from farmed animals [  ]  and induce economic costs in farming [  ]. Free range (outdoor) farming is particularly prone to macroparasites compared to indoor farming  because generally it provides more favourable conditions for parasites to complete their lifecycle  and thus the risk of infection from wild populations may be higher [  ]. The worldwide trend from free-range farming to indoor farming of monogastrics [] could have reduced parasite prevalence globally  while the opposite trend in farming conditions that occurs in some developed countries [] might increase parasite prevalence locally. For the same reasons that free-range farming is more prone to macroparasites than indoor farming  outdoor cage and pond aquaculture—the dominant forms of aquaculture—are likely to be more prone to macroparasites than indoor aquaculture. The prevalence of macroparasites is controlled by (1) preventive measures that minimize the risk of infection  inhibit the rate at which parasites spread  and interrupt the parasitic lifecycle  and (2) by treatment with drugs or other methods. Treatment efficacy tends to deteriorate over time as parasites often evolve drug resistance []. Because of the evolution of drug-resistant parasites and the stringent regulations on maximum residue limits for drugs  control of parasites is increasingly difficult []. The rate at which parasites evolve drug resistance is expected to increase as the frequency of treatments increases  and when treatment relies only on a few treatment mechanisms compared to a combination of various treatment mechanisms (e.g. drugs and temperature treatment). Based on the same principle  genetic improvement of farm animals may be more sustainable when selection is performed on many underlying loci with small effects compared to selection on a single quantitative trait locus with a large effect []. Nevertheless  both simulation studies [] and empirical evidence [] suggest that parasite evolution will not revert the effect of genetic improvement of livestock in the short term. Thus  genetic improvement of resistance to macroparasites in farm animals is a highly desirable addition to the repertoire of control measures. Genetic improvement should aim at reducing the rate at which parasites spread across the farmed population  and combined with the management strategy  this rate determines prevalence. This rate is determined by the basic reproduction ratio    which was previously proposed as the appropriate breeding goal trait for infectious diseases by Anche et al. []. For macroparasitic diseases   is defined as “the average number of offspring (female offspring in a dioecious species) that are produced throughout the reproductive lifespan of a mature parasite and that survive to reproductive maturity in the absence of density-dependent constraints on population growth” []  where density-dependent constraints refer to parasite density. In the absence of density-dependent constraints   is an “exponential” per parasite generation growth factor for the number of parasites per host.  has a threshold value of 1. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and density-dependent constraints are absent  the parasite population can grow. When   the parasite population declines after initial infection and no major epidemic can occur.  is a widely used parameter in epidemiology to describe macroparasitic infections using the definition above  and to describe microparasitic infections in e.g. a susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model. For both macro-and microparasitic infections   combines susceptibility  infectivity  contact rate  and recovery rate in a single parameter [  ]. Today  selection by breeding companies aims mostly at reducing susceptibility  while methods to estimate infectivity are being developed [  ]. Other traits of potential interest for genetic improvement include tolerance and resilience  and we discuss their relevance later in the paper. For optimal implementation in breeding programs  the economic value of  should be known. The economic value of a trait is a linear approximation of the change in farm profit due to a one unit change in the trait from its current value []. Economic values are needed to maximize economic gain. However  no method has been developed for the derivation of the economic value of  for macroparasites  or alternatively for the derivation of economic values of susceptibility and infectivity. This study presents a method for the derivation of the economic value of  for macroparasitic diseases. The method is specific to macroparasites that are the causative pathogen. It does not apply to macroparasites that act as a vector of microparasitic diseases  such as Lyme disease  because the transmission dynamics are different and production losses are determined by the microparasite rather than the macroparasite. First  we describe the effect of improvement in  on farm profit via reduced production losses and/or reduced expenditures. Then  we consider these effects for situations where management is or is not optimized. We determine the effect of improvement of  when expenditures or losses are kept constant and provide algebra to derive the economic value. A numerical example is provided for illustration  and we apply the method to find the economic value of  for sea lice in Atlantic salmon. Finally  we discuss implications and limitations of the method. The economic value of  is a linear approximation of the change in farm profit due to a one unit change in  from its current value: To derive the economic value  we are interested in the change in profit per unit change in   rather than in its absolute level. Because a reduction in  increases farm profit  the economic value is negative. However  for presentation purposes  we shall ignore the minus sign in the economic value throughout the remainder of the text. Costs of livestock diseases are the sum of production losses () and expenditures on control () [].  are reduced revenues  e.g. due to decreased productivity or reduced product quality  and  are costs of treatment and prevention. The loss-expenditure frontier gives the minimum level of  for any level of   both expressed in monetary units.  decreases when  increases  because expenditures on disease control reduce production losses. The sum of  and  takes a concave shape. Figure a shows the hypothetical loss-expenditure frontiers for two values of . For any given frontier  the value of  is constant. All farmers operate on or above the loss-expenditure frontier. In economics  farmers that operate on the frontier are referred to as “efficient”  while farmers that operate above the frontier are not. Different levels of  reflect differences in disease control management. Some farmers may choose to have a low  and incur a relatively high  as a consequence  whereas other farmers may choose for a high  and incur a relatively low . Farmers that operate at the level of  at which costs are minimum are at the economic optimum. The economic optimum is reached when the sum of  and  is minimal. At this optimum  the sum of  and  does not change with a marginal change in :  or equivalently . Genetic improvement of  lowers the loss-expenditure frontier and thereby reduces     or both  for farmers that are efficient both before and after genetic improvement. Here  we focus on the economic value of  for efficient farmers; benefits for inefficient farmers depend on how they capitalize on genetic gains.

Green arrow: reduction in losses and expenditures when moving from optimum  to optimum   blue arrow ending in : reduction in expenditures at constant losses  red arrow ending in : reduction in losses at constant expenditures In livestock genetic improvement  it is common to derive economic values in the context of optimized management  because improvement of management is generally easier to achieve than genetic improvement. The management variable  is a function of   and  and  together determine . Thus   should be at the economic optimum before genetic improvement []  which results in the optimum level of L. The optimum before genetic improvement is at point  in Fig. b. Following improvement of   the initial optimum  will move to a new optimum ' between points  and . For a small (infinitesimal) improvement in   the new loss-expenditure frontier between points  and  can be approximated linearly by . Thus  the sum of  and  when moving from the initial optimum  to any point on the lower frontier between  and  is constant. Moving to any point between  and  on the lower frontier therefore gives the same cost reduction. When  is optimized before genetic improvement  the economic value () may be derived either as the partial derivative of  with respect to  while  is held constant: or as the partial derivative of  with respect to  while  is held constant: For an infinitesimal change in   both methods give the same result as when moving from the optimum level of expenditures (point ) before genetic improvement to the optimum level of expenditures (point ) after genetic improvement. According to neoclassical economic theory  with no constraints on either  or   farm management converges to the economic optimum strategy. However  in reality farmers may constrain either  or  for non-economic reasons or for economic reasons that are not apparent from the costs of the disease. For example  farmers may keep  at a constant level below its optimum  because of restrictions on the use of antibiotics. Conversely  farmers may keep  above its optimum  because a minimum frequency of treatments is enforced by legislation. Similarly  farmers may keep  below its optimum for animal welfare reasons. Thus  it may be relevant to derive the economic value for a situation where management is not optimized  and where the deviation from the optimum originates from constraints on either  or . In other words  constraints on either  or  may push farmers to operate at a suboptimum level of . Here  we assume that these constraints will remain after genetic improvement. When  is constrained either below or above its optimum  genetic improvement of  will reduce  while  is kept constant. For this scenario  the economic value can thus be derived as the reduction in  per unit change in  while  is kept constant (Eq. )  denoted by the red arrow in Fig. b. When  is constrained below its economic optimum  as in the animal welfare example  genetic improvement of  will reduce  while  is kept constant. For this scenario  the economic value can thus be derived as the reduction in  per unit change in  while  is kept constant (Eq. )  denoted by the blue arrow in Fig. b. We consider situations where  is constrained above its optimum as irrelevant  because we cannot think of a realistic example. Note that in the antibiotics example  the level of  is above its optimum  but this follows from a constraint on  rather than   and improvement of R will reduce  with constant . When expenditures are kept constant  the economic value follows from Eq. . Thus  in this case  we need to express  as a function of .  has been broadly defined as production losses but is defined more specifically as lost production due to parasites  which equals the deviation of the actual production in the presence of parasites relative to the production that would have been achieved in the absence of parasites. In our definition   is independent of the production level itself. Here  we assume that  is linearly related to the mean number of parasites per host []. Hence  production losses per host per parasite are assumed constant. This assumption implies that given the mean  variation in the number of parasites per host within the herd and over time can be ignored when deriving the economic value. Thus  to define  as a function of   we need to define the mean number of parasites per host as a function of . We assume that minimum and maximum numbers of parasites in animal production are controlled within such a narrow range that the growth of the number of parasites per host within this range is exponential and can be described by the growth factor per parasite generation  . Thus  when <U+2009>><U+2009>1  the number of parasites per host grows exponentially over time until treatment is applied. We assume that treatment reduces the number of parasites per host to a fixed minimum  i.e. . Because a single treatment involves a fixed expenditure  the interval between treatments remains constant when  is kept constant  such that the number of parasite generations between two treatments also remains constant. This implies that  for a given  and a given number of parasite generations between treatments  the mean number of parasites per host between treatments is determined by . The transition of one production cycle to the next may affect the number of parasites per host. The relative importance of this effect is diluted when the length of a production cycle is long compared to the period between treatments. Here  we assume that the mean number of parasites per host over the total length of a production cycle can be approximated by the mean number of parasites per host between two treatments. Because  is proportional to the mean number of parasites per host over the length of a production cycle   can be expressed as a function of . The corresponding algebra is provided below. Let  be the minimum number of parasites per host and  the number of parasite generations between two treatments. The number of parasites per host () over parasite generations () is a function of  as: The mean number of parasites per host over a period of  generations between treatments is: which increases with  and . Note that <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>. Let  be the length of a production cycle in parasite generations  and  the mean number of parasites per host over period . We assume that   which allows us to ignore the effect of the transition from one production cycle to the next. Thus   is approximated by . Let  be the production losses (e.g. in euro) per host per parasite present over a period of  parasite generations. The change in the level of a production trait per parasite is known as tolerance or the slope of a reaction norm  and is the linear regression of the production trait on the number of parasites per host []. Thus   is defined as: where  is the slope of the reaction norm of production trait   and  is the economic value of production trait . Under these assumptions   per host is a function of : From Eqs.  and   it follows that: Equations  and  give the economic value of  when expenditures are kept constant. When losses are kept constant  the economic value follows from Eq. . Thus  in this case we need to express  as a function of . Here  we assume that the only expenditures on disease control that change with  consist of treatment costs. In the Discussion section  we show that partitioning  into costs of treatment and prevention is irrelevant for the outcome. Thus  in the remainder of the paper   will refer to expenditures on treatment. We assume that  is linearly related to the number of treatments per production cycle with constant expenditures per treatment. The number of treatments per production cycle equals the length of a production cycle divided by the period between treatments. To keep  constant  treatment must be applied when the number of parasites per host reaches a fixed maximum value. Thus  the period between treatments equals the time needed for the number of parasites per host to grow from its minimum just after treatment to the value at which treatment is applied. This means that the period between treatments is no longer fixed but has become a function of parasite growth rate  i.e. . In other words  improvement of  increases the period between treatments and decreases . The corresponding algebra is provided below. Let  be expenditures per treatment  and  the number of parasites per host when treatment is applied. From Eq.  it follows that  for given values of  and   the period between treatments () in parasite generations is: The number of treatments per production cycle of  parasite generations equals   from which it follows that: which gives  as function of . From Eqs.  and   it follows that: which gives the economic value of  when losses are kept constant. A numerical example with hypothetical loss-expenditure frontiers is provided to illustrate the economic effect of genetic improvement of  (Fig. ). The loss-expenditure curves are created by calculating  from Eq.  and  from Eq.  using the input parameters in Table . Red arrows (pointing downwards) illustrate reductions in  with constant   and blue arrows (pointing leftwards) illustrate reductions in  with constant . Loss-expenditure frontiers used in the numerical example. Red arrows (pointing downwards): reductions in losses with constant expenditures  blue arrows (pointing leftwards): reductions in expenditures with constant losses  green dots: optimum levels of expenditures Figure  shows that when the level of  is optimized before genetic improvement  the lengths of the red and blue arrows are similar. Those lengths are identical for a marginal change in . For the loss-expenditure frontier where   the optimum frequency of treatment is once per 5.84 parasite generations (). The economic value may be calculated either from the reduction in  with constant  (Eqs.  and ): or from the reduction in  with constant  (Eq. ): As expected  both methods give identical results. Relative differences in the lengths of the arrows in Fig.  are proportionate to relative differences in economic values  and depend on the value of  and the management strategy. The management strategy may be to adopt the optimum level of   or to reduce  while  is kept constant  or to reduce  while  is kept constant. When the level of  is optimized before genetic improvement  the lengths of the red and blue arrows increase when  decreases  thus the economic value increases when  decreases. When  is kept constant  the length of the red arrows decreases when  decreases  thus the economic value decreases when  decreases. When  is kept constant  the length of the blue arrows increases when  decreases  thus the economic value decreases when  decreases. To illustrate these patterns  the economic value of  is plotted as a function of the value of  for the different management strategies (Fig. ). Note that the economic value itself does not completely determine economic gain. Economic gain due to genetic improvement is the product of the economic value and genetic gain in . The latter is expected to decrease with decreasing . Economic values for a range of values for  for different management strategies in the numerical example. Black line: optimized expenditures  red line: constant expenditures of €6  dashed red line: constant expenditures of €15  solid blue line: constant losses of €3.4  dashed blue line: constant losses of €5.3. Points       and  are where a strategy with optimized expenditures results in the same economic value as strategies with constant expenditures or constant losses. Note that the minus sign in the economic value is ignored for presentation purposes The black line in Fig.  gives the economic value when  is optimized  and shows that the economic value increases when the value of  decreases. The economic value increases because both the mean number of parasites per host and the frequency of treatments decrease at an increasing rate when  decreases (see Additional file : Fig S1). The solid red line in Fig.  gives the economic value when  is held constant at a level of €6  corresponding to the three red arrows on the left in Fig. . The dashed red line gives the economic value when  is held constant at a level of €15  corresponding to the three red arrows on the right in Fig. . Both red lines show that  when  is kept constant  the economic value decreases as  decreases. Note that when  is kept constant  the economic value is higher at lower levels of  and decreases faster with decreasing values of . The solid red line intersects the black line at point  where . At point  both economic values are equal  which implies that a level of  at €6 is optimum for a  value of 1.26. Because the optimum level of  decreases when the value of  decreases (Fig. a)  the given level of  (€6) is above the optimum for   whereas it is below the optimum for . Similarly  the dashed red line intersects the black line at point  where   thus a level of  at €15 is optimum for a  value of 2.16. Thus  the given level of  (€15) is above the optimum for   whereas it is below the optimum for . The economic value when  is kept constant below its optimum is higher than the economic value when  is optimized  while the economic value is lower when  is kept constant above its optimum. The solid blue line in Fig.  gives the economic value when  is held constant at a level of €3.4  corresponding to the three blue arrows at the bottom of Fig. . The dashed blue line gives the economic value when  is held constant at a level of €5.3. Both blue lines show that  when  is kept constant  the economic value increases when the value of  decreases. The solid blue line intersects the black line at point  where . At point  both economic values are equal  which implies that a level of  at €3.4 is optimum for a  value of 1.19. Because the optimum level of  decreases when the value of  decreases (Fig. a)  the given level of  (€3.4) is above the optimum for   whereas it is below the optimum for . Similarly  the dashed blue line intersects the black line at point  where   thus a level of  at €5.3 is optimum for a  value of 1.60. Thus  the given level of  (€5.3) is above the optimum for   whereas it is below the optimum for . We consider the parts of the blue lines that are below the black line as irrelevant  because for these situations the economic value should follow from the reduction in  with constant  instead. The economic value when  is kept constant below its optimum is higher than the economic value when  is optimized. To summarize the above  we can consider the following scenarios. When management is optimized  the economic value increases as  decreases (black line). When  is held constant above its optimum  the economic value is lower than when management is optimized. When  is held constant below its optimum  the economic value is higher than when management is optimized. When  is held constant below its optimum  the economic value is higher than when management is optimized. A practical implication for continued genetic improvement may be that the management strategy shifts from a strategy where either  or  is held constant (red or blue lines) to the optimum strategy (black line). For example  management may operate under a constraint on   due to which  cannot exceed €6. At first when  is larger than 1.26 (right of point )  management may reduce  while  is kept constant in response to genetic improvement. At some point (left of point )   may become smaller than 1.26  and management can adopt the optimum level of   which will be below €6. Thus  in this example the economic value would first decrease following the solid red line in Fig. . As from when  (point )  it would increase following the black line. Similarly  management may operate under a constraint on   due to which  cannot exceed €3.4. In this case  the economic value would first increase following the blue line. As from when  (point )  it would increase following the black line. Sea lice are one of the major challenges in Norwegian salmon aquaculture. To protect wild salmon populations from infection by farmed salmon  sea lice numbers on farmed salmon are controlled by legislation. Treatment is obligatory when juvenile or adult female lice numbers exceed a threshold. Expenditures on treatment have been estimated at €0.087/treatment/kg production []. Ironically  treatment also induces production losses  which may even exceed production losses induced by lice themselves. Production losses induced by treatment include an elevated mortality and increased feed conversion ratio during and shortly after treatment. Total production losses induced by treatment have been estimated at €0.040/treatment/kg production []. Thus  each treatment involves a cost of €0.127/treatment/kg production. Moreover  current sea lice problems limit the expansion of the salmon farming industry in Norway. Solving these problems by genetic improvement of  might increase production in the long run  which would further increase benefits of selection for R. However  a detailed treatment of this issue is outside the scope of this paper. To derive the economic value  we assume that the level of expenditures is above the economic optimum and that genetic improvement of  reduces the frequency of treatments  while losses induced by lice are kept constant. For simplicity  a threshold for treatment on adult female lice only is considered here. Treatment efficacy is 95% []  hence  is 20. On average  salmon are treated 2.4 times per year []. A production cycle lasts about 500 days followed by a 60-day fallowing period. Thus  the average number of treatments per production cycle is 560/365 · 2.4<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.7. The generation interval of sea lice is about 70 days []  hence  generations   generations  and  (Eq. ).  is €0.127/treatment/kg production. The economic value is (Eq. ): We can use this value to quantify the economic importance of genetic improvement of  for sea lice to the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry. Consider  for example  the effect of one genetic standard deviation reduction in . Selection against sea lice is generally based on dedicated and controlled challenge tests. Challenge tests are preferred over natural infections  because they allow standardization of testing protocols and avoid confounding affects when a subset of the challenged population have already acquired some degree of immunity due to prior exposure []. In a challenge test  fish are exposed to a high dose of copepodids (juvenile sea lice) and lice count per fish is recorded shortly after lice attachment. Part of the variation in lice count is determined by variation in skin surface area  which can be corrected for by using the allometric relation between body weight and skin surface area. The resulting trait is termed lice density []. Remaining variation in lice density is assumed to be explained by variation in susceptibility among individuals. First  consider the case with genetic variation in susceptibility only. In this case  genetic variation in  is proportional to genetic variation in susceptibility  which in turn is proportional to genetic variation in lice density. Thus  in this case breeding values for  can be inferred directly from a challenge test. The genetic coefficient of variation of lice density is about 0.35 []. Thus  one genetic standard deviation improvement gives a 35% improvement in   corresponding to 0.35 · 4.7<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.6 units . Using the economic value of  derived above  this improvement is expected to reduce expenditures on treatment by 1.6 · 0.065<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11 €/kg production. For comparison  in 2017 the farm gate price of salmon was about €6.30/kg []. For the whole of Norway with a salmon production of 1.23 million tons []  one standard deviation improvement in  corresponds to a cost reduction of about 130 million €. In comparison  the expenditures on treatment and production losses induced by treatment combined are 380 million € []. The above analysis ignored genetic variation in infectivity among individuals. However  the result changes only when infectivity and susceptibility are genetically correlated; in the absence of such a correlation  selection for lice density does not yield a correlated response in infectivity. We might hypothesize that susceptibility and infectivity are positively correlated  because the same host-defence mechanisms may underlie these traits. For worm infections in sheep  for example  Kemper et al. [] found that worm fecundity was reduced in sheep selected for low faecal egg count compared to a control line  where worm fecundity may be interpreted as a proxy for infectivity. A positive genetic correlation implies that selection for lower susceptibility via a challenge test induces a favourable correlated response in infectivity. Because susceptibility and infectivity have multiplicative effects on  []  the response in  will then be more than proportionate to the response in susceptibility  and the benefits for industry will be larger than the figures presented above. To fully benefit from genetic variation in infectivity  breeding value estimation could be extended to include also infectivity  and estimated breeding values (EBV) of  can be obtained by combining EBV for susceptibility and infectivity []. Estimation of breeding values for infectivity is challenging  but methods for that purpose have been developed [  ]. This study presents a method for the derivation of the economic value of  for macroparasitic diseases. Economic values  even when imperfect []  would improve the economic effectiveness of breeding programs. When <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  there is no risk for a major epidemic thus the economic value is zero. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and management is optimized  the economic value increases when  decreases  because both the mean number of parasites per host and the frequency of treatments decrease at an increasing rate when  decreases. Such an increase in economic value when  decreases may be counter intuitive  because a decrease in  will lower the sum of production losses and expenditures. However  the total costs of a disease are not a good proxy for the avoidable costs per unit genetic improvement of . In line with these results  it is well-known in epidemiology that the effectiveness of vaccination programs increases when  decreases []. When <U+2009>><U+2009>1 and management is not optimized  the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for a reduction in expenditures or a reduction in production losses. When management is not optimized and  or  is held constant below its optimum  the economic value is higher than in optimized management. When management is not optimized and  is held constant above its optimum  the economic value is lower than in optimized management. Because the relation between  and farm profit is non-linear (Fig. )  the economic value should be updated regularly for its actual value of  []. For practical implementation in breeding programs  some directions are provided in the example on sea lice and in Anche et al. []. Although the aim of genetic improvement should not be to compensate for management inefficiencies []  farmers may not always be able to operate under optimized management. For example  strict regulations on drug use apply in organic production []. Such regulations may constrain expenditures  forcing farmers to operate at a below optimum level of expenditures with relatively high losses. Genetic improvement would then reduce losses while expenditures are kept constant. In the example of sea lice in Norwegian salmon aquaculture  parasite numbers per host are constrained below the optimum  forcing farmers to operate at an above optimum level of expenditures with relatively low losses. In this case  genetic improvement reduces expenditures while losses are kept constant. The example also illustrates that genetic improvement is unlikely to reduce the infective pressure of sea lice on wild fish stocks in the short term  because mean lice numbers will not decrease when genetic improvement leads to a reduction in expenditures on treatment. When losses are kept constant  the economic value of  is derived from the reduction in expenditures. We assumed that expenditures for disease control consist of treatment costs only  but in reality they may also include preventive measures. In case of sea lice  preventive measures that reduce the overall infective pressure of lice may include the use of cleaner fish  lice skirts  and lasers. Here  we will show that the reduction in expenditures on treatment is equal to the reduction in the sum of expenditures on treatment and expenditures on preventive measures. Let  be the sum of expenditures on treatment () and expenditures on preventive measures (). On the loss-expenditure frontier  the balance between  and  is optimum by definition  otherwise the level of  would be above the frontier. For any   we could hypothesize an underlying <U+2009>-<U+2009> frontier. The level of  on the loss-expenditure frontier equals the sum of  and  at the point on the <U+2009>-<U+2009> frontier where . Starting at this point  improvement of  may reduce  while  and  are kept constant or it may reduce  while  and  are kept constant. For an infinitesimal improvement in   the new <U+2009>-<U+2009> frontier between these points can be approximated linearly by   hence  is constant between these points. Thus  based on the same reasoning as before  the economic value may be derived as the partial derivative of  with respect to   while  and  are held constant. This mathematical argument allows us to ignore the complex relation between expenditures on preventive measures and . Another way to approach the issue is by considering a three-dimensional loss-expenditure frontier  where one axis represents production losses  one axis represents expenditures on treatment  and the third axis represents expenditures on preventive measures. We have ignored the axis on preventive measures based on the mathematical grounds given before  but we expect that the surface of the frontier is rather flat in this direction. We expect preventive measures to be a relative attractive control option compared to treatment  such that expenditures on preventive measures are not so responsive to genetic improvement of . For example in case of sea lice  we would expect farmers to reduce rather the number of treatments than the use of cleaner fish. Still genetic improvement may lead to changes in expenditures on preventive measures that affect the value of . Because  in this study  the method to derive the economic value ignores the effect of genetic improvement on preventive measures that affect   the value of  may not improve as much as expected. The estimated value of  should therefore be evaluated regularly and the economic value should be updated accordingly. In this study  the economic value of  includes production losses due to disease. However  the breeding goal usually also includes yield as a trait. This introduces the risk of double-counting of production losses due to disease  which occurs when they are counted via the products of economic values and EBV of both  and yield. To avoid double-counting  one might restrict the economic value of  to expenditures on disease control  and include production losses due to disease in the economic value of yield. However  the economic value of yield would then include a non-linear component for production losses due to changing dynamics of disease transmission (Eq. ) and a linear component for yield independent of production losses  which seems non-trivial. Furthermore  the effect of genetic improvement on management via reduction in losses or expenditures becomes unclear. These issues are resolved in the current study  where the economic value of  includes production losses. As a consequence  we have to define yield to refer to individuals experiencing equal production losses due to disease (e.g. in the absence of disease). For the derivation of selection index weights and for prediction of the response to selection  it is essential that trait definitions agree between the breeding goal  the selection index  and the breeding value estimation. Thus  if the breeding goal includes  (including production losses) and yield at equal production losses  then the selection-index weights and EBV should also refer to those same traits. Ideally  this is achieved by separate recording of phenotypes for production traits on animals that have equal production losses  while phenotypes to estimate breeding values for  are recorded on a different group of animals. This situation is common in salmon breeding programs  where production traits are recorded in commercial conditions with small (and therefore similar) numbers of lice per fish  while susceptibility to sea lice is recorded in dedicated challenge tests. When phenotypes for production traits and phenotypes to estimate breeding values for  are recorded instead on the same animals  phenotypes for production traits will include production losses. In sheep  for example  faecal egg count is recorded together with live weight on sheep maintained on infected pastures. Susceptible sheep have a relatively high faecal egg count and thus a lower live weight. To avoid double-counting of production losses in such a situation  the number of parasites per host may be included as a covariate in the linear model used for breeding value estimation for production traits. Using this approach  Bishop  et al. [] estimated the slope of the regression of live weight on log-transformed faecal egg count to be -<U+2009>1.28 kg/ln (faecal egg count). In addition to   other disease-related traits of potential interest for genetic improvement include tolerance and resilience. Tolerance is defined as an animal’s ability to cope with the effects of infection []. The economic importance of tolerance depends highly on disease status  which is determined by the value of . Tolerance may be included in the breeding goal in addition to   but the derivation of its economic value is beyond the scope of this study. Resilience is defined as an animal’s productivity in the face of infection []  which is some sort of aggregate measure of   tolerance  and production traits. As explained above  it does not seem wise to combine such different traits in a single measure. A few other studies have attempted to derive economic values for macroparasitic disease traits  and some principles were discussed in general terms by Woolaston and Baker []. Woolaston and Baker [] consider frequency of treatments and production losses as two separate and mutually exclusive breeding goal traits for macroparasitic diseases. Instead  we consider frequency of treatments and production losses as different management strategies that result from the underlying trait . We have shown that both frequency of treatments (expenditures) and production losses may decrease in response to genetic improvement of  when management is optimized. Including only one of these management variables as a trait in the breeding goal excludes the relevant scenario of optimized management. Bishop and Stear [] demonstrated that the selection response for measures of disease prevalence cannot be predicted from quantitative genetic theory alone  because quantitative genetic theory disregards the underlying dynamics of disease transmission determined by . Their findings are in agreement with the non-linear relations between  and the number of parasites at any given time (Eq. )  and between  and the mean number of parasites between treatments (Eq. ). Similarly  the response in frequency of treatments cannot be predicted from quantitative genetic theory alone  due to the non-linear relation between  and frequency of treatments (Eqs.  and ). The economic value may compensate for this bias in the predicted selection response resulting in the appropriate emphasis on the breeding goal trait  as in Amer et al. [] for faecal egg count in sheep. In contrast  when  is the breeding goal trait  the response to selection can be predicted from quantitative genetic theory only []  such that the product of the response in units  combined with the economic value of  gives a direct prediction of the economic response to selection. Gharbi et al. [] used an epidemiological model to describe the relation between genetic improvement and frequency of treatments for sea lice in salmon  but we have not been able to replicate their results. Lobo et al. [] derived the economic value of the number of anthelmintic doses used per year for sheep. Bishop et al. [] derived the economic value of faecal egg count for sheep from its negative effect on live weight. Neither Lobo et al. [] nor Bishop et al. [] explicitly considered whether genetic improvement would reduce production losses  expenditures  or both and neither of these studies considered that quantitative genetic theory fails to predict the response to selection for these traits. These issues would be resolved if  was used as the breeding goal trait for which the economic value can be derived with the method outlined in this paper. This study presents a method for the derivation of the economic value of  for macroparasitic diseases. When management is optimized  the economic value increases with decreasing values of  (until the threshold of   where it drops to zero). When management is not optimized  the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reduced expenditures or production losses. For sea lice in salmon  the economic value is estimated to be 0.065 €/unit /kg production.  Throughout the text  the minus sign in the economic value is ignored for presentation purposes.

This suggests that the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in a litter is a suitable indirect measure of uterine capacity for inclusion in breeding programmes that aim at reducing IUGR in piglets and improving piglet survival. The antagonistic life-history trade-off between litter size and offspring size [   ] originates from the allocation of limited maternal reserves  i.e. energy  nutrients  and abdominal space available for offspring []. In polytocous livestock species  litter size is studied in order to increase prolificacy  which is the result of complex interactions between male  female  and embryo genotypes []  although genetic or permanent environmental factors are of low importance due to the high variability in litter size []. The success of selection for high prolificacy may be due largely to an increase in the number of corpora lutea [  ]  with associated negative consequences for the resulting foetal-placental units [  ]. Indeed  in pigs  it has been shown that selection for increased litter size leads to a significantly lower mean birth weight and a greater percentage of small piglets born [  ]  with the possibility of various degrees of intrauterine growth retardation occurring in these small piglets []. In pigs  intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been associated with impaired foetal and placental growth []  which can result in lower birth weights and a higher brain to liver weight ratio [] due to the ‘brain-sparing effect’. This is part of a foetal adaptive reaction to placental or nutritional insufficiency []  which may have permanent effects on the structure  physiology and metabolism of the body [  ]  intestinal morphology and enzyme secretion [  ]. Wang et al. [] showed that proteins related to energy supply  protein metabolism and muscle structure  function and proliferation are differentially expressed in IUGR-affected piglets  which indicates impaired metabolism and reduced growth and development of muscle. Thus  IUGR poses economic problems for subsequent commercial meat production  such as reduced feed conversion efficiency and a decreased percentage of meat [] and increased percentage of body fat in the carcass []. One suggested solution to reduce the incidence of IUGR-affected piglets due to gestational-undernutrition is to provide the sow with a nutritional intervention during pregnancy [  ]. However  some studies have found that increasing global maternal nutrition has no effect on piglet performance and muscle traits []  while other studies observed that both maternal under-nutrition and over-nutrition may stunt foetal growth [  ]. An alternative approach to reduce IUGR is to select against the IUGR phenotype  either directly at the piglet level or at the maternal level. Some easily classified fitness traits at the offspring level are heritable and suitable for direct selection  i.e. offspring vitality or vigour [  ]. In pigs  as in other polytocous species (e.g. rats [])  IUGR-affected offspring display a phenotype that is easy to categorise  i.e. an altered head morphology [  ] with three characteristics: (1) a steep  dolphin-like forehead  (2) bulging eyes  and (3) wrinkles perpendicular to the mouth. Although the foetal genome is an important factor for growth potential in utero  there is evidence that suggests that the intrauterine environment is a major determinant of foetal growth []. In this case  if selection at the piglet level is not effective  selection at the maternal level could be based on the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in a litter. Bazer et al. [  ] showed that greater embryonic loss  which is associated with a larger number of embryos in the uterus  is due to maternal limitations and not to limitations of the embryo. The proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in a litter may depend  in part  on the available uterine capacity  which can be defined as the ability of the uterus to maintain the appropriate development of some number of conceptuses []. However  uterine capacity  as defined by Webel and Dzuik []  is difficult to measure directly on farm but the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in a litter could be an indirect measure that could be used for selection. The amount of genetic variation in head morphology of IUGR-affected piglets at the piglet and sow levels can be compared by estimating either the narrow-sense heritability    i.e. the standardised additive genetic variance    or the evolvability    i.e. the square of the coefficient of the additive genetic variance  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100<U+2009>×<U+2009>/ []. The evolvability of a trait refers to the ability of a population to respond to a potential selective challenge []  i.e. its ability to generate adaptive genetic diversity  and is equal to the “expected percent change in a trait under a unit strength of selection” []. Therefore  the evolvability of a trait refers to the capacity of a population to generate heritable and selectable phenotypic variation []  which suggests that a greater evolvability allows for greater selection possibilities.  is a mean-scaled and dimensionless statistic  like narrow-sense heritability    and  thus  is also suitable for the comparison of traits at both the maternal and offspring level. Thus  the objective of this study was to determine if the incidence of immature piglets could be reduced by: (1) selection at the piglet level by recording IUGR head morphology of IUGR-affected piglets used as an indirect measure for IUGR; or (2) selection at the sow level based on the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets born in a litter  as a candidate for indirect measurement of uterine insufficiency. This study was conducted in accordance with the Newcastle University Ethics Policy for Research  Teaching and Consultancy. All pigs were maintained in accordance with the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007. Data were collected for 52 weeks in 2015 and 2016 on 21 159 piglets from 1575 litters (866 individual sows) at a commercial multiplier sow herd located in the UK  which produces crossbred gilts. The unit consists of a sow herd of approximately 750 Landrace sows  which are inseminated artificially with either White Duroc or Large White semen. At insemination  animals in standing oestrus were served up to 3 times at 12- to 14-h intervals with a semen dose of 2.7 billion spermatozoids. The decision of whether to serve an animal for a third time depended on whether it still demonstrated standing oestrus. During gestation  animals were fed on a standard gestation curve according to the season. In the summer months (April–September)  gilts were given 2.2 kg sow meal post-service and 2.5 kg prior to farrowing  whereas sows were given 2.5 kg sow meal at service and 3.0 kg sow meal at farrowing. During the winter months (October–March)  gilts were given 2.5 kg sow meal at service and 3.0 kg sow meal at farrowing  with sows receiving an additional 0.5 kg compared to the gilts. Each ration contained crude protein at 10.50%  oils/fats at 5.25%  crude fibre at 4.25%  crude ash at 4.75%  and digestible lysine at 0.43%. The net energy of the ration was 9.35 MJ/kg. After insemination  sows were group-housed in gestation pens and remained in their gestation pen cohorts until shortly before farrowing  except for those removed because of lameness or aggression issues. During farrowing (and until weaning)  sows and piglets were maintained in standard farrowing crates (0.62<U+2009>×<U+2009>2.40 m)  with a heated piglet area (heated mat or heat lamp) to the front or side of the sow. In general  no assistance was required during farrowing  except in the case of prolonged birth  and all piglets remained in their birth litters until processing at 18–24 h after farrowing  when piglets were first handled for tail docking  teeth grinding and ear tagging for identification of females (males were not identified). All piglets were then cross-fostered to equalize the number and size of piglets in a litter and maximise chances of survival by mixing all piglets born on the same day and then allocating them by size to the available sows. For sows  data collection included parity  gestation length (GL)  total litter size (LITTER SIZE i.e. the number of full-term piglets born alive<U+2009>+<U+2009>born dead  but not including mummified piglets)  and the numbers of piglets born alive  born dead  and mummified. Data collected at the piglet level included sex  individual piglet weight at processing (Ind BWT; used as a proxy for birth weight)  and the level of exposure to IUGR. The level of IUGR a piglet was exposed to was determined by the shape of the head  using visual scores based on head morphology [] and three criteria that characterise growth-restricted piglets []  i.e. (1) steep  dolphin-like forehead; (2) bulging eyes; and (3) wrinkles perpendicular to the mouth. Using these criteria  the following three-point piglet head-morphology score was used: 1<U+2009>=<U+2009>normal head shape  no criteria met; 2<U+2009>=<U+2009>moderate IUGR head morphology  one or two criteria met; and 3<U+2009>=<U+2009>severe IUGR head morphology  all criteria met. These scores were then further condensed into either a normal head shape (score 1) or an IUGR head morphology (scores 2 and 3 combined)  which translated into the following traits: (1) at the piglet level  whether the piglet was born with a normal head shape or an IUGR head morphology (HEAD CLASS); and (2) at the sow level  the number of piglets with a HEAD CLASS of 1  which resulted in the proportion of piglets in a litter with an IUGR head morphology (PROP IUGR). For each litter  the average birth weight (AVE BWT)  the standard deviation of birth weight (SD BWT)  and the proportion of the litter (born alive and born dead) that survived to processing (18–24 h after birth; PROP SURV) were calculated. All genetic parameters  predicted means for the fixed effects  and covariance parameters for covariates at both the piglet and sow levels were obtained using mixed linear models in ASReml []. Traits analyzed included the binary trait HEAD CLASS at the piglet level  which was not transformed before analysis and although there are statistically more rigorous mathematical algorithms based on assumptions of ordered categories and concepts of thresholds [  ]  the general linear model has been shown to be an appropriate approximation []. Traits of interest at the piglet level were HEAD CLASS [normal (0) or IUGR (1)] and birth weight (Ind BWT). A bivariate mixed linear model was used that included fixed effects for sow parity (1–6<U+2009>+)  piglet sex [male (M) or female (F)]  presence of mummified piglets within the litter (Yes/No)  month of birth  and the covariates of litter size and gestation length. Random effects were the direct additive genetic effect  the permanent environmental effect of the dam  and the residual. Traits of interest at the sow level were PROP IUGR  AVE BWT  SD WBT  LITTER SIZE  PROP SURV  and GL. A 6-variate mixed linear model was used with fixed effects for sow parity  farrowing month  and the covariate of gestation length. Random effects were the additive genetic effect (variance )  permanent environmental effect (variance )  and the residual (variance ) of the sow. Repeatability was calculated as: <U+2009>=<U+2009>(<U+2009>+<U+2009>/)  where  is the phenotypic variation of the trait. It should be noted that piglet genotype (L<U+2009>×<U+2009>LW or L<U+2009>×<U+2009>WD) was initially included in the analysis but since it was not significant (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.1)  it was removed from the model. The pedigree structure that was used for the models at the piglet and sow levels is in Table . It should be noted that the pedigree structure did not allow separation of maternal additive effects  maternal permanent environmental effects and temporary environmental effects for any of the piglet level traits. Summarized data for the piglet and sow levels are in Table . For the 1575 farrowings that were included in the study  330 sows had one record  345 two records and 185 three records. Parity ranged from 1 to 9  with 420  322  252  223  172  97  65  20  and 4 litters  respectively. At the piglet level  more piglets were born with a normal HEAD-CLASS score (score 0; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>17 604) than with an IUGR HEAD score (score 1; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3387)  and Ind BWT ranged from 178 to 2960 g. At the litter level  there were 475 l with no piglets showing IUGR head morphology (PROP IUGR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0). Ave BWT of a litter ranged from 820 to 2740 g and the SD BWT ranged from 8.5 to 811.8 g. LITTER SIZE ranged from 1 to 29 piglets. The within-litter proportion of piglets surviving to processing (18–24 h; PROP SURV) ranged from 0.086 to 1 and GL ranged from 106 to 120 d. For all traits  month of birth was a significant source of variation but these results are not presented since month of birth and any differences in management are not repeatable and are therefore of limited interest. Male piglets had a lower (more normal) HEAD CLASS score and were heavier at birth than female piglets (Table ). Piglets from primiparous sows had a higher abnormal HEAD CLASS score than piglets from later parity sows (Table ). Piglets from second parity sows had the lowest HEAD CLASS score  which then increased with successive parities. Ind BWT was lowest for primiparous sows  highest for second and third parity sows  and then decreased with successive parities (Table ). Piglets from larger litters had a higher abnormal HEAD CLASS score (regression coefficient<U+2009>±<U+2009>SEM  0.017<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.001  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and lower Ind BWT (regression coefficient<U+2009>±<U+2009>SEM  -<U+2009>40.26<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.03  <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) than piglets from smaller litters. Piglets from a litter that had one (or more) mummified piglets had a higher abnormal HEAD CLASS score and lower Ind BWT than piglets from litters without mummified piglets (Table ). The bivariate genetic analysis for traits at the piglet level was conducted on the full dataset of 21 159 records  of which  20 991 piglets had both HEAD CLASS and Ind BWT records. For HEAD CLASS and Ind BWT  the permanent environmental effect of litter accounted for 5 and 15% of the phenotypic variance  respectively  while direct additive genetic effects for 5 and 20% of the phenotypic variance  respectively (Table ). The residual accounted for 90 and 65% of the phenotypic variance  respectively. Estimates of direct heritability for HEAD CLASS score and Ind BWT were low  i.e. 0.01<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.001 and 0.07<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.023  respectively (Table ). The genetic correlation between these traits was high and negative  i.e. 0.93<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05. HEAD CLASS had a low  of 7.7% and Ind BWT had a very low  of 0.4%. The maternal heritability for HEAD CLASS was also low at 0.03<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.009 but was slightly higher for Ind BWT at 0.11<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.028. Primiparous sows had the highest proportion of piglets with an IUGR head morphology (IUGR PROP)  the lowest average birth weight (Ave BWT)  the smallest variation in birth weight (SD BWT)  and were among the highest for survival to processing (SURV PROP; Table ). Second and third parity sows had the lowest IUGR PROP  which then increased as parity increased  and the highest Ave BWT  which then decreased as parity increased. The within-litter variability in birth weight (SD BWT) increased as parity increased. LITTER SIZE peaked at parities 4 and 5 and then decreased in older sows. The proportion of piglets surviving to processing (SURV PROP) was lowest in the oldest sows. Sow parity had no effect on gestation length (GL). Genetic analysis for traits at the sow level was conducted on the full dataset of 1575 records  with all sows having a complete set of records. For all traits  estimates of variance of the animal permanent environmental effect  direct additive genetic effects  and residual variance ranged from 4 to 14%  6 to 33% and 59 to 84% of the phenotypic variance  respectively. Heritabilities for traits at the sow level ranged from low to moderate values (Table ): PROP IUGR  0.20<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05; Ave BWT  0.33<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07; SD BWT  0.12<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04; LITTER SIZE  0.11<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05; PROP SURV  0.04<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03; and GL  0.20<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05. Estimates of the genetic correlation of PROP IUGR with the other traits were all moderate to high and negative (-<U+2009>0.29 to -<U+2009>0.90)  with the exception of the correlation with LITTER SIZE  which was moderate and positive (0.46; Table ). This shows that as PROP IUGR increases  Ave BWT and PROP SURV decrease. However  it should be noted that  in this dataset  not all estimated genetic correlations were significantly different from zero. PROP IUGR had a moderate  of 21.6% but was about 1% or less for all other traits. All repeatabilities were higher than the estimated heritabilities (Table )  except for Ave BWT for which they were identical  which indicate that some non-genetic-selection gains can be made for those traits. Changes in piglet head morphology are known to be a phenotypic indicator of IUGR [IUGR;   ]  with IUGR challenge resulting in a specific head morphology that is easy to characterise on farm and under commercial conditions. Our results indicate that genetic gains would be minor when selection is against IUGR at the piglet level; however  selection against the within-litter proportion of IUGR at the sow level would yield better results and may be a suitable trait for an indirect measure of uterine capacity. At the piglet level  gestation length had a slight effect on IUGR status and birth weight  with a shorter gestation length associated with a higher HEAD CLASS score  i.e. a more IUGR like head morphology and a lower birth weight. In general  shorter gestation lengths are associated with lower birth weights and more intrapartum deaths []  while longer gestation lengths are often associated with higher birth weights []. The association between gestation length and HEAD CLASS score may be due to the negative genetic relationship between gestation length and litter size at the maternal level  with larger litters being associated with shorter gestation lengths  and the negative genetic relationship between litter size and proportion of IUGR in a litter  with larger litters being associated with a higher proportion of IUGR head morphology and lower birth weight piglets. It should be noted that not all genetic correlation estimates were significantly different from zero (with high standard errors). Studies with more animals and different populations are necessary to elucidate furthermore these relationships and their impact on IUGR incidence. Our heritability estimate for gestation length and the associated genetic correlations fit squarely with values in the literature  i.e. heritabilities for gestation length ranging from 0.14 to 0.30 [  ]  with a negative genetic correlation with litter size [] and a positive genetic correlation with average birth weight []. Our findings agree with those from other studies in which first parity sows produce piglets with lower average birth weight than older parities. Sows are not physically mature during their first gestation and do not reach maturity until approximately 18 months of age []  although some studies have shown that body growth continues past the 6th parity []. Because of this  young sows are ‘selfish’ in terms of nutrient partitioning  keeping more of their available nutrients for somatic body growth rather than offspring growth. This results in more nutritional retardation and thus lower birth weights and a higher proportion of piglets with an IUGR head morphology. In addition  birth weight varies less within first parity litters because more of these litters are uniformly small. It is interesting to note that  in our study  second parity sows do not follow the biological logic in energy partitioning  since they are expected to still have significant somatic growth and thus to be intermediate between first and third parity sows. Litter size is a significant predictor of piglet IUGR head morphology. Recent selection pressure for increased litter size at birth has resulted in more piglets being born with a low birth weight [      ]  lower physiological maturity at birth []  and higher rate of intrauterine growth retardation []. The estimated heritability for litter size  in our study  is similar to those reported for other polytocous species [        ]  and typical for a composite reproductive trait. We also found that litter size and average birth weight at the sow level were strongly negatively genetically correlated and acted antagonistically on mother and offspring  which is in agreement with other studies [      ]. This antagonistic relationship  with a presumed negative genetic correlation between number and size of offspring is thought to constrain the evolution of litter size and average birth weight []. In theory  genetic correlations between life history traits are expected to be negative [] and our estimate of the genetic correlation between litter size and average birth weight was high and negative. An increase in average birth weight has been linked to a reduced risk of mortality []  which explains our high and positive genetic correlation estimate between average birth weight and within-litter proportion of piglets surviving till processing. The within-litter standard deviation in birth weight has also been linked to a greater odds-ratio for mortality of piglets []  with this within-litter weight distribution already established by the end of the embryonic stage of gestation []. In our study  litter size was highly negatively genetically correlated with the proportion of piglets surviving till processing (18–24 h after birth)  negatively genetically correlated with average birth weight  and positively genetically correlated with the within-litter proportion of IUGR piglets  which suggests that bigger the litter size  the lower the average birth weight  the greater the proportion of IUGR piglets  and the lower the proportion of piglets surviving until 24 h after birth. Of particular interest is the highly negative genetic correlation between the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets and the proportion of piglets surviving until processing  which indicates that selection against the within-litter proportion of IUGR-affected piglets would result in an associated increase in the within-litter proportion of piglets surviving until 24 h of age. Uterine capacity can be defined as the number of conceptuses a uterus can successfully carry to term []. In general  the number of living conceptuses that the uterus is capable of supporting is larger in early gestation than later []  while in later gestation intrauterine competition for the establishment of adequate surface area for nutrition exchange between foetal and maternal circulations may act to limit litter size []. However  it is often difficult to measure uterine capacity directly on farm and most selection programmes use indirect measures of uterine capacity  such as increasing litter size  selection on the number of live born piglets at day 5 [] or on litter weight []. In our study  phenotypes were collected on the piglets and  thus  the underlying mechanism resulting in reduced incidences of IUGR is unclear since measures to characterise uterine morphology and physiology were not available. Selection for reduced rates of IUGR may result in improving the development of the folded placental-epithelial/maternal-epithelial bilayer and fold depth  i.e. the maternal foetal interactive surface []  or of a more efficient placenta. However  a comparison of placental efficiency (the grams of foetus that could be supported by the grams of placenta) between Meishan and Yorkshire breeds highlighted that the greater placental efficiency of Meishan sows was a result of smaller conceptuses that contained fewer cells  compared with Yorkshire conceptuses regardless of uterine environment []. In addition  although selection for placental efficiency may result in greater litter size without decreasing piglet viability []  the resulting piglets had a 20% lower birth weight than those of control lines. An alternative effect of selection for lower rates of IUGR may be more evenly spaced embryos. Lents et al. [] reported negative relationships of ovulation rate with embryonic spacing and with empty space around the embryonic-placental unit  which both indicate crowded uterine conditions. Other studies have shown that mouse lines that lack lysophosphatidic acid  a phospholipid involved in uterine peristaltic movements that facilitate embryo separation []  have blastocysts that remain clustered in the vicinity of the cervix  whereas non-deficient lines have blastocysts that are evenly distributed along the uterine horns []. Studies that specifically investigated different aspects of uterine capacity reported that genetic selection of gilts for high uterine capacity led to greater litter size and overall litter weight  but not to a greater average birth weight []  and that selection for increased placental efficiency did not increase litter size []. Lents et al. [] investigated the phenotypic differences of the reproductive tract in prepubertal gilts using transrectal ultrasound and found that  overall  selection for increased uterine capacity resulted in larger ovaries and uterine horn diameter but that there was no discernible difference in these traits between gilts selected for increased uterine capacity and control gilts at 130  150 or 170 days  which suggests that uterine capacity is difficult to select for prior to first breeding. Attempts to identify candidate genes [] and chromosomal regions that harbour quantitative trait loci [] found no definitive associations between major genes or markers for reproductive traits  although more recent studies have since identified some potential genetic markers for various reproductive traits average birth interval []  teat number []  e.g. age at puberty and reproductive longevity []. Another approach to estimate uterine capacity is to use the unilateral hysterectomy-ovariectomy (UHO) model. Christenson et al. [] concluded that UHO gilts that carried the largest litters had greater uterine capacity. Regardless of the mechanism underlying selection for increased uterine capacity  this variability indicates that there is additive genetic variance in this trait. In our study  the heritability of IUGR head morphology at the piglet level was low  i.e. 0.01. The proportion of maternal variance was also low  i.e. 0.03. In contrast  the heritability for birth weight was higher at 0.10  while the proportion of maternal variance was 0.14. However  it should be noted that  in this dataset  the direct heritability of the continuous birth weight trait was low compared with other studies [  ]. Sire effects are also known to affect piglet birth weight []  but we did not find any significant effect of the piglet genotype (L<U+2009>×<U+2009>LW or L<U+2009>×<U+2009>WD) and  therefore  removed it from the model. Binary traits tend to have a lower heritability than continuous traits by virtue of the binary scale and its lack of intermediate values  with the bias and precision of the estimation methods  depending on the incidence of the phenotype under study []. The conventional solution to binary traits is to treat the binary trait as if it was continuous  quantify the heritability and adjust the estimates based on the prevalence of the trait in the population. In our study  since the direct heritability for traits at the piglet level was sufficiently low  no further adjustments were conducted and an alternative trait (at the sow level) was investigated. In general  traits with the strongest influence on survival have the lowest heritabilities [  ]. There are two possible reasons for this: (1) fitness traits limit the evolutionary potential by exhausting the genetic variation for traits in direct proportion to their effect on fitness [  ]; or (2) fitness traits have greater residual variance [      ]. In our study  the residual variance of the IUGR head morphology trait at the piglet level was high  i.e. 90% of the phenotypic variance  compared to the 5% attributable to genetics  which suggests the second explanation may be more appropriate []. If offspring fitness depends on the piglet’s IUGR head morphology and associated effects  piglet head morphology is expected to have a higher evolvability than other morphological traits. However  an evolvability of ~<U+2009>8% was found for IUGR head morphology  which indicates that the potential phenotypic variation for this trait is small. In addition  the direct narrow-sense heritability was low at 0.01 due to the high residual variance and  thus  direct selection against IUGR head morphology at the piglet level would be slow. If selection against intrauterine growth retardation at the piglet level is not suitable/appropriate  is selection at the sow level a better prospect? Heritability of the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in a litter was approximately 0.20. The variance percentage for the permanent environmental effect of the sow was low at 9%  while the residual variance accounted for 72% of the phenotypic variance. The evolvability for the within-litter IUGR proportion was approximately 22%  while the narrow-sense heritability was 0.20. The repeatability of the proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in a litter was 0.29<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03  which suggests that  although most of the improvement may be achieved via genetic selection some improvement can be obtained via the maternal environment. Repeatability is the proportion of total variance in multiple measurements that is due to individual differences [] and is useful for quantifying the extent to which an individual’s performance remains consistent over time [  ]. The generally low repeatability of the traits analysed in this study may indicate practical problems that are associated with trait measurement or that the time-frame for measurement was not relevant []. This may be true for young sows  with primiparous sows having the highest proportion of IUGR-affected piglets and the lowest average birth weight compared with older sows  which is most likely due to the biology behind energy partitioning. Thus  these findings suggest that these traits should be treated as different traits in primiparous and older animals. However  the lower repeatabilities may also show a lack of independence for successive measurements [] since  at each successive farrowing  the traits are context-dependent on litter size. The number of conceptuses will differ at each service for many reasons  i.e. poor/good sow body condition at service  poor quality semen sample  or reduced quality of available oocytes in older parity sows. In this study  we show that selection against intrauterine growth retardation and an associated increase in the proportion of piglets surviving until 24 h  can be effective. In addition  selection for component traits of female reproduction/fertility does not appear to negatively affect boar semen quality []  which means that the within-litter proportion of IUGR-affected piglets trait has potential application in the field. Its measurement is based on a visual score [  ]  which is easily collected under commercial conditions. This indicates that selection against the within-litter proportion of IUGR-affected piglets  with the corresponding genetic gains in associated traits  is a suitable trait for use in commercial breeding programs. In conclusion  selection against intrauterine growth retardation is possible at the maternal level  through the within-litter proportion of IUGR-affected piglets trait. Inclusion of litter size in addition to the within-litter proportion of IUGR-affected piglets in the breeding programme should maintain current litter sizes. An important and beneficial consequence of selection on low levels of within-litter proportions of IUGR-affected piglets would be a corresponding increase in the survival of piglets to 24 h of age.

In the whole-genome prediction era  the concept of genetic connectedness can be extended to measure a connectedness level between reference and validation sets. However  little is known regarding (1) the impact of non-additive gene action on genomic connectedness measures and (2) the relationship between the estimated level of connectedness and prediction accuracy in the presence of non-additive genetic variation. We evaluated the extent to which non-additive kernel relationship matrices increase measures of connectedness and investigated its relationship with prediction accuracy in the cross-validation framework using best linear unbiased prediction and coefficients of determination. Simulated data assuming additive  dominance  and epistatic gene action scenarios and real swine data were analyzed. We found that the joint use of additive and non-additive genomic kernel relationship matrices or non-parametric relationship matrices led to increased capturing of connectedness  up to 25%  and improved prediction accuracies compared to those of baseline additive relationship counterparts in the presence of non-additive gene action. Our findings showed that connectedness metrics can be extended to incorporate non-additive genetic variation of complex traits. Use of kernel relationship matrices designed to capture non-additive gene action increased measures of connectedness and improved whole-genome prediction accuracy  further broadening the scope of genomic connectedness studies. A two-step simulation process was carried out using the QMSim software []. A historical population with 1000 individuals was created at the initial generation  followed by a sharp reduction in the population size owing to population bottleneck during generation 1 to 100. This resulted in the population size decreasing to 220 individuals in the last historical generation  creating initial linkage disequilibrium along with mutation and drift. The recent population was formed by randomly sampling 200 females and 10 males from the last historical generation. The individuals were mated for the subsequent five generations with equal probability of males and females  producing a total of 2000 individuals with a structured pedigree for analysis. The simulated genome consisted of 29 pairs of autosomes each 100 cM long. To mimic a commercial Bovine 54K SNP chip  1885 bi-allelic SNPs were equally distributed across each chromosome and each chromosome was assigned 65 quantitative trait loci (QTL). Phenotypes were simulated under three different gene action scenarios: (1) additive and dominance (AD)  (2) additive  dominance  and epistasis (ADE)  and (3) purely epistasis (PE). The simplest quantitative genetic model with main effects (additive and dominance) and epistasis constitutes a two-allele two-locus model. Epistasis was simulated only between pairs of QTL including second order additive  dominance (AD) interactions. Five QTL from the 65 on each chromosome (total of 145) were selected to create 10 440 epistatic two-order interactions (145(145-1)/2 = 10 440). The total effect of QTL pairs influencing a given trait was calculated as the sum of all effects using the following model: Here      and  are the additive  dominance  and epistatic effects  respectively;     and  are SNP codes for additive  dominance  and epistasis  respectively;  denotes the th QTL; and  is the number of QTL (for the epistatic term  this is only summed over the epistatic QTL). The phenotypic value of each individual  was created by adding a normally distributed residual  to the sum of genetic values. Additive effects were drawn from a Gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters equal to 0.42 and 8.282  respectively []. Their effect signs were sampled to be positive or negative with probability 0.5. The dominance effect for the th QTL was determined as the product of the absolute value of the additive QTL effect and the degree of dominance  [  ]. Here   is the degree of dominance sampled from a normal distribution with . The epistatic effects were drawn from a normal distribution with  []. Additive and dominance components were simulated for the AD scenario; additive  dominance  and epistatic components were included for the ADE scenario; and only epistasis was considered for the PE scenario. Two broad-sense heritability levels () equal to 0.4 and 0.8 were simulated  with the partitioning of variance components shown in Table . We considered phenotypic variance equal to unity and simulated genetic variance according to the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by additive  dominance  and epistatic QTL effects:     and   where  is the allele substitution effect  and  and  are minor and major allele frequencies  respectively [  ]. For real data analysis  publicly available PIC swine data was used []. We analyzed five traits  T1  T2  T3  T4  and T5  with the corresponding number of individuals equal to 2804  2715  3141  3184  and 3184. Their heritability values were 0.03  0.23  0.20  0.32  and 0.36  respectively. It has been shown that this dataset exhibits a small to moderate amount of dominance genomic variation [  ]. Therefore  this dataset was considered suitable to test the extent to which the use of a non-additive genomic kernel relationship matrix might increase the capturing of connectedness measures. After removing SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05  52 842 SNPs remained for the analysis. The management units were simulated according to the approach in Yu et al. [] for simulated and real data. We clustered all individuals into management unit 1 (MU1) and management unit 2 (MU2) using the -means clustering algorithm applied to a numerator relationship matrix computed from pedigree data such that the overall level of relatedness between individuals in different management units is minimized. There was no exchange of individuals between MU1 and MU2 in scenario 1 (S1)  which served as a least connected design. An additional five management unit scenarios (S2 to S6) were considered by exchanging 10  20  30  40  and 50% of individuals between MU1 and MU2 as shown in Fig. . Simulated management units (MU). Scenario 1: Disconnected management units MU1 and MU2. Scenario 2: 10% of individuals were exchanged between MU1 and MU2. Scenario 3: 20% of individuals were exchanged between MU1 and MU2. Scenario 4: 30% of individuals were exchanged between MU1 and MU2. Scenario 5: 40% of individuals were exchanged between MU1 and MU2. Scenario 6: 50% of individuals were exchanged between MU1 and MU2 Three types of genomic relationship kernel matrices () were used in the present study. The additive genomic relationship matrix () was used to capture the pattern of additive inheritance   where  is the centered marker incidence matrix taking values of  for zero copies of the reference allele   for one copy of the reference allele  and  for two copies of the reference allele []. Here   is the allele frequency at SNP . The dominance genomic relationship matrix () aimed at capturing dominance gene action   where  is the dominance marker incidence matrix defined according to Vitezica et al. []. The additive by dominance genomic relationship matrix was constructed as   where  denotes the Hadamard product []. The Gaussian kernel () is equivalent to modeling epistatic gene action up to an infinite order by taking the Hadamard product between  matrices when SNPs were coded in an additive manner []. It is also known as a space continuous version of the diffusion kernel  which is deployed on graphs []. The Gaussian kernel between a pair of individuals  and  with their genotype vectors  and  is given by: where  is the Euclidean distance and  is the smoothing parameter. Large  leads to  entries closer to 0 (i.e.  local kernel) and smaller  produces entries closer to 1 (i.e.  global kernel). Therefore   controls the extent of genomic similarity between individuals. Consider a standard BLUP model    where  is the vector of the phenotypes   and  are the incidence matrices for systematic and random effects  respectively   and  are the vectors of systematic effects and genetic values  and  is the vector of residuals. By defining  we have: where  is the variance associated with a kernel matrix    is the variance of   and  []. Recall that since  =  =   the prediction error variance (PEV) of  is given by: where  can be any positive (semi)definite relationship matrix between pairs of individuals discussed earlier. The generalized coefficient of determination (CD)  which is also known as the square of the correlation between the predicted and the true difference in the genetic values  was used to quantify connectedness. CD of the contrast between management units  and  consisting of  and  individuals is given by [  ]: where  is the contrast vector involving    and 0 corresponding to individuals belonging to th  th  and the remaining units. Here  the sum of contrast vector elements is zero. The greater the CD of contrast  the greater the connectedness. A large CD is expected when prediction error covariance in the numerator is large  reflecting errors that are in the same direction between units. Alternatively  the measure of CD decreases when the relationship between individuals across units is large in the denominator. Therefore  the CD of contrast combines the prediction error variance of the difference (PEVD) [] and genetic variability. This metric was chosen because it was found to represent the most stable connectedness metric in a recent study []. Measures of CD between MU1 and MU2 were inferred from estimated variance components followed by assessing genomic PA by two-fold cross-validation using a BLUP type model. In the first fold  MU1 was treated as a training set and MU2 was treated as a testing set. This was reversed in the second fold such that MU2 was used to train the model and MU1 was used to test prediction performance. The multi-kernel  and  approach in the AD scenario  the multi-kernel     and  approach in the ADE scenario  and the  matrix in the PE scenario were benchmarked against the baseline  matrix (i.e.  genomic BLUP). Note that the use of  corresponds to fitting a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression (e.g. []). For a multi-kernel approach  we weighted each kernel by its relative contribution to the marked total genetic variation  also known as kernel averaging or multiple kernel learning []  to measure connectedness and assess PA. For instance  the kernel matrix  was used when  and  were fitted together  where  and  were additive and dominance genomic variances  respectively. PA was obtained as the correlation between true and predicted genetic values for the simulated data averaged across 10 replicates (cor()) and the correlation between phenotypes and predicted genetic values for the real data (cor()). The relationships between CD and PA across the six management unit simulation scenarios (S1 to S6) are shown in Fig. . The joint fit of  and  kernel relationship matrices was benchmarked using the  matrix alone. A sharp increase in PA was observed with the increasing proportion of exchanged individuals from S1 to S3  which reached a plateau after 30% exchange rate between MU1 and MU2 in S4. Overall  PA improved as more individuals between MU1 and MU2 were shared. Higher PA values were achieved by accounting for dominance  compared to  alone for the two heritability levels considered (0.4 and 0.80). The lowest PA (0.368) was obtained in S1 with  and the highest PA (0.632) was obtained in S4 with . For the measures of connectedness  there was a good agreement between increasing the rate of exchange and stronger measures of connectedness up to S3. However  the estimates of CD increased up to scenario S3  followed by a decrease from scenario S4 onward because CD penalizes connectedness measures when two units are genetically close. The results showed that establishing genetic links between management units by exchanging more individuals created more genetic similarity on one side and reduced genetic variability on the other side  resulting in lower CD values. CD of contrast measured by  captured stronger connectedness than that of  consistently across all scenarios (S1 to S6). The largest measured CD (0.989) was obtained with  in S3  and the smallest CD (0.64) was obtained with  in S6. Overall  accounting for dominance variation increased PA and measures of CD. The relationship between PA and CD was positively associated up to S3; then  whereas PA continued to increase  CD began to level off.

The magnitude of the relationship level was steadily increased from scenario 1 (S1) to scenario 6 (S6). : additive genomic kernel relationship matrix. : dominance genomic kernel relationship matrix. : broad-sense heritability including additive and dominance variation The results of PA and CD from the ADE scenario are shown in Fig. . We found that the overall pattern resembled that of the AD scenario. That is  with increasing degree of similarity among management units  PA increased and then reached a plateau after S4. The highest PA (0.731) was obtained with  kernel matrices in S4 and the smallest PA (0.245) with  in S1. The PA results suggested that increasing the number of linking individuals improves PA and the use of non-additive genomic relationship matrices simultaneously further increased PA. In comparison  measures of CD were strengthened with the increase of linking individuals up to S4  followed a decreasing tendency  similar to the pattern observed in the AD scenario. Improved capture of connectedness was achieved by explicitly accounting for additive  dominance  and epistasis variations compared to additive only. The greatest and weakest measures of connectedness were observed with  (0.731) in S4 and with  (0.456) in S1  respectively.

We considered different values for the smoothness parameter  ranging from 0.22  0.5  and 0.9 to 1.6.

The relationship between PA and CD for  and  is shown in Fig. . For   the results from the PE scenario were similar to those of AD and ADE scenarios  showing a higher PA with an increasing number of linking individuals. A  equal to 1.6 produced the highest overall PA. Altogether  these results demonstrate the usefulness of  to capture information arising from non-additive genetic variation. The advantage of  over  for PA was less obvious when heritability was high ().

Again  the highest PA was observed in S6 whereas the highest CD was observed in S3. This is because CD accounts for the reduction of connectedness owing to low genetic diversity [].

T1 to T5 denote five different traits analyzed in this study The assessment of genetic connectedness originated from testing the estimability of linear functions of fixed effects in -way cross classifications to determine the absence or presence of connectedness [  ]. It was subsequently extended to the random effects framework [] to quantify the uncertainty associated with the accuracy of breeding value comparisons involving different management units. In this sense  connectedness is a measure germane to the capability to have estimable comparisons []. In the genomics era  the concept of genetic connectedness offers insights on two aspects of the prediction of genetic values. The first is relevant to improving the quality of genomic breeding value comparisons [  ] whereas the other is related to improving the accuracy of genomic prediction []. Notably  it is possible to reconcile these two items by quantifying a genomic connectedness level between reference and validation sets in the whole-genome prediction paradigm. Toward this end  Yu et al. [] investigated the relationship between connectedness measures and PA using pedigree and genomic information under an additive model. Concurrently  it has been shown that whole-genome prediction models designed to capture non-additivity yield slightly to moderately higher PA than additive counterparts when the underlying genetic architecture is governed by dominance or epistasis e.g. [  ]. Although the extent of non-additive genetic variance may not be big in general  this type of variance is particularly important for fitness-related traits []. These recent findings served as the impetus for the present study  extending the scope of connectedness applications by further considering non-additive genetic variation. We observed that the inclusion of non-additive genetic relationship kernel matrices or non-parametric relationship matrices in a BLUP type model increased PA as more individuals were exchanged between MU1 and MU2  and that this was associated with stronger measures of connectedness up to S3 or S4. This reinforced the view that the commonly observed higher prediction performance in non-additive or non-parametric models in the presence of non-linear gene action is due to improved capturing of connectedness between units. We also found that the choice of smoothness parameter  not only influences PA but also the extent of CD. This indicates the importance of the smoothness parameter in evaluating PA and CD  especially when a complex trait is controlled by non-additive gene actions. In general  our results showed that when the optimum  is selected  PA and CD of  will be better than those of   and that even  constructed from additive coding of SNPs only captures additive by additive epistasis theoretically []. We note that many studies have shown that PA decreases when the reference population has a lower relatedness to the validation population e.g. [  ]. This is equivalent to when two units exhibit weak connectedness. Use of connectedness thereby opens up the possibility for an alternative way to measure the strength of relationship between these two populations instead of using an average relationship. Moreover  once the rate of exchange reached S3 or S4  the estimated level of CD gradually leveled off in all management unit simulation scenarios  contrary to PA. This is because when there are sufficient numbers of individuals linking MU1 and MU2  the denominator of CD becomes smaller thus increasing the second term  which in turn renders the CD of contrast to become small. This agrees with the findings in other studies dealing with only additive genetic variation [  ]. Together  these findings suggest that the use of CD holds great potential to identify an optimal breeding program design in terms of genetic diversity while maximizing PA  whereas other connectedness metrics such as PEVD aim at increasing PA regardless of how closely individuals between units become related []. Note that PA is one of the criteria to determine the most appropriate model to fit (for example   vs. ). Once the model is chosen  CD can be used to identify an appropriate level of relatedness or diversity between two units while maintaining high PA. Although we applied -means clustering of a numerator relationship matrix  the choice of  for clustering may impact our results. Thus  we further constructed management units based on clustering of  or  +  under the AD scenario. As shown in Figures S1 and S2 (see Additional file : Figures S1 and S2)  -means clustering of  or  +  produced patterns of PA and CD that are similar to those generated using the numerator relationship. We also repeated our analyses using forward validation rather than -means clustering. We treated 1200 individuals in generations 1 to 3 as the training set (MU1) and 800 individuals in generations 4 to 5 as the testing set (MU2) under the AD scenario. We found that using  yielded higher PA and greater amount of CD compared to using  (Additional file : Figure S3). The utility of genomic connectedness does not preclude its application in management units. For instance  connectedness measured by CD is currently gaining recognition for training population formation in plant breeding []. We contend that the use of CD holds promise to tackle a multitude of challenges related to increasing genomic prediction while maintaining genetic diversity. Here  the genetic connectedness metric  CD  was used to assess genomic connectedness measures between reference and validation sets in a whole-genome prediction framework using simulated and real data in the presence of non-additive gene action. Joint fitting of additive and non-additive genomic kernel relationship matrices or non-parametric relationship matrices could yield enhanced capture of connectedness and improved PA compared to those obtained through baseline additive models. Our approach shows promise to measure connectedness levels and investigate their relationship with genomic PA when the linear assumption of genotype-phenotype mapping may not hold.

Of the algorithms tested  the combination of Eagle2 and Minimac3 gave the highest accuracy across the simulated and real datasets. In this paper  we review and analyse the use of imputation methods based on hidden Markov models (HMM) for animal breeding populations. Genotype imputation is a key aspect of many modern animal breeding programs and makes it possible to obtain genetic information on a large number of animals at a low cost. In breeding programs  a small subset of individuals (e.g.  sires) are typically genotyped at high density and the remaining animals are genotyped at lower densities. Statistical regularities between shared chromosomal segments are used to impute the untyped loci. Modern methods impute missing genotypes at a very high accuracy [  ]  which increases the number of animals that can be genotyped for a fixed budget [  ]. The larger number of genotyped animals increases the accuracy of genetic predictions [] and/or offers the potential to increase selection intensity [  ]. Traditionally  pedigree and heuristic imputation methods have dominated animal breeding [    ]. These methods use large chromosome segments that are shared between closely-related animals to impute untyped or otherwise missing loci rapidly and accurately. In contrast  imputation methods used in human genetics have been based largely on the probabilistic HMM framework of Li and Stephens []. These probabilistic methods tend to have a higher accuracy than heuristic methods when used on datasets where individuals are not closely related or when pedigree information is not available. However  the computational cost of these methods has traditionally been too high for routine imputation in animal breeding populations. In the last few years  the speed of HMM methods has improved  which allows the imputation of hundreds of thousands of individuals to hundreds of thousands of loci in reasonable computational time [  ]. These improvements have been driven by the widespread availability of large haplotype reference panels  and the emergence of a two-step imputation pipeline  in which observed genotypes are first phased and then untyped loci are imputed based on their phased haplotypes []. The improved scaling of HMM methods may allow for their routine use in large animal breeding populations. This progress is particularly timely  given the increasing interest in performing imputation in settings where pedigree information is not available  e.g. in developing countries or in non-nucleus commercial environments. Given the lack of appropriate public domain haplotype reference panels for many animal populations  smaller population sizes  and sparser marker densities  it is not clear whether these advances in HMM will be made for imputation in animal breeding populations. In addition  several HMM imputation methods have been developed and it is not clear which is most suited for routine use in animal breeding. In this paper  we review several imputation methods and study their performance on simulated and real data. We grouped comparisons based on single-step (diploid) imputation methods and a two-step method that are based on a combination of pre-phasing and haploid imputation. Specifically  for diploid imputation  we evaluated fastPHASE []  Beagle v4.0 []  IMPUTE2 []  and MaCH []. For pre-phasing  we evaluated SHAPEIT2 []  HAPI-UR []  and Eagle2 []  followed by haploid imputation with IMPUTE2 []  Beagle v4.1 []  or Minimac3 []. First  we provide a review of these methods and then evaluate their performance on simulated and real data. All of the methods considered here are based on the HMM framework of Li and Stephens []  in which an individual’s genotype is modelled as a mosaic of haplotypes from a reference panel . The methods calculate the probability that the individual has the pair of haplotypes   and  at a locus  given the observed genetic data  . To account for linkage between adjacent loci  the methods evaluate the probability of a haplotype  based on its fit to the observed genotypes at the loci and its similarity to the haplotypes inferred at nearby loci: In this equation  the term  measures the fit between the pair of haplotypes and the observed genotype at a locus; the term  captures transitions between haplotypes given the haplotypes at neighbouring loci; and the terms  and  measure the fit between haplotypes and observed genotypes at the remaining loci. These probabilities can be calculated using a standard forward–backward algorithm []. Traditionally  methods that rely on the framework of Li and Stephens [] scale linearly with both the number of individuals and the number of loci  and quadratically with the number of reference haplotypes. The quadratic scaling is due to uncertain phase at heterozygous loci  which requires the methods to model haplotypes that are assigned on both chromosomes simultaneously. The quadratic scaling quickly leads to intractable computational costs  even for small reference panels  but this can be avoided if the low-density individuals are pre-phased  which allows haplotypes to be considered independently. As a result  haploid imputation  i.e. imputation with pre-phased haplotypes  scales linearly with the number of individuals  the number of loci  and the number of reference haplotypes. In this paper  we consider two classes of HMM. In the first class  diploid imputation methods perform phasing and imputation simultaneously  which results in quadratic scaling with the reference panel size. To mitigate the latter  each of the evaluated methods  fastPHASE  Beagle v4.0  IMPUTE2  and MACH  apply their own strategy to reduce the effective number of reference haplotypes while maintaining high accuracy. In contrast  two-step imputation methods treat phasing and imputation as separate problems. Individuals are first phased and then imputed using a haploid HMM  which scales linearly with the number of reference haplotypes. Phasing methods may have either quadratic  super-linear  or linear dependence on the number of reference haplotypes. To increase phasing speed and accuracy  a number of techniques are deployed that could not be used if the phasing methods also had to handle genotype uncertainty at untyped loci. Intuitively  we might expect that the diploid imputation methods will have higher accuracy (at a higher computational cost) than performing phasing and imputation separately because they automatically handle phase uncertainty. This is not necessarily the case if most errors in imputation stem from the inability to find appropriate reference haplotypes that would explain observed genotypes. By performing pre-phasing and then imputation  it may be possible to consider a much larger number of reference haplotypes and thus increase accuracy by finding a more appropriate set of reference haplotypes  which offset accuracy losses due to phasing errors. Below  we review methods for diploid imputation  haploid imputation  and phasing. All four diploid imputation methods evaluated here use a haplotype state-space reduction technique to alleviate the impact of modelling a large number of reference haplotypes. IMPUTE2 and MaCH use subsampling  where the haplotypes considered in each iteration are a sample of the total haplotype pool. fastPHASE and Beagle v4.0 use haplotype clustering  where the overall number of haplotypes is collapsed into a smaller number of “ancestral” haplotypes. Both IMPUTE2 and MaCH are run over a series of iterations. During an iteration  a subset of the haplotype reference panel is used to phase and impute each individual’s genotypes. In MaCH  the subset is selected randomly. In IMPUTE2  the subset is selected such that it is made up of haplotypes that are “nearby” the currently estimated haplotype for the individual. If these methods are run without an external reference panel  a reference panel is built up from the current phasing of high-density individuals. At each iteration  a new subset of the reference panel is selected for each individual  individuals are imputed and phased based on that subset  and then a reference panel is re-computed from the currently inferred haplotypes. The methods are run for a small number of iterations (e.g.  20) and the imputation results are averaged across iterations. There is a potential issue in applying these methods in populations of many closely-related individuals  due to the potential for feedback between the phasing of closely-related individuals []. In contrast  in fastPHASE and Beagle v4.0  individuals are imputed based on a set of estimated “ancestral” haplotypes. In fastPHASE  an expectation–maximisation algorithm is used to infer a small number of ancestral haplotypes from the data (e.g.  30) and the method then iterates between estimating the haplotypes of each individual as a mosaic of ancestral haplotypes and estimating the ancestral haplotypes based on the haplotype assignments for each individual. Beagle v4.0 uses a similar approach as fastPHASE  but instead of using a fixed number of ancestral haplotypes  it infers the number of ancestral haplotypes at each marker and models the transition between ancestral states at adjacent markers in the form of a directed acyclic graph. In contrast to the four diploid methods  haploid methods do not need to use a state-space reduction technique to handle moderate numbers of haplotypes  because they consider each phased chromosome independently and scale linearly with the number of haplotypes in the reference panels. However  with the recent focus on imputing large bio-bank size human populations (over 100 000 individuals) to whole-genome sequence level data  many of the current haploid methods use other techniques to reduce the computational burden when analysing large numbers of individuals at a large number of markers. The haploid HMM used by Impute2 is a straightforward extension of the diploid method implemented in the same program and uses a subset of haplotypes (based on their similarity to the individual’s current phasing) to impute individuals. Minimac3 uses a similar technique  but instead of subsetting the reference panel  it uses a loss-less haplotype compression technique that combines haplotypes that are identical in a region and updates the likelihood of those haplotypes simultaneously. This update is particularly useful for whole-genome sequence data  which may display limited haplotype variation over long windows. Beagle v4.1 moves away from the graph-based haplotype model in Beagle v4.0 and uses the more traditional model of Li and Stephens. To reduce computational burden  Beagle v4.1 aggregates adjacent loci together into “strings” and performs updates based on “strings” instead of individual markers. In addition  it only updates the haplotype probabilities at genotyped loci and linearly interpolates the haplotype probabilities at untyped loci. Just as with diploid imputation  HMM-based phasing methods naively scale quadratically with the number of haplotypes in the reference panel. However  this quadratic scaling can be avoided by a state-space reduction technique of splitting the chromosomes into small windows and assuming that linkage information decays quickly across the window boundaries. Both SHAPEIT2 and HAPI-UR use a window-based approach  whereas Eagle2 manages the quadratic dependence by performing a limited beam search through the haplotype space. SHAPEIT2 operates by splitting the chromosome into small haplotype windows  each containing three heterozygous loci. For each window  there are 2<U+2009>=<U+2009>8 possible ways to phase it  and there are 2<U+2009>=<U+2009>64 possible transitions between windows. SHAPEIT2 evaluates the probability of each of the eight possible haplotypes and 64 transitions based on a haplotype reference panel  and then phases individuals by sampling haplotypes based on their posterior probabilities. The probability of a haplotype in a given window and transition between windows can be evaluated in a time that scales linearly with the number of reference haplotypes. As in IMPUTE2  SHAPEIT2 subsets the haplotype reference panel by selecting haplotypes that are nearby the current haplotypes of the individual. The window splitting approach may lead to lower imputation accuracy in breeding populations  where individuals are expected to share long chromosome segments. In SHAPEIT2  only the transmission probabilities between windows are modelled  not the probabilities of the underlying reference haplotypes. This means that haplotype assignment information from a given window is only used to update the next window and is ignored for further windows. This approach limits the amount of long-range haplotype information (covering more than three heterozygous loci) that can be exploited. One solution to this is to increase the window size. HAPI-UR takes a similar approach to SHAPEIT2 in reducing the large state-space but uses a series of growing windows  which allow it to exploit longer shared chromosomal segments. In order to process large windows  HAPI-UR takes advantage of a number of computational techniques to reduce computation time drastically. Unlike most methods that assume a small error rate for observed genotypes (to cover genotyping errors  errors in the reference panel  mutations from the ancestral state  and gene conversions)  HAPI-UR sets the probability of all reference haplotypes that disagree with the observed haplotype to 0. This allows the evaluation of which haplotypes fit an individual’s chromosome to be re-formulated as a bit-wise set-intersection operation. In addition to this  HAPI-UR uses a structured representation of the reference haplotypes that allows for fast lookups of matching haplotypes  and for each individual  it creates individual specific diploid HMM  which ignore all haplotypes that disagree with homozygous sites. Instead of using a fixed window size  HAPI-UR uses dynamic windows that begin with a small size (4 markers) and grow to a user specified maximum (e.g. 64 markers) allowing the method to capture longer chromosome segments. Eagle2 takes a different approach to phasing individuals by not using a window-based haplotype representation. Instead  Eagle2 uses a highly efficient reference haplotype storage method based on the positional Burrows–Wheeler Transform [] to allow for consistent haplotype pairs to be identified in constant time. Instead of using a full HMM to evaluate all possible haplotypes  Eagle2 employs a beam search to evaluate only the most promising paths in the space of all possible haplotype pairs. At each heterozygous locus  these paths branch into two possible sub-paths based on the two phasing options. Low probability paths are pruned or merged to keep the overall number of paths small. To decrease the impact that errors in one part of the genome have on subsequent paths  haplotypes are called after 20 markers  allowing for the back-propagation of relevant genetic information while decreasing the potential impact of genotyping errors. Absence of approximate window-based haplotype representation makes Eagle2 particularly appealing for breeding populations  where a large number of close relatives share long chromosome segments. We evaluated the performance of the four diploid imputation methods  fastPHASE  Beagle v4.0  IMPUTE2  and MaCH and the three phasing methods  SHAPEIT2  HAPI-UR  and Eagle2 followed by three haploid imputation methods  IMPUTE2  Beagle v4.1  and Minimac3 on a series of simulated datasets and a real dataset. The simulated dataset modelled a cattle population. The population consisted of five generations of 2000 animals  genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a single chromosome. Each generation was produced by selecting 100 sires from the previous generation based on their true breeding values and mating them with 1000 dams at random. The initial set of haplotypes was sampled using a Markovian Coalescent Simulator []  assuming a single 100-cM long chromosome that was simulated using a per site mutation rate of 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  and an effective population size (Ne) that changed over time. Based on estimates for the Holstein cattle population []  Ne was set to 100 in the final generation of simulation and to 1256  4350  and 43 500 at 1000  10 000  and 100 000 generations ago  with linear changes in between. The simulation of breeding values and of haplotypes of progeny were performed using AlphaSim []. In the baseline scenario  a single chromosome was genotyped either with a high-density array of 1000 SNPs (allele frequency greater than 0.01) or with a low-density array of 200 SNPs  evenly spaced across the high-density array. These numbers of SNPs per chromosome are order equivalent to some of the commonly used arrays in livestock. To cover the full span of arrays used in livestock  we varied the number of high-density and low-density SNPs as described in the following section. All sires and 100 dams were genotyped with a high-density array  while the remaining animals were genotyped with a low-density array. Pedigree information was not used in any of the phasing or imputation algorithms. To test the robustness of each method we independently modified the baseline scenario by varying: the number of SNPs on the low-density array from 5 to 400  the number of individuals in the population from 200 to 10 000  randomly selecting individuals that were genotyped at both high- and low-density  the number of genotyped dams from 0 to 500  the number of SNPs on the high-density array from 3000 to 45 000  while keeping the ratio of low-density to high-density SNP constant at 15:1. We also considered the case in which the first two generations were genotyped on a different high-density array than the next two generations  with either 25  50  or 75% of the SNPs overlapping between the two high-density arrays. To compare the methods on a real dataset  we performed imputation on 56 607 individuals from a commercial pig breeding program. These animals were genotyped either with a high-density array of 60 000 or 80 000 SNPs or with a low-density array of 15 000 SNPs. To estimate imputation accuracy  we selected 500 high-density animals (typed at 60 000 SNPs) and masked part of their genotypes to mimic the pattern of missingness found for 500 animals that were genotyped at low-density. We restricted imputation to chromosome 1. Imputation accuracy was measured as the correlation between the animals’ imputed genotypes and their true genotypes for each animal separately and averaged over all animals. The genotypes were not centered or standardized prior to calculating the correlation. While not centering or standardizing the alleles may increase the resulting correlations  it also makes the correlations independent of the minor allele frequency. We did not assess phasing accuracy independently of imputation accuracy. For the simulated datasets  each method was given 8 GB of memory and 24 h to run. Jobs were terminated if they exceeded the runtime or memory limits. Unless otherwise specified  we used the default parameters for each simulation. We tested IMPUTE2 using either the default 10-cM windows or the entire chromosome and found that imputing the entire chromosome increased accuracy at the cost of additional computational time. We used windows of 5 cM with an overlap of 1 cM for Beagle v4.0 and Beagle v4.1. The real dataset was only imputed using the two-step imputation methods  given their high accuracy and shorter runtimes. In all cases  high-density and low-density individuals were phased separately. In the case of multiple high-density arrays  we used the “merge_ref_panels” option in IMPUTE2 and phased genotypes from the two high-density arrays separately. Because neither Minimac3 nor Beagle v4.1 accept multiple high-density arrays  we phased the high-density individuals together and let the phasing method fill in the missing genotypes for high-density individuals. Performance of the diploid imputation methods is shown in Fig. . Among these methods  MaCH performed well in most settings. Its accuracy depended slightly on the number of high-density dams  the number of low-density SNPs  and the overlap between high-density arrays. The performance of fastPHASE was similar to that of MaCH but fastPHASE performed better when there was a small number of high-density animals or a small overlap between high-density arrays. Accuracies of IMPUTE2 and MaCH were similar but IMPUTE2 performed worse than MaCH when considering a small number of high-density dams  or a small number of individuals  and better when a large number of high-density dams was considered. Beagle v4.0 performed similarly to IMPUTE2 but was less affected by the number of high-density dams and the number of individuals. In all cases  the diploid imputation methods were not able to impute to more than 3000 SNPs per chromosome in 24 h and so they were not evaluated under that condition. Genotype imputation accuracy of four diploid HMM algorithms based on simulated data. Unless otherwise noted  there were 1000 high-density (HD) SNPs per chromosome  200 low-density (LD) SNPs per chromosome  100 dams genotyped at high-density  and complete overlap between the high-density arrays of generations 1 and 2 and those of generations 3 and 4. We varied  the number of dams genotyped at high-density   the number of individuals in the population   the number of SNPs in the low-density array  and  the amount of overlap between the high-density array of generations 1 and 2 and those of generations 3 and 4 Performance of the pre-phasing and haploid imputation methods is shown in Fig. . Among these methods  we found that the combination of Eagle2 and IMPUTE2 gave the highest imputation accuracy. Eagle2 led to the highest imputation accuracy regardless of the imputation method it was combined with  and led to higher accuracies than any of the diploid imputation methods. SHAPEIT2 led to a similar but slightly lower performance than Eagle2. HAPI-UR led to the lowest overall performance for low-density arrays but its performance increased as the number of high-density SNPs increased and reached the same accuracy as Eagle2 for arrays with more than 10 000 SNPs per chromosome. Of the tested haploid imputation methods  we found only a small difference between IMPUTE2 and Minimac3 but we found that Beaglev4.1 had poor imputation accuracy for all tested scenarios. We re-ran Beagle v4.1 with different-sized windows but did not see a noticeable increase in accuracy. The accuracy of Beaglev4.1 did increase as the total number of high-density SNPs increased but its accuracy was still substantially lower than that of either Minimac3 or IMPUTE2 at 45 000 SNPs per chromosome. There was no interaction between the choice of phasing method and the choice of imputation method for the overall imputation accuracy  except when multiple high-density arrays were used. In this case  the combination of HAPI-UR and Minimac3 outperformed the combination of Eagle2 and Minimac3. Genotype imputation accuracy of a combination of pre-phasing and haploid HMM methods based on simulated data. Unless otherwise noted there were 1000 high-density (HD) SNPs per chromosome  200 low-density (LD) SNPs per chromosome  100 dams genotyped at high-density and complete overlap between the high-density arrays of generations 1 and 2 and those of generations 3 and 4. We varied  the number of dams genotyped at high-density   the number of individuals in the population   the number of SNPs in the low-density array   the amount of overlap between the high-density array of generations 1 and 2 and those of generations 3 and 4  and  the number of high density SNPs per chromosome keeping the ratio between high- and low-density constant (15:1) The elapsed run times for each method in the baseline scenario are in Table . Of the diploid imputation methods  MaCH had the shortest run time  followed by Beagle v4.0  fastPHASE  and IMPUTE2. Of the phasing methods  HAPI-UR was the fastest by an order of magnitude  followed by Eagle2 and SHAPEIT2. Of the haploid imputation methods  Minimac3 was the fastest  followed by Beagle v4.1 and IMPUTE2. The combined run-times of the two-step phasing and imputation methods were all substantially shorter than that of the single-step methods. The two-step methods evaluated had similar performance on the real dataset (see Table ). SHAPEIT2 was not able to phase the high-density and low-density individuals in 4 days and so was not analysed. Imputation accuracies of Eagle2 with Minimac3  Beagle v4.1  and IMPUTE2 were 0.992  0.925 and 0.827  respectively. Imputation accuracies of HAPI-UR with Minimac3  Beagle v4.1  and IMPUTE2 were 0.995  0.939 and 0.997%  respectively. Phasing with Eagle2 took 7 h distributed across eight cores. Phasing with HAPI-UR took 54 h on a single core. All haploid imputation methods took less than 6 h. In this paper  we evaluated the performance of HMM-based methods for imputation in animal breeding populations. We found that combinations of pre-phasing and haploid imputation methods led to greater imputation accuracy at substantially reduced runtimes compared to diploid imputation methods  even for a very small number of low-density markers or for a small number of high-density genotyped dams and small numbers of genotyped individuals. The combination of using Eagle2 to pre-phase genotypes and using Minimac3 for imputation led to high accuracy imputation in a wide range of simulation scenarios and when analysing a real animal population. Our results highlight the power of phasing and imputing genotypes separately. Intuitively it makes sense that performing phasing and imputation in a single step may increase imputation accuracy by marginalizing over uncertainty in phasing. However  the results suggest that the additional accuracy lost by marginalizing over phasing errors is outweighed by the accuracy gained by considering larger haplotype reference panels. These results are particularly surprising in the context of animal breeding populations where pre-existing reference panels may not exist (at least in the public domain)  and so the reference panel itself is inferred by phasing high-density genotyped individuals. Our results suggest that modern phasing methods have a sufficiently high accuracy for this phasing to lead to only a small number of imputation errors. The superior performance of pre-phasing and haploid imputation is also surprising given the lower density of SNP arrays (both high-density and low-density) and the substantially smaller numbers of genotyped individuals that we used compared to recent human genetics studies. These results also suggest that when working with multiple low-density SNP arrays  individual SNP arrays can be phased and imputed separately. Of the three phasing methods that we evaluated  Eagle2 led to the most accurate imputation  probably because it is able to exploit longer segments of shared haplotypes between individuals  which are very common in closely related breeding populations. Although Eagle2 resulted in the highest imputation accuracy  we found that HAPI-UR was an order of magnitude faster for most datasets and resulted in a small decrease in accuracy for the simulated scenarios but no decrease in accuracy for the real dataset. In their original paper  the authors of HAPI-UR suggest that it may be possible to increase the accuracy of HAPI-UR by running it multiple times with different window start positions and taking the consensus phase []. Due to the short run time  this strategy would be feasible in animal populations but was not analysed here. SHAPEIT2  the oldest of the phasing methods  had the longest run-time  which prevented us from evaluating it for the real dataset. Although the authors of SHAPEIT2 have now released SHAPEIT3  they do not recommend its use for populations with less than 60 000 individuals and so the performance of SHAPEIT3 was not analysed here. The great speed increases of HAPI-UR and Eagle2 over SHAPEIT2 are also notable because it closes the gap between HMM-based imputation methods and traditional heuristic imputation methods. For example  Miar et al. [] found that  for phasing  FImpute was over a hundred times faster than SHAPEIT2. In this paper  we found that HAPI-UR was over fifty times faster than SHAPEIT2  which suggests that the difference between HAPI-UR and a heuristic pedigree-based method may be of a similar order of magnitude (a fact supported by pilot simulations  not shown). We found little difference in performance between the assessed haploid imputation methods. Both Minimac3 and IMPUTE2 led to accurate imputation. The accuracy of IMPUTE2 was consistently slightly (<<U+2009>1%) higher than that of Minimac3 with the simulated data but the runtime of IMPUTE2 was between two and three times longer than that of Minimac3. For the real dataset  the imputation accuracy of IMPUTE2 dropped when Eagle2 was used to pre-phase the data but remained high when HAPI-UR was used to pre-phase the data. Overall  the performance of Beagle v4.1 was poor in the context of the simulated datasets  although it improved in the context of the real dataset. As the number of SNPs increased  the performance of Beagle v4.1 also increased. This may be a result of the approximations used in Beagle v4.1  which were designed for imputation of human high-density SNP arrays to whole-genome sequence data and which may be less appropriate for the lower-density SNP arrays used in animal breeding populations. With two exceptions  we found little interaction between the choice of phasing method and the choice of haploid imputation method. The first exception was observed for HAPI-UR when individuals were genotyped with multiple  semi-overlapping  SNP arrays  where the imputation accuracy obtained for HAPI-UR with Minimac3 or Beagle v4.1 was substantially higher than accuracy obtained for Eagle2 with Minimac3 or Beagle v4.1  although the accuracy of HAPI-UR with IMPUTE2 was lower than that of Eagle2 with IMPUTE2. The reason for this interaction stems from the fact that  in the case of Minimac3 and Beagle v4.1  the phasing algorithms were also used to perform imputation on the missing non-overlapping SNPs for each high-density array  whereas in IMPUTE2 the two high-density arrays were phased separately  and IMPUTE2 was used to fill in missing SNPs as part of its high-density array merging step. The higher accuracy obtained with HAPI-UR over Eagle2 in this scenario suggests that HAPI-UR can impute untyped loci in high-density arrays better than Eagle2. This is consistent with the second exception  which was that the imputation accuracy obtained with HAPI-UR was at least as high  as that obtained with Eagle2 when performing imputation on the real dataset. Animals in the real dataset were genotyped with two high-density arrays and two low-density arrays that both exhibited a number of randomly missing SNP genotypes. When using Eagle2 to phase individuals  IMPUTE2 and Beagle v4.1 resulted in markedly lower imputation accuracy  in particular compared to Minimac3. In contrast  when HAPI-UR was used to phase individuals  the performance of Minimac3  IMPUTE2 and Beagle v4.1 remained high  which suggests an advantage of using HAPI-UR over Eagle2 when individuals are genotyped on multiple arrays or when observing a large amount of random missing genotypes. Some of the analysed phasing methods have an option to use pedigree information to improve phasing. Although these options were originally designed to help phase and impute parent–progeny trios []  they can also be used for larger pedigrees []. Previous work on phasing and imputing animal populations showed that combining pedigree and linkage information can improve phasing and imputation accuracy [  ]. In this paper  we focused only on HMM-based methods that use linkage-disequilibrium information for phasing and imputation  as originally proposed by Li and Stephens []. SHAPEIT2 []  Beagle v4.0 []  and HAPI-UR [] all provide options to use parent–progeny trio information. However  the top two performing methods in this study  Eagle2 and Minimac3  do not provide this option. It is likely that pedigree information can be included in these algorithms by pre-phasing and pre-imputing an individual’s genotypes based on the genotypes of the individual’s parents. This is similar to the approach of DuoHMM []. Future work is needed to analyse how HMM can use pedigree information to improve phasing and imputation  and to integrate this with the high-performance methods that were reviewed and tested here. Overall  this study suggests that modern hidden Markov model pre-phasing and haploid imputation methods can perform fast and accurate imputation of SNP genotypes in animal breeding populations of any size without the use of pedigree. This is particularly important given an interest in performing imputation and implementing genetic selection in non-traditional livestock populations without recorded pedigree  for which existing heuristic methods may be less appropriate  such as in developing countries or on multiplier and commercial farms. We noticed no disadvantage of using the two-step imputation approach even in cases of small populations  low-density SNP arrays  or multiple high-density arrays. Of the algorithms  we found that Eagle2 and HAPI-UR both reliably pre-phased the data and that IMPUTE2 and Minimac3 led to the highest imputation accuracy. However  we also noted a decreased accuracy when Eagle2 and IMPUTE2 were used to pre-phase and impute the data when animals were genotyped with semi-overlapping high-density SNP arrays. In this case  using Eagle2 with Minimac3 and HAPI-UR with IMPUTE2 or Minimac3 led to higher accuracy. Overall  our findings highlight the importance and feasibility of using HMM to perform imputation in animal breeding populations  even as the number of genotyped animals and genotyping densities increase.

Algorithms for the detection of ROH depend on the similarity of haplotypes. Coverage gaps and copy number variants (CNV) may result in incorrect identification of such similarity  leading to the detection of ROH islands where none exists. Misidentified hemizygous regions will also appear as homozygous based on sequence variation alone. Our aim was to identify ROH islands influenced by marker coverage gaps or CNV  using Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (777 K) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for Austrian Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer cattle. ROH were detected using clustering  and ROH islands were determined from population inbreeding levels for each marker. CNV were detected using a multivariate copy number analysis method and a hidden Markov model. SNP coverage gaps were defined as genomic regions with intermarker distances on average longer than 9.24 kb. ROH islands that overlapped CNV regions (CNVR) or SNP coverage gaps were considered as potential artefacts. Permutation tests were used to determine if overlaps between CNVR with copy losses and ROH islands were due to chance. Diversity of the haplotypes in the ROH islands was assessed by haplotype analyses. In Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  we identified 13  22  and 24 ROH islands covering 26.6  389.0 and 35.8 Mb  respectively  and we detected 30  50 and 71 CNVR derived from CNV by using both algorithms  respectively. Overlaps between ROH islands  CNVR or coverage gaps occurred for 7  14 and 16 ROH islands  respectively. About 37  44 and 52% of the ROH islands coverage in Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively  were affected by copy loss. Intersections between ROH islands and CNVR were small  but significantly larger compared to ROH islands at random locations across the genome  implying an association between ROH islands and CNVR. Haplotype diversity for reliable ROH islands was lower than for ROH islands that intersected with copy loss CNVR. Our findings show that a significant proportion of the ROH islands in the bovine genome are artefacts due to CNV or SNP coverage gaps. A run of homozygosity (ROH) refers to a continuous stretch of homozygous loci in the genome []. ROH are typically detected based on the genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are derived either from high-throughput microarrays or next-generation sequencing data []. ROH can either appear by chance or simply be artefacts caused by imperfect SNP coverage in the design of a chip. The proportion of an individual’s genome that is located within ROH is an approximate measure of inbreeding []  where longer ROH most likely derive from more recent common ancestors []. Estimates of ROH inbreeding coefficients have been shown to be more accurate pedigree inbreeding coefficients [  ]. Studies on ROH in some European cattle breeds have revealed the presence of distinct genomic regions with ROH that are common between individuals  within a breed and even across breeds. These common ROH are called ROH hotspots or ROH islands [] and in this paper  we use the term “ROH islands”. Zavarez et al. [] found three ROH islands on chromosomes 4  7 and 12 and four ROH islands on the X chromosome in Nellore cattle. Karimi [] identified ROH islands on chromosomes 7 and 21 in   and on  (BTA) chromosomes 5  6  7  16 and 21. Particularly notable  ROH islands present in a large proportion of the individuals of the population have been identified on BTA6 in the Brown Swiss  Pinzgauer and Tyrol Grey bovine breeds []. The distribution and pattern of ROH islands can indicate a pattern of selection events and this is of interest for any breeding program. Thus  it is important to know the location and distribution of the ROH islands for a given population. The reasons why ROH islands occur are not well understood. Theoretically  ROH islands within a breed may be explained by shared recent ancestry []. Szmatola et al. [] hypothesized that such ROH islands may be due to selection at functionally important quantitative trait loci  which would imply high local linkage disequilibrium (LD) in those genomic regions. In humans  Nothnagel et al. [] noted that regional LD between SNPs is not sufficient to explain the occurrence of ROH islands. False ROH can be detected if the maximum gap allowed between homozygous SNPs is too large. This applies especially to short runs and in the case of low-density SNP chips  as indicated by Ferencakovic et al. []. Other reasons for detecting false ROH are reference genome assembly problems  the occurrence of rare alleles in the reference genome and local ascertainment bias resulting from sampling of the SNPs that are included in the SNP panel. ROH islands may also be due to biological factors  such as differences in chromosome structure that are perceived as stretches of homozygous genotypes by the SNP assays. For instance  it is hypothesized that ROH islands may be related to the centromeric location of the ROH []  although in cattle this would hold only if the ROH island is found within the first few Mb of a chromosome  since all bovine chromosomes are acrocentric. ROH islands may also result from the existence of structural variants (SV). SV are genomic rearrangements that affect more than 50 base pairs (bp) of sequence and can be due to deletions  insertions  inversions  transpositions  duplications and translocations []. Typical SV are copy number variants (CNV)  defined as DNA segments of one kilobase (kb) or more that are present in variable copy number in comparison with a reference genome []. This paper explores the possibility that ROH islands are artefacts resulting from limitations of the algorithms that are used to detect ROH with Illumina assay SNP chip data. The GenTrain algorithm used by Illumina assays depends on the intensity of the signals emitted by a probe at a specific marker compared to expected intensity (log R ratio  LRR)  and the proportion of hybridized sample that carries the B allele as designated by the hybridization assay (B-allele frequency  BAF)  usually normalized to 0.0  0.5  and 1.0 []. As illustrated in Fig.   a genome segment with a double deletion has random BAF values  and very low LRR values (implying a low signal intensity) []. A segment with a copy loss has lower LRR values and its BAF values tend towards the extremes (very high and very low). The GenTrain algorithm may mistype this hemizygotic region as being homozygous and ROH algorithms may detect this as a ROH. Thus  taking CNV into account is very important to eliminate erroneously detected ROH. BAF and LRR plots for scenarios with different copy numbers and homozygous alleles. The plots show how some regions that contain CNV can be erroneously determined as having ROH. The normal state is to carry two copies of an allele  and the BAF values are distributed between intermediate and extreme values  while the LRR ratio has intermediate values. As the number of copies increases  the LRR values move towards the higher extreme while the BAF values disperse into more intermediate values based on copy number. When the copy number is very large  this segment may also be mistyped as being homozygous and ROH algorithms may detect it as a ROH. A segment  which is truly homozygous has extreme BAF values and intermediate LRR values Thus  one of the first steps towards understanding why ROH islands exist is to distinguish true ROH from ROH artefacts. The objective of this paper was to identify artefactual ROH islands resulting from large intermarker distances (IMD) and/or interference with copy number variation (CNV) that were detected by two methodologies. We used Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (777 K) genotype data from three Austrian cattle breeds. The dataset comprised 48 Brown Swiss  120 Tyrol Grey and 119 Pinzgauer bulls. Quality control of the genotype data was done using PLINK [] with the following parameters: call rate higher than 0.9  departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at the 0.001 level  missing genotype rate less than 0.05 and missing data rate less than 0.1. The numbers of animals that passed quality control for ROH analysis were 46  117 and 118 for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. ROH were detected using a clustering algorithm implemented in the SNP & Variation Suite (SVS) based on the paper of Zhang et al. []. ROH were detected using ROH lengths of more than 1  2  4  8 and 16 Mb  each. Different numbers of heterozygotes and missing SNPs were allowed for each of the ROH length categories (1  2  4  8  16 for heterozygotes and 4  8  16  32  64 for missing SNPs for 1 to 2  2 to 4  4 to 8  8 to 16 <U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb  respectively) as recommended by Ferencakovic et al. []. ROH for each individual were merged using the BEDTools software []. CNV were detected by using two algorithms: the multivariate copy number analysis method implemented in the Golden Helix SVS v8.5 software (Golden Helix  Inc.  Bozeman  MT  ) and a hidden Markov model (HMM) implemented in PennCNV []. LRR and BAF data were extracted from the Illumina BovineHD final reports and imported into SVS. Only markers with GC scores higher than 0.7 were used. Wave detection and correction on autosomes were based on the University of Maryland assembly of   release 3.1 (UMD3.1  bosTau6) with a minimum training marker distance of 1000 kb. Using the recommended wave factor threshold of 0.05 []  the numbers of animals that passed this step were equal to 40  64 and 89 for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. Means of CNV segments were computed using the SVS multivariate copy number analysis method (CNAM) and the optimal segmenting procedure. The maximum number of segments allowed per 10 000 markers was 20; the minimum number of markers per segment was 3; and the maximum pairwise segment  value was 0.005 (with 2000 permutations per pair). The copy number segment list was discretized using a three-state model (-<U+2009>1  0 1) based on a segmentation mean threshold of 0.3 as used by Zhou et al. []. In the three-state model  “-<U+2009>1” denotes a copy loss  “0” denotes copy neutral and “1” denotes copy gain. BAF and LRR ratio data were extracted into individual raw files from the Illumina final reports using the “split_illumina_report.pl” script. These data were used to generate files of population frequencies of the B allele (PFB) for each breed using “compile_pfb.pl” script. A GC content file for bosTau6 was downloaded from . The file was converted to the appropriate wiggle track format using BigWig and BigBed Tools []. Appropriate “gcmodel” files were generated for each breed using the “cal_gc_snp.pl” script based on a 1000-kb span (500 kb on each side of a marker). The CNV calling procedure was run with the “gcmodel” option for detection and adjustment of the intensity values [] using the “detect_cnv.pl” script. Post-processing of the CNV calls was done using the “filter_cnv.pl” script with the same quality control parameters as those used in SVS: absolute wave factor value (0.05)  minimum number of markers per segment (3)  and LRR standard deviation (0.3). In addition  a BAF drift threshold of 0.01 was used. Using the 1.5× inter-quartile range rule []  the distribution of the number of CNV calls per sample was used to re-run the filter procedure to exclude samples with CNV calls greater than 59  120 and 114 in Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively  as done by Ghani et al. []. The numbers of animals that remained at this point were 41  55 and 98 for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. Finally  CNV calls with gaps shorter than 20% of their combined CNV lengths were merged using the “clean_cnv.pl” script. To obtain consensus results between the two CNV calling algorithms used  only the animals  which passed quality control in both analyses  were considered to determine the proportion of CNV in regions of ROH islands. The final numbers of animals were 37  52 and 87 for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. CNV that overlapped by at least 1 bp were merged using BEDTools [] as done by Prinsen et al. []. CNV regions (CNVR) were divided into three categories: gain  loss or both (for regions with copy gains  copy losses and both copy gains and losses for different samples)  respectively. A consensus list of CNVR (CNVR derived from CNV detected by both SVS and PennCNV) was generated using the “intersect” procedure of BEDTools []  while the overlaps between the CNVR in this study and other studies were determined using the “merge” procedure of the same software. ROH detected in the genome of the animals in the final sample were used to determine ROH islands. Inbreeding levels of the markers were computed by calculating the proportion of individuals for which the marker was homozygous. ROH islands were defined as regions where the inbreeding level for markers passed the 99th percentile of the genome-wide distribution of inbreeding levels. The following metrics were computed from the CNV and ROH analyses: Proportion of individuals inbred at each marker. Proportions of individuals with CNV at each marker by category of copy state (gain  loss or both). Mean IMD within the ROH island; using Tukey’s box-plot method for identifying outliers []  the upper limit for defining outliers was 9.2365 kb. ROH islands that overlapped with CNVR and that had a mean IMD longer than 9.2365 kb were considered as likely artefacts. A permutation test was performed to check whether the overlaps between ROH and CNVR were due to chance. The positions of the ROH islands for each breed for each algorithm used to detect CNV were randomized 10 000 times with the constraint that ROH islands on the same chromosome should be more than 1 Mb apart. The intersection of the CNVR and the ROH islands based on the test data (ROHD) were compared with the intersections between the CNVR and the randomized ROH islands (ROHR) using a t-test. Genotyping data of the animals that passed quality control were phased using the genetic model of coalescence with recombination implemented in the SHAPEIT software [] with default options. Each ROH island was assigned to one of seven categories based on whether it presented a coverage gap and/or a copy loss and/or a copy gain or none of these issues. Each ROH island was split into 100-kb blocks using the “ghap.blockgen” function in GHap []  which is a package in R []. The average size of bovine haplotype blocks ranges from 10 to 20 kb but can be as long as 700 kb [  ]. The 100-kb size was selected as a conservative size that is within the range of reported maximum haplotype block sizes. Effective numbers of haplotypes for each haplotype block were computed as the inverse of the sum of the squares of the frequencies of haplotypes within a block. Expected block heterozygosity () was used as a measure of haplotype diversity  and was computed as: where  is the frequency of each haplotype in the block. Haplotype diversity and (effective) number of haplotypes were compared between breeds and different categories of ROH islands: ROH islands with no coverage gap; ROH islands with a coverage gap  and ROH islands with a copy loss (copy loss only or copy loss with copy gain and/or coverage gap). The genomes of each of the 176 animals in the dataset of interest had ROH. The mean inbreeding coefficients based on the overall sum of ROH (F) with a minimum length of 1 Mb were 13.3  5.8 and 5.6% in Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively (see Additional file : Table S1). The largest sum of ROH was 588 Mb (F<U+2009>=<U+2009>20%) in a Tyrol Grey individual  while the smallest was 45 Mb (F<U+2009>=<U+2009>2%) in a Pinzgauer individual. In the three breeds  59 ROH islands were identified based on 99th percentile marker inbreeding level cut-off points of 45.95  19.23 and 17.24%  respectively  of which only 44 were unique (see Additional file : Table S2). The ROH islands are shown in the Manhattan plots in Figure S1 (see Additional file : Figure S1) and their descriptive statistics are in Table . Two ROH islands were common to Brown Swiss and Pinzgauer; three were common to Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer; and five were common to all three breeds  two on BTA6 and one each on BTA7  10 and 12. Overall  BTA6 had the largest number of ROH islands (five in Brown Swiss  six in Pinzgauer and two in Tyrol Grey)  which is consistent with the results of Ferencakovic et al. [] and Karimi et al. [] in other  breeds. There were no significant differences in the size and genome coverage of ROH islands. In total  306 (187)  606 (153) and 528 (178) CNVR were identified in Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively  using PennCNV and (SVS). Thirty  50 and 71 consensus CNVR were found in Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. A full list of the CNVR is in Table S3 (see Additional file : Table S3)  and a summary is in Table . PennCNV detected more CNV with copy gain than SVS. Overall  most of the CNVR had copy losses. Based on PennCNV’s CNV calls  the largest number of CNVR was identified on BTA19 (37  62 and 47 for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively) and  the smallest number (0  1 and 0  respectively) on BTA27. The average number of CNVR per chromosome was equal to 10.55  21.14 and 18.21 for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. Based on SVS’s CNV calls  the largest number of CNVR (given in parentheses) were identified on BTA8 (17)  12 (12) and 2 (13)  in Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively  and the smallest number of CNVR were on BTA25 (0)  26 and 14 (0 each) and 16  22 and 26 (1 each)  with the mean number of CNVR per chromosome equal to 6.45  4.27 and 6.14  respectively. CNVR coverage was highest in Tyrol Grey  followed by Pinzgauer. The genome coverages for PennCNV CNVR and (SVS CNVR) were about 0.94% (0.30)  2.04% (0.72) and 1.70% (0.40) for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. Jiang et al. [] found that CNVR cover about 1.29% of the genome of the autosomes in Holsteins. Similarly  Wu et al. [] reported a genome-wide coverage of 1.41% (about 35.48 Mb) in Simmental cattle. However  using sequence data  Keel et al. [] found that CNV cover about 6.7% of the bovine genome. All the consensus CNVR in Brown Swiss and most of those in Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer have been reported in another Brown Swiss population by Prinsen et al. []  while most of the consensus CNVR in Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer have recently been reported by Bickhart et al. [] and Sasaki et al. [] (Table ). Generally  SVS tended to detect CNV that occurred across individuals  while PennCNV tended to detect also CNV that were private to individuals. This may be due to PennCNV using additional individual-specific information such as BAF values  compared to SVS  which only uses LRR values  and because the CNAM algorithm in SVS detects fewer private CNV than its univariate counterpart. There were gaps in SNP coverage above the threshold of 9.2365 kb on many chromosomes  with the most significant ones being on BTA6  7  8  10  12  13  14  15  16  17  23  and 27. The largest gap detected was 1 080 181 bp long at position 7 798 579 on BTA7. Some of the gaps were in regions that contain ROH islands  such as the regions between approximately 5 and 7 Mb on BTA6 and between approximately 24 and 25 Mb on BTA10 in the three breeds. Such gaps in SNP coverage can lead the algorithms that are used for the detection of ROH to extend short ROH as illustrated by the first ROH island on BTA6 (Fig. )  which is characteristic of some taurine breeds  but absent in indicine breeds []. This is most probably caused by the presence of very short gaps in the regions flanking the ROH  which leads the ROH algorithm to detect the whole region as one ROH. A similar pattern of gaps was observed on BTA12. Details of the overlaps between SNP coverage gaps  ROH islands and CNVR. The upper panel shows the ROH (black) for each animal (grey gridlines). The lower panel shows the IMD (black) and the proportion of animals in ROH at each marker (green). The inset shows a short region with normal IMD  and which could be a true ROH island. However  the region is flanked by big gaps  the edges of which could also be true ROH. The whole region is detected as a ROH in most of the individuals Details of the overlaps between individual ROH and individual CNV for each animal and each chromosome in the three breeds are in Additional file . A summary of the ROH islands and CNVR that were detected by both PennCNV and SVS in Pinzgauer cattle is in Fig.   which shows the overlaps between ROH islands  CNVR and IMD. Similar figures for such overlaps in the other two breeds are in Figure S3 (see Additional file : Figure S3). ROH islands and CNVR on each chromosome for Pinzgauer cattle. Each chromosome (dark grey bar) has four lines. Starting from top to bottom within the chromosome  the top line (black) is for ROH islands. The second line is for PennCNV CNV (light blue for copy loss  red for copy gain and light green for both copy loss and copy gain). The third line is for SVS CNV (blue for copy loss  maroon for copy gain and dark green for both copy loss and copy gain). The fourth (last) line is for intermarker distance (IMD  light grey for IMD<U+2009><<U+2009>9.2365 kb and orange for IMD<U+2009>><U+2009>9.2365 kb). The magenta rectangles show regions where consensus CNVR overlap with ROH islands For Tyrol Grey  an overlap was detected between a ROH island and a consensus CNVR (copy loss) on BTA17 (with the intersection at 73 748 297–75 132 928 bp). In the three breeds  at least one consensus CNVR intersected with a ROH island and/or a gap on BTA10. For Brown Swiss  the intersection was within a gap between 23 889 533 and 24 998 515 bp. For Tyrol Grey  the intersection was within both gaps and CNV at two locations: between 23 651 168 and 24 057 642 bp and between 24 061 376 and 24 143 260 bp. For Pinzgauer  the overlap was also within both gaps and consensus CNVR at two locations: between 23 889 533 and 24 057 642 bp and between 24 061 376 and 24 095 827 bp. We note that the region between 23 and 25 Mb on BTA10 contains the - gene and it has been reported that CNVR are strongly associated with genes responsible for immune response []. For the three breeds  intersections between ROH islands and a combination of gaps and consensus CNVR were found on BTA12 between approximately 70.0 and 75.5 Mb. For Brown Swiss  only one CNVR was detected in this region i.e. between 72 432 362 and 72 467 225 bp with the corresponding ROH island at 72 432 362–72 467 225 bp and intersection at 72 432 362–72 467 225 bp. For Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  the ROH islands present in this region were longer (4.6 and 4.7 Mb  respectively)  and overlapped with multiple CNVR (11 and 12  respectively). The existence of CNV on BTA12 in taurine cattle has been documented []. We observed one intersection between ROH islands  gaps and consensus CNVR on BTA23 for Pinzgauer and also several other overlaps between gaps  ROH islands and CNVR detected by either PennCNV or SVS alone. The results on the intersections between CNVR and ROH islands based on the test data (ROHD) and the mean intersections between the CNVR and ROH islands with randomized positions (ROHR) are in Table . ROHR differed considerably between the two algorithms used to detect CNV for Brown Swiss but were similar for Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer. ROHR were generally lower than ROHD (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  which implies that the intersections between the ROH islands and the CNV are not random and that there is a significant association between the ROH islands and the CNVR. Details of the position of individual ROH islands  proportions of individuals with CNV at each marker and the proportion of inbred individuals and percentage of individuals with copy gain or loss within each ROH island for the CNVR detected with PennCNV and SVS and for consensus CNVR are in Table S4 (see Additional file : Table S4). Seven  14 and 16 ROH islands were identified as possibly false for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. Table S5 shows the details of the 37 ROH islands considered as false based on the overlaps between CNVR and ROH islands and the mean IMD within the ROH islands  and Table  shows a summary of the number and sizes of the ROH islands. For Brown Swiss cattle  48% (6.624 Mb) of the 13.928 Mb affected by CNV in ROH islands were located on BTA16 between 22 077 094 and 28 701 552 bp. Similarly  stretches of ROH islands of about 4.612 and 4.652 Mb for Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively  which were affected by CNV and gaps  were on BTA12 between 70 and 75 Mb and for Pinzgauer  most of the ROH islands were affected. For Brown Swiss  about 37% of the ROH islands were affected by copy loss. Similarly  the proportion of ROH island coverage affected by copy loss and coverage gaps was equal to 44 and 52%  for Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively. The BAF and LRR plots for all 42 ROH islands are in Additional file . Figure  shows the genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the false ROH islands based on the distributions of BAF values and LRR values in selected ROH islands. The plots show that some of the ROH islands identified in this study could indeed be artefacts due to coverage gaps and mistyping of genotypes because of the presence of CNV. BAF and LRR plots of selected ROH islands. In each of the four sub-plots  the top panel is for individual ROH (black) and individual CNV (blue and dark red for copy loss and copy gain  respectively  for SVS; and light blue and red for copy loss and copy gain  respectively  for PennCNV). The middle panel shows the mean BAF values at each marker while the third panel is for mean LRR at each marker. Panel  illustrates the possibility of a gap being detected as a ROH. Panel  shows how a CNVR can extend ROH leading to a ROH island. Panel  is a typical example of a CNVR and gaps within a ROH island. Panel  is an extreme example of ROH islands being detected between regions with a high frequency of CNV There were significant differences in haplotype numbers between different categories of ROH islands and between breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.2e-16). The number of SNPs per haplotype differed between breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004) and varied widely across the ROH island categories (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.418e-15). The effective number of haplotypes was affected by both breed and ROH island category (<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.2e-16). Haplotype diversity was lowest in ROH islands with both copy loss and copy gain (such as on BTA12 between 70 and 75 Mb). Haplotype diversity was lower in ROH islands with no gaps or CNV than in ROH islands with coverage gaps  copy loss and CNV. The diversity of the rest of the ROH islands with gaps and/or copy loss and/or copy gain was similar to that of ROH islands with none of these issues. Figure  shows the estimates of the number of haplotypes per block  number of SNPs per haplotype  effective numbers of haplotypes and haplotype diversity in the ROH islands. Haplotype diversity statistics in all ROH islands.  Number of haplotypes.  Number of SNPs per haplotype.  Effective number of haplotypes per haplotype block.  Haplotype diversity CNV contribute significantly to genetic variation [] and have been associated with several genetic disorders. Under natural selection  individuals with undesirable SV are unlikely to pass on their genes to their offspring. However  most SV are benign. Moreover  if the SV confer some advantage to the individual  balancing selection may occur. This is very common in domestic livestock such as cattle  where breeders deliberately select breeding stock for particular traits  some of which may result from single copy genotypes  which may result in SV being maintained in a large proportion of the individuals beyond what could be expected from genetic drift alone []. If such variants are copy number deletions  there may be a high frequency of heterozygous wild type/null genotypes []  which could be mistyped as homozygotes by the GenTrain algorithm []. Subsequently  the ROH calling algorithms would interpret such regions as ROH  which for the population would lead to erroneous ROH islands. ROH contain valuable information for estimating the levels of inbreeding  predicting and mapping inbreeding depression and for identifying signatures of selection. In this paper  we present evidence indicating that some of the ROH islands in the bovine genome may be artefacts due to copy losses as well as to coverage gaps (~<U+2009>37  44 and 52% of the genomic regions covered by ROH islands for Brown Swiss  Tyrol Grey and Pinzgauer  respectively). Thus  CNV and coverage gaps need to be taken into proper account and considered with great care when assessing signatures of selection via ROH patterns.

These percentages reached 77.0 and 68.4% in the scenario without litter and pen effects on phenotypes. Our results indicate that the model works appropriately for the analysis of group records from varying group sizes. Using group records for genetic evaluation of traits such as feed intake in pig is feasible and the efficiency of the resulting estimates depends on the size and structure of the groups and on the magnitude of the variances for litter and pen effects. The amount of available data is a key factor that affects accuracy of selection in a breeding program. For some traits  individual records are difficult or expensive to measure  making it difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of data. An example is feed intake  which is one of the most important traits in livestock production  since feed represents 60 to 70% of the total cost in modern commercial livestock production systems [  ]. Feed intake at the individual level is usually measured by electronic feeders that can recognize each individual in the pen/barn (pig/cattle)  or by isolating an animal in a cage (poultry). Because individual recording of feed intake is expensive  individual feed intake is usually only measured for a small proportion of selection candidates. For most selection candidates  their BV are predicted using information from their relatives that have individual records of feed intake and information on correlated traits such as growth or production traits that are usually recorded individually. The lack of phenotypic data on feed intake is a barrier in the genetic progress of feed efficiency. Therefore  alternatives to measuring individual feed intake are required in order to improve the accuracy of genetic evaluation of feed efficiency. One alternative is to use data of feed intake at the group level. In pig farms  a group of pigs (e.g.  12–15 pigs) are usually kept in a pen during a particular growth period (e.g.  from 30 to 100 kg). Although it is costly to measure feed intake individually due to the expensive equipment required  total feed intake at the pen level is relatively easy to measure by manually or automatically weighing the feed that is provided in the feeder during the trial and the remaining feed at the end of the trial. Many studies have reported the estimation of variance components [  ] and prediction of BV using group records [   ]. However  in all these studies only additive genetic and residual effects were considered as random effects in the model  and they analyzed data of equal group sizes or set a constant group size to model the residual variance when analyzing data of varying group sizes []. Thus  it is necessary to extend these approaches to handle multiple fixed and random effects  such as litter and pen effects on feed intake in pigs  and investigate the efficiency of using group records for predicting BV in different scenarios. The objectives of this study were to (1) model group records from varying group sizes  considering both additive genetic and non-genetic random effects (litter and pen effects); (2) interpret variance components at the group level; (3) assess the variances estimated from group records; and (4) compare prediction accuracy based on group and individual records in different scenarios. In this section  first we describe the model used to fit group records with unequal group sizes; second  we illustrate variances at the group level and variance components estimated from group records; third  we present the simulation of data for various scenarios by mimicking feed intake in pigs; and finally  we describe the analysis of data to compare the efficiency of using group versus individual records for predicting BV in different scenarios and with different models. Assume that phenotypes for a trait (vector of individual records )  such as feed intake in pigs  are affected by additive genetic effects ()  litter effects ()  pen effects ()  and some fixed effects ()  along with residual effects ()  resulting in the following linear mixed model for individual records: where       and  are incidence matrices linking      and  to . Litter effects reflect the continuous effects due to common environment before weaning  while pen effects represent common environment effects during the grow-finish period. It is assumed that the random effects have the following distributions: where  is an identity matrix   is the additive genetic relationship matrix      and  are the variance of litter effects (hereafter referred to as litter variance)  the variance of pen effects (hereafter referred to as pen variance)  and additive genetic variance  respectively. The expectation and variance of  are: and . For a trait measured at the group level  for example  aggregated feed intake in a pen  the model for group records (here a pen is considered as a group) corresponding to the model for individual records can be written as: where  is an indicator matrix that links individual records to groups with number of rows equal to the number of groups and number of columns equal to the total number of animals with records. Element () of  is 1 if the th animal belongs to the th group  and otherwise 0. Matrix  also sums variables for each level of particular factor within a group. The model for group records can be written in the typical form of a linear mixed model: where           and . Thus   is the vector of group records with element   where  is the th row of matrix  with elements indicating the animals in the th group  and  is the number of animals in the th group. For matrices      and   the number of rows is equal to the number of groups and the number of columns is equal to that of matrices       and   respectively. Element  is either the number of animals in the th group at the th level of the fixed effect  or the sum of elements in the th group for a regression covariable. Element  is the number of animals of the th litter included in the th group  and the number of non-zero elements in the th row of  is equal to the number of litters involved in the th group. Element  is the number of animals of the th pen included in the th group. When considering a pen as a group   is a diagonal matrix with diagonal element  equal to group size. Element  is 1 or 0 to indicate if the th animal is in the th group. Thus  the number of 1 s in the th row of  is equal to the number of animals in the th group. The expectation and variance of  are: where  is a diagonal matrix with . Let     and  denote the rows of    and   respectively. For a particular group (here a pen<U+2009>=<U+2009>a group) with a size of   the variance of the cumulative pen effect for the group is: The definition of the pen variance at the group level () is based on the concept that the pen effect is the same for all animals j and j' within the same pen  i.e. . Thus  In the next section  we show that although one pen (i.e.  one group) has only one group record  it is possible and necessary to include pen effect in the model for group records where the number of animals per pen varies. The variance of the cumulative litter effect in a particular group is: where  is the number of litters within a group and  is the number of littermates from litter  in the group. The definition of litter variance at the group level () is based on the concept that if individuals  and  are littermates    or else . Let  and  denote individuals within litter   The variance of the cumulative additive genetic effect for a particular group is: where  is a sub- matrix for the animals in that particular group. The definition of the additive genetic variance at the group level () is based on the concept that the additive genetic covariance between individual  and  is . Thus  In other words   is equal to  times the sum of the elements in the sub- matrix for the animals in that particular group. Assuming that residual effects between individuals  and ' are independent  i.e.    where  and  are not the same animal  the variance of the cumulative residual effect in a group is: Therefore  as long as the model for group records is consistent with the model for individual records and the model is appropriate  estimates of variance components are consistent from both types of records. Comparison of Eq. () with Eq. () shows that the pen variance at the group level has a quadratic relationship with the number of pen mates  while residual variance at the group level has a linear relationship with the number of pen mates. This indicates that  in theory  a model for group records should include pen effects because it is difficult to handle the distribution of the residuals when they include pen effects and group sizes vary. It should be noted that  is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to  when considering pen as the group. If group (pen) size is constant   and   thus . In such a case  the covariance matrix for pen effects is proportional to the covariance matrix of residuals  and thus  pen and residual effects cannot be separated. Similarly  if each pen contains one whole litter    and thus  litter effect and pen effects are not identifiable. An example to demonstrate the model for group records and variance components is shown in the “”. Estimation of variance components and prediction of BV using group records were evaluated using simulated data of individual feed intake in a pig population. To simplify the simulation procedure  the simulated populations were under random selection and mating  sows had first parity only  and generations did not overlap. Each generation had 30 sires  each sire was mated to 20 dams  and each litter had six individuals available for testing. In total  eight generations of data were simulated. Only the last five generations of phenotypic data were used in the analysis but pedigree was traced back to the base population. Two sets of phenotypic values ( and ) were simulated. In phenotype 1  <U+2009>=<U+2009>litter effect<U+2009>+<U+2009>pen effect<U+2009>+<U+2009>additive genetic effect<U+2009>+<U+2009>residual  and the variance components were <U+2009>=<U+2009>120  <U+2009>=<U+2009>40  <U+2009>=<U+2009>40  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>200. In phenotype 2  <U+2009>=<U+2009>additive genetic effect<U+2009>+<U+2009>residual  and the variance components were <U+2009>=<U+2009>120  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>280. It was assumed that       and . A group record was defined as the sum of individual records within a pen. To investigate the effect of different group structures on estimates of variance components and BV  three group structures with an initial pen/group size of 12 were generated  i.e.  (1) L: all individuals of a litter were assigned to the same pen and thus  a pen included two litters; (2) L: a litter was randomly divided into two sub-litters of size 3  which were randomly allocated to pens  and thus a pen included pigs from four litters; and (3) L: individuals of a litter were randomly distributed to pens. Scenario L was taken as the base scenario for detailed analysis. To investigate the effect of group size on genetic evaluation  different group sizes were simulated  ranging from 3 to 30. In this setting  animals were allocated to pens in two ways  i.e. (1) sub-litters (each with three individuals) were randomly allocated to pens  and (2) individuals randomly allocated to pens. The construction of groups was performed within generations. In practice  group sizes in a dataset are not constant due to differences in pen size  rearing density between farms  etc. To create various group sizes within a scenario  20% of the individuals were randomly deleted (but all breeding animals were kept). Thus  group sizes within a scenario followed a binomial distribution with a mean group size equal to 80% of the pre-designed size. For each scenario  100 replicates were generated and analyzed  and the mean and standard deviation of these 100 replicates are presented. The standard deviation reflects standard error for an estimate of a parameter. For both datasets with or without simulated litter () and pen () effects  variance components were estimated and breeding values were predicted using the following four models: The datasets of individual records were also analyzed using the models for individual records (M  M  M and M  corresponding to M  M  M and M). In the analysis of the effect of different group sizes and structures on prediction of BV  M with true (simulated) variances was used to predict BV from phenotypes with litter and pen effects  and M with true variances was used to predict BV from phenotypes without litter and pen effects. Variance components were estimated by the average information (AI) REML procedure [] and BV were predicted with the BLUP method []. All analyses were performed with the DMU package []. The efficiency of using group versus individual records for predicting BV was assessed by accuracy and bias of BV prediction. Accuracy was calculated as the correlation between predicted and true BV for all animals with phenotype data. Bias was evaluated by regression of true on predicted BV. Variance components estimated from group or individual records of the basic scenario (L) using different models are in Table . Based on individual records for which phenotypes included litter and pen effects  as expected  variance components were estimated without bias using the full model (M). On the one hand  the models that ignored litter effect (M and M) greatly overestimated the additive genetic variance  which indicates that most of the litter effect moved to the additive genetic effect due to the strong genetic relationship between littermates (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5). Model M also overestimated pen variance  which suggests that part of the litter effect moved to the pen effect. On the other hand  the model that ignored pen effects (M) led to an unbiased estimate of additive genetic variance  but overestimated litter variance and increased residual variance  indicating that one part of the pen effect moved to the litter effect and the other part moved to the residual effect. Based on group records for which phenotypes included litter and pen effects  variance components were estimated without bias by using the full model (M). Models that ignored litter effects (M and M) overestimated the additive genetic variance but this overestimation was much less than the one when individual records were analyzed without litter effects  which indicates that only part of the litter effect moved to the additive genetic effect. The amount of overestimation of pen variance due to ignoring litter effects was similar to that based on individual records. Similar to analysis of individual records  the model that ignored pen effects (M) led to an unbiased estimate of the additive genetic variance  but overestimated the litter variance. Estimates of residual variances depended greatly on the model used for analysis. The model that ignored litter effects led to a slightly larger estimate of the residual variance and the model that ignored pen effects resulted in a very large estimate of the residual variance compared to the full model  which indicates that a large proportion of these effects merged into the residual effect. The largest estimate of the residual variance was obtained when using a model that ignored both pen and litter effects. These changes in estimated residual variances by different models based on group records are explained in the “” section. For phenotypes without litter and pen effects  variance components that were estimated with the true model (M) were unbiased regardless of whether individual or group records were used (Table ). When the model included litter and pen effects  the resulting over-specification had a very small effect on estimates of variance components based on individual records  but had an impact on estimates based on group records. Using group records  the model that over-specified litter and pen effects resulted in small estimates of litter and pen variances  which slightly decreased the estimate of the additive genetic and residual variances. The standard deviations of the estimated variance components from 100 replicates reflects their standard errors  which were very similar to the standard errors calculated with AI-REML (not shown). As expected  standard errors of estimates of variances based on group records were much larger than those based on individual records  which indicates a significant loss of information due to combining individual records into group records. When the model included pen effects (M and M)  estimates of the residual variance had large standard errors  which highlights the difficulty to distinguish pen from residual effects based on group records. As shown in Table   for simulated phenotypes with litter and pen effects  the models that ignored these effects greatly reduced the accuracy of EBV obtained from individual records  and those that ignored litter effects caused a serious inflation of EBV since the regression coefficient of BV on EBV was much less than 1. However  when analyzing group records  models that ignored litter and pen effects did not decrease the accuracy of EBV  while those that ignored litter effects led to a slight bias in EBV. The ratio of the accuracy of EBV obtained from group records to that from individual records was equal to 67.6%. For phenotypes without litter and pen effects analyzed with a model that included these effects  the resulting over-specification did not decrease the accuracy of EBV regardless of whether individual or group records were used (Table ). However  a slight deflation (reflected by the regression coefficient) of EBV was observed when using group records. This was in line with a small reduction of the estimate of the additive genetic variance due to over-specification. For phenotypes without litter and pen effects  the accuracy of EBV obtained from individual records increased slightly  while the accuracy of EBV obtained from group records increased considerably. The ratio of the accuracy of EBV obtained from group records to that from individual records was equal to 77.0%. These results indicate that the magnitudes of the litter and pen effects have a considerable influence on the accuracy of EBV when using group records. Accuracies of EBV according to group structure are in Table . With a given group size  having more littermates in the same pen led to a higher accuracy of EBV when using group records  regardless of the existence of litter and pen effects. The accuracy of EBV decreased from 0.53 when all animals of a litter were in the same pen to 0.41 when animals were randomly distributed across pens for phenotypes with litter and pen effects  and from 0.60 to 0.48 for phenotypes without litter and pen effects. In contrast  when using individual records  the accuracy of EBV increased slightly as the number of littermates in each pen decreased for phenotypes with litter and pen effects  and hardly changed for phenotypes without litter and pen effects. Figure  shows the accuracy of EBV obtained from group records when group sizes were changed from 3 to 30 (covering 1–10 sub-litters  respectively)  as well as the accuracy obtained from individual records for the scenario of group sizes up to 12. In these cases  the model used to predict BV was consistent with the model that was used to generate phenotypes. Clearly  the accuracy of EBV tended to decrease with increasing group size. This decrease was more marked for phenotypes with litter and pen effects than for phenotypes without those effects. In the scenario of phenotypes without litter and pen effects  accuracies of EBV obtained from group records with group sizes up to 12 individuals (average 12*0.8<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.6) and up to 24 individuals (average 19.2) were equal to 77.0 and 68.4% of those predicted from individual records  respectively. In the scenario of phenotypes with litter and pen effects  these proportions were equal to 67.6 and 53.0%  respectively. Accuracy (mean of 100 replicates) of EBV with different group sizes for phenotypes with or without litter and pen effects when three littermates together were allocated to a pen. The model used to predict BV was consistent with the model used to generate phenotypes Figure  shows that the accuracy of EBV tended to decrease with increasing group size in the scenario when animals were randomly distributed across pens. This trend was consistent with that in the scenario when a sub-litter of three littermates were in the same pen. Thus  for phenotypes without litter and pen effects  accuracies of EBV obtained from group records with group sizes up to 12 (average 9.6) and up to 24 (average 19.2) were equal to 66.6 and 55.9% of those estimated from individual records  respectively. In the scenario of phenotypes with litter and pen effects  these proportions were equal to 57.6 and 40.4%  respectively. Accuracy (mean of 100 replicates) of EBV with different group sizes for phenotypes with or without litter and pen effects when animals were randomly allocated to pens. The model used to predict BV was consistent with the model used to generate phenotypes In this study  we extended the model for group records of Olson et al. [] to the inclusion of multiple random factors such as litter and pen effects  as well as varying group sizes  and investigated the efficiency of using group records for genetic evaluation of feed intake in various scenarios. The extended model worked appropriately for analysis of the simulated data. The variance components estimated from group records were consistent with those estimated from individual records when the correct model was used  but had larger standard errors. Nevertheless  our results show that group records could be an important source of information for genetic evaluation of individual BV. Our results show that variance components of a trait can be estimated from group records  but the estimates had larger standard errors than those obtained from individual records. Variance components estimated from group records were consistent with those estimated from individual records when the correct model was used  i.e.  the model that included litter and pen effects if they existed. When litter and pen effects were present but ignored in the model of analysis  variances estimated from group records and from individual records were both biased but to different degrees. When litter effects were ignored  overestimation of the additive genetic variance was much larger when it was based on individual records than on group records. However  the change in the residual variances estimated with different models was much larger when they were based on group records compared to individual records. With the model that ignored litter or/and pen effect and used group records  the estimate of the residual variance depended on the number of littermates and the number of pen mates (i.e.  group size in this study). In scenario L  average  is equal to 12*0.8<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.6  the average number of litters represented in a pen is equal to 4  and the average number of littermates is 3*0.8<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.4. When pen effects are ignored and assumed to move to the residual effects  . Since  is a diagonal element in   the estimate of the residual variance with this model is expected to be approximately 584 but a slightly lower estimate of 558 was observed (Table )  because part of the pen variance actually moved to the estimate of the litter variance. Similarly  when litter effects are ignored and litter variance is assumed to move to residual variance i.e. thus  the estimate is expected to be 296. However  a much lower estimate of 226 was observed  because a large part of the litter variance moved to the additive genetic and pen variances. Finally  when both litter and pen effects are ignored and assumed to move to the residual effect  i.e. thus  the estimate from the model is expected to be 680. However  an estimate of 662 was observed  because part of the litter variance moved to the additive genetic variance. Litter effects are usually included in the model to predict BV for growth traits [  ]. In general  for feed efficiency in pig  BV is predicted based on individual records that are measured in a test station. Since in a test station only a relatively small proportion of the litters have more than one individual with records on feed intake  litter effects are often excluded from the prediction model [  ]. The current study showed that when there is a litter effect and more than one individual per litter is included in the dataset  a model that ignores litter effects results in overestimation of the additive genetic variance (Table )  a reduced accuracy of EBV and an inflation of EBV (Table ) when individual records are used. When group records are used  the model that ignores litter effects resulted in a slight overestimation of additive genetic variance and a slight inflation of EBV  but did not reduce accuracy of EBV in the simulated scenarios. Thus  our results suggest that litter effects should be included in the model for genetic evaluation of feed efficiency traits  even when using group records. On the other hand  over-specification of the model by including factors that do not have an effect on the trait  also has an unfavorable impact on estimates of variance components  as shown in analyses in which litter and pen had no effect on the trait but the model included litter or/and pen effects. This could be because REML estimates must be larger than zero. Our study shows that the unfavorable effect of over-specification was larger when group records rather than individual records were used. This could be due to larger standard errors of estimates that are based on group records rather than individual records  and thus a wider range of REML estimates above zero. As observed in the current study  over-specification of litter and/or pen effects in the model led to underestimation of the additive genetic variance when group records were used  but had a very tiny impact when individual records were used. Pen effects are often included in the prediction model for the genetic evaluation of growth and feed efficiency traits in pig [  ]. However  based on group records  the estimate of the residual variance had a large standard error when the model included pen effects  and sometimes there was a problem with convergence for both estimation of variance components and prediction of BV  especially when the number of individuals varied slightly between pens. If the number of animals per pen is constant  pen effects cannot be separated from residual effects  which suggests that it can be difficult to distinguish between pen and residual effects. An alternative to the full model for analysis of group records is a reduced model by combining the pen effects into residual effects  with appropriate weights on residuals. Thus    where . Then    where . This reduced model is equivalent to the full model but greatly reduces computation demand and avoids the problem of convergence in the prediction of BV. When the dataset of group records is insufficient for accurate estimates of variance components  the ratio  can be inferred from variance components estimated from individual records of feed efficiency  or other appropriate traits with individual records  such as daily gain. Given the same group size  having more littermates in the same group (pen) led to higher accuracy of EBV when group records were used. Our results confirmed previous reports that when relationships between individuals within a group were closer  the accuracy of EBV was higher when group records were used []. By theoretical derivation and data analysis  Peeters et al. [] concluded that the accuracy of the estimate of additive genetic variance increased as the level of relationships between individuals within a group increased. Our study showed that even when using the true variance components  the accuracy of EBV increased as the degree of relationships between individuals in each group increased (Table ). A possible reason could be that the proportion of additive genetic to phenotypic variance at the group level increases as the level of relationships between group mates increases. For example  assuming no genetic relationship between parents  based on Eqs. ()  ()  () and () and the parameters used in the simulation  if a group consists of four litters and each has three individuals          and thus  the ratio of  to  is 0.23. However  this ratio is 0.31 when a group consists of two litters and each has six littermates. In contrast  based on individual records  the accuracy of EBV decreased slightly as the number of littermates in the same pen increased when there were litter and pen effects. In a breeding program  the breeding goal usually includes many traits and most traits can be measured individually. Therefore  although more littermates in the same pen is favorable for genetic evaluation of feed efficiency based on group records  it is necessary to investigate whether this strategy is optimal for the overall breeding goal in a pig breeding program. The presence of litter and pen effects caused a slight reduction in the accuracy of EBV when individual records were used  and a large reduction when group records were used. This could be due to a quadratic relationship between the variance of the cumulative litter effects and the number of littermates  and between the variance of the cumulative pen effects and the number of pen mates. Considering a scenario in which a pen includes four litters of three individuals  the ratio of  to  is 0.23 when there are litter and pen effects  but increases to 0.46 when there are no litter and pen effects  although heritability for individual records is the same in both cases. We carried out an additional analysis to compare the accuracy of EBV based on group records and individual records for a trait with a low heritability  in the base scenario. In this analysis  data were simulated by setting <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000 for the scenario with litter and pen effects  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1080 for the scenario without litter and pen effects  but without changing the other variance components. This led to a heritability of 0.10. Based on individual records  the accuracy of EBV was 0.57 and 0.59 for the scenarios with and without litter and pen effects  respectively. Based on group records  the accuracy of EBV was 0.41 and 0.44 for scenarios with and without litter and pen effects  respectively. The ratios of accuracies for group records to those for individual records were 71.4 and 75.6% in these two scenarios  respectively  which were similar to those for a trait with a heritability of 0.3. These results indicate that heritability has limited influence on the efficiency of using group records for predicting BV  in terms of the accuracy in relation to that when individual records are used. In other words  group records are valuable for predicting BV  regardless of the heritability of the trait. In pig production systems  there are two popular structures of pens  i.e. (1) there is one feeder per pen (“single pen”)  and (2) one feeder is shared by two pens (“double pen”). We used the example in which a single pen has a group size up to 12 (average 9.6) and a double pen has a group size up to 24 (average 19.6). Accuracies of EBV based on group records of the double pen were equal to 87.8% (phenotype without litter and pen effects) and 77.5% (phenotype with litter and pen effects) of the accuracies based on group records of the single pen  in the scenario with an average of 2.4 littermates in the same group. These proportions were equal to 84.0 and 70.0% in the scenario in which pigs were randomly allocated into pens. Therefore  to use group records efficiently  we recommend a pen structure with one feeder per pen. The use of group records could also be valuable for predicting BV in other species. Biscarini et al. [] used cage records to predict BV for body weight and egg production in laying hens. Cooper et al. [] used pen records to predict BV for feed intake in beef cattle. Shirali et al. [] used cage records to predict BV for feed intake in mink. The extended model in our study enables the handling of multiple random factors and varying group sizes  which will facilitate the use of group records for predicting individual BV in all these species. Based on group records  full-sibs within group have the same EBV. When a multiple-trait model that includes traits with individual records (e.g.  group records for feed intake and individual records for average daily gain) is used  full-sibs within a group can have different EBV for the group recorded trait. However  these differences in EBV between full-sibs within a group originate only from differences in the correlated traits between full-sibs. Genomic selection [] has been successfully applied in pig breeding [  ]. With genomic data  genotyped full-sibs within a group can have different EBV even when a single-trait model based on group records is used. In practical genetic evaluations  a good approach would be to predict BV for feed efficiency by a multiple-trait analysis using a single-step genomic model [  ] and data that include individual (from a test station) and group records (from a farm) for feed efficiency together with individual records for correlated traits. Based on our findings  we conclude that the extended model for group records presented here can appropriately handle multiple fixed and random effects for estimation of variance components and prediction of BV using group records with varying group sizes. Estimates of variance components based on group records with unequal group sizes are consistent with those estimated from individual records when the correct model is used  although with larger standard errors. For traits such as feed intake in pigs  using group records for genetic evaluation of individual BV is feasible. For an efficient use of group records in genetic evaluation  group size should not be too large (e.g.  a normal pen with its own feeder instead of two pens sharing a feeder for feed intake in pigs). In addition  a close genetic relationship between animals within a group is favorable for genetic evaluation based on group records  which should be taken into consideration when placing animals into groups (pens).

The variance parameters of these models can be inferred using restricted maximum likelihood  which produces consistent  asymptotically normal estimates of variance components under the true model. These properties are not guaranteed to hold when the covariance structure of the data specified by the genomic model differs substantially from the covariance structure specified by the true model  and in this case  the likelihood of the model is said to be misspecified. If the covariance structure specified by the genomic model provides a poor description of that specified by the true model  the likelihood misspecification may lead to incorrect inferences.ResultsThis work provides a theoretical analysis of the genomic models based on splitting the misspecified likelihood equations into components  which isolate those that contribute to incorrect inferences  providing an informative measure  defined as   to compare the covariance structure of the data specified by the genomic and the true models. This comparison of the covariance structures allows us to determine whether or not bias in the variance components estimates is expected to occur.ConclusionsThe theory presented can be used to provide an explanation for the success of a number of recently reported approaches that are suggested to remove sources of bias of heritability estimates. Furthermore  however complex is the quantification of this bias  we can determine that  in genomic models that consider a single genomic component to estimate heritability (assuming SNP effects are all )  the bias of the estimator tends to be downward  when it exists."

The variance parameters of these models can be inferred using restricted maximum likelihood  which produces consistent  asymptotically normal estimates of variance components under the true model. These properties are not guaranteed to hold when the covariance structure of the data specified by the genomic model differs substantially from the covariance structure specified by the true model  and in this case  the likelihood of the model is said to be misspecified. If the covariance structure specified by the genomic model provides a poor description of that specified by the true model  the likelihood misspecification may lead to incorrect inferences. This work provides a theoretical analysis of the genomic models based on splitting the misspecified likelihood equations into components  which isolate those that contribute to incorrect inferences  providing an informative measure  defined as   to compare the covariance structure of the data specified by the genomic and the true models. This comparison of the covariance structures allows us to determine whether or not bias in the variance components estimates is expected to occur. The theory presented can be used to provide an explanation for the success of a number of recently reported approaches that are suggested to remove sources of bias of heritability estimates. Furthermore  however complex is the quantification of this bias  we can determine that  in genomic models that consider a single genomic component to estimate heritability (assuming SNP effects are all )  the bias of the estimator tends to be downward  when it exists. Genomic models that incorporate dense genotype information are increasingly being used and studied to infer variance parameters [   ]. We define a genomic model as any linear mixed model (LMM) that links a phenotype to multiple genotypes without knowledge of those that are associated with the phenotype. We refer to a general set of genotypes as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to the set of genotypes associated with the phenotype as quantitative trait loci (QTL). The variance parameters of the LMM can be inferred using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) []  which produces consistent  asymptotically normal estimators of variance components  even if normality does not hold and the number of QTL increases dramatically  tending to infinity []. These asymptotic properties of the REML estimators are not guaranteed to hold when the likelihood of the genomic model used for inference differs substantially from the likelihood of the true model that conceptually generated the data. In such a situation  the likelihood is said to be misspecified. In a Gaussian setup  given the fixed effects  this will be the case when the covariance structures of the data specified by the genomic and the true models differ.

Since these are typically unknown  in practice  the genomic model makes use of the available SNP genotypes instead in order to compute a covariance structure (referred to in our work as )  leading to misspecification of the likelihood. The patterns of realized relationships at different sets of loci vary across the genome []. Because of this   may provide a poor description of   and the likelihood misspecification may lead to biased estimators of variance parameters. REML was first implemented with a genomic model in []  where the focus of inference was the proportion of the variance of a quantitative trait explained by the LMM  including all genotyped SNPs simultaneously. In more recent years  concerns have been raised about the quality of the inferred variance parameters when genomic models are used without directly addressing the problem of likelihood misspecification. Speed et al. [] argued that uneven linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs can lead to upward or downward bias of variance parameters estimators. The consequences of using  instead of  on the likelihood were also investigated by []. These authors used the singular value decomposition of  and expressed the likelihood function of the genomic model as a function of these decompositions  concluding that the likelihood-based estimators are unreliable because they are sensitive to small perturbations on the eigen-values. This work generated back-and-forth discussions [  ]. The problem of misspecification of the likelihood of the genomic model was first raised by [] and was studied using simulation by []. However  in [] the authors addressed the problem by redefining the variance parameters according to the genomic models. In our work  we compare the variance parameters estimators to the parameters defined by the true model  as previously studied by []. The assumptions posed by [] on the true model  however  differ substantially from those posed by our study  which can lead to different conclusions. Jiang et al. [] assumed that the number of QTL associated with a phenotype are large enough to be considered infinite  an assumption which we consider rather unrealistic  and therefore our study assumes that the number of QTL is finite  although possibly very large. This work provides a theoretical analysis based on splitting the likelihood equations into components  isolating those that contribute to incorrect inferences. We describe a true model that associates a phenotype with QTL  and we use its likelihood as a basis for comparison with the likelihood of the genomic models. This theory was used to understand the potential bias of REML estimators of variance components under different scenarios  each with different assumptions on the true model  that are of interest in quantitative genetics studies. We start this section by describing a general model that links phenotypes of a complex trait to genotype data: where  is the overall mean   is a  standardized SNP genotypes matrix (with     and ;  is the count of the minor allele at the  SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF)   of the  individual  for all  and )   is an  vector of random SNP effects and  is an  vector of the model’s residuals. In the true model   is a  () matrix containing only the QTL  and all the elements and parameters that describe the model are sub-indexed with . In the genomic model   contains  SNPs  with  the number of markers (non causative mutations). When   we are in fact in the case of the true model  and when  the genomic model contains no QTL in the SNP data. The covariance structure specified by the true and genomic models are  and   respectively  which also define the relationships between individuals at the genotype level []. Let  (total variance due to the genotypes)  and   and define the matrix   we then have that . In genetics studies  the interest lies in estimating the narrow-sense heritability   the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the genotypes. Under the true model  the heritability is defined as . Analogously  under the genomic model we have . When we fit the true model (QTL only)   and consequently   for any number of QTL []  even if normality does not hold  as demonstrated by [] using large-sample theory. We also used large-sample theory to evaluate the likelihood of the genomic model  which is misspecified to the likelihood of the model that conceptually generated the phenotypes. Intuitively  if when we fit the genomic model  we obtain   then . This means that if   then . Therefore  because REML will yield the estimator   we focus our analysis on . Define . The REML log-likelihood of the genomic model is []: and by equating its gradient to zero at the point of maximum   is the root of the REML equation []: Using the eigen-decomposition   the REML Eq. () can be written as a function of  (see “Appendix ”): such that  is the root of . Now  since  for  sufficiently large (see “Appendix ”)  with   we can write the non-observable REML function at the root as the following (see “Appendix ”): We refer to Eq. () as non-observable because it is written as a function of  and   which cannot be observed directly when only phenotype and genomic data are available  and we have no knowledge about the QTL. The use of such function is purely theoretical as an aid to obtaining deeper understanding of REML mechanisms. In practical implementations  we find the root of Eq. () to obtain . We evaluated genomic models for SNP data consisting of QTL and markers that can be either uncorrelated or correlated  considering two configurations: (i) QTL plus markers and (ii) markers only. The covariance structure specified by these configurations  as well as their eigen-decomposition are denoted respectively by  and . Before we proceed to define our scenarios of interest and evaluate  for each of them  we provide a brief discussion about our assumptions for the true model. In the study by Jiang et al. []  the authors assumed that both the number of QTL () and the number of markers () increase simultaneously with increasing SNP data density (). Define  as the matrix of expected relationships between individuals  such that  []. Then   and using the eigen-decompositions    and   we can state that  and . Therefore    meaning that the REML functions of the true and genomic models become equal with increasing SNP data density. Because  []  if   it is straightforward that . We consider that the assumption that both  and  increase simultaneously with increasing SNP data density is too strong. Unless we consider the true model to be the infinitesimal model (in which a phenotype is generated by a countable infinite number of QTL  each with very small effect)  it is most likely that the number of QTL will be finite (it may still be large  but finite). Thus we assumed a fixed and finite number of QTL for the true model  and therefore . Our main objective was to evaluate how much of the variability in the phenotypes can be captured by   potentially leading to  being biased to . We used simulations to support the theoretical analysis of the REML estimators of  when using genomic models. A preliminary study indicated that 2000 individuals were enough to ensure the asymptotic properties of REML under the true model. The simulations were performed for eight scenarios that differed in population structure (completely unrelated or related individuals) and genetic architecture  in the linkage disequilibrium between QTL and markers  and the MAF of the QTL. We assumed independence between MAF and effect sizes when simulating QTL effects  and phenotypes were simulated using scaled genotypes  with a heritability parameter . 20 000 SNPs were simulated and for each scenario we estimated the heritability for 500 replicates that assigned 100 SNPs as QTL  and for 500 replicates that assigned 3000 SNPs as QTL. The algorithms used for the simulations can be found in appendices G to J. For each scenario  the heritability was estimated using the true model (QTL only)  and two genomic models  one containing the QTL plus the markers  and one containing the markers only. The key to evaluating the bias of  to the true parameter  is the term  for every   in Eq. (). This term corresponds to the diagonal of . The off-diagonals of this matrix do not feature in the likelihood of the genomic models  as can be seen in Eq. ()  and thus  are not relevant to the bias of . Nonetheless  we performed a brief analysis of the off-diagonal elements in our simulations  and verified that their values are centered at zero and within the interval (- 0.15 0.15)  regardless of the scenario. To simplify notation  we define: Here  we set out the conditions for asymptotically unbiased or biased   and in the following subsections we give details on how we arrived at these conditions:     (unbiased)     ( cannot be estimated)     (biased: downwards)     (biased: upwards) Note that  and  are monotone increasing to  and  respectively  meaning that if we have   such that  and   then . Thus  the direction of the bias of  for  is the same as that of the bias of  for . We know that  []. This holds for any number  of QTL  regardless of their MAF and correlation between them. Moreover  in the non-observable REML equation  . This means that for any set of eigen-values from any   for  sufficiently large   if  and only if  the structure of the non-observable REML equation is as: meaning that  is unbiased for  if  and only if    for all . There are two cases in which  is biased to : (1)  for   such that  is a positive constant; (2)  for   such that . Note that because the  matrix is built with centered and scaled genotypes  its eigen-decomposition has  degrees of freedom  and  always. In the first case that  is biased to   where  for   we have: Only  guarantees the identity in Eq. (). Therefore  when  for   no variance from the genomic data can be captured by REML. We now analyze the second case where  for . If the relationship between  and  is linear     then Eq. () ensures . However  because    and  cannot be linearly related  and  will be biased to . We have now: To understand the bias in this case  we will go through some details about . Let   with  and  (because ). Thus   satisfies From the unbiased case  we know that . This means that if   () will hold only if . Because the latter is monotone decreasing on   only an estimator  will result in  > 0. Now  if   then we have analogously that . In “Appendix ”  we show that for genomic models that include the QTL plus markers  in which markers are uncorrelated to the QTL  Assuming that the number of SNPs is always much larger than the number of individuals ()  . Since  and because  follow the Marenko-Pastur distribution when  is sufficiently large []  we have: Note in Eq. () that increasing the number  of markers will concentrate the eigen-values more strongly around 1. Hence  for  very large   at a faster rate than  increases  and . Since   the ratio  determines only the variance of  around . Therefore  a genomic model that contains QTL plus markers that are uncorrelated to the QTL will yield  such that . We also show in “Appendix ” that for genomic models that include markers only  Therefore   is a constant  and a genomic model that only contains markers that are uncorrelated to the QTL in the SNP data will always obtain   when REML is used. In “Appendix ”  we show that for genomic models that include the QTL plus markers  in which markers are correlated to the QTL  where  and . It is intuitive that   and therefore . Thus  a genomic model that contains all QTL and markers that are correlated to the QTL will yield  such that   only when   resulting in .  depends greatly on the distributions of the minor allele frequencies of the QTL and markers   and   respectively. When   unless the number of QTL is very small (say )  we find that  and  are very similar. It is intuitively obvious that in this case . Hence    and consequently . When   the larger the number  of markers  the more different  and  will be. Moreover  . This difference between  and  will ensure the inequality . Hence    and consequently . We show in “Appendix ” that   with the number of QTL  being fixed    and . The relationship between individuals increases the speed of convergence of  (when ) and of   when  increases. Therefore   and  decreases when the number of generations increases. Finally  we find that  and  are more similar when the number of generations increases. Thus  the choice of populations with increasing relationship between individuals tends to reduce the bias of heritability estimators (when these are biased). However  when   stronger relationships are necessary  so the downward-bias becomes less perceptible. The explanation for this is related to the range of the MAF. For any    for SNPs with low MAF is lower than  for SNPs with high MAF  and populations with more closely related individuals are necessary to compensate for this difference in  across different MAF ranges. We also show in “Appendix ” that for genomic models that include the markers only  Equation () is not so straightforward to understand analytically. Assume that we randomly pick just a few markers. These markers will most likely be in low LD with the QTL and   as shown in the previous section. When the density of marker data increases  we obtain Eq. (). We show in “Appendix ” that . This means that   with equality only when . Table  summarizes what is expected regarding the estimation of the heritability for a set of scenarios that are relevant in quantitative genetics studies  based on the theory detailed in the section Conditions for unbiased REML estimators. The REML estimation of  was performed on data containing QTL plus markers () and markers only (). It is known that   since the markers alone cannot capture more genetic variability than SNP data that contains both QTL and markers []. However  for scenarios in which markers are in LD with the QTL . When individuals are completely unrelated  such convergence is most probably unrealistic even with sequence data (although  approaches ). In populations with strongly related individuals  for  finite and sufficiently large. Figure  presents the simulation results for scenarios 1 and 2  Fig.  presents the simulation results for scenarios 3  4 and 5  and Fig.  presents the simulation results for scenarios 6  7 and 8. All three figures show the results for simulations that assigned 3000 SNPs as QTL. The results for the simulations that assigned 100 SNPs as QTL differed from those presented in Figs.    and  only by a larger variance around the same means. In all three figures  panel (a) shows the relationship between  and   for the true model (QTL only) and for both genomic models evaluated (QTL plus markers and markers only); the relationship in the simulated data agreed with the theory in the section Genomic models for scenarios of interest in quantitative genetics  for QTL uncorrelated and correlated to markers  respectively. In all three figures  panel (b) presents the confidence ellipses for the simulated heritabilities ()  with a simulation parameter   and the heritabilities estimated using REML ()  for the true model (QTL only) and for both genomic models evaluated (QTL plus markers and markers only);  was very stable around the simulation parameters  and  had confidence intervals that agreed with the results in Table . Note that when QTL were correlated with markers  in scenarios 3 to 8  the variability of  was smaller than that of  when QTL were uncorrelated with markers  in scenarios 1 and 2. In all three figures  panel (c) presents the confidence ellipses for the simulated heritabilities ()  with a simulation parameter   and the relative bias of  (). Note that when QTL were correlated with markers  in scenarios 3 to 8  the variability of  was smaller than that of  when QTL were uncorrelated with markers  in scenarios 1 and 2. Note as well  that the variability of  decreases when  increases. For scenarios 6  7 and 8  in which QTL were correlated with markers and   we found that increasing the number of generations (thus  increasing the relationship between simulated individuals) decreases the bias of estimation and the variability of  and . We have performed a theoretical analysis of the likelihood equations of genomic models based on splitting these equations into components in order to isolate and identify those that contribute to incorrect inferences. We have shown that the term in the likelihood equations that is responsible for producing potentially biased heritability estimators () is in fact a measure that evaluates whether  provides a proper description of  or not. The key measure to evaluate whether bias will arise in the REML heritability estimators is   for every   as we have shown in the section Conditions for unbiased REML estimators. Elements  correspond to the diagonal of   and the condition for unbiased  is that the portion of variance explained by the  component of  (defined by ) is equivalent to the sum of weighted correlations between its corresponding eigen-vector and the eigen-vectors of    . This identity is equivalent to saying that  and  are similar matrices in the general linear group of . Evaluation of this similarity of  and  is much more informative than a direct comparison of the elements of  with those of   or a comparison of their eigen-values (see Additional file   which presents the distribution of  and   Additional files    and   which present the scatterplots of  versus   and Additional files  and   which present respectively a scenario where  and  with   and a scenario where  and  with ). Hence  in the scenarios studied here  we can detect when a genomic relationship estimated by the SNPs correctly represents the true genetic relationships by verifying whether  and  are similar matrices in the general linear group of   by comparing  with . This comparison allows us to determine the presence and direction of the bias  as described in the section Conditions for unbiased REML estimators. Scenarios in which QTL and markers are in LE have been explored theoretically in other studies  with particular emphasis on the effect of the eigen-values of  on the likelihood of the (misspecified) genomic model [  ]. Although Kumar et al. [] discussed the relevance of the difference between the eigen-vectors of  and   they did not relate this difference expressed by the correlation between the eigen-vectors  implicit in   to the portion of variance explained by each  and . The performance of genomic models in estimating heritability was assessed mainly by describing the sensitivity of the likelihood to changes in the eigen-values  under the Marenko–Pastur distribution []. Indeed  the likelihood depends sensitively on all the eigen-values  but evaluating the likelihood given a change in each eigen-value separately is not as informative as evaluating the REML equation given a change in the distribution of all eigen-values simultaneously. Assuming that the number of individuals () is sufficiently large  and that the numbers of QTL and markers ( and ) both increase with increasing density of SNP data such that  and   Jiang et al. [] used the Marenko–Pastur distribution of the eigen-values to evaluate the limiting behavior of the term  in the REML Eq. () of the genomic model  proving that under these assumptions   is unbiased and consistent. Although Jiang et al. [] stated that  still remains unbiased and consistent when QTL and markers are in LD  we have raised a particular concern about inferences of  in the case when MAF(QTL)  MAF(markers)  such as when QTL are rare mutations  for which the estimates of heritability are empirically known to be biased [      ]. Two remarks about the approach used in [] must be made at this stage. First  the limiting behavior of  relies strongly on the Marenko–Pastur distribution  which holds only when the SNPs are in complete LE (and thus individuals are unrelated  since family relationships would induce LD). The second remark is that LD between markers and QTL and the distribution of their MAFs may alter correlations between phenotypes and genotypes  implied in  and   and this was not evaluated by Jiang et al. []  whereas in our study the correlations between phenotypes and genotypes are implied in  (see \"Appendix  and \"). Using our approach and the result that  []  we demonstrated in section Genomic models for scenarios of interest in quantitative genetics  that the conclusions from Jiang et al. [] about  are mathematically true  even when QTL and markers are in LD. However  in populations of unrelated individuals with QTL as rare mutations  an unrealistically large number (tending to infinity) of QTL would be necessary to ensure   and when we assume that the number of QTL is finite  . With the knowledge that the method proposed by Yang et al. [] may yield a biased  under some scenarios  several approaches have been proposed for solving the problem of biased estimates  exploring different genetic architectures of the trait and population structure. The theory presented in our study can be adapted to provide an explanation for the success of those approaches  and we offer an overview on how that can be done for five approaches. First  addressing the different MAF of the SNPs  Speed et al. [] suggests a weighting of the SNPs by their MAF  which would give the same weighting to terms involving  in the non-observable REML functions  owing to the change in the definition of the heritability. A G-matrix obtained using the SNPs suitably weighted according to the scenario will improve the relationship between  and   reducing the bias of . The definition of a suitable weight must be explored further  and the theory provided in this study provides a tool that can be used for such investigations. The genomic model in () can be generalized to assume different weights to the SNPs by simply changing the assumption for the distribution of  to   such that  is a diagonal matrix of weights. The G-matrix must then be defined as  to ensure that properties indicated in “Appendix ” and theoretical evaluations in the Results section hold. Second  and with the same objective of distinguishing SNPs by their MAF  Yang et al. [] suggested a method that is analogous to that proposed in [] by fitting the model with several genomic variance components  each of them relative to groups of SNPs with MAF values within the same range. In this approach  assuming the components to be independent  we can obtain a non-observable REML equation for each genomic variance component to be estimated  and the analysis then follows exactly as we have presented here. This approach also generalizes the genomic model in Eq. () by assuming   as described in the previous paragraph  with the difference that the values on the diagonal of  are to be estimated. Indeed the method is capable of removing the bias of . However  as observed by []  the increase in the number of variance components may increase the variance of   especially when independence between the components cannot be ensured  and  depending on the scenario evaluated  the estimates may be less reliable than those obtained by fitting a single genomic variance component. Edwards et al. [] suggested a third approach  which fits genomic models by including a variance component for SNPs grouped based on genomic features (i.e. genes and their gene ontology) to the model  which requires the use of prior information about the genomic data. The results of their study showed that a relevant amount of variance was attributed to the significant feature  and  in this approach can be evaluated with a non-observable REML equation for each component (SNPs grouped based on genomic features and SNPs not grouped based on genomic features)  just as we suggest for evaluating  obtained with the approach proposed by []. It is important to note that the genomic feature model works better than a single component when the feature component is enriched for the QTL; otherwise  this model can also lead to problems in the estimation of . The advantage of grouping SNPs based on genomic features instead of MAF is that there are fewer variance components  reducing the variance of . The use of prior genomic information to fit genomic models with mutiple genomic variance components was previously suggested by Speed and Balding []  who included a dynamic procedure to define a suitable partition of SNPs. A fourth approach considers the situation where prior genomic feature information is absent and Bayesian mixture models  such as BayesB [] or BayesR []  are reasonable solutions for assigning different distributions to groups of SNP effects []. Again  non-observable REML equations for each component can be used to evaluate  based on the assumptions posed by the Bayesian mixture models  and the assumptions can be tuned using the information from our suggested theoretical analysis. A fifth approach includes related individuals to study populations  which can greatly reduce the bias of   when it exists. This is because rare QTL induce genetic relationships between individuals. In populations of nominally unrelated individuals the common markers will disguise those induced genetic relationships at the QTL ()  drastically reducing the correlations between eigen-vectors  and resulting in . Conversely  in populations of related individuals  assuming no selection  the induced genetic relationships at the QTL will better reflect the kinship matrix ()  improving the correlation between eigen-vectors  and resulting in less biased . A last point to be raised in this discussion  concerns the direction of the bias of . We show in the section Genomic models for scenarios of interest in quantitative genetics  with our theoretical analysis  that when we consider a single genomic component in the model to estimate heritability (assuming SNP effects are all )  when it exists  the bias of the estimator will tend to be downward. An exception is observed when  and the number of QTL is smaller than the number of individuals. If genomic models are fitted including the QTL and markers  such that the total number of SNPs in the genomic data is smaller than the number of individuals  the heritability estimator will present an upwards bias. This fact is related to   as eigen-values that are zero are overestimated by . Increasing the number of markers will make  approach   forcing only the last eigen-value to zero and the overestimation will no longer be present (see Additional file ). When multiple genomic components are considered in the model  overestimation of heritability may be observed even when the total number of SNPs is larger than the number of individuals. When different variance parameters are estimated for each component  the multiple components approach is explicit  and overestimation of heritability will relate to components with a rank lower than . When a single variance parameter is estimated for SNPs associated with pre-determined weights  the multiple component approach is implicit  and overestimation of heritability as observed in [] may relate to  overestimating the largest . Associating pre-determined weights to the SNPs in the genomic model may inflate correlations  for eigen-vectors  that are associated with the highest eigen-values  resulting in   while correlations  for eigen-vectors  that are associated with the lowest eigen-values will be deflated  resulting in  (see Additional file ). In a Gaussian setup  the likelihood of a genomic model is misspecified with respect to that of the true model that conceptually generated the data. When used for inferring variance parameters the misspecified likelihood may yield biased estimators of those parameters  and inferences must be interpreted with caution. Misspecification of the likelihood is due to the difference between the covariance structures of the data specified by the misspecified and true models ( and )  and our study shows that the bias of REML estimators of variance parameters is linked to the relationship between the eigen-values and eigen-vectors of both models  occurring when . Moreover  comparison of  with the eigen-value  not only identifies the potential bias of variance components estimators  but is also a very informative method for comparing  with . The eigen-vectors reflect how each individual contributes to the proportion of variance explained by the components of  and  (defined by  and )  and if the contributions are similar  then   meaning that the covariance structures of the data specified by the genomic and the true models are equivalent. In mathematical terms   is the same as stating that  and  are similar matrices in the general linear group of . We have evaluated the similarity of  and  in a set of scenarios of interest to quantitative genetics studies  identifying those for which inferences must be interpreted with caution. Because of the many factors related to the genetic architecture that influence the similarity of  and  (LD between QTL and markers  presence and number of QTL in the SNP data  MAF  relationship between individuals) and the lack of information about the QTL  quantifying the bias (when it exists) of the estimators of variance parameters  is not trivial. Although the quantification of this bias is complex  we can determine that in genomic models that consider a single genomic component to estimate heritability (assuming SNP effects are all )  the bias of the estimator will tend to be downward  when it exists.

When we use the genomic model containing the markers only  from Eq.

When the density of marker data increases   also increases  but Eq. () is not so straightforward to understand analytically. Therefore  we use the identity  to help us understand what happens when we use a genomic model that contains only markers in LD with the QTL in the SNP data.

Nevertheless  the gene network analysis revealed candidate genes that are involved in shared biological pathways that occur in mammalian testes  in both lines. Artificial insemination (AI) pig industry focuses mainly on maximizing the number of insemination doses produced from each boar ejaculate. To achieve this goal  the ability of boars to produce high-quality semen (high motility and progressive motility with low levels of morphological defects) in sufficient quantity (large number of sperm cells per ejaculate) is decisive []. In recent years  with the fast advances in high-throughput genotyping and in molecular techniques in general  there is an increased interest in the study of the molecular processes and genetic mechanisms that affect semen traits. Genes and markers associated with pig semen traits have been described in the literature [      ]. However  very few studies analyze large datasets to identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) and to provide a deeper knowledge of the genes that control boar semen traits. One reason for this is the genetic complexity of the process for the production and maturation of sperm cells. Mammalian spermatogenesis requires coordination among different genes and cell types (germ cells  Sertoli cells  and Leydig cells) [] and occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in three steps: mitotic phase  meiotic phase  and spermiogenesis []. In the first step (mitosis)  spermatogonias produce primary spermatocytes  which enter the first stage of meiosis (meiosis I) and produce secondary spermatocytes. Then  the second step of meiosis (meiosis II) leads to the generation of haploid round spermatids. In the last phase  i.e. spermiogenesis  the spermatids undergo morphological transformations and acquire the spermatozoa shape. Then  the new pre-formed spermatozoa go through the epididymis to maturate and acquire motility []. Mutations and impaired expression of genes that control the whole process of spermatogenesis and sperm maturation can lead to problems in semen quality and fertility. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are commonly used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with QTL with major effects []. The weighted single-step GWAS (WssGWAS)  proposed by Wang et al. []  is a method that allows estimation of SNP effects using genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) from single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP  []) based on all phenotyped  genotyped and pedigree-related animals. In addition  it allows unequal variances for SNPs  which results in improved precision of the estimation of SNP effects []. Therefore  when the number of animals with both phenotypes and genotypes is small and the traits are controlled by QTL with large effects  the WssGWAS may perform better than traditional GWAS methods. Recent studies have used this method for production  carcass and reproductive traits in livestock [         ]. In a post-GWAS study  a gene network analysis can be performed for candidate genes related to QTL regions identified in GWAS. The gene network is used to investigate pathways and biological processes that are shared by these genes []. In addition  the biological information provided by these gene networks are helpful to understand genetic differences between populations for the same trait []. In this study  our aim was to identify QTL regions that are associated with four semen traits (motility  progressive motility  number of sperm cells per ejaculate and total morphological defects) in pigs. In addition  our aim was to identify candidate genes within those QTL regions that explained the highest proportions of genetic variance. To achieve our goal  we performed a WssGWAS in two commercial pig lines (L1: Large White type and L2: Landrace type)  followed by gene network analyses to investigate the biological processes shared by genes that were identified for the same semen traits in these two lines. Phenotypic data were available from two commercial pig lines  a Large White type line (L1) and a Landrace type line (L2)  on ejaculate samples that were collected between January 2007 and October 2014. The evaluated traits were: (1) sperm motility (MOT)  which is the proportion of moving sperm cells in an ejaculate; (2) sperm progressive motility (PROMOT)  defined as the proportion of sperm cells that move in a straight line; (3) abnormal sperm cell number (ABN)  which is the total number of sperm cells with morphological abnormalities; and (4) the total number of sperm cells in the ejaculate (Ncells per 10 sperm cells). MOT and PROMOT were evaluated using the UltiMateTM CASA system (Hamilton Thorne Inc.  Beverly  MA  USA). Ncells was calculated as the product of the semen volume (mL) and concentration (10 mL  measured by the CASA system). The values of this measure were not normally distributed  and thus log-transformed before further analyses (lnNcells). Ejaculates evaluated for ABN were analyzed microscopically at a 1000× magnification by a trained technician with a phase contrast microscope and a thermal plate (BH-2  Olympus  Tokyo  Japan)  counting 100 sperm cells per assessment. All semen traits were assessed on the day of semen collection using fresh semen. The phenotypic data for MOT  PROMOT and lnNcells consisted of 43 455 ejaculates for L1 (866 boars) and 39 161 ejaculates for L2 (900 boars). For ABN  the phenotypic data consisted of 13 366 ejaculates for L1 (849 boars) and 9853 ejaculates for L2 (886 boars). The average number of ejaculates per boar (with standard deviations in parenthesis) for MOT  PROMOT and lnNcells were 50.18 (38.12) for L1 and 43.51 (36.37) for L2. For ABN  the average number of ejaculates per boar were 15.74 (11.19) for L1 and 11.12 (8.99) for L2. Number of boars with phenotypic data  mean  standard deviation  minimum and maximum values of semen traits in L1 and L2 are in Table . Genotyping data for 3737 animals (856 males and 2881 females) from L1 and 3307 animals (953 males and 2354 females) from L2 were available. A majority of the animals (2718 for L1 and 2394 for L2) were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip (Illumina  Inc.  San Diego  CA) but part of the animals from L1 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1019) and L2 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>913) were genotyped using the (Illumina  Inc.) GeneSeek Custom 80 K SNP chip (GeneSeek Inc.  Lincoln  NE). Quality control was performed by excluding SNPs that had an unknown position on the pig genome build 10.2 []  that were located on sex chromosomes  that had a call rate lower than 0.95 or a minor allele frequency lower than 0.01  or that were in strong deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<U+03C7><U+2009>><U+2009>600). Animals for which the frequency of missing genotypes was higher than 0.05 were also excluded. After quality control  missing genotypes from animals genotyped with the SNP60 BeadChip were imputed with the software Beagle version 3.3.2 [] to the set of SNPs on the SNP60 BeadChip that passed quality control. In addition  genotypes from the animals genotyped with the GeneSeek Custom 80 K SNP chip were imputed to the set of SNPs on the SNP60 BeadChip that passed quality control. After quality control  39 945 and 41 478 SNPs remained for L1 and L2  respectively  and were used for the GWAS. The complete pedigree included 8352 animals for L1 and 8271 animals for L2. The total number of animals that remained after pedigree pruning was 6724 for L1 and 6502 for L2. Most animals had either phenotypic or genotypic data. The number of animals with both phenotypes and genotypes was 349 for L1 and 446 for L2. The weighted ssGBLUP analysis was conducted within line using the BLUPF90 software family [] adapted for genomic analyses []. First  variance components were estimated using AIREMLF90  which were then used in BLUPF90 to predict GEBV. SNP effects were then calculated using postGSf90 software. The single-trait animal model for ssGBLUP was as follows: where  is the vector of phenotypic observations;  is the vector of fixed effects (combined effects of AI station  year and month of semen collection; the laboratory where the samples were analyzed and the covariates of interval between two subsequent semen collections in days and age of the boar at the time of collection in months);  is the vector of random additive genetic effects;  is the vector of random permanent environmental effects;  is the vector of random residuals; and    and  are the incidence matrices of    and   respectively. It was assumed that    and  where    and  are the additive genetic  permanent environmental and residual variances  respectively;  is the matrix that combines pedigree and genomic information []  and  is an identity matrix. The inverse of  needed for mixed model equations is given by: where  is the numerator relationship matrix based on pedigree for all animals;  is the numerator relationship matrix for genotyped animals; and  is the genomic relationship matrix []. This matrix was obtained as follows: where  is a matrix of gene content adjusted for allele frequencies (0  1 or 2 for    and   respectively);  is a diagonal matrix of weights for SNP variances (initially );  is the number of SNPs  and  is the minor allele frequency of -th SNP. Estimates of SNP effects and weights for WssGWAS were obtained according to Wang et al. [] by the following steps: In the first iteration (): ;   where  []; GEBV were calculated for the entire dataset using ssGBLUP; GEBV were converted to estimates of SNP effects ():   where  is the GEBV of animals that were also genotyped; The weight for each SNP to be used in the next iteration was calculated as:   where  is the -th SNP; The SNP weights were normalized to keep the total genetic variance constant:  was calculated;  and loop to step 2. This procedure was run for three iterations based on the realized accuracies of GEBV according to Legarra et al. [] and performed by Wang et al. []. At each iteration  the weights for SNPs were updated (steps 4 and 5)  used to construct the  matrices (step 6)  update the GEBV (step 2) and  consequently  the estimated SNP effects (step 3). The percentage of genetic variance explained by the -th set of consecutive SNPs (-th SNP window) was calculated as described by Wang et al. [] as: where  is the genetic value of the -th SNP window that consists of a region of consecutive SNPs located within 0.4 Mb  which is the average haplotype block size in commercial pig lines []  including the lines considered in the present study;  is the total additive genetic variance;  is the vector of gene content of the -th SNP for all individuals and  is the effect of the -th SNP within the -th window. Manhattan plots showing these windows were created using the R software []. The selection of relevant SNP windows and the search for genes within these QTL regions were performed in three steps. First  for the four traits (MOT  PROMOT  lnNcells and ABN)  the SNP windows that explained 1% or more of the total genetic variance based on the WssGWAS were selected within each line (L1 and L2). The threshold of 1% was chosen based on the literature [    ] and on the expected contribution of SNP windows []. For example  assuming an equal contribution of all windows (on average  we had 4223 and 4229 windows for each trait in L1 and L2  respectively)  the expected proportion of genetic variance explained by each window was 0.02% for both lines (100/4223 for L1 and 100/4229 for L2). The threshold of 1% used in the present study is equal to 50 times the expected variance (0.02%<U+2009>×<U+2009>50<U+2009>=<U+2009>1%) and considered a suitable threshold for our purposes. Then  after selecting the windows that explained more than 1% of the genetic variance  a search for overlapping windows for two or more traits of the same line was performed. Windows were considered to overlap if their midpoints were less than 0.4 Mb apart. Second  the three most important windows (that explained the highest proportion of genetic variance) for each trait and the 0.4 Mb region on either side of these windows midpoints were also identified. Third  based on the windows selected in the first step (><U+2009>1% of variance explained)  overlapping windows for the same traits  but across lines  were investigated (also considering a maximum distance of 0.4 Mb between midpoints). Based on the start and end positions of each identified and selected QTL region in the third step  we identified the genes in these QTL regions based on the Gene database for  available at “National Center for Biotechnology Information” (NCBI  []). For all the identified genes  we manually searched the literature if they had a previously identified relationship with the traits under study. In addition  based on human genes with the same description  we carried out four gene network analyses that described the biological processes and relations between the L1 and L2 sets of genes that were identified for the same traits by using the ClueGO and CluePedia Cytoscape plug-ins [  ]. The ClueGO plug-in combines Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG/BioCarta pathways and develops a GO/pathway network. It also calculates enrichment and depletion tests for groups of genes based on the hypergeometric distribution and corrects the P-values for multiple testing []. Using the CluePedia plug-in  new associations between genes can be discovered with enrichments and added to the ClueGO pathways []. Estimates of variance components for all semen traits in both lines are in Additional file : Table S1. Low to moderate heritabilities ranging from 0.10 to 0.31 were estimated (Table )  with higher estimates in L1 than L2 for MOT  PROMOT and ABN. For L1  the three most important windows for MOT  PROMOT  lnNcells and ABN explained 14.4  18.2  15.67 and 18.8% of the genetic variance  respectively (Fig. ) and Additional file : Table S2. For L2  the three most important windows explained 21.9  18.7  18.3 and 13.8% of the genetic variance of each trait  respectively (Fig. ) and Additional file : Table S3. For L1  20 relevant QTL regions (single and overlapping) were found on SSC1 (SSC for  chromosome)  3  4  5  6  8  9  10  12  13  14  and 15 (Table ). For L2  16 relevant QTL regions were located on SSC1  2  3  6  7  8  9  11  13  15 and 18 (Table ). For L1  110 genes located in the relevant QTL regions were identified  of which six genes were described to be related to MOT  PROMOT  lnNcells and ABN in the literature (Table ). For L2  106 genes were found in the detected relevant regions  of which five genes were related to MOT  PROMOT  lnNcells and ABN based on literature (Table ).

Nevertheless  the gene network analysis for PROMOT revealed two genes in L1 ( and ) and one gene in L2 () that shared the biological processes of eicosanoid biosynthesis and arachidonic acid metabolism. The genes  in L1 and  in L2 were also found to share the biological process of cyclooxygenase pathway (Fig. ). Gene network of biological processes for progressive motility.

Green dots are biological processes for  In the past years  interest in investigating genomic regions that control boar semen traits has increased due to advances in molecular and genotyping techniques  statistical methods  and the ease of GWAS application. According to Wang et al. []  two of the most used GWAS methods are (1) single-SNP GWAS  which fits each SNP separately as a fixed effect in a model that accounts for population stratification; and (2) Bayesian methods  which analyze all SNPs at the same time. Nonetheless  when the number of animals that are both phenotyped and genotyped is relatively small  the application of single-SNP GWAS and Bayesian methods is limited  since the calculation of pseudo-phenotypes (i.e. deregressed breeding values []) is necessary []. An alternative method is single-step GWAS (ssGWAS)  which was proposed by Wang et al. [] and converts the GEBV of genotyped animals obtained by ssGBLUP into SNP effects. However  the ssGWAS model  which assumes equal variance for all marker effects  may be limited when traits are affected by large QTL [  ]. To overcome this limitation  Wang et al. [] proposed the WssGWAS approach  in which SNP effects are weighted according to their importance for the trait of interest  which improves QTL detection []. To perform the WssGWAS  first  the  matrix is calculated  by combining all known pedigree and genotype information  and then used in the ssGBLUP procedure to estimate GEBV for all animals. Then  the GEBV of the genotyped animals are used to estimate effects for the SNPs. Finally  SNP effects are used to calculate the percentage of genetic variance that is explained by sets of consecutive SNPs (SNP windows). In this approach  the SNP effects are not directly estimated from the model and there are no measures of uncertainty for the statistical tests. However  the WssGWAS provides information on the most important SNP windows  based on the proportion of explained genetic variance  which is a general concept that is widely accepted in QTL detection analyses [  ] but does not allow for a formal testing of significance. In this study  we chose the WssGWAS approach because: (1) it can integrate all phenotypic  genotypic and pedigree data simultaneously  thus avoiding the need to calculate pseudo-phenotypes for genotyped animals to incorporate all phenotypic information; (2) it allows the use of different weights for SNPs according to their importance  which is a deviation from the non-realistic GBLUP assumption of the infinitesimal model and improves the precision of estimates of SNP effects; and (3) it provides the possibility to work with SNP windows  since a window of consecutive SNPs in the GWAS may be more successful in finding QTL regions compared to individual SNP analysis because of linkage disequilibrium (LD). In general  analyses that consider the association of individual SNPs may overestimate the number of detected QTL []. In spite of the small number of animals that were both genotyped and phenotyped (349 for L1 and 446 for L2)  all the information of the 3737 and 3307 genotyped animals  the 866 and 900 phenotyped boars (849 and 886 for ABN)  and the 6724 and 6502 animals in the pedigree file  for L1 and L2  respectively  were used to calculate GEBV  and consequently  to estimate SNP effects in the WssGWAS. Obtaining a large dataset of both genotyped and phenotyped animals is unlikely or difficult for semen traits because phenotypes can be recorded only for animals that are used for AI. The number of males and females genotyped in this study also shows the relatively small number of boars  856 and 953 for L1 and L2  respectively  compared to the number of females  2881 and 2354. In this context  the advantage of WssGWAS is to supply additional information on relatives without genotypes in order to improve the statistical power of QTL detection []. In our previous study []  a classical GWAS (single-SNP GWAS) was performed for sperm motility in a subset of the L1 and L2 populations that were used in the present study: 645 and 1886 phenotyped and genotyped animals for L1  respectively  and 760 and 1972 animals for L2. Due to the small number of animals that were both genotyped and phenotyped  deregressed breeding values [] were calculated and included as response variables in the GWAS model  a polygenic effect was added in the model to account for population structure  and a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) was applied (q-values) to avoid false positives due to multiple testing. The results showed no SNPs with a significant association (q-value =<U+2009>0.05) with sperm motility for L1 but six SNPs associated with the trait for L2 (SSC1  from 117.26 to 119.50 Mb). In this QTL region on SSC1  a novel candidate gene () that affects translation efficiency of proteins in sperm cells  was identified. The number of relevant QTL regions that was identified for MOT in the present study was greater than in []  which indicates that the WssGWAS was more successful in detecting QTL. All the recommended steps for the GWAS method used were performed in each study and reliable candidate genes with biological meaning were found. In addition  Marques et al. [] reported high genetic correlations between MOT  PROMOT and ABN  which corroborate our findings regarding the overlapping QTL regions that explained more than 1% of the genetic variance for these traits. Therefore  we believe that the QTL results of the present and previous studies should not be considered as false positives and we conclude that the single-SNP method with pseudo-phenotypes and the amount of data in the previous study were not able to identify some of the relevant QTL related to MOT. For L1  we identified overlapping QTL regions for MOT and other semen traits on SSC1 (Table )  but they did not include the  gene described in our previous study []  likely as a result of the larger number of animals used in the current study and the different statistical models used in the two studies  i.e. WssGWAS based on the  relationship matrix in the current study and single-SNP GWAS using the  relationship matrix and deregressed phenotypes in the previous study. In the WssGWAS  we identified several relevant QTL regions associated with the traits under study  which confirms the assumption that these traits have a complex genetic determinism. In this study  the region used to search for candidate genes was not limited to the SNP window  but also included the upstream and downstream flanking regions. The use of a larger genomic region for the identification of genes is important because SNPs within a window may be in high LD with QTL in the surrounding area. We detected several candidate genes for the semen traits in both L1 and L2 pig lines (Tables  and ). For L1  the  () gene  located on SSC12  was considered the best candidate gene for MOT in the QTL region. The  gene encodes axonemal dyneins; the axoneme is a microtubular structure located in the center of all motile cilia and flagella  including sperm flagella []. Dyneins are large multisubunit ATPases that interact with microtubules to generate the driving force for flagellar motility []. Mutations in the human  are involved in defects of the axoneme []. For L1  some overlapping QTL regions were identified between MOT and PROMOT. On SSC5  we identified one candidate gene  i.e. - (). Pinto et al. [] described the expression of  in human sperm flagellum principal piece and showed that sodium channels contribute to the regulation of human sperm motility. Another candidate gene for both traits was identified on SSC13  i.e.  (). Li et al. [] showed that  knockout mice presented severe malformation and total immobility of their spermatozoa because of disorganized sperm flagellum axoneme. Harris et al. [] reported that mice with mutations in the  gene presented spermiogenesis defects  with incomplete sperm tail formation. We detected one overlapping QTL region in L1 for MOT  PROMOT and ABN on SSC14. This QTL region includes the gene   which is described as a -.  genes form a large gene family that plays a very important role in testis development and spermatogenesis []. In humans   is a subfamily of the  large gene family. In   only the  gene has been described. Wu et al. [] demonstrated that the protein encoded by this mouse gene is located in the acrosome of round and elongated spermatids and  knockout mice showed disorganized testis morphology and aberrant spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules. The gene network analysis was very useful to investigate the shared biological processes between the candidate genes that were identified for the same traits between the two lines. For PROMOT  we found two genes in L1 ( and ) and one gene in L2 () that are involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis and arachidonic acid metabolism  of which  and  are also involved in the cyclooxygenase pathway (Figs.  and ). Kaewmala et al. [] described the presence of  (-) protein in boar Leydig cells  spermatogonium and spermatids  which suggests that it may have a role in the spermatogenic process in pigs. They also showed that the levels of - mRNA and enzyme tended to be higher in animals with low sperm motility  which indicates that it has a negative effect on boar sperm quality. Frungieri et al. [] showed that the  enzyme is abundant in the interstitial cells of male seminiferous tubules with impaired spermatogenesis. The  enzyme provides a precursor for the action of  in testes interstitial mast cells (Fig. )  producing   ()  which regulates the function of Leydig cells []. Yamamoto et al. [] and Saharkhiz et al. [] showed that  after treatment with mast cells blockers  sperm motility increased in men.  is also involved in negative regulation of male germ cell proliferation (Fig. )  which is linked to  production. Moniot et al. [] identified the  pathway as one of the earliest signaling pathways involved in male germ cell differentiation in fetal testes. In the cyclooxygenase pathway   can be converted into   () or into  () (Fig.   steps IV and V). Schlegel et al. [] stated that seminal plasma is the richest natural source of prostaglandins  which are synthesized in the seminal vesicles. The authors showed that high concentrations of prostaglandins (especially ) in the human seminal fluid were associated with poor sperm motility. Rios et al. [] demonstrated that low physiological levels of  and  were able to increase and prolong human progressive sperm motility. Graphic scheme of pathways shared by genes found in network analysis for progressive motility. Only part of the cyclooxygenase pathway is presented.  () is involved in cleaving arachidonic acid from phospholipids  preferentially (I). Then  the free arachidonic acid is metabolized to produce eicosanoids (including prostaglandins) in the process known as cyclooxygenase pathway (II–V). The genes - (/-  number II) and  (  number III) are involved in this pathway. The - enzymes catalyze  () synthesis from arachidonic acid (II)  providing  for the action of  (III) and production of  () in testes interstitial mast cells.  can also be converted into  (  number IV) and  (  number V) For L2  the  gene () on SSC2 was considered the best candidate for lnNcells (Table ). According to Munier et al. []  this gene is highly and specifically expressed in testis and the encoded protein is important for the initial stages of spermatogenesis (before meiosis I). Choi et al. [] reported that  when expression of murine - (which shares 86% identity with its human homolog ) is reduced  the round and elongated spermatids in the testes become more sensitive to oxidative stress  leading to DNA damage and reduced cell numbers  showing that this gene is a critical factor for spermiogenesis. The  gene () is located in a region on SSC6 that explained 4.7% of the genetic variance for ABN in L2 (Table ). Lopez-Contreras [] showed that  expression is critical for spermiogenesis in mice. Its expression starts in the testis at the beginning of spermiogenesis and its mRNA level increases in more differentiated spermatids. During spermiogenesis  round spermatids elongate  develop an acrosome in the sperm head  form a flagellum  and dispose of the excessive cytoplasm []. Therefore  if a mutation in  causes impaired spermiogenesis  it may lead to morphological defects in the spermatozoa. The  gene () is located on SSC7  in an overlapping QTL region for MOT and PROMOT in L2. According to Liu et al. []  the METTL3 protein catalyzes the methylation and formation of N-methyladenosine (mA)  which is the most prevalent and reversible RNA epigenetic modification in mammalian mRNA. Yang et al. [] detected increased mA contents in sperm RNA from patients with reduced sperm progressive motility  which was related to a higher expression of . An overlapping QTL region for MOT and ABN was detected for L2 on SSC7 (Table )  which includes the  gene (). This gene was first identified in rat and human spermatocytes and may be involved in preparing chromatin for the initiation of meiotic recombination []. According to Ferguson et al. []  meiotic recombination ties homologous chromosomes together and facilitates proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Errors in the formation of crossovers can result in the production of aneuploid gametes. Sun et al. [] reported a higher frequency of sperm aneuploidies for some chromosomes in men with sperm morphological defects compared to men with normal sperm concentrations. Thus  the  gene in this QTL region on SSC7 is considered the best candidate gene for MOT and ABN. We identified several QTL regions that are associated with semen traits in two pig lines using the weighted single-step GWAS  which allowed detection of QTL in spite of the small number of animals having both phenotypes and genotypes. A large part of the genetic variance of the semen traits was explained by different genes in the two lines but the gene network analysis revealed candidate genes for these two lines that are involved in shared biological pathways in the mammalian testes. These results can be used to search for causative mutations and for marker-assisted selection to enhance the production and quality of semen for a more efficient use of AI in pig breeding and production.

The results show that methods available to alleviate differences between the founder populations implied by the two types of relationship matrices perform well; in particular  the meta-founder approach is advantageous. An application to data from routine genetic evaluation of Australian sheep is shown  confirming their effectiveness for practical data. Aligning pedigree and genomic relationship matrices for single step genetic evaluation for populations under selection is essential. Fitting meta-founders is an effective and simple method to avoid distortion of estimates of genetic trends. Genetic evaluation based on the use of genomic information has become a routine procedure in numerous livestock improvement schemes. Many employ the so-called single-step procedure for best linear unbiased prediction (SS-GBLUP) which allows for joint evaluation of genotyped and non-genotyped animals []; see Legarra et al. [] for a comprehensive review. The most widely used implementation involves a ‘simple’ extension of the pre-genomic ‘breeding value’ model  which replaces the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix (NRM) between animals by its counterpart  which combines the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) between genotyped animals with relationships derived from the pedigree. Henceforth  a predicted breeding value that is obtained by using the GRM and SS-GBLUP will be referred to as GEBV while PEBV is used to denote the corresponding value based on the NRM ignoring genotype information  and EBV alludes to both types. A problem inherent to combining genomically-derived and pedigree-based relationships arises due to different conceptual founder populations with potentially different means. For the NRM  the (unknown) parents of the first generation of pedigreed animals are considered to be the unrelated and non-inbred founder animals. Thus  the base generation is determined by the point in time where pedigree recording began. In contrast  genomic relationships are based on ancestral founders many generations back. Combining the NRM and GRM without accounting for these differences can result in biased predictions of breeding values  in particular EBV for genotyped animals may be biased downwards. This is akin to problems that have been encountered earlier on in genetic evaluation of beef cattle when PEBV of imported  superior bulls without appropriate local pedigree ties were found to be severely underestimated because they referenced the wrong  lower base []. Several procedures have been suggested to align the NRM and GRM [   ]. Typically  such modifications have been found to reduce the overdispersion that is often reported for GEBV. However  observed effects on corresponding accuracies are generally small  e.g. [  ]. A standard measure  which is routinely computed to demonstrate the efficacy of selection programmes in livestock is the genetic trend. This is usually obtained as the mean EBV of cohorts of animals in a generation or born within a given time period. To date and to our knowledge  there are no studies that have examined estimates of genetic trend in the context of SS-GBLUP. This paper considers the effects of different modifications  which are suggested for the relationship matrices involved in SS-GBLUP  on the estimates of genetic trend. After a review of the methods proposed in the literature  we demonstrate by using simulated data that different ways of centering marker counts or aligning GRM and NRM can substantially affect estimates of trends  especially for populations that are subject to intense selection. This is followed by an application to data from LAMBPLAN  the Australian sheep genetic improvement scheme []  representing a typical data structure where only relatively few animals have been genotyped so far and where these animals were born in the most recent years. Consider a SS-GBLUP analysis comprised of  non-genotyped and  genotyped animals  with allele counts for  markers summarized in matrix  of size . Assume standard coding of allele counts as 0 and 2 for homozygotes and 1 for heterozygotes. Let  and  denote the NRM and GRM  respectively  and  the joint relationship matrix. Assume animals are ordered so that  can be partitioned into blocks pertaining to genotyped () and non-genotyped animals () and the relationships between them (). The joint relationship matrix is then [] with the inverse [] The genomic relationship is commonly determined as a matrix of sums of squares and crossproducts of the matrix of centered marker counts  possibly with some differential weighting for individual markers. A popular form is Van Raden’s [] method 1: where  is the allele frequency of the -th marker and  is a matrix comprised of columns  with  a vector of length  with all elements equal to unity. Subscript ‘M’ is used to denote the ‘raw’ GRM as derived from marker information  without any modifications. Other formulations  extend Eq. () to weigh contributions from individual markers according to their frequencies (e.g. method 2 of [] or []). Van Raden [] emphasized that the frequencies  should be those in the unselected base  founder population. In practice  these are generally unknown and frequencies are commonly determined from the observed genotypes. Another choice is to assume that  for all   equivalent to coding allele counts as  and 1. An argument for the latter is that  for random choice of reference alleles  the expectation of  is 0.5 []. Moreover  this coding is obtained when integrating the likelihood function for the single-step model over the unknown allele frequencies [].  is often modified in some fashion to ensure that it can ‘safely’ be inverted  to improve alignment between the GRM and NRM or to account for residual polygenic variation. We use  to denote the modified matrix with  on the right hand side of the following equations representing the matrix to be changed. Since different procedures can be combined  the latter may represent either  as given above or  from a previous step. A common modification is to ‘shrink’ the GRM towards the corresponding part of the NRM: Often values of  close to unity [] are used to counter-act the problem of  not being positive definite when observed allele frequencies are used to center . Smaller values of  are used for analyses where it is deemed necessary to account for residual polygenic variation  i.e. additive genetic variance not explained by the markers  or to limit the influence of genomic information. For instance  values of  have been chosen for SS-GBLUP genetic evaluation of Australian sheep [] and beef cattle []. Suggestions for aligning  with  or  involve a modification of the form: where  denotes a matrix with all elements equal to unity. Factors  and  can be estimated by least-squares regression [] or determined by equating the means of the elements of the two matrices   and   and the means of their diagonals []. The latter may seem heuristic  but can be thought of as enforcing equality of a sample covariance matrix and its expectation for both matrices []. Legarra et al. [] interpreted  as ‘overall relationship’ and  as change in scale or genetic variance due to drift or selection. This gives: where  is a vector with all elements equal to unity and ‘’ denotes the matrix trace operator. Similarly  Vitezica et al. [] proposed values of This yields a value of  which is equal to the mean difference between  and   so that the means of elements of the modified GRM and the corresponding part of the NRM are equal. Several studies recognized that adding a multiple of  to the GRM shifts GEBV for genotyped animals by a constant  i.e. is inconsequential for analyses which do not include individuals without genotypes. For instance  Stranden and Christensen [] showed that allele coding did not affect relative differences between predicted genomic breeding values  provided the model included a fixed mean effect. Comparing different additions to the GRM  Tier et al. [] demonstrated that adding very different multiples of  yielded analogous results. Vitezica et al. [] emphasized that replacing  by  implies fitting a mean term  assumed to have variance  (with  the additive genetic variance)  arguing that the mean of random breeding values (of genotyped animals) should also be a random effect. The authors further showed that this is an equivalent model to fitting a single genetic group for genotyped animals explicitly with group proportion for their non-genotyped relatives given by ‘pedigree regression’  . Similarly  Fernando et al. [] proposed to fit a (fixed) mean for genotyped animals in SS-GBLUP implementations fitting a marker effect or hybrid model (rather than the breeding value model) to account for inappropriate centering of allele counts or imputation error. A simulation study considering such models for populations under selection  confirmed that estimates for  represented the mean GEBV of genotyped individuals when observed genotypes were centered by their mean frequencies []. Moreover  Vitezica et al. [] suggested that  could be interpreted as twice the so-called  or fixation index  which gives the average relationships of gametes for a given base population. They pointed out that the  based adjustment to change base population described by Powell et al. [] translates to a modification of  with  as above [see Eq. ()] and . However  please note that  depending on the choice of values for  and    is not guaranteed to be positive definite. Interpretation of  as a variance implies a positive value. The adjustments of form of Eq. () were proposed for the scenario in which markers were centered using their observed frequencies—different choices for  could readily yield elements of  much larger than of  and thus a negative estimate for  or an invalid   and should not be used naively. An alternative is to scale the NRM to be similar to the GRM  so as to account for ancestral relationships that are captured by genomic information but not the pedigree. This is similar to earlier attempts to account for prior inbreeding in genetic evaluation; see Van Raden []. Let  represent the degree of ‘self-relationship’ among the base animals in the pedigree. Christensen [] then proposed to replace  with: Using the Sherman–Morrison matrix identity  gives the inverse: as   with  denoting the number of founders in the pedigree. This modification is of the same form as the  based adjustment of  []. Indeed  Garcia-Baccino et al. [] showed that  can also be interpreted as twice the  index. Hence  it attempts to change the base population for pedigreed individuals. Legarra et al. [] subsequently demonstrated that the same adjustment can be obtained by augmenting the pedigree with a so-called meta-founder  a conceptual parent which replaces the unknown parents of founder animals in the pedigree  acting as both sire and dam. This framework is attractive as it allows for computation of the terms required to build   specifically  and the submatrix of  for genotyped animals    with minor modifications of commonly used existing algorithms for these tasks. Moreover  multiple base populations are readily accommodated by allowing for separate metafounders and replacing the scalar  with a positive definite matrix  with diagonal elements equal to the individual self-relationships and off-diagonal elements comprised of across population relationships. This makes it suitable for the analysis of crossbred populations; see  for instance  [] for an application. Alternatively  metafounders can be thought of as a generalisation of the ‘phantom parents’ to model genetic groups for unknown parents for genetic evaluation using pedigree information []. Let  and  denote the equivalents to  and  for multiple meta-founders. Both [] and [] presented algorithms to evaluate the terms required to set up    or  and  or  recursively  extending the procedures of Quaas [] and Colleau []. Similarly  both described likelihood based approaches to estimate  or . Centering marker counts by  and with  denoting the centered matrix of allele counts  this requires maximising: with respect to the elements of   with Variable  represents a measure of heterozygosity  similar to  above. While estimation of  from Eq. () involves numerical optimisation  Eq. () is of closed form and  can be obtained directly. Alternatively   and  can be estimated based on summary statistics. For a single metafounder []  and Subsequently  Garcia-Baccino et al. [] described generalised least squares estimators for  or . For a single metafounder  where  denotes the vector of centered allele counts for the -th locus (). An estimate of  is then obtained as twice the variance of  across loci. Furthermore  [] outlined corresponding maximum likelihood schemes  based on the assumption that the  are normally and independently distributed. The authors presented a simulation study for a single metafounder  reporting that both methods estimated  accurately while the summary statistics based approach tended to yield overestimates. As noted by Strandén et al. []  quantities  given in Eq. () are estimates of (twice) the founder allele frequencies as proposed by McPeek et al. []. These are readily calculated for large numbers of genotyped animals  using: where  are the submatrices of  corresponding to the partitioning of  for genotyped and non-genotyped individuals. Hence   in Eq. () can be obtained by using sparse matrix calculations without the need to invert a large matrix  requiring the factorisation of  instead []. In addition  it has been suggested to weigh  and   differently when constructing   i.e. or similar. Suitable values for  and  were commonly determined experimentally by evaluating their effect on the inflation of genomic breeding values. Reduction in bias for values different from unity with little effect on accuracy have been reported for dairy cattle genetic evaluation [  ]. In particular  reducing the weight on  appeared advantageous () by reducing the effects of a high proportion of incomplete pedigrees []. Garcia-Baccino et al. [] emphasized that the metafounder approach would act in a similar fashion  albeit with a theoretically justified basis. Martini et al. [] showed that weighting of  and  as in Eq. () is equivalent to replacing the diagonal block for genotyped animals in  [see Eq. () above] with: which can be thought of as a weighted harmonic mean of  and . Note that  depending on the choice of  and    again is not guaranteed to be positive definite. To examine the effects of different methods of aligning  and   data were simulated using the software package   [] adopting the scenario used by [] and [] to mimic a livestock population under selection (Parameter file available at ); see their papers for details. This was modified slightly to consider a trait recorded on both sexes and by reducing the number of markers. In brief  this yielded records and genotypes comprised of allele counts for 46 500 loci for 2800 unselected animals with unknown parents in generation 0 and 2600 animals in each of 10 overlapping generations  28 800 in total. Records were sampled for a trait with a phenotypic variance of 10 and heritability of 0.3. Parents of the next generation were selected based on their breeding values  obtained by BLUP using the (pedigree) numerator relationship matrix. Selection involved replacement of 80 out of 200 sires and 520 out of 2600 dams in each generation. A total of 25 replicates were obtained and analysed. Data were analysed by considering successive subsets of genotypes in generations  through to 10  for  and 10. Markers with minor allele frequencies lower than 0.02 were disregarded. In addition  a ‘pedigree BLUP’ analysis was carried out  ignoring all genotypes. Records and pedigree information for all generations were used throughout. Restricted maximum likelihood analyses to estimate genetic and residual variances were carried out by fitting a linear model with an overall mean as the only fixed effect and animals’ genetic merit as random effects  obtaining predicted breeding values at convergence. The inverse of the joint relationship matrix between genotyped and non-genotyped animals was built in three ways. First   was constructed without any attempt to align  and   referred to as model . Second  for model  the GRM was augmented by  as proposed by Vitezica et al. []. Preliminary analyses had shown negligible differences in results for  to corresponding analyses using the forms of adjustment suggested by [] or []  and the latter were thus not examined any further. Lastly for model    and  in  [see Eq. ()] were replaced with  and its submatrix for genotyped individuals    with  as for . This was done by augmenting the mixed model with a single meta-founder. The degree of self-relationship    for each subset of genotypes considered was estimated using the generalised least-squares procedure described by Garcia-Baccino et al. [] and  and  were built following Legarra et al. []. In turn   was constructed using up to four different sets of allele frequencies to center . The first  denoted as   was calculated using all observed genotypes in the subset  as is common practice. Second  only the genotypes for the first generation available were used  yielding case . For comparison  the third scheme    considered the founder frequencies  i.e. for individuals in generation 0. Finally  all frequencies were assumed to be equal to 0.5 (). No weighted averaging between  and  was performed  i.e.  was used. Instead  safely positive definite matrices  were ensured by augmenting their diagonal elements with a constant of 0.05. The examined summary statistics included mean EBV for each generation and coefficients for the regression of true on predicted breeding values for individuals in generation 10. In addition  mean GEBV per generation for each genomic analysis were deviated from the corresponding PEBV values  after standardising the ‘location’ of curves by subtracting the mean GEBV or PEBV for generation 0 from the respective means for all generations. A measure of discrepancy between estimates of genetic trends for different analyses was then calculated as the Frobenius norm of the resulting vector. Standardisation ensured that this quantity reflected only differences in shape of the trajectories. Analyses were carried out using our mixed model software WOMBAT  building  by using a recently added module to carry out the associated calculations [  ]. Methods were also tested for Australian sheep data  using records from the LAMBPLAN [] maternal breeds genetic evaluation for the trait ‘number of lambs born in one year old ewes’ ()  defined as number of lambs born per ewe mated. A total of 19 564  records were collected on ewes born between 2007 and 2016. Of the ewes with records  905 were genotyped. In addition  there were 275 animals in the pedigree with genotypes available but no records  mostly sires. This yielded a total of 1180 genotypes included in the SS-GBLUP analyses. Genotypes were comprised of marker allele counts from either 12 or 50 K ovine SNP chips (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA)  with 12 K genotypes imputed to 50 K. Table  summarizes numbers of records and numbers of genotyped ewes per year of birth  showing that genotyped animals were concentrated in the more recent data. The pedigree records available included 34 947 animals  extending back to animals born in the late 1980’s. However only animals born from the year 2000 onwards were considered in the calculation of genetic trends. Data for  were analysed using WOMBAT which involved fitting single trait animal models with a fixed effect for contemporary group (250 levels) and an additional random effect for service sire (291 levels). The genetic effect was again fitted either without genotypes as ‘pedigree BLUP’  or with genotypes as SS-GBLUP fitting  as described above: for  no attempt was made to align  with   for   was augmented with   and  the meta-founder approach with  estimated from the data was used. To construct   all observed genotypes () were used to calculate allele frequencies. In addition  analyses were repeated assuming frequencies of 0.5 () for  only. For   two values of the parameter  (see Eq. ()) were used to compute a weighted average of  and   1 as above and 0.5 as used in routine SS-GBLUP evaluations for Australian sheep []. Estimates of genetic trend for a single replicate for different scaling methods and allele frequencies. Simulated data  Allele frequencies:  ignoring genotypes (pedigree analysis)   using observed frequencies in first generation available   using observed frequencies from all genotypes  and  assuming frequencies of 0.5  Considering genotypes in selected generations: 0 to 10  4 to 10  7 to 10 and 10 only Estimates of genetic trend for different analyses and amounts of genotypes available are shown in Fig.  for a single replicate (results for the subset comprising generations 2 to 10 were omitted). This is representative of the typical pattern observed for all replicates. All panels show mean PEBV as a reference. The latter were virtually identical to corresponding true means  scaled to zero for generation 0 (not shown). Considering genotypes for generation 10 only  allele centering strategies  and  are the same and only  is shown. For model  and   the estimate of  when considering all genotypes was negative and  was not positive definite  causing the analysis to fail. Without modifications of  or   using observed frequencies () to center allele counts  mean GEBV were shifted downwards. The resulting trend curve was parallel to the corresponding curve of pedigree means when all animals were genotyped  i.e. individuals were ranked correctly and  without the need to align GEBV for genotyped and non-genotyped animals  the shift is inconsequential. Indeed  in practical evaluation schemes  estimates are often scaled to a selected  fixed base  i.e. the ‘shape’ rather than ‘location’ of estimated trend trajectories is important. As fewer generations of genotypes were considered  the discrepancy between curves increased. For this method of centering  the mean of the genotyped animals used to determine the allele frequencies is forced to be zero []. As especially evident when considering genotypes in generation 10 only  this can lead to a marked distortion of the estimated trend. Conversely  as expected  using founder frequencies (generation 0  ) resulted in trend estimates that are indistinguishable from the pedigree values for all subsets of genotypes (not shown). Consequently  using only the first generation of observed genotypes () to estimate allele frequencies resulted in less biased estimates of trends but again altered the shape of the trajectory by forcing the mean GEBV for that generation to be zero. Similarly  assuming gene frequencies of 0.5 yielded mean GEBV per generation that are reasonably close to the pedigree values. In part  this may be attributable to the fact that the mean allele frequency (across loci and replicates) in generation 0 was 0.48  i.e close to 0.5. However  whereas the average proportion of loci with frequencies in the middle deciles (0.4–0.6) was 24%  13% of markers had frequencies in the extreme deciles ( or ). Estimates of  for  for  increased with the first generation number for which genotypes were considered: values were 0.027  0.041  0.071 and 0.111 for genotypes in generations 2 to 10  4 to 10  7 to 10 and 10 only  respectively (if all genotypes were considered  the estimate was close to zero  0.018  i.e. there was virtually no modification  as for ). This yielded mean GEBV very close to mean PEBV when only genotypes in the last or last few generations were used  but less close agreement otherwise. The simulation involved strong selection and associated sizeable changes in allele frequencies over generations. While  corrects for changes in mean due to selection or drift  it does not allow for the accompanying reduction in genetic variance from the conceptual base population []. Results suggest that estimates of a global  for all generations may not be sufficient if many generations are genotyped. Centering using  or  for  was not considered as these resulted in negative estimates of  and thus non-positive definite matrices . Finally  modifying  to align with  yielded parallel curves for all four types of centering. Estimates of  decreased slightly as fewer generations of genotypes were considered  0.548  0.543  0.540  0.539 and 0.537 for generations 0 to 10 to generation 10 only. As above  using all observed genotypes () to construct  resulted in the largest shift  with the mean GEBV for genotyped animals forced to zero. However  fitting a metafounder yielded an estimate of the shift. For instance  for  these were - 3.50 (0–10)  - 4.34 (2–10)  - 5.16 (4–10)  - 6.34 (7–10) and - 7.56 (10 only). Subtracting these estimates from the corresponding mean GEBV then shifted the trajectories to be superimposed on the curve for mean PEBV. This held for all types of frequencies. Assuming frequencies of 0.5  GEBV for the metafounder were expected to be zero  i.e. GEBV should have been aligned correctly. In practice  there were small deviations. This may  at least in part  be attributed to sampling or other errors in the estimate of . Christensen [] emphasized that  strictly speaking   should be estimated using observed phenotypes as well as genotypes  and reported slight overestimates when ignoring phenotypes. There was little variation in results over replicates. Table  summarises selected means of the Frobenius norm of the vector of differences between mean EBV from pedigree and genomic analyses and their standard deviations across replicates. Mean Frobenius norms confirm the observations on a single replicate above: if founder allele frequencies were known and used to construct  no alignments would be needed. In the absence thereof  fitting a metafounder and using the resulting estimates of its effect to account for the shift in GEBV due to selection yields comparable results. We also provide the corresponding statistics for the regression of true on predicted breeding values for individuals in the last generation. Mean regression coefficients were close to the theoretical value of unity when all animals were genotyped  using founder frequencies to center allele counts or fitting a metafounder. For  with frequencies  and  with  some under-dispersion of GEBV (regression coefficients ) was apparent when only individuals in the last few generations were genotyped. This was not reflected in the corresponding mean norm values. For pedigree only analyses  the mean regression was 0.984 with standard deviation of 0.034. Simulations considered the scenario where all animals in a generation were either genotyped or not. In practice  this is unlikely. Simulations were thus repeated deleting genotype information for every third animal (not shown). For case  using observed frequencies  either  or   reduced regression coefficients further  the more so the fewer genotyped generations were considered. For instance  for  and genotypes in generation 10 only  the regression of true on predicted breeding values dropped to 0.55. Whereas standard deviations across replicates increased slightly  regression coefficients for the other cases differed little from the values given in Table   i.e. they remained close to unity. Corresponding mean Frobenius norms (not shown) were somewhat smaller as fewer individuals were genotyped. Estimates of genetic trend for different methods of scaling relationship matrices and assumed allele frequencies. Sheep data for trait ‘number of lambs born in one year old ewes’  Allele frequencies:  ignoring genotypes (pedigree analysis)  using observed frequencies (all genotypes) for    using observed frequencies (all genotypes) for   and  assuming frequencies of 0.5 Estimates of genetic trend for different analyses of the sheep data are shown in Fig. . Corresponding values of the Frobenius norm for deviations from ‘pedigree BLUP’ results are summarized in Table   together with estimates of heritabilities and phenotypic variances. As for the simulated data  estimates of genetic trend for SS-GBLUP without any attempts to align  and  (top panel) differed substantially from the pedigree-based estimates  especially for the years with genotyped animals. Reducing the influence of genomic information by replacing the GRM with the average of  and  () reduced differences markedly. Modifying  as suggested by Vitezica et al. [] yielded a GEBV trajectory which was mostly parallel to that for pedigree only analyses (middle panel; considering  only)  i.e. of the correct shape but with some shift in location evident (for an estimate of ). Results for analyses fitting a meta-founder shown in Fig.  are mean GEBV adjusted for the estimate of the meta-founder effect (in contrast to corresponding results in Fig.  which are mean GEBV prior to adjustment for the meta-founder). The predicted value for the meta-founder was - 0.077 for  and an estimate of . Hence  estimated trends for all analyses agreed well  although there was a tendency for mean GEBV in the last few years to be slightly lower than corresponding mean PEBV. Presumably this is  at least partially  a reflection of the small number of genotypes available and resulting sampling errors. Estimates of heritability and phenotypic variances varied little between analyses  with the estimated variance ratio for the service sire effect equal to 0.04 throughout. Values for the discrepancy in genetic trends between SS-GBLUP and pedigree BLUP analyses reflected observations for Fig.   with small numerical values which are an artifact of low phenotypic variances. Joint genetic evaluation of genotyped and non-genotyped animals in a single-step analysis has become a standard procedure. Results clearly illustrate that care has to be taken to model different means and conceptual founder populations appropriately  especially for populations under selection. In particular  estimates of genetic trends are easily distorted and can differ with the assumptions on gene frequencies or the way they are estimated. As reviewed briefly  various methods have been suggested to combine or align the pedigree-based and genomically-derived relationship matrices or scale selected components of  to improve the accuracy or reduce the bias in GEBV from SS-GBLUP analyses. Moreover  most of these are easy to apply. Current livestock improvement schemes typically have genotype information for the most recent generation(s) of animals only  especially for the more extensive industries such as sheep and beef cattle. Results show that both scaling of  to align with   or  vice versa  scaling  to match  are effective for this scenario  with estimates of genetic trends in good agreement with true values (simulation) or results from pedigree only analyses. However  when more generations of genotypes are considered  estimated trajectories tend to be shifted somewhat (although still of the correct shape)  especially when centering marker allele counts using all observed genotypes to estimate gene frequencies. In this case  the meta-founder approach has an immediate advantage: the GEBV for the meta-founder provides an estimate for the shift in GEBV—and adjusting for it yields the correct location for the curve. The expectation for the latter is a mean of zero for the founder generation. For practical applications where models of analysis include many fixed effects (as in our sheep example) this may differ somewhat if fixed effects and animals are sufficiently confounded so that fixed effects remove some of the trend. Analogously  the shift may be estimated for MG by fitting an equivalent model including a genetic group effect []  but this was not considered. Moreover  for the meta-founder approach coefficients for the regression of true on predicted breeding values (simulation) were essentially equal to unity  while adding  to   resulted in slight deflation (coefficients ) when only genotypes in recent generations were considered. Adjusting  to align with  makes the genomic base of the reference population. The parameter   estimated from the genomic information and ranging from 0 to 2  can be interpreted as the degree of homozygosity among the pedigree founders that would yield observed relationships closest to those in   where  is obtained assuming allele frequencies equal to 0.5. In other words   refers to a conceptual  genomic base with maximum variability for all loci []. Alignment of pedigree-based and genomic relationship matrices for single-step genetic evaluation of populations under selection is essential. Making the pedigree based relationship to be compatible with genomic information by fitting meta-founders is simple and effective. Misztal I  Legarra A  Aguilar I.

Cannibalism is a social behavior where individual survival is affected by direct genetic effects (DGE) and indirect genetic effects (IGE).

Cannibalism is a social behavior where individual survival is affected by direct genetic effects (DGE) and indirect genetic effects (IGE). Previous studies analysed repeated binomial survival  instead of survival time  which improved accuracies of breeding value predictions. Our study aimed at identifying SNPs associated with DGE and IGE for survival time  and comparing results from models that analyse survival time and repeated binomial survival. Survival data of three layer crosses (W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC) were used. Each individual had one survival time record and 13 monthly survival (0/1) records. Approximately 30 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the genome-wide association study (GWAS)  using a linear mixed model for survival time  a linear mixed model and a generalized linear mixed model for repeated binomial survival (0/1). Backwards elimination was used to determine phenotypic and genetic variance explained by SNPs. The same quantitative trait loci were identified with all models. A SNP associated with DGE was found in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  with an allele substitution effect of 22 days. This SNP explained 3% of the phenotypic variance  and 36% of the total genetic variance. Four SNPs associated with DGE were found in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  with effects ranging from 16 to 35 days. These SNPs explained 1 to 6% of the phenotypic variance and 9 to 44% of the total genetic variance. Our results suggest a link of DGE and IGE for survival time in layers with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system  since a SNP located near a gene for a GABA receptor was associated with DGE and with IGE (not significant). This is one of the first large studies investigating the genetic architecture of a socially-affected trait. The power to detect SNP associations was relatively low and thus we expect that many effects on DGE and IGE remained undetected. Yet  GWAS results revealed SNPs with large DGE and a link of DGE and IGE for survival time in layers with the GABAergic system  which supports existing evidence for the involvement of GABA in the development of abnormal behaviors. Mortality due to cannibalism has important welfare and economic implications in the commercial laying hen industry. Brinker et al. [] reported mortality to be between 22 and 37% in crossbred chickens with intact beaks  while beak-trimmed hens of the same crosses showed a mortality of 2 to 3% at the end of the laying period (personal communication J. Visscher)  which indicates that a substantial part of the mortality is due to cannibalism. Previous research revealed that survival time is affected both by an individual’s own genes (direct genetic effects; DGE) and by genes of its group mates (indirect genetic effects; IGE). It was found that IGE contribute 33 to 76% of the heritable variation in survival time in purebred and crossbred laying hens with intact beaks [  ]. However  the genetic architecture of survival time in laying hens that show cannibalism remains largely unknown. The availability of genomic information has increased our understanding of complex traits  but studies have mainly focussed on DGE. Results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on DGE show that most quantitative traits in livestock are highly polygenic and that variants tend to be associated with more than one trait []. However  the genetic architecture of IGE may differ from the genetic architecture of DGE. For example  IGE are less exposed to natural selection compared to DGE []  and therefore we expect that some loci may have large effects for IGE. A few studies have investigated the genetic architecture of IGE. Biscarini et al. [] conducted an association study using 1022 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and identified 81 SNPs that were associated with IGE for plumage condition in laying hens. However  the number of observations used was limited; 662 laying hens originating from nine lines were used for analyses. Mutic and Wolf [] identified 13 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for IGE associated with size  development  and fitness related traits in . To increase the power of IGE detection  they did not consider loci that did not have DGE in their IGE analyses. From a statistical point of view  survival time is a difficult trait because many laying hens are still alive at the end of the recording period. For these hens  true survival time cannot be observed but is known to exceed the length of the recording period (censored). Several statistical techniques have been proposed to deal with survival data and IGE  including survival time analysis [  ] and the use of repeated binomial survival records (0/1) []. Ellen et al. [] showed that survival time analysis did not improve breeding value predictions compared to analysing survival time with an ordinary mixed linear model when censoring occurs at the same moment in time. Compared to a linear mixed model analysis of survival time  the use of repeated binomial survival records (0/1) by Brinker et al. [] improved accuracies of breeding value predictions up to 21%. Hence  the use of repeated binomial survival records (0/1) may also be beneficial for the identification of direct and indirect SNP associations in GWAS. This study had two aims: (1) to identify SNPs associated with direct and indirect effects for survival time in laying hens that show cannibalism; and (2) to compare GWAS results from analysis of survival time versus repeated binomial survival (0/1). Data were collected under the control of Hendrix Genetics. Hendrix Genetics complies with the Dutch law on animal welfare. Hendrix Genetics provided data on three crossbred White Leghorn layer lines. Crossbreds descended from one sire line (W1) and three dam lines (WA  WB  and WC)  and were coded W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. In contrast to Brinker et al. []  data from cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WD were not used in this study because the quality of the genomic data was insufficient. A total of 159 sires and 3218 dams were used  with 48 to 57 sires per cross. For each cross  matings between sires and dams were randomly assigned  which resulted in approximately two female offspring per dam. The sire pedigree was recorded for all offspring. The dam’s pedigree was initially unknown but a reconstructed pedigree  based on genomic information  was provided by Hendrix Genetics. Chickens of the three crosses hatched simultaneously in the Netherlands. One-day old chickens were vaccinated  wing-banded  and transported to Canada. Chickens had intact beaks. Chickens were transported to a laying house at approximately 17 weeks of age. The laying house consisted of two wings. In each wing  rows were grouped into six double rows that each contained two levels  with a corridor between each double row to allow access to cages. Each cage contained five individuals of the same sire. Thus  cage mates were either paternal half-sibs or full-sibs. A standard commercial layer diet and water were provided ad libitum. A feeding trough was in front of the cages and each cage had its own drinking nipples. The light intensity was stronger at the top level compared to the bottom level  due to closer proximity to light sources. Further details are in Brinker et al. []. Dead hens were removed daily but the cause of death was not determined. The wing band number and cage number were recorded after death. The study was terminated when hens were approximately 75 weeks old. Survival at the end of the study was 78  75  and 63%  for crosses W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC  respectively. Cages with initially less than five hens and cages with mistakes in their composition ( with hens descending from multiple sires) were removed from the dataset. Cages with hens descending from multiple sires were identified based on genomic information. Survival time was defined as the number of days from the start of the laying period until either death or the end of the study  with a maximum of 402 days. Hens that were alive at the end of the laying period were given a survival time of 402 days. In total  records on 1920  1875  and 1620 laying hens were used for the statistical analyses for crosses W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC  respectively (Table ). To generate repeated binomial survival records (0/1)  the laying period was divided into 13 months. For each month  survival was coded 1 if the laying hen was alive at the end of that month and as 0 if not. Thus  a survival record (0/1) was available for each month. In total  24 960  24 375  and 21 060 monthly records were available for crosses W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC respectively (Table ). Birds were genotyped based on DNA extracted from blood  using a custom made Illumina 60 K chicken SNP BeadChip  which included 52 232 SNPs across chromosomes 1 through 28  Z  W  and two unmapped linkage groups  along with some unassigned SNPs. PLINK [  ] was used for the quality control of genotypes. SNPs with a missing rate higher than 0.30 and a MAF lower than 0.005 were removed. Individuals with a missing rate higher than 0.10 were also removed. SNPs that deviated from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) in the parental population were removed from the full dataset. SNPs contributing more than one Mendelian error and individuals contributing more than five Mendelian errors were also removed from the dataset. Remaining Mendelian errors were set to missing. The number of genotyped crossbreds and the number of SNPs available after quality control for each cross are in Table . Some individuals were not genotyped (max. 4%) due to death before blood sampling (~<U+2009>1 month after the start of the laying period) or due to poor DNA quality. To allow cages that contained individuals without genotype information to be included in the statistical analyses  missing genotypes were replaced by the “parental mean”  which was the average of the allele count of the sire and the average allele count of its mates (~<U+2009>20 dams). In case parental genotypes were missing  the line average was used. The same procedure was applied for missing genotype information   for genotypes associated with Mendelian errors. Data were analyzed separately for each cross. Three statistical models were compared: a linear mixed model for survival time (STM)  a linear mixed model for repeated binomial survival (0/1; RMM.t)  and a generalized linear mixed model for repeated binomial survival (0/1; GLMM). All models were implemented using ASReml []. First  genetic parameters were estimated without SNP effects in the model (see models below). Five generations of (reconstructed) pedigree information on sires and dams were included in all genetic analyses. In our data  cages consisted of paternal half-sibs  with an occasional full-sib. Therefore  direct and indirect polygenic effects were strongly confounded [  ]. With cages composed of families  an animal model with DGE only will also pick up IGE and consequently yields genetic parameter estimates that refer to the total breeding value []. Thus  an animal model with DGE only was used to account for population stratification ( family structure in the population). This animal model incorporated the genetic covariance structure across individuals  to avoid spurious SNP associations due to relatedness. Second  SNP effects were estimated one by one  including both the direct SNP effect of the individual and the summed indirect SNP effects of its cage mates in the model. For all models  variance components were fixed to the estimated values from the corresponding model without the SNP effect. Direct and indirect SNP effects were fitted simultaneously  because a GWAS with direct SNP effects only would also capture part of the indirect effect of the SNP  as the related group mates have an above-average probability to carry the same alleles. Survival time records were analysed using the following linear mixed model: where  is the observed survival time (days) for individual  in cage   with cage mates    is the number of cage members (=<U+2009>5)  and  represents the fixed effect of the combination of wing-row-level;  and  are regression coefficients of  on SNP genotypes fitted as fixed effects  where  is the fixed direct effect of the SNP of individual   and  is the fixed indirect effect of the same SNP in cage mates ;  is the allele count (0  1  2) for the individual   is the summed SNP allele counts (0–8) of cage mates    is the random polygenic effect of individual    is the random cage effect  and  is the residual. All random effects were assumed to be normally distributed. The covariance structures for the model terms were:     and   where  is a pedigree relationship matrix   is the additive genetic variance   is an identity matrix   is the cage variance  and  is the residual variance. Repeated binomial records on survival (0/1) were analysed using a repeated measures model that included random regressions on time (hence RMM.t). Following []  the model was: where  is the observed survival (0/1) for individual  in cage  and month   with cage mates   at time  measured in months since the start of the experiment;  represents the interaction effect of wing-row-level with time  which was a sixth-order polynomial of time  fitted as a fixed effect  which was used to model the survival curve across time and to allow this curve to depend on location (i.e.  on the wing-row-level combination);  is the random effect of cage  at time   which accounts for covariances between cage members at specific time points;  is the random permanent effect of cage   with  accounting for covariances between records on the same cage at different time points  and for increasing variance over time. Together  the  and  effects account for similarity of cage mates due to shared environment  which is essential to avoid inflation of genetic estimates in the analysis of socially-affected traits []. Finally   is the random permanent environmental effect of individual    is the time  and  is the residual. A separate residual variance was estimated for each month. Other terms are the same as in STM. More details on this model are in []. To account for the binomial distribution of survival (0/1)  we used a generalized linear mixed model with a logit link function. ASReml uses approximate likelihood techniques  of which the limitations are discussed in the Results and discussion section []. The model was: where  is the logit link function that links the probability of surviving to the linear predictor  and ) is the probability of surviving for individual  in cage   with cage mates   at time . The other terms are the same as in STM and RMM.t. The GLMM includes only a genetic intercept and no regression on time because the non-linear link function takes the change in variance over time into account. Consequently  at the beginning of the recording period  the variance of the survival probabilities can be (near) zero even when  is greater than zero. More details on this model are in []. The three models  STM  RMM.t  and GLMM were compared by reviewing -log values of SNP effects and the size of the inflation factor for  values (<U+03BB>; see below). Pearson correlations between -<U+2009>log values were calculated to quantify the agreement between the three models. A quantile–quantile plot (Q–Q plot) was used to investigate the distribution of the observed  values compared to their expected distribution under the null hypothesis that the SNP has no association with the trait. The extent of deviation of the observed distribution from the expected distribution was expressed as <U+03BB>  where a <U+03BB> equal to 1 means no deviation []. In cases where <U+03BB> was larger than 1.10  the so-called “genomic control” was applied to avoid spurious associations with the trait by dividing F values by <U+03BB> before calculating  values []. Multiple testing was accounted for by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) using the -value package [] in R []. The FDR is the expected proportion of false-positives among those that were called significant under the distribution of the  values. The -value package calculates an FDR based on the distribution of  values  which represents the minimum FDR when the SNP effect is called significant  which was set to 0.3. This is a liberal threshold that also reveals suggestive SNP associations with survival time and was chosen because little is known about the background of DGE and IGE for survival time  this study being one of the first large ones. A backwards elimination method was used to obtain an estimate for phenotypic and genetic variance explained by SNPs. Backwards elimination involved including all direct and indirect SNP effects below the genome-wide FDR threshold (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.3) in the model to account for possible linkage disequilibrium (LD) between them  testing their model fit  and dropping the least significant SNP effect. This was repeated until all SNPs reached the FDR threshold. Then  for each remaining SNP  we calculated the genetic variance explained by the SNP following Falconer and Mackay [] as   with  being the major allele frequency and  is the estimated direct allele substitution effect from the model with all remaining SNPs. LD between fitted SNP effects was not considered in the calculation of . The proportions of phenotypic variance () and of genetic variance () explained by the direct effects of SNPs were calculated as  and   respectively. The  is an estimate of the total genetic variance since group members are related []. Genetic parameters were estimated without SNP effects in the model. For all models  variance components were fixed to the estimated values from the corresponding model without SNP effects. The  and  values are in Table . Variance components from RMM.t and GLMM are not presented in Table  because they can be translated to the survival time scale  for which estimates are in Table  []. The total genetic standard deviation ( was 24 days for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  38 days for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and 73 days for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. There were no evident differences between GWAS results from STM  RMM.t  and GLMM (Tables   ) and [see Additional files    and ]. The same QTL were identified with all three models. Table  shows that correlations between -<U+2009>log values for direct and indirect SNP effects from the three models were higher than 0.9  thus similar SNPs were identified as having weak(-er) or strong(-er) associations in all models. This is in line with findings of Rönnegård et al. []  who investigated the benefit of using uncensored repeated measures in GWAS in a simulation study with direct effects only. In a design with an equal number of observations per individual  as in our study  they found that the correlation between -<U+2009>log values between results from a model fitting average phenotypes and a model fitting repeated measures was higher than 0.9 []. Rönnegård et al. [] concluded that a repeated measures model in GWAS was most beneficial when individual phenotypes were very different across time or when the number of observations varied among individuals. Table  shows the inflation factor <U+03BB> and the corresponding Q–Q plots are in Additional files  and . There was no clear pattern for <U+03BB> across models. Moreover  there were no large differences in the number of SNPs with <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 between the three models after genomic control (Note: the aim was to compare models here  not to identify SNPs) [see Additional file ]. In this study  we used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) for GWAS  which was fitted with ASReml []. ASReml uses an approximate likelihood technique (the penalized quasi-likelihood)  which has not been studied well for hypothesis testing. Gilmour et al. [] recommend to use GLMM in ASReml with caution. However  when comparing  values from the GLMM to those of the other two models  STM and RMM.t  we found that the Q–Q plots from the GLMM behaved well and were similar to those for STM and RMM.t [see Additional files  and ]  -<U+2009>log values from the GLMM were highly correlated with those from STM and RMM.t (Table )  and Manhattan plots from GLMM showed a similar pattern as those from STM and RMM.t [see Additional files  and ]. Based on these results  we concluded that there was no evidence that RMM.t and GLMM outperformed STM. Thus  in the remainder of this paper  we will only show results from STM. Figures  and  show the Manhattan plots for the direct and indirect SNP effects for the three crosses  respectively. Several SNPs were associated with direct effects for survival time at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3 in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  but none in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. In none of the crosses  SNPs were associated with indirect effects for survival time at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3. Manhattan plots of direct SNP effects for crosses W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. FDR threshold was 0.30 (solid line). If no SNP reached the FDR-threshold  the threshold could not be estimated (Panel 3). Locations of SNPs with <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3 are indicated with an arrow Manhattan plots of indirect SNP effects for crosses W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. FDR threshold was 0.30 (solid line). If no SNP reached the FDR-threshold  the threshold could not be estimated (Panels 1  2 and 3) In cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  17 SNPs were associated with direct effects for survival time at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3. Of these  one SNP was on chromosome 4 at 42 Mb. The remaining 16 SNPs were on chromosome 2  with one SNP at 46 Mb  and 15 SNPs in the region between 87 and 89 Mb. The latter 15 SNPs were in high LD with most pairwise  higher than 0.9. After backwards elimination  one SNP (rs317294317) remained in the model (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.3  corresponding to <U+2009><<U+2009>2.05E-5  Table ). This SNP is an intron variant at 88 Mb on chromosome 2  had an estimated effect of 22 days  and explained 3% of the phenotypic variance ()  and 36% of the total genetic variance (). In cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  seven SNPs were associated with direct effects for survival time at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3. These were located on chromosome 2 (at 9 and 86 Mb)  chromosome 5 (two SNPs at 54 Mb)  chromosome 7 (at 6 Mb)  chromosome 9 (at 17 Mb)  and chromosome 20 (at 20 Mb). After backwards elimination  four SNPs remained in the model (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.3  corresponding to <U+2009><<U+2009>2.84E-05  Table ). Estimated effect sizes ranged from 16 to 35 days  with rs31610924 having the smallest effect size and rs312488612 having the biggest effect size. The SNPs explained 1–6% of  and 9–44% of . Biscarini et al. [] was the first to investigate the genetic architecture of both direct and indirect genetic effects of plumage condition in laying hens. They found 11 direct associations and 81 indirect associations between SNPs and plumage condition. Our study did not confirm the large number of indirect SNP associations  although it is one of the first large GWAS that includes both DGE and IGE. We analyzed survival time  which reflects the final stage of cannibalism  while plumage condition is recorded before the end stage. This could partly explain the difference in results with Biscarini et al. [].  In cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  SNP rs317294317 remained in the model after backwards elimination. This SNP is an intron variant on chromosome 2. The associated gene is  (88.0–88.4 Mb; Fig. ). A clear peak is visible for direct SNP effects in this region for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA. Moreover  we observed a clear peak in the same region for indirect SNP effects in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB—although not significant at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3 after genomic control (Fig. ). The favorable allele was the same for the direct SNP effect in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA and the indirect SNP effect in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB. This allele has a positive effect both on the survival of the individual itself and on the survival time of its group mates. The  gene was found to be associated with both direct phenotypes and behavioral phenotypes [    ]. The  gene encodes a receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)  which plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmitters in the brain. GABA is an inhibitor of neuronal activity and plays an important role in physiological and behavioral stress response in many species [    ]. Zhang et al. [] for example  found that the level of GABA affects the performance and physical condition in Roman laying hens under heat stress. Furthermore  Poshivalov [] found that the level of GABA was associated with a change in state of aggressiveness and sociability towards conspecifics in . In addition to GABA  serotonin and dopamine are also important neurotransmitters and are known to be associated with several behavioral disorders in a variety of species. Moreover  several studies have reported a link between the serotonergic  dopaminergic  and GABAergic pathways [  ]. Biscarini et al. [] investigated the genetic architecture of direct and indirect genetic effects of plumage condition in laying hens and found a SNP in the  gene  which is involved in the serotonergic system  that was associated with indirect genetic effects. Another study on aggression in chickens revealed a role of the dopaminergic system []. Moreover  Bolhuis et al. [] investigated the effects of group selection on survival on serotonin levels and suggested that the level of serotonin may be linked to the development of cannibalism. Indeed  the study of Flisikowski et al. [] concluded that genomic regions related to the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems were associated with feather pecking behavior in laying hens. Thus  our results support those from two other GWAS that focused on a feather pecking related trait in chickens.  In cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  SNP rs313098101 remained in the model after backwards selection. This SNP is an intron variant on chromosome 2. The associated gene is  (9 Mb; Fig. )  which encodes a receptor for protein tyrosine phosphatase and is associated with several disease phenotypes []. However  it is likely that the association of SNP rs313098101 with direct effects for survival time is a false positive association  given that no clear peak is visible in this region. The contribution of DGE associated SNPs with <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3 to the total genetic variance after backwards elimination was large and summed up to 36% for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA and to 81% for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB (Table ). These genetic variances explained by the SNPs are probably overestimated because of the Beavis effect  i.e.  when many effects are tested for significance and only those below the defined significance threshold are considered  SNP estimates tend to be overestimated []. This especially occurs when the power of the study is low. Moreover  the proportion of genetic variance explained by SNPs associated with direct effects was calculated as   where  is the variance explained by the SNPs  and  is an estimate of the total genetic variance. The latter is the sum of variances due to direct and indirect genetic effects  along with a component due to their covariance []. Previous research reported negative genetic correlations between direct and indirect effects for survival time in crossbred layers []. If the correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects is strongly negative  the total  may be smaller than the variance due to the direct effects  which could partly be the reason for the possible over-estimation of the proportion of  explained by direct SNP effects in this study. We are interested in the proportion of direct genetic variance that is explained by DGE associated SNPs. However  with cages composed of families  an animal model with direct genetic effects only will also pick up many indirect genetic effects []. The variance due to direct genetic effects alone was  thus  unknown. Statistical power of a GWAS depends on several factors such as the number of observations  relatedness among individuals  allele frequency  level of linkage disequilibrium  and the statistical model []. To get an estimation of the power of our data for GWAS  we calculated power by assuming a number of true direct SNP effects from 1 to 18 days at allele frequencies ranging from 0 to 1  given the population specific parameters of the crosses ( and ; Table ) and significance threshold <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3 (~<U+2009>4 standard deviations from the mean; [see Additional file ]). We assumed a normal distribution. Theoretical findings as presented in Additional file  were supported by the empirical evidence obtained from this study. The results suggest that the statistical power of the GWAS was highest for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA and lowest for cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. True direct effects  at an allele frequency of 0.5  had to be at least 15 days for W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  16 days for W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and 21 days for W1*WC in order to be detected with reasonable probability (power<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.8). True indirect effects  at an allele frequency of 0.5  had to be at least 3.5 days for W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA  4 days for W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB  and 5 days for W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC in order to be detected with reasonable probability (power<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.8). The number of observations in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC was much smaller compared to the other two crosses  which may explain why the power of this cross was lowest. Theoretical power to detect indirect SNP effects was higher than power to detect direct SNP effects. This is due to the multiplication by the number of group mates for indirect SNP effects. It is  therefore  possible that SNP with a lower MAF can be detected at <<U+2009>0.3 as associated with IGE rather than DGE. In addition  the contribution of IGE to the total heritable variance of survival time in laying hens is often larger than the contribution of DGE [    ]. Moreover  in the absence of kin selection  IGE are less exposed to natural selection than DGE [  ]  and some loci may therefore have large effects. Nevertheless  no IGE associated SNPs were found at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.3. Perhaps the level of mortality in crosses W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB (22 and 25%) was insufficient for detection of IGE associated SNPs  i.e.  with lower mortality  fewer individuals will die due to cannibalism and less indirect genetic variance will be available for SNP detection. For cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC  theoretical power for GWAS was lower than for W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WA and W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WB and more individuals died before blood sampling. These hens were given an average genotype while having an extreme phenotype  which may explain why no direct and indirect SNP associations were found in cross W1<U+2009>*<U+2009>WC. This is one of the first large studies that investigates the genetic architecture of a trait by considering both direct and indirect genetic effects. Our results indicate that the same QTL were identified using either a linear mixed model of survival time or models of repeated binomial survival (0/1). Although the power was relatively low  and many SNP associations may have not been detected  our results revealed a link of the GABAergic system with direct and indirect genetic effects for survival time in crossbred layers. The associated gene was . This supports existing evidence of the involvement of GABA in the development of abnormal behaviors. Brinker T  Raymond B  Bijma P  Vereijken A  Ellen ED.

In this paper  we provide fundamental genomic information that will contribute to the development of more accurate breed conservation programs and genetic improvement strategies. Livestock breeding is an important sector of agriculture in Russia and is inextricably linked with the historical  social  cultural  and climatic features of the regions of this country. The beginning of cattle breeding and spreading throughout Russia is associated with the relocation of ancient Slavic tribes during the sixth century []. The history of Russia has led to the formation of cattle populations that are well adapted to the local climatic environment and economic conditions of certain regions []. In the second decade of the twentieth century  based on the territorial principle and phenotypic traits  several large groups of cattle populations were formed in the USSR—the so-called Russian tribes (currently defined as breeds)—”which acquired considerable importance  and were of great economic interest and became the subject of… breeding” []. Large-scale breeding of cattle in Russia began in the 1920–1940s  when the first herd books were published and the first breeds were officially recognized  including Russian Black-and-White (in 1925)  Yaroslavl (1925)  and Kholmogor (in 1927)  which originated from the Northern Great Russian land cattle; the Red Gorbatov (in 1926)  Bestuzhev (in 1928)  and Suksun (in 1943) breeds of red cattle; Yakut (in 1929)  which was native to Siberia; Kalmyk (in 1934)  which was bred by the nomadic people of the southern steppe of Russia; and the Kostromsky breed of brown cattle (in 1943) (for a short description of breeds [see Additional file : Table S1]). Due to the unorganized importation of almost all cattle breeds that were bred in Western Europe from the first quarter of the eighteenth century to the early twentieth century [  ]  the genetic origin of the Russian cattle breeds is not entirely clear. There are different viewpoints concerning the contribution of imported breeds in the formation of the Russian cattle population. While some authors claim a composite origin of most of the Russian cattle breeds [  ]  others insist on only minor contributions from the foreign breeds in the development of the Russian cattle population [  ]. Many studies have been undertaken to clarify the demographic history of cattle breeds in the European  Asian  and North and South American countries  as well as in Africa [     ]  but little is known about the genetic origin of cattle breeds in Russia. Different types of genetic markers have been applied to reconstruct the demographic history of cattle breeds worldwide. Microsatellites were used to verify the hybrid origin of the Near-Eastern cattle breeds [  ]  elucidate the different histories of the Mediterranean and Northern European cattle populations  [] and clarify the classification of the Eurasian cattle breeds []. Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and microsatellites were successfully applied to study the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of several Russian cattle breeds [     ]. However  the genetic relationships between some breeds remain ambiguous owing to the lack of discriminatory power of these genetic markers []. The full sequence of the bovine genome was completed in 2009 [  ]  which led to the identification of several hundred thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been successfully used in livestock studies at the genome-wide level [      ]. Whole-genome SNP analyses were successfully applied to characterize the diversity and population structure of the Russian cattle breeds  but these studies were either limited to a few breeds [] or did not compare the Russian cattle breeds with the worldwide breeds []. Here  a genome-wide comparative study of nine native and locally developed Russian cattle breeds was performed with the aim to characterize their genetic architecture and clarify the contribution of the worldwide breeds to their origin. A total of 195 samples (sperm or blood) collected from nine locally derived Russian cattle breeds  namely  Bestuzhev (BEST  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>26)  Russian Black-and-White (BLWT  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>21)  Kalmyk (KALM  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>14)  Kholmogor (KHLM  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>25)  Kostromsky (KSTR  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20)  Red Gorbatov (RGBT  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>23)  Suksun (SKSN  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20)  Yakut (YAKT  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>25)  and Yaroslavl (YRSL  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>21)  were analysed. Blood samples from eight of the nine breeds (excluding Russian Black-and-White) were collected from purebred herds during the 2004–2016 period  whereas Russian Black-and-White was represented by semen samples (kept in a genetic resources’ collection; unique collection number 663.00.X3057) of bulls born in the 1970–1980s. Blood samples were collected during routine veterinary procedures. Sperm samples were provided by the artificial insemination (AI) stations according to specific scientific collaboration agreements. Figure  shows a map [  ] that indicates the regions of sample collection. Map [  ] illustrating the geographical origin of the nine Russian cattle breeds included in this study.

DNA concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm  and DNA quality was determined by separation on agarose gels. Whole-genome SNP genotyping was performed using the Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). The genotypes of 746 individuals representing 70 breeds distributed around the world were included in the dataset (see Additional file : Table S2). Genotyping data of breeds from the former USSR were from the SNP library of the L.K. Ernst Federal Science Center of Animal Husbandry  whereas those of the other worldwide breeds were obtained from publicly available sources []. To assess the accuracy and efficiency of SNP genotyping  the GenCall (GC) and GenTrain (GT) scores were used. A cut-off of 0.5 for both the GC and GT scores was applied to determine the valid genotypes for each SNP []. SNP quality filtering was performed using PLINK v 1.07 []. SNPs for which <<U+2009>90% of individuals were genotyped (–geno 0.1)  that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 5% (–maf 0.05) and that departed from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with a  value<U+2009><<U+2009>10 (–hwe 1e-6) were excluded from further analyses. LD filtering was performed by removing SNPs with the squared correlation coefficient between the two alleles of the two SNPs () higher than 0.5 within 50-SNP sliding windows with each window overlapping by 5 SNPs (–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5). SNPs located on sex chromosomes or with unknown map positions were also removed. Individuals for which <<U+2009>90% of SNPs were genotyped (–mind 0.1) were removed. A Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test was not performed for comparisons with the worldwide breeds because too many SNPs would have been excluded due to the Wahlund effect []. Within-breed genetic variability was evaluated using the R package ‘diveRsity’ [] to calculate the rarefied allelic richness (A)  observed (H) and unbiased estimate of the expected heterozygosity (H) []  and inbreeding coefficient (). To characterize the genetic differences between the Russian breeds  we calculated the overall  value [] using the R package ‘diveRsity’ []. Breed differentiation was evaluated using pairwise  values [] and multidimensional scaling (MDS). Pairwise  values were also calculated with the R package ‘diveRsity’ []. MDS analysis based on pairwise identical-by-state (IBS) distances was performed with PLINK 1.07 (–cluster  –mds-plot 4) and visualized with the R package “ggplot2” []. To reduce the bias that is caused by longest genetic distances () and inbreeding []  we excluded the American  African  Australian as well as the Chinese and Indonesian breeds from the dataset and selected only the Eurasian breeds for the network and admixture analysis. In total  the SNP profiles of 45 breeds from Eurasia including nine Russian breeds were pooled. A pairwise matrix of  values [] was used to construct networks of breed relationships []  using the program SplitsTree version 4.14.5 []. Genetic admixture analysis was carried out using Admixture 1.3 []. Data was visualized using the R package “pophelper” []. We evaluated the K values (the number of assumed ancestral populations)  ranging from 1 to 40  along with their respective cross-validation (CV) errors. Trends in historical effective population size (Ne) were estimated from linkage disequilibrium (LD) as implemented in  v1.11 []. Default parameters were applied  except for the correction for sample size  the occurrence of mutation (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.2; [])  and the recombination rate modifier  according to Sved and Feldman []. Following Kukucková et al. []  the current effective population size (Ne) was inferred based on the results of linear regression analysis performed on Ne estimates ranging from 10 to 60 generations ago. A “Ne changing ratio” (NeC) analysis was used as a proxy of the speed in Ne changes in the 13 most recent generations. The slope of each segment that links a pair of neighbouring Ne estimates was calculated and normalized using the median of the 13 most recent Ne estimates. R version 3.3.2 was used as an instrument for creating input files []. After quality control and filtering  35 874 SNPs remained for further analyses. The summary statistics for genetic diversity are in Table . The A and H values were similar in eight of the nine breeds analysed (A ranged from 1.918 to 1.958 and H from 0.337 to 0.366)  except for the Yakut breed  for which a significantly lower level of variability was observed (A<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.780 and Ho<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.279). Six of the nine breeds analysed had a significant (95% CI) excess of heterozygotes  while in the three remaining breeds (Bestuzhev  Russian Black-and-White  and Yaroslavl) a deficiency in heterozygotes was identified. The largest excess in heterozygote was detected in Kholmogor (F<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.028)  while the Russian Black-and-White breed was characterized by the largest deficiency in heterozygotes (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.036) (Table ). The current effective population size estimated from LD ranged from Ne<U+2009>=<U+2009>63 (Red Gorbatov) to Ne<U+2009>=<U+2009>161 (Bestuzhev). Multidimensional scaling revealed the clear differentiation of breeds from the European part of Russia (Fig. a). Component 1 (C1) accounted for 4.43% of the variability and discriminated the red breeds (Red Gorbatov and Suksun) from those derived from the Northern Great Russian land cattle (Yaroslavl<U+2009>+<U+2009>Kholmogor). Component 2 (C2) accounted for 4.19% of the variance and discriminated the breeds that are less related to Dutch cattle (Kholmogor  Yaroslavl<U+2009>+<U+2009>Kalmyk  and Kostromsky) from those showing higher levels of Dutch cattle introgression followed by Holstein cattle introgression. At the global level (Fig. b)  breeds were separated on the X-axis into two main groups according to the origin of their species: taurine  and indicine cattle . Most of the studied Russian breeds (Russian Black-and-White  Bestuzhev  Kholmogor  Red Gorbatov  Suksun  and Yaroslavl) formed a cluster that overlapped with the breeds from Northern Europe and Great Britain as well as those from Southern Europe (Kostromsky and Kalmyk). The Yakut breed exhibited taurine ancestry along the C1 axis  but was clearly separated from the European taurine breeds on the C2 axis. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of native and locally developed Russian cattle breeds.  Analysis of the breeds from the European part of Russia. The colours are identical to the colours of the breeds’ regions of origin in Fig. .  Analysis of the worldwide cattle breeds. The Russian breeds are denoted in red colour. For the full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2) The Neighbor-Net (Fig. a) analysis confirmed the clear differentiation of all the studied Russian cattle breeds. The most distant cluster included the Yakut and Kalmyk breeds  which belong to the Turano-Mongolian root breeds (-). Among the remaining breeds  the Red cattle breeds clustered together at the opposite end  and among these the Red Gorbatov breed was the most divergent. The Russian Black-and-White breed was integrated in the Red breeds’ cluster between the Suksun and Bestuzhev breeds  which indicates the presence of possible common ancestry. The intermediate positions between the Turano-Mongolian breeds and the Red cattle breeds were occupied by branches comprising the native Yaroslavl and Kholmogor breeds  and the Kostromsky breed on the opposite end. Neighbor-Net of Eurasian breeds (Fig. b) showed a three-cluster structure: (1) a first cluster joined the breeds from Great Britain and Northern Europe and included six Russian breeds (Bestuzhev  Russian Black-and-White  Kholmogor  Red Gorbatov  Suksun  and Yaroslavl); (2) a second cluster was comprised of Central European and Southern European breeds including Kostromsky  which formed the common branch with Brown Swiss cattle; and (3) Turano-Mongolian root breeds (including Kalmyk and Yakut)  and Podolian cattle breeds branched as a third cluster. Neighbor-Net dendrogram constructed from pairwise matrix of  values [].  Analysis was carried out for nine Russian cattle breeds. The colours are identical to the colours of the breeds’ regions of origin in Fig. .  Analysis of the Eurasian cattle breeds. The different colours indicate the geographical origin of breeds: Russia—red  former USSR countries Kazakhstan and Ukraine—light blue and light green  respectively  Great Britain—green  Northern Europe—blue  Central Europe—purple  Southern Europe—orange  Turkey—dark red  Western Asia—grey. For the full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2) Population structure of the Russian cattle breeds and the possible introgression of other Eurasian breeds were inferred by admixture analysis (Fig. ). We used 10 clustering solutions at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2–5  9  10  15  17  20 (the lowest cross-validation value (Cv)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.587; [see Additional file : Figure S1])  and 22  which showed the Russian ancestry of the studied breeds (at lower K values) and that they shared ancestry with other Eurasian breeds. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2  Yakut clustered separately from the other Eurasian breeds  while the majority of the other Russian breeds (except Kalmyk) showed a relatively low Yakut genomic component. Among the studied Russian breeds  the highest Yakut genomic component was found in Kalmyk  which persisted at higher K values. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3  Kostromsky clustered separately from the other Russian breeds with a clustering component mostly shared with breeds of Central European origin. The structure of the cluster of six breeds (Bestuzhev  Kholmogor  Red Gorbatov  Suksun  Yaroslavl  and Yakut) was similar to that of the Northern European breeds with a slightly higher percentage of Yakut genomic component. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4  the Holstein breed formed its own cluster  with all six above-mentioned Russian breeds sharing a high percentage of Holstein ancestry. Only four of these breeds (Bestuzhev  Kholmogor  Red Gorbatov  and Yaroslavl) retained Yakut specific components. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5  all studied breeds from the European part of Russia revealed clustering components that were consistent with Turkish—West Asian roots. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>9  Red Gorbatov showed an extremely heterogeneous genetic structure  with all of the nine putative ancestry sources hardly distinguishable. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>10  Red Gorbatov and Kholmogor clustered separately  while Russian Black-and-White  Bestuzhev  and Suksun maintained the high percentage of Holstein genetic roots. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>15  17 and 22  Yaroslavl  Russian Black-and-White (partly)  and Bestuzhev  respectively  were assigned to their own clusters  whereas  Kalmyk retained a heterogeneous genetic structure. Bar plot showing the extent of admixture of the Russian breeds with 36 Eurasian breeds. Breeds are grouped according to their origin: Russia  former USSR countries  Great Britain  Northern Europe  Central Europe  Southern Europe  Turkey  and Eastern Asia. For the full definitions of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2) Most of the breeds showed a slow decline in the effective population size over time (Fig. ). The Ne values preceding such time points ranged from 100 to 700 for most of the breeds  except for Kalmyk  which was around 1200 at 50 generations ago. The Ne values ranged from 63 to 161  with Red Gorbatov and Bestuzhev showing the lowest and highest values  respectively. The slope value (ß1) of most of the linear regression models ranged from 5 to 10  whereas Kalmyk and Yakut had values of 21 and 3  respectively (Table ) and (see Additional file : Figure S2). All linear regression models had a high coefficient of determination (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.99). Historical effective population size (Ne) from approximately 50 generations ago based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates. For the full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1) Understanding the genetic diversity and population structure of local cattle breeds is necessary for their genetic improvement and the development of effective conservation programs as well as for understanding their capacity to survive under certain environmental conditions [  ]. Numerous studies have been undertaken to characterize the Russian cattle breeds using mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms []  single protein-coding genes [] and multiple microsatellite loci [       ]. To elucidate the origin of the Russian cattle population  we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of nine Russian cattle breeds  including eight breeds from the European part of Russia and one breed native to Siberia (Yakut)  and their relationship with the cattle breeds from around the world at the whole-genome level using a set of 35 874 polymorphic SNPs from the Bovine SNP50 K BeadChip (Illumina  Inc.  San-Diego  USA). An average  value of 0.0982 was obtained for the Russian breeds  which suggests that 9.8% of the variability was due to between-breed differentiation and the remaining 90.2% was due to allelic variations within breeds. The level of genetic variability (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.355–0.360; A<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.949–1.959) was highest in the Bestuzhev  Russian Black-and-White  Kalmyk  and Suksun breeds  which indicates the participation of several genetically distinct breeds in their development. The level of genetic variability observed in eight Russian breeds  excluding Yakut  was similar to that in other taurine breeds [  ]. The lowest level of genetic diversity (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.278; A<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.780; Ne<U+2009>=<U+2009>64) was recorded for the Yakut breed of Siberia  which could be due to the extremely small size of the population (600 individuals in 2015  [see Additional file : Table S1]). Among the focal Russian breeds  the  values ranged from -<U+2009>0.028 (Kalmyk) to 0.036 (Black-and-White). Our observations were in agreement with Gautier et al. []  who reported similar  values for 28 of the 29 European breeds in their study ( ranging from -<U+2009>0.040 to 0.027) based on 44 706 SNPs. Five of the studied Russian breeds had  values close to zero (ranging from -<U+2009>0.006 to 0.007)  while four breeds showed relatively higher deviations. The Kholmogor  Kostromsky and Suksun breeds were characterized by an excess in heterozygotes ( ranging from -<U+2009>0.013 to -<U+2009>0.028). For the Kostromsky and Suksun breeds  the negative  values were probably due to recent crossbreeding with Brown Swiss (for Kostromsky)  and Danish Red and Red Holstein cattle (for Suksun). For the Kholmogor breed  the excess in heterozygotes may be associated with breeding schemes that use bulls of various genetic origins. We observed a deficiency in heterozygotes (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.036) in Russian Black-and-White cattle  which was probably due to the greater use of a limited number of bulls and higher selection pressures for a limited number of productive traits compared to other breeds. By applying a variety of statistical estimations to whole-genome SNP data  we unravelled the genetic structure within Russian cattle breeds. Furthermore  we assessed the distinctiveness of Russian cattle in a scenario including world-wide cattle. The results of the admixture  MDS-plot  and Neighbour-Net analyses were consistent regarding the genetic relationship and population structure patterns in the Russian breeds analysed in this study (Figs. a    ). We identified three major groups within the studied Russian breeds  based on their historical origin and degree of conservation of ancestral genomic components. In contrast  based on results of a principal component analysis  Yurchenko et al. [] grouped the Russian cattle breeds into four clusters  by combining the breeds that are strongly affected by transboundary breeds with those that have maintained a considerable degree of the Russian specific component. Such a clustering reflects mainly the earlier demographic history of Russian cattle breeds and less the recent migration events. In our study  we included in the first group the Yakut and Kalmyk breeds  which clustered with breeds of Turano-Mongolian origin (Fig. b). Yakut was the most distinct breed among those analysed here  which is in agreement with the results of Yurchenko et al. []. Yakut is characterized by a high degree of differentiation from the other Russian breeds ( ranging from 12.9 to 19.0%) and from other Eurasian breeds ( ranging from 13.6 to 27.5%) (see Additional file : Table S3). Among all the breeds studied here  Yakut appeared to be closer to the Russian Kalmyk  Mongolian  and Korean Hanwoo breeds  although the differences in pairwise  between them were relatively large ( ranging from 12.9 to 14.2%) (see Additional file : Table S3). The Kalmyk breed displayed a very complex genetic structure  although it maintained the highest percentage of Yakut genomic component among the Russian breeds (Fig. ). This breed originated from cattle that were bred by nomadic people who inhabited the southern steppe regions of Russia. The Kalmyk breed appeared to be genetically close to the Mongolian (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.1%) and Gray Ukrainian breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.3%) (see Additional file : Table S3)  which suggests a common ancestor. In the MDS plot  this breed was located between the breeds from south Europe and East Asia (Fig. b)  which indicates that they contributed to the development of the Kalmyk breed. This breed showed gene flow signals that originated from several other Russian  Southern European  and West Asian breeds (Fig. )  in agreement with findings in previous studies [      ] and historical records on the breed [  ]. Our results suggest that the Yakut and Kalmyk breeds constitute a unique Turano-Mongolian genetic resource in the Russian cattle breed pool  and therefore deserve attention for their conservation; however  gene flow from European breeds to the Kalmyk breed cannot be completely excluded and further analyses are necessary for a more precise assessment. The second group clustered together the Black-and-White  Kostromsky  and Suksun breeds  which result from multiple crossbreeding with transboundary European breeds.   Neighbor-Net and admixture results indicate a high percentage of Holstein ancestry in the Russian Black-and-White breed (see Additional file : Table S3) and (Figs. b  ). Traces of other ancestors were revealed in a separate clustering of most of the Black-and-White animals at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>17 (Fig. ). For the Kostromsky breed  we observed a high degree of identity with Brown Swiss cattle  as suggested by the low  value (5.2%) in the pairwise comparison (see Additional file : Table S3)  the neighboring locations at the Neighbor-Net (Fig. b)  and the high degree of Brown Swiss specific component in the model-based clustering (Fig. ). This observation is in line with the history of the breed  which was developed by multiple backcrossing with Brown Swiss bulls [  ]. The Suksun breed displayed admixture signals of Northern European cattle  which probably reflect the active use of Danish Red cattle in the earliest stages of its development []. This was further supported by microsatellite-based studies of Eurasian cattle breeds  in which the Suksun breed clustered together with Danish Red cattle [  ]. Thus  our data confirm that  in the past  expansion events of the Northern-European breeds such as Danish Red  Holstein–Friesian  and Ayrshire occurred in Russia  as previously highlighted by large-scale microsatellite studies [  ]. The third cluster included the Kholmogor  Yaroslavl  Red Gorbatov  and Bestuzhev breeds  which were characterized by a reduced influence of non-Russian genetics components. Kholmogor is a breed of tall cattle that inhabit the islands in the upper reaches of the Northern Dvina River in Northern Russia. The first records of the presence of cattle in this area date back to the times of Ivan the Terrible (sixteenth century) []. It is known that Dutch cattle were provided to the inhabitants of the fertile meadows in Kholmogor in the 1760s under the order of Empress Catherine II []. Breeding of cattle in the Yaroslavl region (near Moscow  and the breed that was named after this region) was developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to supply the citizens of Moscow with dairy products []. Dutch  Tyrolean  Angeln  Simmental  and Kholmogor cattle were brought in small quantities to the Yaroslavl’s breeding zone at different times. However  after 1882–1883  cattle were no longer imported to this region of Russia []. The cline-like variation within the native Yaroslavl and Kholmogor breeds towards the Black-and-White breed (Fig. a) suggests a reduced contribution of Dutch cattle during the formation of the breeds  although they are separated by a significant genetic distance (see Additional file : Table S3). Our data show that a Russian genetic component is present in the Kholmogor and Yaroslavl breeds ( values between these breeds and Holstein were 8.5 and 9.1%  respectively; [see Additional file : Table S3])  which clearly formed private branches on the Eurasian Neighbor-Net tree (Fig. b) and clustered separately in the admixture plot (Fig. ). Our findings are consistent with those of several previous studies that suggested a small contribution of foreign breeds in the development of the Kholmogor and Yaroslavl breeds [      ]  but contradict the findings of a microsatellite-based clustering analysis [] that suggested the composite origin of these breeds but the authors themselves indicate the ambiguous nature of their results. Further studies are necessary to better decipher the history of these two aboriginal Russian cattle breeds. We observed a high degree of divergence between Red Gorbatov (a breed of red cattle distributed on the banks of the Volga River) and the other breeds. The Red Gorbatov breed has its own branch within the British-Northern European cluster in the Eurasian Neighbor-Net tree (Fig. b) and clusters separately in the admixture-plot (Fig. ). At the global level  Red Gorbatov seem to be closer to the Southern European breeds—Piedmontese (<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.7%) and Pirenaica (<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.1%) (see Additional file : Table S3)  which reflects the contribution of Tyrolean cattle in the improvement of both breeds during the nineteenth century []. Most likely  this contribution came from the Tux-Zillertal breed  which was widespread in Tyrol because of its adaptability and good productive capacity in the presence of poor forage resources. At the agricultural exhibition of 1855 in Tyrol  Tux-Zillertal cattle were presented as a Tyrolean breed []. Interestingly  our findings contradict the previous observation by Felius []  who classified the Red Gorbatov breed as derived from Alpine cattle breeds. We infer that during the century-long history of breed formation without cross-breeding  the Red Gorbatov breed developed its own genetic and phenotypic characteristics  which made it most suitable to the specific environmental conditions in Central Russia. We assigned Bestuzhev cattle to the third group due to its unique genetic identity (Figs. b   at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>22) in spite of its composite origin []. Inference of the trends in Ne showed an overall decline of Ne for all the cattle breeds analyzed in this study. The inferred sizes of the current effective populations (Ne) showed that several breeds approached a Ne of ~<U+2009>50 (Red Gorbatov  Yakut  Kalmyk; Table )  which is generally considered to be a danger threshold in terms of species survivability to adaptation challenges []. Analysis of the ratio of Ne change revealed a peak at approximately 18 generations ago for almost all the breeds  which is most likely a reflection of the World War I and II crisis. The peak at 10 generations ago occurred in the 1960s  when artificial insemination began. For the Kalmyk breed  we observed a peak at approximately 45 to 50 generations ago (see Additional file : Figure S2)  which could coincide with the period of the mid-eighteenth century when the forces of the Russian Empire turned traditional Kalmyk grazing lands into hayfields and passed them under the plough  which drove the Kalmyk people to a less fertile steppe and resulted in a drastic decline in the number of their livestock. Moreover  those events led to an exodus in 1771  during which the Kalmyk people lost most of their livestock []. The peak at approximately 30 generations ago (see Additional file : Figure S2) was probably due to the dramatic decline in the number of Kalmyk livestock during the 1830s  which was caused by the severe winter of 1833. According to official information  the number of cattle dropped from 124 690 in 1827 to 33 308 in 1837 []. In this paper  we present the genetic characterization of nine native and locally developed Russian cattle breeds. Based on whole-genome SNP data analysis  we identified three distinct groups among the Russian breeds included here. The first cluster contained the Yakut and Kalmyk breeds of Turano-Mongolian origin  which were the most distant from the other breeds. The Russian Black-and-White  Kostromsky  and Suksun cattle clustered as a second group and represent breeds that were developed by multiple crossbreeding with West European transboundary breeds (Holstein  Brown Swiss and Danish Red  respectively). The third group comprised the Kholmogor  Yaroslavl  Red Gorbatov  and Bestuzhev breeds  which are those that have been the least influenced by introgression with non-Russian breeds  and thus they represent the authentic genetic resources. Such results provide a significant contribution to our understanding of the origin and modern genetic composition of the Russian cattle breeds  and provide the basis for developing more accurate programs for their conservation and genetic improvement.

In 2009  the approximate position of the  locus in Brown Swiss cattle was mapped to a 922-kb interval on bovine chromosome 3 and  subsequently  assigned to a 336-kb haplotype block based on an animal set that included  Brown Swiss  Dutch Belted (Lakenvelder) and Belted Galloway individuals. A possible candidate gene in this region i.e.  was investigated but the causal mutation remains unknown. Thus  to elucidate the causal mutation of this prominent coat color phenotype  we decided to remap the belted phenotype in an independent animal set of several European bovine breeds  i.e. Gurtenvieh (belted Brown Swiss)  Dutch Belted and Belted Galloway and to systematically scan the candidate region. We also checked the presence of the detected causal mutation in the genome of belted individuals from a Siberian cattle breed.ResultsA combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis based on 110 belted and non-belted animals identified a candidate interval of 2.5 Mb. Manual inspection of the haplotypes in this region identified four candidate haplotypes that consisted of five to eight consecutive SNPs. One of these haplotypes overlapped with the initial 922-kb interval  whereas two were positioned proximal and one was positioned distal to this region. Next-generation sequencing of one heterozygous and two homozygous belted animals identified only one private belted candidate allele  i.e. a multiplication event that is located between 118 608 000 and 118 614 000 bp. Targeted locus amplification and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed an increase in copy number of this region in the genomes of both European (Belted Galloway  Dutch Belted and Gurtenvieh) and Siberian (Yakutian cattle) breeds.

In 2009  the approximate position of the  locus in Brown Swiss cattle was mapped to a 922-kb interval on bovine chromosome 3 and  subsequently  assigned to a 336-kb haplotype block based on an animal set that included  Brown Swiss  Dutch Belted (Lakenvelder) and Belted Galloway individuals. A possible candidate gene in this region i.e.  was investigated but the causal mutation remains unknown. Thus  to elucidate the causal mutation of this prominent coat color phenotype  we decided to remap the belted phenotype in an independent animal set of several European bovine breeds  i.e. Gurtenvieh (belted Brown Swiss)  Dutch Belted and Belted Galloway and to systematically scan the candidate region. We also checked the presence of the detected causal mutation in the genome of belted individuals from a Siberian cattle breed. A combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis based on 110 belted and non-belted animals identified a candidate interval of 2.5 Mb. Manual inspection of the haplotypes in this region identified four candidate haplotypes that consisted of five to eight consecutive SNPs. One of these haplotypes overlapped with the initial 922-kb interval  whereas two were positioned proximal and one was positioned distal to this region. Next-generation sequencing of one heterozygous and two homozygous belted animals identified only one private belted candidate allele  i.e. a multiplication event that is located between 118 608 000 and 118 614 000 bp. Targeted locus amplification and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed an increase in copy number of this region in the genomes of both European (Belted Galloway  Dutch Belted and Gurtenvieh) and Siberian (Yakutian cattle) breeds. Finally  using nanopore sequencing  the exact breakpoints were determined at 118 608 362 and 118 614 132 bp. The closest gene to the candidate causal mutation (16 kb distal) is . Based on our findings and those of a previously published study that identified the same multiplication event  a quadruplication on bovine chromosome 3 between positions 118 608 362 and 118 614 132 bp is the most likely candidate causal mutation for the belted phenotype in cattle. Breeders as well as geneticists have been interested in the inheritance of obvious coat color patterns for many decades [  ]. Besides plain-colored and spotted phenotypes that more or less uniformly affect the whole body  there are also “segmental body traits” that seem to affect only a distinct part of the animal. Examples for such segmental coat color phenotypes are the white head in Simmental or Hereford cattle  the half-black  half-white coat color of the Valais Blackneck goat  and the belt pattern  which exists in various species. In general  the belt pattern can be described as a white band of varying width around the midsection of the body [] but does not always encircle the body completely  and is considered to result from a lack of melanocytes []. Olson calls it “one of the most striking white-spotting mutants” and believes that modifying genes are responsible for the width of the belt []. The belt pattern is well described in mice  pigs and cattle and its genetic determinism has been extensively studied. In the mouse  Rao et al. [] reported a recessive belt pattern that is caused by mutations in the  gene. The belt in Hampshire swine was first studied in 1907 by Spillman [] who hypothesized that it was due to the complementary action of at least two factors. Many other studies followed and considered that this trait displayed a dominant mode of inheritance [    ]. In 1999  Giuffra et al. [] confirmed the dominant inheritance of the belt pattern in Hampshire swine and identified the  locus as the fourth allele at the  locus on pig chromosome 8. To date  it is not clear if this  allele also causes the belt phenotype in Chinese pig breeds []. For belted cattle  a dominant inheritance of this trait was reported as early as 1921 []. The monogenic dominant mode of inheritance was confirmed in 2001 by Schmutz et al. []. However  the physical appearance of a belt is apparently not inherited in a simple way because animals that are homozygous at the  locus do not necessarily have a more perfect belt than heterozygous animals [  ]. In 2009  the  mutation in Gurtenvieh (GUV) cattle (which is the name of belted Brown Swiss cattle) was mapped to the telomeric region of  chromosome 3 (BTA3). Since the former candidate genes   and   are positioned on other chromosomes than BTA3  they were excluded as causative genes []. After remapping of the mutation and haplotype analysis  these authors reported that it was most likely located in a 922-kb segment on BTA3. In a second study  two additional belted breeds were analyzed  i.e. Belted Galloway (BGA) and Lakenvelder (Dutch Belted  DBE). According to the histories of these two breeds  their belt phenotype could originate from Gurtenvieh cattle [  ]. For each breed analyzed  a single belt-associated haplotype was identified. A comparison of these haplotypes revealed four short haplotype blocks of which the most extended block (336 kb) spanned nine SNPs and contained one potential candidate gene that encodes the developmental transcription factor HES6. Although the  coding sequence was completely re-sequenced  no belt-associated polymorphism was detected []. Thus  when we decided to remap the  locus in order to localize the underlying mutation  the causal polymorphism for the belted phenotype in cattle was still unknown. However  during the course of our analyses  which led to the identification of a strong candidate causal mutation  Awasthi Mishra et al. published an article [] that describes the same mutation as the most likely cause for the belt pattern. Thus  our study confirms the findings of Awasthi Mishra et al. [] by using an independent animal set that includes a Siberian breed in addition to European cattle breeds and strengthens the assumption that the approximately 6-kb copy number variation (CNV) upstream of the  gene is indeed the causative mutation of the belted phenotype in cattle. Moreover  we provide detailed information on the repetitive structure of this special locus. For this study  121 animals were analyzed  of which 117 were sampled from the following breeds  i.e. 43 Belted Galloway (Fig. )  29 Black or Red Galloway GAL)  26 Dutch Belted  and 19 Gurtenvieh  and four were analyzed from two non-belted offspring of Gurtenvieh parents and two belted and non-belted full siblings descending from a Gurtenvieh (dam)<U+2009>×<U+2009>Pinzgauer cattle (sire) cross. However  five Gurtenvieh and six Belted Galloway animals were excluded from the animal set used for remapping because of an “atypical” phenotype. Thus  the final animal set comprised 110 animals of which 78 were belted and 32 were plain-colored. Belted cattle.  Red Belted Galloway bull with three Black Belted Galloway cows  for which the varying size of the belt is obvious.  Belted Mongolian cattle.  Belted Yakutian cattle When available  we used pedigree data to differentiate between homozygous and heterozygous belted animals. Homozygosity was assumed as likely if all the ancestors in the last three generations were belted. Heterozygosity was inferred when the animals themselves originated from crosses between belted and black Galloway or between belted and non-belted breeds  or if they had at least one non-belted offspring. Thus  it was possible to assign the 110 animals to four groups: (i) non-belted  (ii) heterozygous belted  (iii) likely homozygous belted  and (iv) with a belted phenotype but a completely ambiguous genotype. We assumed that the Dutch Belted animals were homozygous at the  locus. These group affiliations were taken in account in the variance component method that combines linkage disequilibrium (LD) and linkage analysis (cLDLA) (see section “”). Since the belt pattern in cattle is a dominant phenotype  only the heterozygous classification can be assumed to be accurate  whereas the homozygous classification can be incorrect in some cases  which is why we called this group “likely homozygous”. However  our previous analyses on the mapping of the Weaver disease []  showed that such misclassifications do not hinder effective mapping by the procedure applied here. For qPCR analysis  samples of eight belted and two non-belted Russian Yakutian cattle (RUY)  which belong to the Mongolian-Turano group of taurine cattle  were also collected. Interestingly  the belt phenotype of most Yakutian cattle was less accurate than those of European breeds (Fig. c). However  since belted Turano cattle with a European-like phenotype are present in Mongolia (Fig. b; J. Peters personal communication)  the phenotypic difference between the Yakutian cattle and European breeds might not be due to a distinct belted mutation in the North-East Asian Turano cattle but rather to various coat color phenotypes segregating in Yakutian cattle. DNA was extracted from blood  hair root samples or semen  and genotyped using either version 1 or version 2 of the BovineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  USA). Physical positions of all SNPs were based on the reference assembly of the bovine genome UMD3.1 [  ]. The following SNPs were excluded from further analysis: (i) SNPs with a call rate lower than 95%  (ii) SNPs that displayed frequent paternity conflicts in animals with known paternity (i.e. SNPs showing Mendelian error rates above<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.2%)  (iii) SNPs with an unknown position according to the reference assembly UMD3.1  (iv) SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.025  and (v) SNPs located on bovine chromosomes other than BTA3 since the  locus is already mapped to BTA3 [  ]. After this filtering process  2111 SNPs remained for further analyses. After quality control  haplotypes were reconstructed and missing genotypes were imputed using the Hidden Markov model implemented in BEAGLE 3.3.2 []. To improve haplotype reconstruction and imputation of missing alleles  SNP genotypes of more than 9000 animals from previous studies were included  although these animals had no direct relevance to our study. Within the mixed linear model used to remap the belted phenotype  locus IBD (LocIBD) was used as a correction for local haplotype relationships  while the unified additive relationships (UAR) were used to correct for population stratification and familial relationships. Hence  UAR were estimated between all animals []  then all the principal components of the UAR matrix were determined using R []  and the number of principal components that explained more than 95% of the genetic variance was ascertained using the R package paran []. Thus  genome-wide relationships were accounted for by using the 60 most significant principal components of the UAR matrix. For local haplotype relationships  sliding windows of 40 consecutive SNPs along BTA3 were used. At each window midpoint (i.e. between SNP 20 and 21)  the LocIBD was estimated [] and  as shown in Lee and Van der Werf []  the resulting haplotype-based IBD matrices were converted into diplotype relationship matrices (called  hereafter). Estimation of  for sliding windows and remapping were carried out by a procedure that is equivalent to the combined linkage/linkage disequilibrium mapping method reported by Meuwissen et al. [] and has already been applied for QTL mapping in swine []  fine-mapping of the Weaver disease in Braunvieh []  and for mapping fertility traits in Holstein cattle []. Finally  ASReml [] was used for a variance component analysis at the midpoint of each sliding window. The mixed linear model included random phenotype effects that were based on  and the 60 principal components used as covariates to account for polygenic effects. To prepare the vector of phenotypes  all plain-colored animals were assigned the numerical value “1”  heterozygous belted animals “2”  and likely homozygous belted animals “3”. Belted animals with a completely ambiguous genotype status were set between heterozygous and likely homozygous belted and thus were assigned “2.5”. The resulting model was: where  is the vector of phenotypes   is a vector of fixed effects (including the overall mean  and the 60 principal components)   is a vector of random additive genetic effects due to the belt locus with   where  is the diplotype relationship matrix at position  of the putative  locus  and  a vector of random residual effects with   where  is an identity matrix. The random effects  and  were assumed to be uncorrelated and normally distributed and their variances ( and ) were simultaneously estimated using ASReml []. The likelihood ratio test statistic ()  which is known to be X-distributed with one degree of freedom []  was calculated from the logarithm of the likelihood that was estimated for both the model with  and without QTL effect (; corresponding to the null hypothesis). Finally  the chromosome-wide highest LRT peak (LRT) was identified  and the respective confidence interval of the  locus was determined using the 2-LOD (log off odds; one LOD<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.605 LRT) drop-off criterion [  ]. Since each value represents the position at the midpoint of a 40-SNP sliding window  the initial confidence interval was extended by 20 SNPs in each direction. For this extended confidence interval  positional candidate genes were identified using the Ensembl release 86 []. To identify the most likely position of the  locus  the extended confidence interval was searched manually across the whole animal set for haplotypes that were at least heterozygous in belted and absent in plain-colored animals. Haplotypes within the extended confidence interval that met these criteria are called inner candidate haplotypes (-) in the following sections. DNA samples from a likely homozygous Belted Galloway individual  a Dutch Belted individual and a heterozygous belted cross individual between Gurtenvieh and Pinzgauer were sequenced at the Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis of the LMU Munich. Libraries were prepared from genomic DNA after ultrasonic fragmentation (Covaris M220 (75 s  20% duty factor)) using the Accel-DNA 1S kit (Swift Biosciences  Ann Arbor  USA). Libraries were sequenced in 100-bp paired-end mode on a HiSeq 1500 (Illumina  San Diego  USA). All reads were aligned to the reference sequence (UMD 3.1) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) []. Variant calling and filtering for variants that were homozygous and different from the reference sequence in the Belted Galloway and Dutch Belted animals and  at the same time  heterozygous in the belted cross individual  were performed with SAMtools mpileup [] and VarScan [] for the whole extended confidence interval. To reduce the list of candidate causal variants  we used four Holstein–Friesian bulls that had previously been sequenced for another project and five animals for each of the Simmental  Jersey and Angus breeds that had been sequenced within the 1000 Bull Genomes Project []. Thus  we could exclude candidate causal variants that were heterozygous or homozygous in at least one of these animals. Moreover  sequence data that matched an - were visually inspected using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) [  ] to check for possible rearrangements (e.g. extended InDel) that cannot be detected by the applied automated variant calling and filtering process (mpileup [] and VarScan []). To ensure that the reference sequence of the candidate segment (see section “”) that was identified by NGS was correctly assembled  two BAC clones (CH240-library: CH240-363B2  CH240-104M22) that mapped to the region of interest according to the NCBI CloneFinder [] were re-sequenced. Libraries were prepared for both Illumina paired-end sequencing and nanopore 2D sequencing. Reads from nanopore sequencing (MinION Mk1B  R9 flowcell  Oxford Nanopore Technologies  Oxford  Great Britain) were assembled with the CANU assembler [] and error correction was performed with Illumina 100-bp paired-end reads of the same clone using BWA []  mpileup (SAMtools package) []  VarScan []  and a custom script for editing the variants called by VarScan in the reference FASTA file. To determine the relative copy number ratio of the candidate segment between belted and non-belted animals  three qPCR primer pairs within the candidate segment (Fig.  and Table ) and two qPCR primer pairs flanking the candidate segment (belt_b1  belt_d2) were designed. In addition  two qPCR primer pairs were designed for reference sites within the  and  genes. All seven qPCR were run under optimized conditions (Table ) on the LightCycler 96 System (Roche  Rotkreuz  CH) using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche  Rotkreuz  CH). The copy numbers of the investigated segment were determined from a standard curve derived from serial dilutions of a reference DNA. The relative copy number ratio (candidate segment to the reference site) was calculated for all constellations. Targeted locus amplification (TLA) is a method for targeted re-sequencing that is based on crosslinking of physically proximal sequences. Thus  this technique can generate DNA libraries that cover more than 100 kb of contiguous DNA on either side of a primer pair [  ]. An advantage of the TLA method is that it does not depend on detailed prior locus information. Thus  it is particularly useful when there is doubt about the overall correctness of the reference genome sequence in the target region and/or when extended rearrangements are assumed to have occurred within the target region [] as was assumed for the candidate segment in belted animals. For re-sequencing with TLA  leukocytes were isolated from fresh EDTA-blood samples of a Belted and a Black Galloway individual according to the protocol provided by Cergentis (NL) []. Locus amplification  sequencing and mapping were performed by Cergentis. The Dutch Belted animal  LKF08  was chosen for whole-genome nanopore sequencing in order to further elucidate the structure of the expanded repeat region. Five nanograms of needle-sheared DNA (obtained by passing the sample through a 20 gauge needle five times) were used for library preparation with the Oxford Nanopore Kit for 1D libraries (LSK108). The DNA was end-repaired with NebNext UltraII End repair module and simultaneously damage-repaired with the FFPE repair kit (both from New England Biolabs). The reaction was carried out with 24 µL of DNA  1.75 µL of end repair buffer  1.75 µL of FFPE buffer  1.5 µL of end repair enzyme mix and 1 µL of FFPE repair enzyme mix. This reaction mix was incubated for 5 min at 20 °C and 5 min at 65 °C. Then  20 µL of AMX adapter and 30 µL of NebNext UltraII Ligation mix were added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The ligated library was purified with Ampure XP beads and prepared for sequencing following the instructions of the Oxford Nanopore kit for 1D libraries. The final sequencing mix was loaded onto a PromethION flow cell and sequenced for 60 h on a PromethION alpha version instrument (ONT  Oxford UK). The resulting data were base-called with Albacore 2.1.7. The resulting 6.75 Gbp of fastq data were mapped to UMD3.1.1 with minimap2 (Li H (2017) Minimap2: fast pairwise alignment for long nucleotide sequences. arXIV: 1708.01492). Reads that mapped to the belted candidate region were extracted and assembled with CANU []. As shown in Fig. a  the LRT position was detected at 118 156 136 bp and the extended confidence interval ranged from 117 042 320 to 119 561 104 bp on BTA3.

Dotplot of the reference sequence of the 6-kb candidate segment against itself. Green circles highlight the obvious sequence similarity at the end and beginning of  To narrow down the true position of the  locus  the haplotypes of the extended confidence interval  which was defined by the cLDLA analysis  were visually analyzed. Therefore  haplotypes consisting of 60 SNPs that covered the whole extended confidence interval were sorted by breed and by assumed belt genotype (see Additional file ). First  two candidate haplotypes that perfectly fitted the phenotypes of Belted Galloway and a third haplotype that matched the situation in Dutch Belted cattle were identified. Then  two other common haplotypes were found in Gurtenvieh cattle. Assuming that the belted phenotype was introgressed into Dutch Belted and Belted Galloway by Gurtenvieh individuals  we hypothesized that the  locus resides in a region common to these five haplotypes. These five haplotypes overlapped with four inner candidate haplotypes (--) that extended across five to eight SNPs (Table ). Among these  - overlapped with the candidate haplotype identified by Drögemüller et al. []  - and - were located proximal and - was located distal to this region (Fig. b). Filtering of all the variants included in the combined confidence interval region to select only those that were homozygous in both the Belted Galloway and Dutch Belted animals and heterozygous in the Gurtenvieh crossbred animal produced a list of 298 candidate variants (15 InDel and 283 SNPs). However  a comparison with control animals showed that  for each of these polymorphisms  at least one animal in the non-belted control group was also heterozygous or homozygous for the respective variant. Consequently  all these variants were excluded as candidate causal mutations. Visual inspection identified a<U+2009>~<U+2009>6-kb segment with an elevated read coverage (called  hereafter) that was not observed in any of the non-belted animals (see Fig. c). This segment extends from<U+2009>~<U+2009>118 608 000 to 118 614 000 bp on BTA3 (in both reference genomes bosTau6/UMD3.1 and bosTau8/UMD3.1.1) and is located between the first and second SNP of - (Fig. ) []. This segment does not encompass any annotated protein coding gene but comprises a large number of repetitive elements (LINE and SINE). The nearest gene   (; 118 630 617-118 690 527 bp)  is located approximately 16 kb distal of . Although the coverage curve suggested some kind of multiplication of this sequence  we were not able to identify the borders of this event since there were no reads that showed a common breakpoint for correctly mapped and mis-mapped bases  as is frequently seen in duplication events. NGS identified an obviously large number of SNPs that were homozygous and different from the reference sequence  especially in the proximal third part of the  region  in animals from all tested breeds (Fig. c)  whether belted or not. Thus  to check the reliability of the reference sequence  BAC clones CH240-363B2 and CH240-104M22 were sequenced. It should be noted that the DNA used to construct the CH240 library originated from a male Hereford individual  i.e. a non-belted animal. The results clearly refuted the occurrence of assembly errors in the candidate region of the reference sequence  as demonstrated by the pairwise local alignment of the sequence of CH240-104M22 and the UMD3.1 reference sequence of the candidate region (chr3:118 608 000-118 614 000)  which was performed using EMBOSS Water []. As shown in Additional file   a similarity of 99.9% between the re-sequenced BAC CH240-104M22 and the reference sequence including only five SNPs and no gap in 6001 aligned bases was found. In order to elucidate why there was an increased number of reads mapping to  in the NGS data  we determined the relative copy numbers in belted and non-belted animals by qPCR (Fig. ). In a first set  we determined the relative copy numbers for 12 non-belted and 18 belted animals  with a heterozygous status predicted from haplotypes for six animals and a homozygous status for 12 animals of the latter group. All non-belted animals showed a relative copy number of approximately 1 for the qPCR amplicon belt2 (Figs.   ) as well as for the amplicons belt1 and belt3 (Fig. ). The copy number ratio between the reference sites in  and  was also close to 1 (data not shown). Since cattle is a diploid species  a ratio of 1 represents copies from two chromosomes. The relative copy number ratio of the belt amplicon sites increased to more than 2 for animals that presumably carried the belted genotype in a heterozygous state and more than 4 in animals that were presumably homozygous belted. These results confirmed that  most likely represents a quadruplication of the 6-kb candidate region. For all the animals studied  the phenotypes predicted from qPCR data agreed with those predicted from haplotype data. Interestingly  the qPCR also confirmed the haplotype-based prediction of heterozygous genotypes for two Dutch Belted individuals  which contradicts the initial assumption used for remapping (see section “”) that all Dutch Belted animals are homozygous belted. The qPCR amplicons flanking the candidate region (belt_b1  belt_d2) showed copy number ratios close to 1 for all animals irrespective of the belted phenotype. Thus  the multiplication points could be restricted to the segments between belt_b1 and belt1 and between belt3 and belt_d2 (Fig. ). In a second set  we checked another 70 animals that included  in addition to Belted Galloway  Dutch Belted and Gurtenvieh individuals  eight belted and two non-belted individuals from the Russian Yakutian breed. Interestingly  all but one belted Russian Yakutian individual also showed increased copy numbers for all three belt amplicon sites but not for the two flanking amplicons (Fig. ). Relative copy numbers of the candidate region. The copy numbers for the amplicon belt2 within the candidate segment were compared to the copy numbers of the reference sites in  and   respectively.

Regions that appear to be conserved among mammalian species are marked by grey ellipses and regions that are predicted to have a regulatory function in humans are indicated by a dotted bar. Regions that resemble repetitive elements are indicated by thin lines. The multiple occurring repetitive elements A and B are highlighted with arrows indicating their approximate size and orientation. The candidate region that was predicted by an increased number of NGS reads (inset) is shown by a grey arrow with the localization of the amplicons used in the qPCR indicated by colored dots. The shown qPCR results represent the results of the second set (see “”). The top row comprises animals from the Belted and Black Galloway (GLW)  Braunvieh (new and old breeding type) and Gurtenvieh (BV or OBV) breeds  and crosses between Gurtenvieh and Pinzgauer (RR) and Dutch Belted (LKF). The bottom row comprises animals from the Belted and Black Galloway (GLW) and Russian Yakutian (RUY) breeds (the latter highlighted by orange boxes) To investigate the hypothesis that the size or physical appearance of a belt could be associated with multiplication events other than a quadruplication  we included five animals that showed a very unsymmetrical belt  a very thin or very broad belt  a belt that did not circle the body completely and a belt that contained colored spots. However  qPCR results showed that  for these animals  copy numbers were comparable to those for animals with a typical belt and  thus  did not support the hypothesis (data not shown). Targeted locus amplification (TLA) was conducted in a belted and a non-belted GLW (Galloway) individual and confirmed the previous results of this study. Amplification of the candidate region and its surrounding regions showed that the genome coverage in the candidate region was 3 to 4.5 times higher in the genome of the belted Galloway individual than that of the non-belted Galloway individual (see Additional file ). The start and end positions of the multiplication event were estimated to lie between 118 607 797 and 118 608 377 bp and between 118 613 882 and 118 614 044 bp  respectively. Based on the observed copy number and the fact that no breakpoint was detected  a multiplication event with homologous recombination at the sites of repetitive elements was hypothesized. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the same LINE element (BovB) occurs at the beginning and the end of the candidate locus. The similarity between both BovB-sequences was clearly seen in the dotplot performed with Gepard 1.4 [] (Fig. d)  and a global pairwise alignment performed with EMBOSS Needle [] (see Additional file ) confirmed an identity of more than 80% between both elements. Whole-genome sequencing produced approximately 6.8 Gb of sequence of which about 98% could be mapped to the bovine genome. Read lengths extended up to 25 kb  but most of the reads were shorter than 5 kb. Mapping results in the candidate region for the belted trait showed five long reads that partially mapped to the end of the suspected repeat expansion and partially to its beginning (see Additional file a and b)  thus confirming the head-to-tail repetition of the candidate region. An attempt to assemble the candidate region from long reads resulted in only a relatively short contig of 5 kb  but it showed the junction between the putatively amplified regions and thus confirmed the head-to-tail orientation. While the overall genome coverage was only about twofold  it was tenfold in the candidate region. Five reads showed the presence of a head-to-tail junction between the putative repeat units. A simple duplication would only show junction-spanning reads in the range of the average genome coverage (2<U+2009>×)  thus the five split reads correspond approximately to three junctions  i.e. a fourfold repetition of the unit. The breakpoints of the repeated units were determined by the results of the assembly and the split alignment of junction-spanning reads at 118 608 362 and 118 614 132 bp. At position 118 614 132 (the breakpoint on the right side)  five fragments showed a “soft-clip” from which a consensus sequence GGACCAGATGCTGATTTGTTTTC… could be derived (see Additional file c). This sequence is present at the beginning of the candidate region and thus defines the left breakpoint (at position 118 608 362). A formal confirmation of the quadruplication event would need a nanopore read that spans the entire amplified region. While this is technically possible  these reads are usually present only a small fraction of the whole sequencing run  and thus would require a high throughput flow cell that yields<U+2009>~<U+2009>100 Gb of sequence from a single run. Such flow cells are currently under development. The NGS  qPCR  TLA and nanopore sequencing results consistently showed an increase in the number of copies of a region between approximately 118 608 00 and 118 614 000 bp on BTA3 in belted animals compared to non-belted animals. Thus  our findings confirm the multiplication event that was previously also described by Awasthi Mishra et al. [] as the most likely candidate for the belted phenotype in cattle. Interestingly  the qPCR  nanopore and TLA sequencing results suggest that the belted phenotype is probably not due to a simple duplication of the candidate region  but more likely to a quadruplication of this region. The molecular basis of such a process remains elusive  but a detailed analysis of the candidate region and its surrounding regions illustrates that this locus carries a considerable number of two types of repetitive elements referred to as “A” and “B” (Fig. ). While the elements of A and B are not identical  the high degree of homology between them might be sufficient for homologous recombination  which  in the end  caused multiplication of the locus. The high density of repetitive elements within and around the candidate region also hampers the definition of the complete multiplied region so that the exact nucleotide sequence of  remains elusive. In general  however  there is evidence that after a rare event of a duplication  the chance of getting higher orders of duplications at the same site is elevated based on asymmetric pairing and crossing-over []. Although the approximate position of the  candidate locus is obvious (118 608 000–118 614 000 bp) and the putative breakpoints could be identified  the exact nature of the multiplication event is yet unknown. Most probably  a homologous recombination within the repetitive elements that are located on both sides of the multiplied region (Fig. d) led to a stepwise amplification of the region. Mapping of long nanopore reads defined the outer boundaries of the multiplication at 118 608 362 and 118 614 132 bp. However  the exact multiplicity and the inner breakpoints could not be determined due to the relatively low coverage and limited read length. The outer breakpoints do suggest that repetitive elements at the beginning and end of the  region are involved. Interestingly  the annotated repetitive elements differ partly in their classification regarding long (LINE) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) in bosTaurus6 and bosTaurus8 reference genomes  although an exemplary pairwise alignment shows that both sequences are identical (see Additional file ). Interspersed nuclear elements are known to be involved in genome instability by generating copy number variants []. We hypothesize that a similar process has caused the multiplication event leading to the belted phenotype. For quadruplication  independent recurrences of this process could have occurred. The gene  represents the nearest protein coding sequence and is located approximately 16 kb downstream of the multiplication event. We agree with Awasthi Mishra et al. [] that this gene is most likely affected by the multiplication event. Several reasons supporting this assumption are presented in Awasthi Mishra et al. []. Another indication that strengthens the assumption that  could be involved in the formation of the belted phenotype in cattle is the fact that a gene interaction network prepared with genemania [] connects  with both  and   which are the causal genes for belted phenotypes in pigs and mice (see Additional file ). In addition to various indirect connections  there are also direct connections between all three genes (even if only predicted functional relationships). Since the candidate variant for the belted phenotype is most likely a quadruplication  the question was raised whether animals with a smaller number of multiplication events  i.e. duplications or triplications  showed an imperfect or thin belt  and those with more than four duplications showed unusually broad belts. The assumption that copy numbers other than 1 (non-belted allele) and 4 (belted allele) may occur correlates with the results of Awasthi Mishra et al. who found varying copy numbers of 2 to 12 by digital droplet PCR []. To check this hypothesis  we included six animals with imperfect belts within the qPCR analysis. However  the qPCR results of the animals with imperfect belts showed comparable copy numbers to those of the typically belted animals and  thus  did not support this hypothesis. However  it should be noted that due to the small DNA concentrations (less than 10 pg/µL in some cases)  the results of the second qPCR set clearly confirmed the separation of non-belted and belted animals (Fig. ) but only hardly allowed a differentiation between homozygous and heterozygous belted animals. Consequently  based on the current data  a connection between belt width/appearance and copy number seems unlikely but cannot be excluded for certain. The qPCR results presented in this study strongly indicate that the belt phenotype of belted Russian Yakutian animals has the same or at least a very similar genetic cause than that of Gurtenvieh  Dutch Belted and Belted Galloway cattle since all but one belted Russian Yakutian individual also showed an elevated copy number for the amplicons belt1-3 but not for those outside of the candidate region. However  we were not able to check if the supposedly belted Russian Yakutian individual that did not carry the multiplication event was indeed belted or maybe piebald because no pictures were available and the animal was no longer available for a second phenotyping and sampling. While breeding histories strongly indicate that the belt phenotype was introgressed into Dutch Belted from Gurtenvieh cattle and then into Belted Galloway from Dutch Belted cattle  a direct connection of one of these breeds to the Russian Yakutian breed (or the other way round) is not known to the authors. However  an indirect connection could be found  i.e. that cattle from the Netherlands were crossed with Kholmogory cattle in 1725 and  again  in small numbers during the years 1765 to 1898 []. Kholmogory bulls  in turn  were frequently crossed with Yakutian cattle in the years after 1929 []. Since Kholmogory cattle are a piebald breed  the belts may not be clearly visible with animals that have a large proportion of white coat  thus the belted phenotype may have been introduced into both Kholmogory and Russian Yakutian cattle unintentionally. In that case  we would expect belted Russian Yakutian cattle to have the Dutch Belted haplotype or at least a similar extended haplotype such as the Gurtenvieh  Dutch Belted and GLW breeds. However  as shown in Additional file   the haplotypes of the belted Russian Yakutian are  especially within -  much less extended and less uniform than in the European cattle breeds  which is an indication that the belted mutation has been segregating in the North-East Asian Turano cattle group for a much longer time. Thus  it could also be possible that the belt phenotype was introduced into European cattle breeds by some North-East Asian cattle or that the mutation already existed when the progenitors of the North-East Asian and European breeds spread. Future studies using IBD analysis of high-density SNP data for haplotypes flanking the belted mutation  or third-generation sequencing  or even more advanced methods that might be developed within the next years and that will hopefully be able to sequence the whole multiplication event in one piece  could finally clarify the question if the North-East Asian and European belted mutation events are completely identical or not. Our results confirm the findings by Awasthi Mishra et al. [] in an independent animal set and indicate that a putative 6-kb quadruplication on BTA3  which is positioned between 118 608 362 and 118 614 132 bp and might affect its nearest gene   is the most likely candidate causal variant for the belted phenotype in European and very likely even Siberian cattle. Moreover  this study highlights the complexity of this highly repetitive genomic region and demonstrates that  in particular  the beginning and end of the multiplication event are formed by highly similar sequences. Finally  the breakpoints defined here could enable a PCR-based test that would be specific of the junction generated by the multiplication event. However  the repetitive nature of the joined elements may prevent this obvious solution. Although this study adds important new information to the process of elucidating the belted coat color phenotype in cattle  several questions remain that need future investigations: (i) do multiplication events other than quadruplications exist and do the respective animals show plain-colored or belted phenotypes  (ii) are the multiplication events in European and North-East Asian Turano cattle identical or do they represent two independent similar mutations  and (iii) (in which way) does the multiplication event influence the putative candidate gene .

However  in spite of the growing diffusion of cosmopolite specialized breeds  several local cattle breeds are still farmed in Italy. Genetic characterization of breeds represents an essential step to guide decisions in the management of farm animal genetic resources. The aim of this work was to provide a high-resolution representation of the genome-wide diversity and population structure of Italian local cattle breeds using a medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.ResultsAfter quality control filtering  the dataset included 31 013 SNPs for 800 samples from 32 breeds. Our results on the genetic diversity of these breeds agree largely with their recorded history. We observed a low level of genetic diversity  which together with the small size of the effective populations  confirmed that several breeds are threatened with extinction. According to the analysis of runs of homozygosity  evidence of recent inbreeding was strong in some local breeds  such as Garfagnina  Mucca Pisana and Pontremolese. Patterns of genetic differentiation  shared ancestry  admixture events  and the phylogenetic tree  all suggest the presence of gene flow  in particular among breeds that originate from the same geographical area  such as the Sicilian breeds. In spite of the complex admixture events that most Italian cattle breeds have experienced  they have preserved distinctive characteristics and can be clearly discriminated  which is probably due to differences in genetic origin  environment  genetic isolation and inbreeding.ConclusionsThis study is the first exhaustive genome-wide analysis of the diversity of Italian cattle breeds. The results are of significant importance because they will help design and implement conservation strategies. Indeed  efforts to maintain genetic diversity in these breeds are needed. Improvement of systems to record and monitor inbreeding in these breeds may contribute to their in situ conservation and  in view of this  the availability of genomic data is a fundamental resource."

However  in spite of the growing diffusion of cosmopolite specialized breeds  several local cattle breeds are still farmed in Italy. Genetic characterization of breeds represents an essential step to guide decisions in the management of farm animal genetic resources. The aim of this work was to provide a high-resolution representation of the genome-wide diversity and population structure of Italian local cattle breeds using a medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. After quality control filtering  the dataset included 31 013 SNPs for 800 samples from 32 breeds. Our results on the genetic diversity of these breeds agree largely with their recorded history. We observed a low level of genetic diversity  which together with the small size of the effective populations  confirmed that several breeds are threatened with extinction. According to the analysis of runs of homozygosity  evidence of recent inbreeding was strong in some local breeds  such as Garfagnina  Mucca Pisana and Pontremolese. Patterns of genetic differentiation  shared ancestry  admixture events  and the phylogenetic tree  all suggest the presence of gene flow  in particular among breeds that originate from the same geographical area  such as the Sicilian breeds. In spite of the complex admixture events that most Italian cattle breeds have experienced  they have preserved distinctive characteristics and can be clearly discriminated  which is probably due to differences in genetic origin  environment  genetic isolation and inbreeding. This study is the first exhaustive genome-wide analysis of the diversity of Italian cattle breeds. The results are of significant importance because they will help design and implement conservation strategies. Indeed  efforts to maintain genetic diversity in these breeds are needed. Improvement of systems to record and monitor inbreeding in these breeds may contribute to their in situ conservation and  in view of this  the availability of genomic data is a fundamental resource. Domestication of cattle occurred during the Neolithic agricultural revolution  about 8000 years ago  and was associated with dramatic modifications in the socio-economic conditions of most human populations []. Cattle became the most relevant domestic species by their ability to supply meat and milk. Moreover  they assumed a role in social and religious ceremonies and games []. Artificial and natural selection  coupled with complex evolutionary background scenarios  have led to the creation of a large variety of breeds in terms of phenotypes that are well adapted to a wide range of environments and rearing systems  and to different production purposes []. In the last 50 years  the diversity of cattle breeds has experienced a severe contraction  mainly because of the massive worldwide adoption of a few highly productive breeds and intensive selection []. As a result  assessing cattle genetic diversity represents an important step in the management of cattle breeding programs []. Thanks to the recent advent of high-throughput affordable genotyping techniques  fine genome-wide analysis of the genetic structure and relationships between cattle populations has become possible []. These technologies have opened new perspectives to livestock genetics  as part of both the genomic selection revolution in livestock industry and the introduction of genomic approaches in conservation programs for small and endangered populations []. In spite of the growing diffusion of the cosmopolite specialized breeds  several local cattle breeds and populations are still farmed in Italy. In the past  local cattle breeds were used as triple purpose animals (work  milk  and meat); then  depending on the region  the animal characteristics  and the geographical boundaries  they began to diverge into the present-day breeds []. Nowadays  most of these local breeds are fully adapted to a specific habitat or production system and represent a significant resource to satisfy present and future demands for sustainable farming in a changing environment []. Unfortunately  in some cases  only a few purebred representatives of local breeds are available  thus highlighting the need for implementing a national conservation strategy []. Towards this aim  detailed information on the genetic diversity and population structure of cattle breeds is needed to guide conservation decisions and the possible use of local cattle populations [    ]. The genome-wide genetic diversity and population structure of Italian cattle breeds remain poorly studied compared to local breeds from other European countries  such as France []  Spain [  ]  Russia [] and  in general  of other worldwide cattle breeds [      ]. Only a few Italian breeds have been characterized using medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays []. In accordance with the criteria defined by the Italian Breeders Association  there are 16 officially recognized cattle breeds in Italy  i.e. Agerolese  Burlina  Cabannina  Calvana  Cinisara  Garfagnina  Modenese  Modicana  Mucca Pisana  Pezzata Rossa d’Oropa  Pontremolese  Pustertaler  Sarda  Sardo-Bruna  Sardo-Modicana and Ottonese-Varzese. These breeds are characterized by a demographic contraction that  in some cases  is very severe. An official genealogical register is responsible for the safeguard and preservation of these breeds that are not included in any national selection program. Thus  the present study was undertaken to analyze the level of genetic diversity  population structure  admixture patterns and relationships among 30 Italian cattle breeds using medium-density genome-wide SNPs. It represents the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of Italian cattle diversity. The genomic characterization of these breeds is a first step towards the development of appropriate breeding strategies. Genomic DNA was isolated using a salting-out protocol from buffy coats of nucleated cells that were obtained from whole-blood withdrawn from the jugular vein using EDTA-containing tubes []. The DNA concentration was assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies  Wilmington  DE). A total of 814 animals (10 to 43 per breed) belonging to 30 Italian cattle breeds (Agerolese  Barà-Pustertaler  Burlina  Cabannina  Calvana  Chianina  Cinisara  Garfagnina  Italian Brown  Italian Holstein  Italian Simmental  Marchigiana  Maremmana  Modenese  Modicana  Mucca Pisana  Pezzata Rossa d’Oropa  Piedmontese  Pinzgau  Podolica  Pontremolese  Pustertaler  Reggiana  Rendena  Romagnola  Rossa Siciliana  Sarda  Sardo-Bruna  Sardo-Modicana and Ottonese-Varzese) were selected. In addition  two cosmopolitan breeds reared in Italy (Charolais and Limousin) were included because they are used for cross-breeding with local breeds. Thus  they are relevant to study the genetic relationships between Italian breeds. For a short description of each breed included in this study (see Additional file ). For sampling representativeness  we selected for each breed unrelated or minimally-related subjects  which were sampled from different farms that cover the usual rearing area. The number of samples and the breed origin of the genotyping data are provided in Additional file : Table S1 and the geographical origin of the breeds is illustrated in Fig. . Geographic origin of the analyzed local Italian cattle breeds. Northern (green)  Northern-central (orange)  Podolian-derived (red) and Southern and islands (blue) breeds. For full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1) For all animals  genotyping data from the Illumina BovineSNP50 v2 BeadChip array were collected for the analysis. The genotypes of several local breeds were generated within the frame of this study  whereas for some breeds  data were derived in previous studies (see Additional file : Table S1). PLINK [] was used to merge the genotyping data and to conduct quality control tests. In total  42 561 SNPs were available before filtering. The dataset was filtered to remove animals with more than 10% missing genotypes  and to exclude non-autosomal SNPs  SNPs with a call rate lower than 98% and with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05. After filtering  31 013 SNPs remained for the analyses on 800 samples from 32 cattle breeds reared in Italy. PLINK [] was also used to estimate observed (H) and expected (H) heterozygosity  the genomic inbreeding  which is based on the difference between the observed and expected numbers of homozygous genotypes ()  and average MAF (=<U+2009>0.05). Historical and recent effective population sizes (N) for each breed were estimated with the SNeP package []  which is based on the relationship between linkage disequilibrium (LD)  N and recombination rate. The contemporary effective population size (cN) was calculated with NESTIMATOR v. 2 []  which is based on the random mating model of the LD method []. Genotyping data were phased by using the Beagle 3.0.4 package []  according to Isi-Touru et al. []. Expected heterozygosity (H_hap) for the haplotypes for each breed was estimated using the R package ADEGENET []. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) were estimated within each breed using PLINK [] by applying the following parameters and thresholds to define a ROH: (1) the minimum size of a ROH was set to 40 SNPs; (2) the minimum lengths of a ROH were set to 4  8 and 16 Mb; (3) a maximum of one SNP with missing genotypes and up to one heterozygous genotype were allowed in a ROH; (4) a minimum density of one SNP per 100 kb; and (5) the maximum gap between consecutive homozygous SNPs was set to 1 Mb. The ROH-based inbreeding coefficient () was calculated for each animal using the method proposed by McQuillan et al. []  which divides the total length of all ROH in the genome of an individual by the length of the autosomal genome covered by SNPs on the chip (2541.17 Mb). We calculated three genomic coefficients      and   based on a minimum ROH length of 4  8  or 16 Mb  respectively. Pairwise genetic relationships were estimated using a matrix of genome-wide identity-by-state (IBS) genetic distances calculated by PLINK [] and plotted using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot. In addition  to investigate more finely the relationships between Italian and European cattle breeds  we also performed a separate MDS analysis by combining our genotyping data with those of 62 European cattle breeds []. Population structure was inferred by applying the model-based clustering algorithm implemented in ADMIXTURE []. We estimated the most likely number of populations with the cross-validation procedure. We calculated the Reynold’s genetic distances with ARLERQUIN [] and used them to construct a Neighbor-Net graph with SPLITSTREE []. Pairwise estimates of  were obtained with GENEPOP software []. To test the correlations between genetic ( and Reynold’s genetic distances) and geographical distances between breeds  a Mantel test was performed []. We used the coordinates of longitude and latitude of the center of origin for each breed to define the geographical localization (see Additional file : Table S1). The geographical distances between each pair of breeds were computed using  function in the R package GEO-SPHERE (). Finally  historical relationships and admixture between the considered populations were inferred using the  and  tests implemented in TREEMIX []  which reconstructs a maximum likelihood tree for the populations based on genome-wide allele frequencies  and then attempts to infer a number of admixture events (edges) to better explain the observed data. The number of admixture events (E) tested ranged from 0 to 10  and the value of E that had the highest log-likelihood was selected as the most predictive model. We then performed the  and  tests implemented in the TREEMIX computer package. In particular  we used the -statistics (A  B  C) to determine if A was derived from the admixture of populations B and C  and the -statistics [(A  B) (C  D)] to test the validity of a hierarchical topology in four-population trees. Genetic diversity parameters are in Table . H and H ranged from 0.297<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.194 (Pontremolese) to 0.358<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.167 (Piedmontese) and from 0.267<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.187 (Mucca Pisana) to 0.353<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.137 (Sarda)  respectively. Mucca Pisana showed the lowest mean MAF (0.200<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.162)  whereas the Sarda breed showed the highest mean MAF (0.267<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.139). The highest average  were obtained for the Pontremolese (0.195<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.101) and Mucca Pisana (0.183<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.058) breeds  whereas the lowest  was obtained for the Sarda breed (0.006<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.063). Estimated H based on haplotype data (H_hap) was higher than that based on genotype data and ranged from 0.323<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.040 (Mucca Pisana) to 0.395<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.003 (Piedmontese)  with several Podolian-derived breeds (Calvana  Romagnola  Maremmana and Chianina) having intermediate values (<<U+2009>0.360). The two H estimates were correlated (=<U+2009>0.95   value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Estimated N at  generations ago (from 13 to 98) are in Additional file : Figure S1. As expected  N decreased progressively across generations. N was less than 150 for all breeds at 13 generations ago  except for the Sarda breed (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>152). The variation in N across generations was smallest for Mucca Pisana  Pontremolese and Garfagnina  for which the estimated recent N (13 generations ago) were less than 40. Ancestral populations of the contemporary Sarda  Cinisara and Podolica breeds exhibited considerably larger N values  with the largest historical N values. We also inferred the size of cN for each breed (Table )  with Pontremolese and Mucca Pisana having the smallest cN (less than 10) and Sardo-Bruna the largest cN (1021). Pearson correlations between genetic diversity indices for SNPs are in Additional file : Table S2. As expected  correlations between H  H and MAF were high (><U+2009>0.90   value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  whereas the correlations between these parameters and cN were quite low (~<U+2009>0.150). Recent and historical N estimates were not correlated with cN but moderately correlated with H  H and MAF (up to 0.810   value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Individual genomic inbreeding was evaluated using ROH data. The distributions of the three ROH inbreeding coefficients (    and ) are in Fig. .  values decreased with increasing minimum length of the ROH. ROH coverage in the genome differed considerably among breeds  with the highest mean values of  across all ROH length categories observed for the Garfagnina  Mucca Pisana and Pontremolese breeds. In particular  the Pontremolese breed had more than 10% of the genome covered by ROH in all length categories  and more than 16% by ROH longer than 4 Mb. In contrast  medium and low  were found for the other breeds  which is consistent with their larger N and moderate inbreeding (). The breeds with the lowest levels of inbreeding included Piedmontese and Rossa Siciliana. However  the large standard deviation values indicated high variability in autozygosity levels within each breed. Box plot of the inbreeding coefficients inferred from runs of homozygosity () defined by different minimum ROH lengths (><U+2009>4 <U+2009>><U+2009>8 and<U+2009>><U+2009>16 Mb) for each cattle population according to their geographical distributions. Northern (green)  Northern-central (orange)  Podolian-derived (red)  Southern and islands (blue)  and commercial (violet) breeds. For a full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1)  and  were highly correlated (0.918   value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and  was also negatively correlated with recent and historical N (~<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.74   value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). The relationship between the number of ROH and the extent of the genome with ROH longer than 4 Mb per individual are in Additional file : Figure S2. The patterns of ROH profiles differ among breeds. Most of the animals had between 1 and 20 ROH and less than 200 Mb of their genome were covered by ROH. For several breeds  such as Italian Brown and Mucca Pisana  some animals displayed a larger number of ROH (from 20 to 40) with a total length of 200 to 400 Mb. We also found some extreme animals (Pontremolese  Varzese-Ottonese and Mucca Pisana) with more than 600 Mb of their autosomes covered by ROH  which is equivalent to almost one-fourth of their genome. Differences existed also in the within-breed size. The distribution of the size of ROH also varied within breeds (see Additional file : Figure S3) and several individuals had a single ROH longer than 60 Mb. We used an MDS plot of the pairwise IBS distances to compare the Italian cattle breeds (Fig. ). The first dimension (C1) distinguished the three Sicilian (Cinisara  Rossa Siciliana  Modicana) and the Podolian-derived breeds (Romagnola  Marchigiana  Chianina  Calvana  Maremmana and Podolica) from the other breeds (right side of the plot). Moreover  the Sardo-Modicana breed was positioned in the same area. The Northern and Northern-central Italian populations formed a distinct group  which was clearly separated from the Sicilian and the Podolian-derived breeds on the first axis. The Burlina and Pinzgau were genetically differentiated and positioned a little further from the breeds from Northern Italy and near the Italian Holstein (at the top left of the plot)  while the other breeds (Piedmontese  Pustertaler  Barà-Pustertaler  Rendena  Pezzata Rossa d’Oropa  Reggiana  Modenese  Varzese-Ottonese  Cabannina and Pontremolese)  overlapped in a single cluster. This cluster also included the Sardo-Bruna  Italian Simmental and the two commercial meat breeds. The Garfagnina appeared as a distinct cluster and was positioned between the two principal clusters. Some Sarda animals clustered with Garfagnina  whereas others were mixed with the Northern and Northern-central Italian populations  and in particular with Piedmontese. The results also indicated that Mucca Pisana was isolated from the other breeds reared in Tuscany. The second dimension C2 clearly separated two other non-overlapping breeds  Italian Holstein and Italian Brown. Finally  among all the analyzed breeds  Agerolese showed a more spread out cluster  with some animals positioned near the Italian Simmental and Italian Brown breeds. Genetic relationships based on the multidimensional scaling analysis between the analyzed cattle breeds. Points and symbols are colored based on the geographic origin of breeds; the colors are the same as those described in Fig. . The first two components  C1 and C2  accounted for 14 and 11%  respectively of the total variation We tested admixture among breeds and groups of breeds by model-based clustering. The ADMIXTURE plots showed the results for K ranging from 2 to 32 (Fig.  and see Additional file : Figure S4). The first split (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) differentiated Calvana and Italian Brown from all other breeds. Additional breed-specific clusters were observed at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4  i.e. Mucca Pisana and Italian Holstein  and at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>8  i.e. Italian Simmental  Garfagnina  Pontremolese and Modicana (Fig. ). Model-based clustering of the estimated membership fractions of individuals from the 32 breeds analyzed in each of the K inferred clusters (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2  4  8 and 24). Names of breeds are colored according to their geographical distributions as described in Fig. . For a full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1) When K increased from 8 to 32  breeds were progressively assigned to separate clusters: Rendena and Maremmana at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>12  Romagnola and Pustertaler at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>16  Pinzgau and Burlina at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>20 (see Additional file : Figure S4). The most probable number of populations present in the total sample  as suggested by the ADMIXTURE cross-validation procedure was K<U+2009>=<U+2009>24 (see Additional file : Figure S5)  since at this value  each breed formed a distinct cluster although there was some variation. In fact  several breeds (Barà-Pustertaler  Varzese-Ottonese  Piedmontese  Cabannina  Podolica  Agerolese  Cinisara  Rossa Siciliana  Sarda  Sardo-Bruna  and Limousin) showed less distinct clusters. The same trend was also observed at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>28 and 32 (see Additional file : Figure S4). The Neighbor-Net graph  which was constructed based on Reynold’s genetic distances between pairs of breeds  showed another picture of the genetic relationships among the analyzed breeds (Fig. ). Consistent with the MDS plot  the Neighbor-Net graph shows several clear clusters and relationships between breeds  i.e. Italian Brown  Agerolese and Sardo-Bruna; Podolian-derived breeds; Sicilian breeds and Sardo-Modicana; and Burlina  Pinzgau  Pustertaler and Italian Holstein formed clear sub-branches. The shortest and longest branches were observed for Sarda and Mucca Pisana  respectively  which is consistent with the genetic diversity results (Table ). Relationship between breeds based on the Reynold’s genetic distance. An allele frequency-dependent distance metric (Reynolds) was used to construct a Neighbor-Net graph that relates the breeds. Names of breeds are colored according to their geographical distributions as described in Fig. . For a full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1) Details of the level of pairwise genetic differentiation are in Additional file : Table S3. Based on the pairwise  among all the populations  Mucca Pisana was again the most divergent breed. In general  for some breeds   was not found to be a proxy for geographic distance. For example   was highest between two Tuscany breeds  Mucca Pisana and Pontremolese  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.222) and lowest between Sarda and Sardo-Bruna (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.016). To test the correlations between genetic ( and Reynold’s genetic distances) and geographical distances  we performed a Mantel test. The results showed no concordance between  and geographical distances among all breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.073   value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.75) (see Additional file 1 Figure S6)  even after removing the commercial breeds (Charolais  Limousin  Italian Brown  Italian Holstein and Simmental) (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.160   value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.94). When only the Sicilian breeds were considered  the correlation increased but remained statistically non-significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.979   value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.33). We also conducted a Mantel test between Reynold’s genetic distances and geographical distances among breeds but again  no correlation was observed (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.078   value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.78). The TREEMIX results highlighted several admixture events (Fig. ) with most of them being expected based on the history of the breeds  such as admixture between Italian Holstein and Agerolese  between the group Calvana/Chianina and Mucca Pisana  between Italian Holstein and Pinzgau  between Pezzata Rossa d’Oropa and Pustertaler  between the group Agerolese/Italian Brown/Sardo-Bruna and Sarda  between the group Modicana/Rossa Siciliana and Cinisara  between Pinzgau and Pustertaler. Some admixture events were less obvious  e.g. between the Italian Holstein/Burlina and Charolais group  between the Italian Simmental/Pezzata Rossa d’Oropa group and the Rendena/Piedmontese/Charolais group. Finally  we detected a basal admixture event that involved several breeds from Central and Southern Italy (Chianina  Calvana  Marchigiana  Romagnola  Maremmana and Podolica) and from Sicily and Sardinia (Sardo-Modicana  Modicana  Rossa Siciliana  Cinisara and Sarda). Results from the  test highlighted clear signs of admixture between Rossa Siciliana and Modicana (see Additional file : Table S4). The admixed nature of Rossa Siciliana was also supported by the  test (see Additional file : Table S5) that highlighted a clear gene flow with Modicana  Sardo-Modicana and Cinisara (significant negative Z values) and with Limousin (significant positive Z values). Maximum likelihood tree inferred from 32 cattle breeds when eight migration events are allowed. Migration arrows are colored according to their weight. Name of breeds are colored according to their geographical distributions as described in Fig. . For a full definition of breeds (see Additional file : Table S1) To investigate the genetic relationships between Italian and European cattle breeds  we performed an MDS analysis using a combined dataset that included 32 115 SNPs and 1437 individuals (see Additional file : Figure S7). The second dimension C2 differentiated the Sicilian and Podolian-derived breeds from all other Italian breeds. Turkish breeds cluster with Sicilian and Podolian-derived breeds and Northern and Northern-central Italian populations were much closer to several French  German and Switzerland breeds. The Spanish breeds were positioned between the Northern/Northern-central and the Sicilian/Podolian-derived breeds. The first dimension C1 separated all the aforementioned breeds from the other European breeds included in this study. Improving our knowledge about the within-breed diversity and the between-breed relationships and structure in cattle is fundamental for improving selection designs and breeds  understanding environmental adaptation  enhancing efficient use of the breeds and implementing conservation programs [  ]. With the development of high-throughput genotyping technologies  analyzing the genetic structure of livestock species has become feasible. However  to date  much of the effort has been devoted to dominant commercial breeds  with local breeds generally poorly studied []  although they can represent outstanding genetic resources for the local economy. This study investigated the genome-wide structure of 30 Italian local cattle and two cosmopolitan breeds using medium-density genome-wide SNPs. Except for a very few breeds (e.g. Valdostana)  we were able to sample all the local cattle breeds reared in Italy and officially recognized. Therefore  our analysis concerns the largest and most complete dataset available for Italian cattle breeds. Although homozygosity may be overestimated for populations that were not included in the design of the SNP array (ascertainment bias) []  the Illumina set of 50 K SNPs was highly informative for all the Italian cattle breeds analyzed here. Heterozygosity values  polymorphism levels and recent and historical N estimates were very consistent. Average MAF were homogeneous among the breeds  and  on average  SNPs were equally informative for all breeds  which is consistent with previous observations []  even if at the individual level  the MAF of SNPs can vary considerably. The H and MAF values obtained in our study agree with the range of values that was reported in a study on the development and characterization of a medium-density SNP genotyping assay for cattle []  and are similar to those observed in other European breeds [] using the same SNP genotyping assay. This finding is likely due to the effect of the European ancestry of Italian cattle breeds []. We observed a decline in N with time in all breeds  as previously reported for other cattle breeds [    ]. In fact  estimated trends in N indicate that  in the past  the N of Italian cattle breeds was large. The size of cN differed among breeds  and several Italian breeds displayed small values  which is consistent with their low genetic diversity and high genomic inbreeding coefficients. In agreement with our results  small cN were reported also for Iranian native cattle breeds [] (from 13 to 107) and the Belgian Campine breed []. In the last 50 years  the number of individuals of these latter breeds has decreased dramatically  as is the case for Italian local breeds. With such small cN  their inbreeding rate has increased markedly until recently  as shown by the detection of long ROH in several local Italian breeds. The small cN inferred for most of the Italian local breeds  as well as the low values of their genetic diversity indices  may be also a consequence of population bottlenecks that occurred due to the geographic isolation of some farms and the reduced interest of breeders for these breeds []. In contrast  the Sarda breed had a larger N at all generations  and the Sardo-Bruna had the largest cN  which is probably due to admixture within these two breeds and crossbreeding with other cattle breeds. In general  strong selection pressures and use of artificial insemination (AI) are the main causes of small N in livestock. In local cattle breeds  selection pressure is usually very weak and AI is almost absent  but conversely  uncontrolled mating of related animals is common  and thus inbreeding and low genetic diversity are the most likely cause of their small N []. No correlation was found between cN and recent and historical N estimated 13  20 and 80 generations ago. Estimates of N vary a lot with the method used []. Moreover  it should be emphasized that these estimates can be strongly biased when the sample size is small  probably because of the LD generated by the sampling process []. Actually  none of the formulas proposed to date for estimating N from LD provide reliable predictions []  probably because they all rely on simplifications or assumptions. Therefore  these estimates (in particular the cN) must be considered with care  even more so when the sample size is less than 15 animals []. Anyway  our results are in agreement with other studies in cattle [  ]. Across all the breeds analyzed here  generally  the cosmopolitan breeds (Italian Holstein  Brown and Simmental  Limousin and Charolais) showed moderate levels of genetic diversity. Moreover  although some breeds (Rossa Siciliana  Sardo-Bruna  Sardo-Modicana  Agerolese) are endangered or have a small census population size  they did not show signals of low levels of genetic diversity. ROH analysis and N values corroborated these results  likely because of their admixed origins. However  the levels of polymorphism and genetic variability were lower in Pontremolese and Mucca Pisana than in all other breeds. These results are as expected since these two breeds experienced a stronger reduction in numerical size in the second half of the 20th century. Currently  the Pontremolese population includes less than 30 cows and the Mucca Pisana population is composed of nearly 200 cows. In both cases  the number of bulls is very small (2 and 10 for Pontremolese and Mucca Pisana  respectively). The low genetic variability observed for these breeds agrees with the theoretical expectation for populations  which have undergone a severe bottleneck []. Genetic diversity is an intrinsic factor that influences the adaptive capacity and resilience of populations. This low genome-wide genetic variability in these two breeds  as that observed in other local breeds  may be also related with a lower adaptation potential  which could represent a threat to their long-term persistence []. Therefore  our findings raise the possibility of a risk for the genetic diversity of Italian local cattle breeds  and the decrease in N should be taken into account and monitored. Abundant genome-wide SNPs are particularly suitable for detecting genomic regions with reduced heterozygosity and  recently  an alternative method called runs of homozygosity (ROH) was implemented []. Currently  ROH-based  estimates () are considered one of the most powerful approaches to detect inbreeding effects [] and may also reveal recent population bottlenecks or signatures of directional selection [  ]. Because the parameters used to detect ROH vary among analyses  it is not easy to compare results from different studies on ROH. Moreover  ROH have rarely been estimated in local breeds. Notwithstanding  our results are in agreement with the values reported in other studies on cattle [    ]. Analysis of individual ROH may be useful for conservation programs  since animals that have high levels of ROH  as observed in some Pontremolese  Varzese-Ottonese and Mucca Pisana animals  could be excluded or assigned lower priority for mating purposes in endangered populations  to minimize the loss in genetic diversity and maintain or increase N []. The length of ROH represents an important source of information on past and present demographic and genetic processes that shape the genetic diversity of livestock species []. Since recombination events split long chromosome segments  long ROH are a consequence of recent inbreeding. In contrast  short ROH are indicative of relatedness dating back to more ancient times []  which are in most cases not considered in an individual’s recorded pedigree. Thus  under the assumption that 1 cM<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 Mb  a minimum ROH length of 4  8 or 16 Mb implies a common ancestor 12  6 or 3 generations ago  respectively []. Thus  analyses that are carried out with ROH of different lengths allow us to estimate the distance between the current and base populations  and provide information on the age of inbreeding []. Generally  all breeds showed long ROH  but for some local breeds (such as Varzese-Ottonese  Calvana  Pontremolese  Mucca Pisana) their number increased. These results are also corroborated by the higher  obtained for Garfagnina  Mucca Pisana and Pontremolese. Therefore  strong evidence of recent inbreeding (3 generations ago) exists for these Italian breeds  due to the decrease in their N. In fact  isolation of breeds with a small population size increases the probability that identical segments are inherited. It is likely that the long ROH are also signatures of the extensive use of a few bulls within herds and of mating among relatives. If long ROH accumulate in the genome of some individuals  they could seriously impact the overall biological fitness []. Indeed  long ROH can be enriched in genomic regions that carry deleterious mutations  and Kim et al. [] showed that a strong relationship exists between the proportion of ROH in the genome and the number of individuals that carry deleterious homozygous mutations. Hence  the ROH levels estimated in our study may be informative to better understand the inbreeding history of the breeds analyzed. For example  this consideration is consistent with the management strategies known for the Pontremolese breed and its demographic decline that was reported ~<U+2009>30 years ago []. Similar results were also reported in Spanish goats  in which the most abundant and long ROH were identified in breeds that are at the verge of extinction []. On the contrary  the high  and low N values observed for the Italian Brown breed can be ascribed to the intense use of a small number of (closely related) bulls for artificial insemination. More generally  these results highlight that both ancient and recent inbreeding have impacted the genome of Italian cattle breeds and that several local breeds  in particular the four autochthonous cattle breeds of Tuscany (Pontremolese  Garfagnina  Mucca Pisana and Maremmana)  have probably not undergone recent extensive crossbreeding since the long ROH in their genomes have not been broken down []. This scenario probably reflects practices in the management of breeds with less controlled breeding that do not always prevent crosses between related animals  although they deserve special attention and conservation efforts. On the contrary  the limited occurrence of long ROH in Piedmontese indicates that this breed has benefited from proper breed management and has a sufficiently large N and thus a low degree of recent consanguinity. Therefore  we conclude that the genetic diversity indices  the effective population size and the genomic inbreeding levels were congruent with the protection status of the local Italian cattle breeds based on their reduced demographic size. The results also reflect the need to implement conservation programs  in particular for the breeds with a limited distribution. Determination of the structure and the genetic relationships of a population has proven useful in conservation programs and for developing suitable management practices [       ]. To understand these aspects  we carried out an MDS and ADMIXTURE analysis  inferred TREEMIX ancestry graphs  calculated the Reynold’s genetic distances and the pairwise estimates of  for the Italian local cattle breeds. Except for Podolian-derived breeds  the MDS grossly separated the breeds according to their genetic origin and/or to their geographical proximity between breeding areas. A previous study on breeds (Calvana  Chianina and Maremmana) reared in the ancient Etruria region (Tuscany  Central Italy)  reported that they are genetically closer to Near Eastern than to European genetic stocks []. This oriental genetic signature was observed also in modern Tuscan human populations  which have been shown to be genetically close to Anatolian and Middle Eastern human populations []. To better understand the genetic relationships between Italian cattle breeds  by considering the possible connections with breeds/populations that are presumed to have contributed to the shaping of the current genetic background of some of them  we performed an additional MDS analysis among Italian and European cattle breeds. Clustering of the breeds is generally consistent with their geographical origin. The Northern Italian breeds are much closer to several European breeds than to other Italian breeds  which indicates a contribution of continental European ancestry in the formation of these Italian cattle breeds. Another observation was that  even on the European scale  populations of the same major commercial breeds cluster together  e.g. Italian Holstein and European Holstein  and Italian Brown and Brown Swiss. Moreover  our results are consistent with those of a mtDNA study []  which showed that the Turkish breeds (such as the Anatolian Black breed)  clustered with the Tuscany (particularly with Calvana and Chianina) and the Cinisara breeds. The observed separation between Podolian-derived breeds and Northern Italian populations corroborates previous studies on the genetic relationship of some local Italian cattle breeds using blood group systems and blood proteins []. Our results were also corroborated by a recent study on mtDNA variation in different Podolian breeds []  which revealed a genetic proximity between the Italian Podolian-derived and the Turkish breeds. Their findings also show that  generally  the values of haplotype diversity indices were lower in some Italian Podolian-derived (Calvana  Podolica and Maremmana) than in non-Podolian breeds  which is consistent with our results of H_hap. The presence of a general North–South distribution of the genetic diversity along the Italian Peninsula was highlighted and confirmed by the low genetic differentiation () among some local breeds from the same geographic area  such as between Sarda and Sardo-Bruna or among the Sicilian breeds. Previously  a similar geographical pattern was described by using a medium-density SNP array in Italian goat [] and sheep breeds []. Our results did not show any obvious relationship between the patterns of clustering and the productive aptitude of Italian cattle breeds  contrary to what was reported for sheep breeds []. Moreover  no significant correlation between genetic differentiation and geographical distances was observed for Italian cattle breeds. Traspov et al. [] showed that  in local pig breeds  there was no geographical gradient of the distribution of their genetic variability and suggested that  even for breeds that had close geographical origins (as was the case for the Mucca Pisana and Pontremolese breeds in our study)  the implemented breeding schemes led to a high genetic differentiation. Moreover  similar results were also observed in pig populations from America []  which are probably the consequence of complex genetic histories. Therefore  these results confirm that the admixture between geographically distant populations could be a major force in breaking regional genetic-geography concordance []. Although the Northern and Northern-central Italian populations have different demographic histories and different breeding goals  our results show that they overlap in a cluster and they cannot be easily discriminated; furthermore  their MDS coordinates identified only small areas on the plot  as a consequence of the reduced within-breed genetic variability []. In general  the MDS plot was consistent with the admixture analysis  in which some kind of hierarchical structuring was identified. The plot obtained by ADMIXTURE showed that at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>8  some groups shared a substantial proportion of their ancestry  such as the Sicilian (Cinisara  Modicana and Rossa Siciliana)  the Podolian-derived breeds and Northern and Northern-central Italian populations. This observation was also consistent with the TREEMIX results. It is worth mentioning that  on the one hand  the breeds that were the most homogeneous at the lower K values also displayed the lowest heterozygosity level  a phenomenon known as ‘inbreeding bias’ []. On the other hand  for the breeds that  at the best K value (24)  displayed less distinct clusters  there was no evidence for high levels of inbreeding due to their admixed origins  and this suggests that crossbreeding with other breeds occurred. Therefore  our results are largely consistent with the breeding history of the Italian cattle breeds  given that some breeds are the result of crossbreeding. For example  the Sardo-Modicana breed originated by crossing local Sarda cows with Modicana bulls [] and the Sardo-Bruna breed by crossing local Sarda cows with Brown bulls. The genetic relationships between the Chianina and Calvana breeds are strongly supported by historical data and were previously investigated through AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) [] and microsatellite markers []. Some Sarda animals were mixed with Piedmontese  which reflects possible admixture. Similarly  Rossa Siciliana showed a high level of gene flow with Limousin. In fact  crossbreeding between local breeds and meat breeds is common practice  to improve meat production but also for long-term breeding. Therefore  this practice explains the results on admixture between local and meat breeds. In addition  the genetic structure of the Agerolese breed was typical of a breed that showed admixture with other breeds  as confirmed by admixture events in Italian Holstein and Italian Brown  and in agreement with its genetic origins. It is indeed a dual-purpose breed  which originated during the 19th century from autochthonous cows crossed with Brown Swiss and Holstein–Friesian bulls []. However  the limited number of males (e.g. only 13 males in natural service in the 2002) [] that were available in the breeding program could result in a limited N size that can  in turn  lead to a strong impact of genetic drift. Our results also indicate that the genetic component of some commercial dairy breeds  such as the Italian Holstein  was relatively small in the Italian local breeds. In fact  the lowest  values of the Italian Holstein was with the Burlina breed (0.066). Moreover  as illustrated by the MDS and ADMIXTURE results  the Italian Holstein breed is genetically distant from the local breeds. Nonetheless  differentiation between some local breeds (Barà-Pustertaler  Sarda  and Sardo-Bruna) and the commercial meat breeds (Limousin and Charolais) was very low (<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.04)  which suggests  as mentioned above  that the use of these breeds could have affected their genetic background. Among all the local breeds  Mucca Pisana was highly differentiated and presented only low levels of admixture with other breeds; this breed consistently demonstrated higher  values with the other breeds analyzed. In a recent study on Russian cattle breeds  analogous results were reported for the Yakut cattle  which was the most divergent breed []. For both Yakut and Mucca Pisana breeds  it is not clear why they are so divergent. It may be due to a combination of a small historical population size and a long history of isolation from other breeds. Our results also suggested that  compared to other breeds  the genome of the Mucca Pisana breed contains less genetic data from any other ancestral breed that it may have interacted with  which can be considered as a typical signal of inbreeding [] and is consistent with the values of the genetic diversity indices. The long branch observed for this breed suggests that it is a differentiated and isolated population with a small N size. In fact  Mucca Pisana showed the smallest recent and past N estimates. In a study on sheep breeds  Kijas et al. [] found that short branches were associated mainly to highly heterozygous breeds  while long branches were associated to much less heterozygous breeds. The above evidence for the Mucca Pisana breed was also confirmed by the MDS  ADMIXTURE  TREEMIX and  analyses  and can be explained by its demographic history since it was reared for a long time in a geographically separate valley (Valle del Serchio) []. Therefore  it is likely that this breed experienced reproductive isolation and reduced gene flow  and thus acquired a strong genetic identity. Since the Neighbor-Network analysis takes gene flow among breeds into consideration (reticulation)  it may provide a more likely reconstruction compared to linear representations []. Indeed the Neighbor-Network graph highlighted several clear clusters and relationships between breeds that originated from the same area  as shown in the MDS plot (Fig. ). The sub-branches of the Neighbor-Network graph were also in agreement with the results of the admixture  genetic relationship and genetic diversity analyses within breeds. In fact  the length of each sub-branch reflected the results of recent and past N estimates. The reticulations towards the extremity of the networks also suggest increased genetic relatedness between breeds and therefore past hybridization events between these populations  and are consistent with several of the admixture events highlighted by TREEMIX between breeds and groups. Indeed  Neighbor-Net is a robust tool for reconstructing phylogenetic networks. Therefore  the low pairwise  values  shared ancestry  admixture events  and reticulations observed on the phylogenetic tree between some breeds  as well as between the Sicilian breeds  all suggest high levels of gene flow between these populations  and as well between some breeds originating from the same area. These results can be attributed to the fact that geographical proximity facilitates the gene flow  and that breeds from the same breeding area are more likely to have common ancestries. Our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the genomic diversity and population structure of Italian local cattle breeds. All the analyses revealed genetic relationships  gene flow and admixture events for several Italian cattle breeds. However  although most of the breeds have experienced complex admixture events  several breeds have preserved distinctive characteristics and can be clearly discriminated  which is likely due to the effect of different remote and/or recent genetic and demographic factors. The population structure and the low genetic diversity presented here for several breeds represent useful information to guide conservation strategies. Notably  mating plans can have an important role in restraining inbreeding and increasing the census size of these local breeds. Monitoring of inbreeding trends and improvement of the recording systems are strategic for in situ conservation of these breeds  and towards this aim  the availability of genomic data represents a fundamental resource. Moreover  these results highlighted the importance of using genomic information to reveal the genetic structure of each population and provide an objective basis for decisions regarding the conservation of the Italian local cattle breeds. When standardized genotyping arrays are adopted  it is possible to combine various datasets. Therefore  further studies are necessary to provide insights into the genetic composition and origin of Italian cattle breeds  such as the Podolian-derived breeds  using data of other worldwide cattle populations  and for the development of a SNP-based identification test for breed assignment and tracing animal products.

Thus  this warrants pruning of genotyping data for high LD. We developed an algorithm  named SNPrune  which enables the rapid detection of any pair of SNPs in complete or high LD throughout the genome. LD  measured as the squared correlation between phased alleles ()  can only reach a value of 1 when both loci have the same count of the minor allele. Sorting loci based on the minor allele count  followed by comparison of their alleles  enables rapid detection of loci in complete LD. Detection of loci in high LD can be optimized by computing the range of the minor allele count at another locus for each possible value of the minor allele count that can yield LD values higher than a predefined threshold. This efficiently reduces the number of pairs of loci for which LD needs to be computed  instead of considering all pairwise combinations of loci. The implemented algorithm SNPrune considered bi-allelic loci either using phased alleles or allele counts as input. SNPrune was validated against PLINK on two datasets  using an  threshold of 0.99. The first dataset contained 52k SNP genotypes on 3534 pigs and the second dataset contained simulated whole-genome sequence data with 10.8 million SNPs and 2500 animals. SNPrune removed a similar number of SNPs as PLINK from the pig data but SNPrune was almost 12 times faster than PLINK. From the simulated sequence data with 10.8 million SNPs  SNPrune removed 6.4 and 1.4 million SNPs due to complete and high LD. Results were very similar regardless of whether phased alleles or allele counts were used. Using allele counts and multi-threading with 10 threads  SNPrune completed the analysis in 21 min. Using a sliding window of up to 500 000 SNPs  PLINK removed ~ 43 000 less SNPs (0.6%) in the sequence data and SNPrune was 24 to 170 times faster  using one or ten threads  respectively. The SNPrune algorithm developed here is able to remove SNPs in high LD throughout the genome very efficiently in large datasets. Most current applications of genomic data involve either high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays or whole-genome sequence data. Depending on the genetic diversity of the samples and the density of SNP arrays  there may be considerable redundancy in loci []  in the sense that many pairs of SNPs are in very high or complete linkage disequilibrium (LD)  i.e. they have an  value [] of (close to) 1. The extent of such redundancy is expected to be especially large for genomic data from populations with a small effective population size  which indicates high levels of LD  such as that typically observed in livestock populations e.g. [  ]. For applications such as genomic prediction  it is common practice to remove one SNP from each pair of SNPs with an  value of 1 []. Removing loci based on high levels of pairwise LD is commonly known as LD pruning. If all possible pairs of redundant loci are considered for pruning  computation of pairwise LD between all available SNPs may not be computationally feasible. Several tools exist that compute pairwise LD between SNPs [  ]. These tools are used to characterize the extent of LD in a population [  ]  to evaluate LD in regions on the genome where significant associations have been detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [  ]  but also to prune for LD []. Characterization of the extent of LD in a population and evaluation of LD in regions on the genome require computation of LD across relatively short distances on the genome. For this reason  but also to reduce overall computational requirements  existing tools generally compute LD between pairs of SNPs located within a certain distance on the genome  as defined by the user. However  for LD pruning  it may be desirable to consider LD for all pairwise combinations of loci. Wiggans et al. [] noted that highly correlated SNPs should have similar MAF  and thus they evaluated only pairs of SNPs with a difference in MAF less than 2.5% units. These authors simply considered that two SNPs are perfectly correlated if the genotypes were all the same (0–0  1–1  and 2–2) or all opposite (0–2  1–1  and 2–0)  while allowing 0.5% of the individual genotypes to differ from those rules  to allow for genotyping errors. The objectives of our study were (1) to develop an algorithm to be able to detect quickly any pair of SNPs in complete or very high LD in very large datasets  using the assumption that highly correlated SNPs should have similar MAF  and (2) to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm. The first step in the SNPrune algorithm is to identify redundant SNPs because they are in complete LD with other SNPs. The pseudo-code of this first step that is described hereafter is provided in Additional file . One way to detect SNPs in complete LD with other SNPs  is to compute the squared correlation between their phased alleles  hereafter termed   which is equivalent to the  value described by Hill and Robertson []: where  is the code of the phased allele  of individual  at SNP    is the code of the phased allele  of individual  at SNP   and  is the number of individuals. Computation of all squared correlations between all phased alleles of  loci involves computation of  correlations and is computationally unfeasible if  is very large  as may be the case for some high-density SNP arrays  but especially for whole-genome sequence data. Considering that the squared correlation between phased alleles of two SNPs can only be 1 when the MAF (and thus the total count of the minor allele) are the same at both loci  a more efficient approach is to take the following steps for each of the SNPs: Compute the total count of the minor allele across all individuals. Sort all SNPs on these counts. For any pair of SNPs that have the same minor allele count  compare the pairwise phased alleles for both haplotypes of each individual and stop as soon as an individual is identified that has a haplotype with the minor allele at one locus and the major allele at the other locus  or vice versa. If all animals passed the check in step (3)  then remove the “leftmost SNP” (which is the SNP with the lowest minor allele count due to the sorting in step (2); if both SNPs have the same minor allele count  the one that appeared in the data first is removed). In step (1)  first the count of the minor allele is computed for each locus   by computing the sum of the alleles  assuming that one allele is coded as 0 and the other as 1  and then translating that into the count of the number of minor alleles as: This means that for each SNP it is assumed that the minor alleles are coded as 1 and the major alleles are coded as 0  without changing the coding of the individual alleles stored in memory. This assumption is used hereafter as well. To avoid having to change the coding for many individual allele counts for the comparison in step (3)  the algorithm stores for each SNP the information on whether the count of the major or the minor allele is used. In step (3)  there are two possibilities for two SNPs with the same sum of alleles: Both SNPs have the same allele code for the minor allele; The two SNPs have opposite allele codes for the minor allele. If (1) is the case  then in step (3) the code of the phased alleles on each haplotype within each individual should be the same for SNPs  and   i.e. both should be either 0 or 1  to reach a squared correlation of 1. If (2) is the case  then in step (3) the phased alleles on each haplotype of SNPs  and  within each individual should either be 0 and 1 or 1 and 0  respectively  for those SNPs to reach a squared correlation of 1. When no phased allelic data is available  the  value between allele counts () is computed  which is a good proxy for   keeping in mind that  []. The above steps can be applied to detect any pairs of SNPs with   by replacing in Eq. () e.g.  with   where  is the allele count (ac) of individual  at SNP   yielding: Thus  in this case  allele counts per individual are compared instead of phased alleles within haplotypes and individuals. In parallel to the identification of SNPs in complete LD  it may be of interest to identify SNPs in (very) high LD  for instance with  values higher than 0.95 or 0.99. This is the second step in the SNPrune algorithm. The pseudo-code of this second step that is described hereafter is provided in Additional file . Continuing from Eq. ()  i.e. using phased alleles coded as 0 or 1  the aim here is to identify pairs of SNPs with an  value higher than a pre-defined threshold   for which the following holds: Note that all terms in Eq. () can be computed once per SNP and stored  except for . To isolate this term  we use the earlier assumption that for any pair of SNPs  the minor alleles are coded as 1 and the major alleles are coded as 0. In this way  the covariance between loci arises only from combinations of alleles coded as 1 on both loci  and consequently in all cases  is higher than 0. Therefore  Eq. () can be simplified to: Then  it follows that: Due to the assumption that minor alleles are coded as 1 and major alleles as 0  any of the sums of the products of the alleles within individual   either on the same locus (i.e. ) or between two loci (i.e. )  can be computed as the number of times that both alleles are 1. Note that for the observed values of the sums of allele counts  i.e.  for locus  and  for locus   the maximum value for  in Eq. () is obtained when  is maximized. This is achieved  when an allele 1 at locus  is as often as possible observed together with an allele 1 at locus . In a formula  the expected maximum number of times that this can happen is: Using Eqs. () and ()  for any possible value of   we can compute and store the range of values  for a locus  that satisfy Eq. (). This is done by considering that the MAF of locus  is lower or equal to the MAF of locus . As a result  Eq. () simplifies to: and Eq. () simplifies to: For each possible value of   we can compute the maximum value of  that may still result in . This is achieved by initializing  and then using the following steps: Increase  by a value of 1; Set ; Use Eq. () to determine whether the threshold can potentially be exceeded for the current values of  and ; If the threshold can be exceeded  then  is increased by 1 and repeat step (3); if not  then store   and return to step (1). The values stored in step (4) provide the range of values of   and thereby the range of loci  that should be considered when evaluating high LD for a locus . That is  the range of  values that should be considered for any value of  is defined as: In spite of the fact that this considerably reduces the number of  values that need to be computed  initial analyses showed that the total number might still be equal to several billions for datasets with a few million SNPs. In an attempt to further reduce the number of combinations for which  values need to be computed  we noted that the same principle can be applied to any (random) subset of the data. Because in our algorithm  due to sorting based on MAF  and the assumption that minor alleles are coded as 1  in all cases . Thus  Eq. () can be rewritten to a restriction for  as: Consider that we are comparing locus  and   for which Eq. () is satisfied. If for any subset of the data  Eq. () is not satisfied  meaning that: then the  value between loci  and  cannot exceed the threshold . Thus  after identifying pairs of SNPs based on sums across all individuals using the interval defined in Eq. ()  we evaluate those pairs based on sums of subsets of the individuals. This involves computing “partial” sums for an arbitrary number of subsets of the data. We used 10 subsets that contained 10  20 …  100% of the data. Note that those partial sums can be computed once for every SNP and stored. Those partial sums are tested against the condition defined in Eq. (). Whenever one of the partial sums fulfils the condition in Eq. ()  no other comparisons are performed for the pair of SNPs  and . Note that this comparison based on partial sums should not be performed for any pair of SNPs in which one SNP has a MAF of exactly 0.5  because in this case coding the minor allele as 1 is ambiguous. The final step of the algorithm is to compute  values for all pairs of SNPs that did not fail the test based on partial sums. In this last step  for any of those pairs of SNPs only  is computed  since all other values in Eq. () are computed once and stored  as previously noted. Since the algorithm to detect SNPs that are in complete LD is much more efficient than the algorithm to detect SNPs that are in high LD  both algorithms are applied sequentially in SNPrune when the aim is to prune for high LD. This is especially useful when pruning whole-genome sequence data  in which the number of SNPs in complete LD may be relatively large compared to the total number of SNPs []. The algorithm described above  which relies on phased alleles  can be applied to allele counts as well  by assuming that  in fact  phased alleles are known. This involves the assumption that if an individual is heterozygous at two loci  the minor allele at the two SNPs reside in the same haplotype  since this will give the maximum possible contribution to the  value. In Fig.  and Additional file   we show that the expected maximum values of  and  are virtually the same for values ranging from<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.95 to 1.0 (i.e.  has values ranging from 1.0000 to 1.0007)  which confirms that  in this range  we can use the algorithm for  to identify which loci may surpass the threshold for . The only other change that should be made to the algorithm for using allele counts instead of phased alleles on input  is that  in the final step   instead of  are computed. Relationship between expected maximum values for  values computed based on allele count () or phased alleles (). Pairs of  values are indicated by black dots. The red line indicates  as a reference To demonstrate the performance of the algorithm developed here  we applied it to two datasets. The first dataset comprised 3534 pigs with genotypes for 52 843 SNPs  which originated from the 60k SNP array. Details of this dataset are described by Cleveland et al. []. The genotypes were partly imputed  and defined as a real number on the 0–2 scale. Before pruning the data  these values were transformed as follows. Values lower or equal to 0.5 were set to 0  values higher or equal to 1.5 were set to 2  and all other values were set to 1. The second dataset was simulated using QMSim [] and contained whole-genome sequence data. The simulation process tried to mimic a historic dairy cattle population and a modern population under selection. The targeted effective population sizes () that changed over time reflected different estimated  values during the history of the US and Canadian Holstein cattle []. After the historic population  20 generations of 2500 animals with an equal sex ratio were simulated  using 200 males and 2500 females as parents. All male parents were replaced at each generation  and were selected based on breeding values for a polygenic trait with an accuracy of 0.8. After each generation  half of the female parents were replaced by all females generated in this generation. The final dataset  used for analyses  contained all 2500 animals of the last generation. For these animals  10 812 225 segregating SNPs were available  spread across 29 autosomes. The phase of the alleles was outputted by QMSim and assumed to be known without error in the analyses to prune SNPs based on LD. The algorithm developed here was used to prune both datasets that are described above based on . In addition  the whole-genome sequence dataset was also pruned based on phased alleles  to demonstrate the difference between both strategies. In all cases  a threshold for  of 0.99 was used. To compare performances  the datasets were also pruned based on  using the software PLINK version 1.90 beta [  ]. Pruning based on LD in PLINK is performed using a sliding window along the genome. For the pig dataset  it was still possible to consider all pairwise combinations by including all SNPs in one window. For the sequence data  this was not possible within acceptable computing time. Thus  sliding windows of 50  500  5000  50 000  500 000  or 5 000 000 SNPs were used for the sequence data  that were shifted forward in steps of 10% of the window size  i.e. with 5  50  500  5000  50 000  or 500 000 SNPs  respectively. The LD threshold used for pruning was 0.99  i.e. the same value as for SNPrune. For window sizes of up to 500 000 SNPs  PLINK was also run using the option that estimates  based on phasing information obtained with maximum likelihood. The command line argument used to run PLINK using  was (using a window of 5000 SNPs) the following: plink --bed data.bed --indep-pairwise 5000 500 0.99  and when using the maximum likelihood phasing information it was: plink --bed data.bed --indep-pairphase 5000 500 0.99. The pig dataset was pruned only by considering allele counts  since no map or phasing information was available. We performed pruning three times by using the two algorithms SNPrune and PLINK (Table ). The first time  the data were fed to both programs without any pre-sorting based on MAF  and SNPrune and PLINK removed 9126 and 9038 SNPs  respectively  with 6792 SNPs that overlapped. This relatively small overlap was most likely largely due to the removal of different SNPs from each pair in high LD  because the order in which SNPs were processed differed between programs. The second time  the order of the SNPs was based on increasing MAF  to make sure that both programs processed the SNPs in the same order. In this case  SNPrune and PLINK removed 9126 and 9098 SNPs  respectively  with 6844 SNPs that overlapped. Finally  the data were first pre-sorted on MAF  and then pre-pruned for complete LD. This pruning step removed 3830 SNPs. The remaining 49 013 SNPs  still pre-sorted based on MAF  were pruned for high LD. In this case  SNPrune and PLINK removed 5296 and 5283 SNPs  respectively  with 4939 SNPs that overlapped. PLINK computed all 1.4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 pairwise  values. Considering the analyses of SNPrune  a relevant question is how efficient is the algorithm in avoiding computation of  values that were predicted to never reach the imposed threshold of 0.99. Using Eq. ()  SNPrune filtered 9 898 092 pairs of SNPs that potentially could have a  higher than 0.99 (Table ). Based on partial sums of the minor allele  the number of  that needed to be computed decreased to 3 718 230. This was only 0.27% of the total number of possible  values in the entire dataset  or 0.31% of the total number of possible  values after pruning for complete LD. First  pruning of the simulated sequence data was done by using SNPrune based on phased alleles or allele counts (Table ). Results using one or ten threads were identical. In total  6 367 210 and 6 366 971 SNPs were removed based on complete LD  and another 1 428 122 and 1 428 725 SNPs were removed based on an  or  higher than 0.99  using allele counts and phased alleles  respectively. In total  3 016 893 and 3 016 529 of 10 812 225 SNPs remained after pruning  using allele counts or phased alleles  respectively. Sets of SNPs that were removed by using phased alleles or allele counts showed an overlap of more than 99.9% (results not shown). Pruning of the sequence data was also done using PLINK. It was not possible to consider all possible pairwise  values within an acceptable computing time  so we used sliding windows ranging from 50 to 5 000 000 SNPs. Whether pruning was based on allele counts or maximum likelihood derived phasing information  hardly affected the results. For example  the difference in number of SNPs removed for the window size of 5000 SNPs was only 342  which represents 0.0044% of the SNPs removed  while the overlap between removed SNPs was more than 99.9%. This result is in agreement with the SNPrune results using either allele counts or phased alleles  for which the overlap between removed SNPs was also close to 100%. When allele counts were used in PLINK  5 411 028 SNPs remained after pruning with a window of 50 and this number dropped to 3 059 391 with a window of 5 000 000 (Table ). When a window of 5 000 000 SNPs was used  PLINK removed 42 498 SNPs less than SNPrune based on allele counts. The number of  values computed by PLINK ranged from 2.65<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to 2.65<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 with window sizes ranging from 50 to 5 000 000 (Table ). SNPrune identified<U+2009>~<U+2009>107.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 pairs of SNPs that potentially could have a  higher than 0.99 (Table ). Based on partial sums of the minor allele  the number of  that needed to be computed was reduced to<U+2009>~<U+2009>61.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. Thus  the number of computed  values was only 0.08% of the total number of possible  values in the entire dataset  or 0.47% of the total number of possible  values after pruning for complete LD. The computing time required to process the pig data  averaged across five analyses and using one thread for all analyses  was equal to 17.2 s for SNPrune and 3 min 9.3 s for PLINK. Thus  SNPrune was 11 times faster than PLINK. For the sequence data with a single thread  SNPrune required 4 h 16 min using phased alleles  and 2 h 28 min using allele counts (Fig. ). Using ten threads  SNPrune required 42 min using phased alleles  and 21 min using allele counts  i.e. the latter almost halved the computing time. Computing times for PLINK were as short as only 1 min with a sliding window of 50  and increased linearly with increasing window size  to a computing time of 58 h 44 min using a window size of 500 000 SNPs. Window size and step size (i.e. the distance between the first SNP for two consecutive windows) increased each time by a factor 10. This means that when the window size increased by a factor 10  the number of computed  values roughly increased by 10  while the number of windows decreased by a factor 10. Thus  in effect  the number of computations increased by a factor<U+2009>~<U+2009>10  which caused the observed linear increase with increasing window size. Computation time to prune the sequence data using SNPrune and PLINK with various settings For the pig data  the peak RAM use was 213 Mb for SNPrune  and 215 Mb for PLINK. For the sequence data  the peak RAM use for SNPrune was 56.5 Gb using phased alleles and 29.8 Gb using allele counts. We ran the analysis using allele counts of all SNPs in PLINK (i.e. using a window size comprising the entire genome) for some time  but we did not let the analysis finish since it was too long. However  this allowed us to assess that the peak memory used in this case by PLINK was 33.0 Gb  but the memory use of PLINK dropped considerably  when smaller windows sizes were used. In this paper  we describe the algorithm SNPrune  which we developed to efficiently prune SNPs in complete or very high LD in datasets containing a large number of SNPs. SNPrune was 11 times faster than PLINK when applied to a dataset with 3534 pigs and 52k SNPs. We also show that SNPrune is able to prune sequence data with 2500 individuals and more than 10 million SNPs in 21 min using 10 threads. These results demonstrate that SNPrune is a very efficient algorithm to prune large datasets for high levels of LD  e.g.   as used in our study. Pruning based on phased alleles versus allele counts gave similar results  both with SNPrune and PLINK  but when the analysis used allele counts  it was considerably faster  for both algorithms. For SNPrune  the analysis using allele counts was almost twice as fast compared to using phased alleles  while for PLINK the analysis using allele counts was<U+2009>~<U+2009>2 to 4 times faster. The explanation of this factor 2 found for SNPrune is that the highest cost of SNPrune is to compute the cross-products of either the genotypes or the phased alleles  for all pairs of SNPs for which the  is computed. When using phased alleles  each of those cross-products involves twice as many multiplications compared to when using allele counts. For PLINK  the difference is larger  because PLINK actually performs the phasing itself  in addition to computing the  values. Interpolating the results in Fig.  shows that for window sizes of<U+2009>~<U+2009>15 000 and<U+2009>~<U+2009>25 000 SNPs  PLINK needs the same computing time for using either allele counts or phased alleles  respectively. In both cases  SNPrune removed only<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.4% more SNPs than PLINK. Thus  in the case of a sequence dataset with similar properties as that used in our study  using PLINK with a sliding window of<U+2009>~<U+2009>20 000 SNPs achieves similar results as SNPrune in similar computing time  albeit that PLINK still leaves some pairs of distant SNPs in high LD in the data. To limit computing time with PLINK or other similar software  usually only SNPs in close proximity on the same chromosome  e.g. less than 2 Mb apart  are compared. When the goal is to evaluate levels of LD  such a window-based approach is usually sufficient. When the goal is to reduce co-linearity between loci  for instance to improve the performance of a subsequent genomic prediction model  then it is desirable to consider all possible pairwise combinations of loci. SNPrune enables the detection of pairs of SNPs that are in strong LD regardless of their locations in the genome. In randomly mating populations  LD between loci on different chromosomes is expected to be low  and pairwise high levels of LD may only appear by chance. However  high levels of LD between loci on different chromosomes may be more frequent in highly structured populations such as livestock populations. Our simulated data mimicked a dairy cattle population under selection. Among the removed SNPs  considering the analyses based on allele counts  0.6% belonged to a pair of SNPs that were located on different chromosomes. The remaining 99.4% belonged to a pair of SNPs that were located on the same chromosome  and were on average 0.59 cM apart. Nevertheless  pairs of SNPs that were on the same chromosome could be separated by a large distance (Fig. ). Distribution of distances between pairs of SNPs pruned from the sequence data that were located on the same chromosome In the context of genomic prediction  high LD between SNPs can impair model performance []. The aim of genomic prediction is to put most of the emphasis  in terms of estimated effects  on SNPs in close LD with typically unobserved causal variants. In this sense  “spurious” associations  in which a SNP has a large estimated effect due to high LD with a causal variant although it is not close to it on the genome  are not desired. Such spurious associations will lead to estimated SNP effects that erode quickly over time. Thus  from the perspective of genomic prediction  it is important to consider all pairwise combinations of SNPs when pruning for high LD  rather than only those in a sliding window  as for instance in VanRaden et al. []. For the removal of spurious associations  the choice of which SNP should be removed from a pair of SNPs that are in high LD  could perhaps be made in a more sophisticated way. For a pair of distantly located SNPs with high LD  one option is to retain the SNP that has the highest LD with the surrounding SNPs. If the pair of SNPs is in LD with a causal variant  then this SNP is expected to be more likely physically closely located to this variant. Pruning for LD may considerably reduce the computational burden of genomic prediction based on sequence data  since  in our study  the number of SNPs in the simulated sequence data decreased by 72%. In the literature  a reduction of 58% was reported when imputed sequence data were used with 14 million SNPs for 5553 Holstein–Friesian dairy bulls and LD pruning in subsets of the SNPs was applied []  and in another study  a reduction of 99.5% was observed using 145 tomato accessions with imputed sequence data with 19.6 million SNPs []. Nevertheless  our results obtained with PLINK and the distribution of the distance between pairs of SNPs exceeding the  threshold (Fig. ) show that using a window approach does lead to the removal of the majority of SNPs that are in high LD with each other. The ability to efficiently identify SNPs that are in high LD with other SNPs located elsewhere in the genome  while they are in low LD with the surrounding SNPs  is also useful for other applications. In empirical analyses  high LD of one SNP with a group of SNPs located on another chromosome  maybe an indication that this SNP resides in a misassembled segment of the reference genome []. Therefore  SNPrune could be also a very useful tool to detect rapidly genome segments that may be misassembled. Similarly  the algorithm could be used in LD-based approaches to derive the chromosomal locations of unmapped SNPs [  ]. The amount of whole-genome sequence data generated is rapidly growing and soon  datasets for 100 000 sequenced animals may be available. Computing time is expected to increase linearly with increasing numbers of individuals  both for PLINK and SNPrune  because the number of multiplications required to compute a single  value is proportional to the number of individuals. In the analyses of the simulated sequence data  57% of the pairs of SNPs that were identified based on their MAF as possibly exceeding the threshold of 0.99  were discarded by evaluating partial sums (i.e. sums based on subsets of the data) of the minor allele rather than the sums of the minor allele of the entire data. Here  we used ten partial sums  comprising 10  20 …  100% of the data. With more individuals  it is possible that the percentage of pairs of SNPs that are discarded based on partial sums will be larger  and fine-tuning the number of subsets may increase this percentage even more. The implementation of SNPrune presented in this paper is not able to deal with missing genotypes  but we showed that it is able to efficiently remove SNPs in high LD. Pruning for considerably lower LD thresholds  i.e.  values lower than 0.8  means that the maximum difference in MAF for a pair of SNPs to possibly exceed this threshold will be considerably larger. This could lead to a relatively small reduction in the number of  values that need to be computed  compared to all pairwise combinations. Extending the algorithm to tolerate small amounts of missing data  and fine-tuning its performance for considerably lower LD thresholds  may increase its potential for other applications than those investigated in our study. While SNPrune is able to remove SNPs in high LD throughout the genome in large datasets very efficiently  the current implementation uses a one-byte format to handle (phased) SNP genotypes. Therefore  additional computing improvements could be realised by using a packed 2-bit format  which will allow bit-level operations and parallelism  as detailed by Chang et al. []. Adaptation of the two algorithms for bit-level parallelism is possible because their main operations involve integers 0 and 1 for phased genotypes  or integers 0  1  and 2 for allele counts (if missing values are ignored). As previously mentioned  allele counts could be considered as phased SNPs. Using such a packed 2-bit format  bit-level operations will improve the computation of terms such as  or   and reduce RAM and CPU time requirements  which would improve the efficiency of SNPrune even more. We developed an algorithm SNPrune that is able to remove SNPs in high LD throughout the genome in large datasets very efficiently. For a simulated whole-genome sequence dataset  we show that 72% of the SNPs were removed by pruning SNPs with  higher than 0.99  which reduces computational burden in subsequent genomic prediction due to the steeply reduced dimension of the data  but also to the considerable reduction in co-linearity in the SNP data. The SNPrune algorithm may also be useful for other applications such as detection of misassembled segments in reference genomes. Larmer SG  Sargolzaei M  Schenkel FS.

The Bayesian methodology developed here enables prediction of breeding values for FCR and RFI from a single multi-variate model. In addition  we derived posterior distributions of direct and correlated responses to selection. Genetic parameter estimates indicated a genetic basis for the studied traits and that genetic improvement through selection was possible. Direct selection against FCR or RFI resulted in unexpected responses in production traits. In swine breeding programs  efficiency of nutrient use is a significant factor because of its economic and environmental importance. Classically  feed efficiency is defined as output over input  for instance  milk yield  or milk components yield over dry matter consumption in dairy cattle  or body weight gain over feed consumption in pigs. However  in swine breeding programs  feed conversion ratio (FCR) is primarily used  defined as average daily feed intake (ADFI) over average daily body weight gain (ADG). The distribution of ratio traits such as FCR depends on the joint distribution of two normally distributed variables. The distribution of a ratio trait is easily determined if the mean of each random variable and the correlation between them are equal to zero. However  complexity arises as the variables’ means and correlation deviate from zero [  ]. The ratio of two correlated normal random variables has a closed approximate form  as illustrated by Hinkley []  and a distribution that deviates from normality  as reported by Gunsett []. Therefore  selection for ratio traits often results in unexpected responses in its component traits []. To circumvent the problems of ratio traits  residual feed intake (RFI) was proposed by Koch et al. [] as a better measure to determine animal feed efficiency. RFI is a partial measure of feed efficiency that refers to the proportion of feed intake that is independent of performance. In the classical definition  RFI is observed as ADFI minus the expected ADFI based on body weight (BW) and ADG  along with carcass composition  e.g.  lean meat percentage (LMP)  based on the results of a multiple regression analysis. Following Kennedy et al. []  this could be termed phenotypic RFI  as the correction ensures that the phenotypic covariance between RFI and production traits (i.e. BW  ADG and LMP) is zero. If the genetic (co)variances for the component traits of RFI (e.g.  ADFI  ADG and LMP) are known  a genetic RFI can be computed using partial genetic regression coefficients of ADFI on production traits (e.g.  ADG and LMP)  as applied by Shirali et al. []. Using a Bayesian framework  Jensen [] showed that breeding values and the posterior distribution of RFI can be derived by defining the proper distributions of feed intake  conditional on BW and ADG  and potentially other traits that act as important energy sinks  such as body fat content. This procedure also circumvents the need for deriving the regression coefficients from a separate regression analysis first and then using them in genetic analysis to compute a phenotypic RFI. Using a multivariate animal model can ensure that parameter estimation in the regression analysis is not biased by fixed effects in the model  or by effects due to genetic trends for component traits in the population under investigation []. Bayesian methodology  as illustrated by Sorensen et al. []  provides marginal posterior distributions for any parameter in the model  given the data available  where the required posterior distributions are obtained by means of the Gibbs sampler []. If non-informative priors are used  these distributions consider that other parameters  such as the variance components  are inferred from the data  such that proper probability statements can be made for response to selection. Bayesian methods ensure that uncertainties about the fixed effects and variance components are considered when evaluating breeding values and estimates of responses to selection. The Bayesian approach allows inference of the posterior distributions of non-linear functions of parameters  even if their distributions are unknown. Genetic or phenotypic variances and covariances in a given generation can be inferred based on their marginal posterior distributions  as shown by Sorensen et al. [] for a univariate model. Inferences about breeding values are made using the marginal posterior distribution of the vector of breeding values. Marginal posterior distributions of responses to selection or of genetic superiorities of a selected group can be obtained by averaging predicted breeding values that are obtained using mixed model techniques  as shown by Sorensen et al. []. In addition  when variance components are known and flat priors are used for fixed effects  the Bayesian estimates of response to selection are identical to the analysis by Sorensen and Kennedy []. The aims of this study were to (1) derive methods for the Bayesian prediction of breeding values for phenotypic and genetic RFI and for FCR  without invoking unrealistic distributional assumptions for FCR; (2) estimate genetic parameters for the production traits of growth  feed intake  and lean meat production  and for the derived traits of RFI and FCR; and (3) derive Bayesian estimates of direct and correlated responses to selection for feed efficiency  measured either as RFI or FCR  and for production traits. Animal care and handling were performed as part of a routine commercial breeding program. Animals were reared using standard procedures in a commercial Irish pig farm and therefore  no further approval of animal care and handling procedures was necessary. The dataset used for this study was collected as routine feed intake records from 2007 to 2014. Pigs (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3027; 2621 boars and 406 gilts) originated from Hermitage Genetics (Kilkenny  Ireland) and were selected on an index comprising feed conversion ratio  days to achieve 110 kg  and lean meat percentage (LMP). Animals went on trial at 52 kg (11  SD) and daily feed intake records were collected until they reached 110 kg (10  SD) of BW. During the test period  pigs were kept in mixed-sex pens of 12 pigs each  equipped with IVOG electronic feeders (Insentec B.V.  Marknesse  The Netherlands). Pig were fed ad libitum using a standard wheat and barley-based Irish finisher diet with 13.7 megajoules of digestible energy  17% crude protein  and 0.97% standard ileal digestible lysine per kg of feed. The test period lasted a maximum of 8 weeks. Raw data contained records from each entry to the feeder during the test period. Feed intake errors in single visits to the feeding station were identified following the algorithm developed by Casey et al. [] and were removed from the dataset. Descriptive statistics for the data are in Table . ADFI was calculated as total feed intake in the entire test period  divided by the number of days on test. ADG was calculated as total body weight gain divided by the number of days on test. LMP was predicted using a transformation of fat layer and muscle depths between the 3rd and 4th last ribs from ultrasound images taken at the end of the test period using a Piglog 105 ultrasonic device (Carometec A/S  Denmark). Pedigree information was available for at least the last four generations  for 6237 animals. Tri-variate analysis was used for ADFI  ADG  and LMP traits using the following models: where    and  are vectors of phenotypic records for ADFI  ADG  and LMP  respectively; vectors     and  contain “fixed” effects of year-quarter  gender  and sow parity for ADFI  ADG and LMP  respectively;  and  are “fixed” regressions for start body weight for ADFI and ADG  respectively;  is the “fixed” regression for end body weight for LMP;     and       and       and  are vectors of animal additive genetic  pen  and residual effects for ADFI  ADG  and LMP  respectively. The permanent environment effect of litter of origin had a small effect based on an initial likelihood ratio test and therefore was not included in the model. Matrices  are design matrices for year-quarter  gender  and parity effects;  is a vector of start body weights for each animal and  is a vector of end body weights. Matrices  and  are the corresponding design matrices for additive genetic animal effects (    and ) and the permanent environmental effect of pen (    and ) for the three traits. Average BW was not included in the model because animals were tested over a fixed weight interval; therefore  all animals had the same average weight. A full Bayesian analysis was conducted and  therefore  priors were specified for all parameters. Prior distributions for all random vectors were multivariate normal distributions with a mean of zero  and   where  is a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 matrix of residual (co)variances    where  is the additive genetic relationship matrix   is a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 matrix of additive genetic (co)variances  and genetic values are ordered by individual; and   where  is a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 matrix of pen (co)variances. The random effects of     and  were considered independent of each other. The prior distributions for the covariance matrices     and  were inverse Wishart distributions and priors for all dispersion and for all “fixed” location parameters were taken as flat priors. The Bayesian estimation method via Gibbs sampling was used to obtain posterior distributions for all parameters that were included in the trivariate models (1)  (2)  and (3)  including the matrices of variances and covariances. The Gibbs sampler was run for 1.1 million rounds  with the first 100 000 rounds considered burn-in  and after the burn-in  every 250th sample was saved for posterior analysis. The RJMC module in the DMU software package by Madsen and Jensen [] was used for analysis. A total of 4000 samples from the joint posterior distribution of all location and (co)variance parameters from the trivariate models (1)–(3) were saved for post-Gibbs analysis. The BOA package of Smith [] in the R program [] was used for convergence diagnostics through statistical and graphical analysis of the posterior distributions of the (co)variance  location  and derived parameters. The results indicated convergence of all parameters investigated. Let  be the vector of all model parameters in sample  from the marginal posterior distribution of . Any feature or function of the distribution can be obtained using the ergodic theorem shown by Geyer [] and Smith and Roberts []: where (.) is an appropriate operator   is any function or feature of the marginal distribution of   and  is the number of samples obtained. For more details on how to use this to estimate response in selection experiments  see Sorensen et al. []. Then  we derived functions to define the posterior distribution of genetic and residual (co)variances to derive breeding values for various RFI and FCR definitions. In addition  functions to infer the amount of genetic variance and covariance available for selection were derived  along with responses to selection or of genetic superiorities of the selected groups for different selection criteria. Functions to define posterior genetic and residual variances for FCR are not available without resorting to Taylor series approximations but the amount of genetic variance in FCR available for selection can be derived from the output of the Gibbs sampler without resorting to approximations. The functions to predict RFI and FCR were used in every sample obtained and Eq. () was used to obtain summary information on the distribution of this function  i.e. the posterior mean and variance of genetic variance. RFI was defined as (1) phenotypic RFI (RFI) using phenotypic partial regression coefficients to ensure that phenotypic covariances are zero; and (2) genetic RFI (RFI)  conditioning breeding values of ADFI by breeding values for ADG and LMP using genetic partial regression coefficients  ensuring that the genetic covariances between RFI and production traits (ADG and LMP) are zero. In other words  the breeding values for ADFI are corrected for ADG and LMP using either genetic or phenotypic regression coefficients. In this section  we present the derivation of variance parameters and breeding values for both RFI forms  which are both linear combinations of the traits included in the analysis. In each individual sample ()  derivation of both the distribution and the breeding values of the RFI traits are straightforward because they are conditional on the (co)variance components  and all elements are from multivariate normal distributions. These derivations are used on all samples obtained from the Gibbs sampler to obtain the posterior distributions of (co)variances and breeding values for the two RFI definitions. Across the posterior samples  the distribution is  however  not necessarily normal. For RFI  the partial regression coefficients () for ADG and LMP were computed from the genetic (co)variance matrix  while for RFI the partial phenotypic regression coefficients () were from the phenotypic (co)variance matrix. Within a posterior sample  both RFI definitions involved conditional normal distributions  resulting in the following straightforward derivations: let  be the phenotypic and  the genetic (co)variance matrices of the traits involved  which are subdivided in: where the diagonals of matrices are the variances and the off-diagonals are the covariances. Bayesian estimation of partial phenotypic () and genetic () regression coefficients was obtained as: which are 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector-valued functions that are obtained in each sample from the Gibbs output. The  and  are 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 matrices of phenotypic and genetic (co)variance for the production traits of ADG and LMP from  and   respectively. Matrices  and  are the phenotypic and genetic covariances  respectively  of the production traits ADG and LMP with ADFI. Predictions of breeding values for RFI can be obtained simultaneously for all animals by the distribution of breeding values for ADFI ()  conditional of breeding values for ADG () and LMP ()  using either phenotypic () or genetic () partial regression coefficients. A sample from the posterior distribution of breeding values for phenotypic () and genetic () RFI is as follows: For a given sample in   distributions of RFI were obtained as the distribution of ADFI conditional on all other model parameters and on ADG and LMP. The corresponding variances and covariances can be obtained using the following equations: where  and  are genetic or phenotypic (co)variances  respectively. where  and  are phenotypic partial regression coefficients from   and  and  are genetic regression coefficients from  for ADG and LMP  respectively. FCR is a ratio between two normally distributed and usually correlated traits and therefore has a distribution that depends on the means of the two traits involved  as well as their (co)variance. As a result  the breeding value for FCR depends on “fixed” location parameters  since it depends on the mean of ADFI () and ADG (). Following Gunsett []  the breeding value for FCR () can be calculated from underlying parameters using the following equation for a given sample : where the estimate of  can be obtained from Model (1) for ADFI as the sum of the average of each “fixed” effect (year-quarter  gender  and parity)  in addition to “fixed” regressions for the start BW according to the population average. Similarly  an estimate of  can be obtained. Location parameters for the mean must be computed once per sample as we investigate functions of the variables in the posterior distribution and are applied to Eq. () to compute breeding values. In this way  the inaccuracy of computing the mean is considered when deriving the posterior distribution of breeding values for FCR. Correspondingly  the phenotypic deviation of FCR can be expressed as: However  this expression cannot be used directly to derive the phenotypic variance of FCR due to influences such as selection and genetic drift. Instead  it can be used to compute the phenotypic variance of the derived traits (FCR    and ) and the recorded traits (ADFI  ADG  and LMP) between animals that have phenotypic records and are available for selection. Genetic trends are defined as a linear function of the vector of breeding values following Sorensen et al. []: where  is the vector of breeding values for trait ;  is a vector of yearly means of breeding values  and  is an incidence matrix relating the breeding values of individuals to yearly batches. Since genetic selection is usually performed within an age group  the amount of genetic (co)variance available for selection at a given time point is: where  is the distribution of genetic (co)variance available for selection after integrating over the genetic trend and  and   were defined in Eq. (). This derivation is an extension of Sorensen et al. [] to a multivariate setting. The Bayesian estimate of the superiority of a selected group is the difference between the mean of the breeding values in the selected group and the mean of the breeding values of all animals corrected for the genetic trend. This yields an expression of the superiority of the selected group in every sample from the posterior distribution  depending on the selection rule. The mean of the selected group for trait  when selecting on trait  can be calculated as: where  is the breeding value for trait  on animal   conditional on the genetic trend;  is the total number of animals; and  is the breeding value for a ranked individual () when ordering breeding values for trait . If   the superiority is due to direct selection for the trait  and if   the superiority is in trait  due to selection on a correlated trait . Six traits were investigated in this study and thus  six scenarios were developed to compare direct and correlated responses to selection for feed efficiency and production traits. The number of individuals ranked for analysis was decided based on truncation selection of the top 5 to 30% of animals. Here  only the results of truncation selection of the top 10% are presented  since the results and conclusions were consistent across various truncation selection percentages. Posterior means and standard deviations (PSD) of heritability and genetic variances for the two  definitions and their component traits are in Table . The posterior mean of heritability was moderately high for the production traits ADFI and ADG and high for LMP. The posterior means of heritability and genetic variance were larger for ADFI than for ADG. For linear feed efficiency traits  the posterior means of heritability were low for  and moderate for  because of a lower posterior mean of genetic variance for  compared to . Posterior means (with PSD) of genetic and phenotypic correlations for the two  definitions and their component traits are in Table . As  was defined using genetic partial regression coefficients  its genetic correlations with the production traits ADG and LMP were zero. The posterior mean of genetic correlation of  was positive and moderate with ADG (0.35) and negative and low with LMP (-<U+2009>0.06). Since partial phenotypic coefficients were used  posterior means of phenotypic correlations of  with ADG and LMP were zero. Posterior means of the genetic correlation were strong and positive between ADFI and ADG (0.82) and moderate and negative between ADFI and LMP (-<U+2009>0.39). The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between ADFI and  was 0.51 but was larger between ADFI and   0.77. The genetic (co)variance available for selection was obtained for all traits based on Eq. (). The obtained posterior mean of genetic (co)variance available for selection and the genetic correlations among traits were identical to the results presented in Tables  and  and are therefore not shown. For FCR  posterior means and PSD of genetic variance available for selection and of genetic correlations with other traits of interest are in Table . Posterior means of the genetic correlations of FCR with the two  definitions were large and positive. The posterior means of the genetic correlation was negative and low between FCR and ADG (-<U+2009>0.07) and negative and moderate between FCR and LMP (-<U+2009>0.40). Posterior means of genetic trends of the traits of interest are presented in Fig. . Posterior means of the genetic trend for  and FCR had a similar pattern but the trend for  was less favorable. Nonetheless   did not follow the trends of  and FCR. Posterior means of the genetic trend of ADG and ADFI had similar patterns. In addition  the genetic trend for LMP was similar to those for ADG and ADFI. In general  genetic trends indicated improved production traits and FCR. In contrast  both  definitions tended to increase  indicating deteriorating partial feed efficiency conditional on production traits. Posterior means of genetic trends for genetic and phenotypic residual feed intake ( and   respectively)  feed conversion ratio (FCR)  average daily feed intake (ADFI)  average daily gain (ADG)  and lean meat percentage (LMP). All lines for each trait were forced through the same origin in 2008 to make trends comparable across lines. All traits were scaled to the standard deviation of their estimated breeding values to make vertical axes comparable across traits The posterior mean of the direct and correlated superiority of the selected groups under various selection scenarios are in Table . Since FCR is a ratio trait in which the numerator should be reduced relative to the denominator  a favorable response to selection is negative. For   a negative selection response is also favorable  since the goal is to reduce the proportion of feed intake that is independent of the energy requirements for growth and maintenance. Direct selection on  resulted in a correlated response of -<U+2009>0.151 kg/d in ADFI  without altering ADG and LMP. However  direct selection for FCR resulted in a correlated response of -<U+2009>0.176 kg/d in ADFI  with a 0.978% increase in LMP. Furthermore  direct selection on  not only reduced ADFI by 0.233 kg/d but also had an unfavorable effect  namely  a 0.035 kg/d reduction in ADG. In this study  a Bayesian method for estimating genetic parameters for  and FCR in farm animals is presented that properly accounts for non-normal distributions of ratio traits. Analyses conducted by Kennedy et al. [] to derive genetic and phenotypic RFI were extended to Bayesian analysis. Here  we present a Bayesian analysis of FCR without resorting to approximations resulting from unknown distributional properties of a ratio trait and its component traits  which causes the genetic parameters of FCR not to be directly estimable. Instead  we developed a posterior multivariate distribution of additive genetic (co)variance available for selection. The example shows that inference based on this measure is very similar to estimates of additive genetic (co)variance in the population and can  therefore  also be used to investigate the posterior distribution of additive genetic variance in the ratio trait of FCR. Finally  we estimate the posterior distribution of the genetic superiority of the selected group when selection is based on various definitions of feed efficiency or production traits. In this study  a Bayesian approach was used to derive a posterior distribution of all parameters of interest  which enables computation of the probabilities that the parameter lies between specified values. The Bayesian method integrates over all unknown model parameters  including “fixed” and random effects  and properly handles ratio traits that do not have standard distributions. Residual feed intake is a partial measure of feed efficiency  for which the average components of feed efficiency related to production and maintenance are excluded  and which is obtained through the conditional distribution of feed intake to production traits and metabolic body weight. Many studies have used linear regression of the phenotype of feed intake onto phenotypes of the production traits  e.g.  Mrode and Kennedy []. Some studies took the above approach one step further by using adjusted production traits values  accounting for the systematic effects that influence these traits with the aim of obtaining a more accurate estimation of  parameters  e.g.  Cai et al. [] and Shirali et al. []. Some studies estimated partial regression coefficients for production traits first and then adjusted the phenotype of feed intake for production traits using the obtained coefficients  e.g.  Saintilan et al. []. This approach is time-consuming and does not consider the systematic effects of production traits. However   is originally defined as a residual effect from regression models that account for BW growth and gain by Koch et al. []. The methods for obtaining genetic or phenotypic  that use genetic or phenotypic (co)variance matrices from a multi-trait model were presented by Kennedy et al. []. Phenotypic derivation of  ensures that the phenotypic correlation between  and its component traits of production traits are zero  but the genetic correlations can still be non-zero  as shown by Kennedy et al. []. The non-zero genetic correlation of  with production traits is due to partial phenotypic regression coefficients  which result in a genetic correlation between  and production traits. This genetic correlation is related to genetic and environmental covariances between feed intake and production traits  as well as the heritability of production traits  as shown by Kennedy et al. []. To obtain a genetic   partial regression coefficients must be obtained from the genetic (co)variance matrix  which ensures that  is genetically independent of production traits. However  this can result in non-zero phenotypic correlations of genetic  with production traits  i.e. (  )<U+2009>=<U+2009>(  ) - ()  which is equal to (  ) - (  )(1 - )/)  as also shown by Kennedy et al. []. Variation in maintenance requirements that are predicted from differences in metabolic body weight have not been significantly related to variation in feed consumption in pigs  as tested by Cai et al. []  Shirali et al. []  and the current study. This could be due to a relatively set body weight test period in pig breeding. Nonetheless  in future studies and in selection practices  the effect of metabolic body weight on the variation of feed intake should be tested since the results can vary depending on the species and breeding programs. Traditionally  FCR is derived by dividing the phenotype of feed intake by BW gain. This definition ignores the fixed and environmental effects that influence the component traits of the ratio trait. The Bayesian analysis presented here considers the uncertainties in the fixed effects and avoids approximations due to unknown distributional properties of a ratio trait and its component traits. The current study shows substantial genetic variance in   which illustrates the possibility of selection for this trait in commercial breeding programs. Genetic  showed a low posterior mean of heritability  lower than for phenotypic   which is as expected  with few exceptions  as explained by Kennedy et al. [] because the genetic variance of phenotypic  is influenced by residual covariance between the component traits of feed intake and production traits. The posterior means of heritability estimates for genetic and phenotypic  were within the range of values (0.10–0.47) reported in the literature [    ]. The percentage of genetic variance in ADFI that was explained by genetic  had a posterior mean of 26%  with a PSD of 6%. Thus  considerable genetic variance in ADFI is not due to production traits (ADG and LMP). Shirali et al. [] reported that the proportion of genetic variance in feed intake explained by genetic  ranged from 17 to 26% for three Danish pig breeds. Cai et al. [] and Shirali et al. [] reported that 34 and 33% of the phenotypic variation in feed intake is due to phenotypic  in Yorkshire and crossbred pigs  respectively. The considerably lower posterior mean of heritability for genetic  compared to ADFI is due to high genetic correlations between ADFI and production traits and to genetic correlations between traits being higher than environmental correlations. Nevertheless  feed intake records provide valuable information on feed efficiency over and above that provided by the production traits ADG and LMP. Posterior means of heritability and genetic variance for ADG and LMP obtained here were larger than those for Danish Duroc pigs that were reported in Shirali et al. []. The larger posterior mean of the heritability for ADFI compared to ADG is in agreement with results of Shirali et al. [] for three diverse Danish pig breeds and of Saintilan et al. [] for French Landrace and Large White sire and dam lines. Posterior means of genetic correlations between ADFI and ADG were larger than the corresponding phenotypic correlations  which is in agreement with Shirali et al. []. The substantial deviation from 1 of the posterior mean of the genetic correlation between genetic and phenotypic  indicates different selection outcomes when selecting on these respective traits. The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between phenotypic  and ADFI was in the upper range of values (0.48–0.72) reported by Saintilan et al. [] and in the range of values (0.70–0.88) reported by Do et al. []. The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between phenotypic  and ADG was larger than the genetic correlations reported by Saintilan et al. [] (-<U+2009>0.05 to 0.16) and Do et al. [] (0.02–0.20). Dekkers and Gilbert [] showed genetic correlations of 0.18 and 0.24 for phenotypic  with growth rate and backfat thickness  respectively in a divergent selection experiment for phenotypic  at Iowa State University  while Gilbert et al. [] reported genetic correlations of -<U+2009>0.07 and 0.14 for phenotypic  with growth rate and carcass lean meat content  respectively  in similar experiments at INRA. Kennedy et al. [] showed that phenotypic  and production traits are genetically independent when the heritabilities of feed intake and production traits are equal and their genetic and environmental correlations are equal. The partial phenotypic coefficient ensures that phenotypic  is phenotypically independent of production traits  explaining the positive moderate and negative low posterior means of genetic correlations of phenotypic  with ADG and LMP  respectively. The Bayesian method provides a method to investigate the variance and covariances of the ratio trait of FCR without resorting to approximations. The posterior mean of the genetic variance for FCR was substantially lower than the estimates of 0.014 to 0.027 reported by Do et al. []. The posterior means of genetic correlations between FCR and different definitions of  deviated significantly from 1. Saintilan et al. [] reported genetic correlations of 0.53 to 0.85 between FCR and phenotypic   and Do et al. [] reported values of 0.87 to 0.88  which are in line with our results. The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between FCR and ADFI was in the middle range of the values reported by Saintilan et al. [] (0.20–0.88) and by Do et al. [] (0.43–0.74). The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between FCR and ADG was in the lower range of values reported by Saintilan et al. [] (-<U+2009>0.09 to -<U+2009>0.51) and was in the range of those by Do et al. [] (-<U+2009>0.38 to 0.26). The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between FCR and LMP was larger than the estimates of -<U+2009>0.15 to 0.03 between FCR and lean meat content in Saintilan et al. [] and of -<U+2009>0.36 to 0.34 between FCR and backfat thickness in Do et al. []. The genetic improvement in FCR can be explained by genetic trends for feed intake and production traits. Using realized genetic trends  on the basis of units of genetic standard deviation  for production and feed efficiency traits in four PIC pig lines from 2001 to 2011  Knap and Wang [] reported that genetic improvement for RFI is slower than for FCR and that the genetic trend of FCR is the result of genetic trends in ADG and ADFI. This was also observed in our study  possibly because the genetic trend of FCR is influenced by production traits  while the genetic trend of  is for the proportion of feed intake that is independent of production traits  which has not been under direct selection. In fact  FCR improved over the period studied  because ADG increased more than ADFI. Efficiency defined in terms of genetic  deteriorated over the examined period. Applying the Bayesian approach to the data yields a marginal posterior distribution of breeding values for the analyzed traits and for any function of them  from which inferences can be made that take the inaccuracy of the knowledge of variances into account. We derived the marginal posterior distribution of additive genetic variance available for the selection of traits of interest from the population under study  considering the genetic trend in each year in a multivariate setting. This is an extension of Sorensen et al. []  who conditioned additive genetic variance for the genetic trend in a Bayesian setting for a univariate model. The current study presents a new approach using Bayesian inference to examine various selection criteria for feed efficiency either as a linear () or ratio (FCR) trait in breeding programs. The method yields a marginal posterior distribution of the average response to selection of selected groups  which can be viewed as a weighted average of an infinite number of conditional distributions. The method also allows PSD of the expected response to selection to be derived easily. Gunsett [] also showed unexpected selection pressure on component traits of ratio traits and that a ratio trait is not a normally distributed variable  as it is a ratio of two normally distributed variables. Therefore  expected genetic gain from truncation selection on FCR is difficult to compute using selection index principles for normally distributed variables. Gunsett [] observed that direct selection for ratio traits places a large proportion of the selection pressure on reducing the numerator  while using a linear index of component traits of ratio traits would allocate more weight to increasing the denominator. Based on a simulation study  Zetouni et al. [] reported that direct selection against the methane-to-milk production ratio trait increased the denominator and the numerator  while multi-trait selection could result in higher genetic gain and a simultaneous reduction in methane emission. The Bayesian approach allows identification  with high accuracy  of the possible outcomes of any combination of single or multi-trait selection on feed efficiency and/or traits in the breeding program. Bayesian analysis is useful to study the design of selection experiments  since it allows a variety of designs  and allows comparison of their efficiency in retrieving accurate marginal posterior distributions of parameters of interest []. An advantage of the proposed Bayesian approach is that the posterior distribution of direct and correlated responses to selection can be obtained and used to make probability statements on expected response to selection as well as other parameters of interest. It should also be noted that the principles outlined in this study have much broader applications beyond FCR  as they apply to any trait that is defined as a non-linear function of other traits. Bayesian analysis suggests that direct selection against genetic  does not have a correlated response on production traits in the breeding program  since the model ensured zero genetic correlations between these traits. The presence of a correlated response on production traits from direct selection against phenotypic  is due to the genetic correlation between these traits  which is due to the use of phenotypic partial regression coefficients that ensure that the phenotypic correlations between phenotypic  and production traits are zero. Kennedy et al. [] observed that response to selection on genetic  increases if the genetic correlation between feed intake and production is low or the heritability of feed intake is high or higher than the heritability of the production trait. Young and Dekkers [] and Gilbert et al. [] showed that selection for phenotypic  resulted in correlated responses in other traits  with a reduction in FCR  backfat thickness  and feed intake in experimental selection lines of purebred Yorkshire and Large White pigs. Young and Dekkers [] showed that eight generations of selection against phenotypic  in Yorkshire pigs decreased  by 241 g/d  feed intake by 376 g/d  growth rate by 79 g/d  FCR by 2.2 g/g  and back fat thickness by 2.5 mm compared to a line selected as control line for five generations and thereafter for high RFI. Similar results were obtained in an experiment at INRA with the low  line having lower   feed intake  growth rate  and backfat thickness than the high RFI line reported by Gilbert et al. []. Kennedy et al. [] observed that response to selection on genetic  is less than or equal to the response to phenotypic  because selection for phenotypic  results in a reduction of the proportion of feed intake used for production traits. Genetic  is a product of genetic parameters of the traits that are involved in the calculations of . Therefore  accurate estimation of genetic parameters of the traits involved in the calculation of  is necessary to maximize response to selection. Our proposed Bayesian approach maximizes gain by averaging over the posterior distribution of variance components for the traits involved. Selection against the ratio trait of FCR results in unexpected selection pressure on feed intake and production traits (e.g.  LMP) in the breeding program. This disproportionate selection pressure on component traits can be explained by genetic correlations between ADFI  ADG  and LMP and their heritabilities. A large reduction in ADFI  which is the numerator of FCR  may be due to the heritability of ADFI being higher than that of ADG  in addition to a large positive posterior mean of the genetic correlation between these traits. The low posterior mean of the genetic correlation between FCR and ADG indicates a smaller change in ADG due to selection for FCR  while a large negative posterior mean of the genetic correlation between FCR and LMP explains the indirect genetic response from selection against FCR. The substantial reduction in ADFI through direct selection on FCR could also be due to a correlated response on LMP  since increased lean meat growth is one of the underlying biological reasons for improved FCR. Therefore  selection for FCR is not an efficient strategy because  first the improvement in this trait can be due to improvement in lean meat growth rather than improvement in efficiency of nutrient utilization per se; and second the relative improvements can change over generations as the means of the underlying trait change. Shirali et al. [] reported low negative genetic correlations between feed intake and BW gain in Danish Duroc pigs  while for Danish Landrace and Yorkshire pigs  they were high negative in the range reported here. In addition  genetic correlations of ADG in the 30 to 100 kg BW test period with LMP at the end of the test on Danish pigs were lower [] than the posterior mean of the correlation between ADG and LMP in our study. Differences in genetic parameters of feed efficiency traits between breeds or breeding programs can result in differences in the outcome of the selection for a ratio trait such as FCR. Gunsett [] reported that selection intensity for a ratio trait influences the relative distribution of response in the component traits when selection intensity increases resulting in more selection pressure on reduction of the numerator of the ratio trait. In our study  a change in selection intensity did not alter the relative responses for linear and ratio feed efficiency traits and for production traits  providing a robust conclusion for the effects of selection on different traits. In a selection index context  single-trait selection against genetic  is equivalent to selection on an index for feed intake that maintains production constant and considers no other traits in the breeding program. Luiting et al. [] showed that joint selection on  and production traits is equivalent to joint selection on a selection index of feed intake and production traits. Furthermore  Kennedy et al. [] showed that selection on an index that includes either genetic or phenotypic   or ADFI  would result in the same responses to selection  provided that the corresponding economic weights are changed in the breeding goal. However  this is only possible by estimating proper economic values when using phenotypic  or ADFI. If the economic value of ADFI  ADG  and LMP are known  phenotypic and genetic (co)variances are needed to derive the corresponding economic weight for RFI. Genetic RFI can be used in a breeding program because it is easy to communicate to farmers/breeders since it expresses net feed efficiency rather than efficiency achieved by improvement on production traits. Furthermore  genetic  can be suitable in selection experiments to provide insight into the biological basis of feed efficiency and variation in feed intake independent of production and maintenance requirements. A Bayesian procedure for analysis of response to selection on linear versus ratio traits was developed and applied to feed efficiency in pigs. The Bayesian methodology allowed prediction of breeding values for ratio and linear definitions of feed efficiency from a multi-variate model for the traits measured. The Bayesian method allowed prediction of breeding values for FCR without the need for approximations. Posterior means of genetic parameters indicated that the traits were influenced by genetics and that genetic improvement through selection was possible. Direct selection against FCR or  resulted in disproportional selection on production traits. Direct selection against FCR results in unexpected selection pressure on its component traits and on LMP. However  direct selection against genetic  allows for selection on the proportion of ADFI that is independent of production. In addition  since there is no genetic correlation between genetic  and other production traits in the breeding program  an EBV for  that is independent of production traits is easier to communicate to farmers/advisors than a breeding value for ADFI that is strongly influenced by production traits such as ADG and LMP.

This study showed that the Bayesian multiple-regression analysis is robust to population structure and to relationships among study subjects and performs better than a single marker mixed linear model approach. Like any other type of statistical association analysis  the purpose of a genetic association test is to establish an association between  or examine independence of  two variables: a trait of interest and a genetic marker [  ]. If the marker being tested is known to be a neutral locus without any known effects on DNA coding  then the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the marker and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting the trait could be a valid reason for the observed association []. The ideal condition in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is that the covariance  and hence the LD  between a genetic marker and the trait of interest is high if  and only if  the marker itself is a causative mutation or is closely linked to a QTL []. This requires a panmictic population. Unfortunately  except in population genetics theory  this type of population probably does not exist [  ]. Widespread prevalence of non-random mating (e.g.  assortative mating) in livestock and crop populations has resulted in complex patterns of population stratification (PS) and genetic relationships between members of the population [    ]. Without properly accounting for these factors  GWAS could lead to spurious false-positives (FP) (markers declared as significant but not closely linked to a QTL) and false-negatives (FN) (markers closely linked to a QTL but not declared as significant) in such populations due to extensive LD between syntenic and non-syntenic loci [                 ]. Compared to simple monogenic traits  complex polygenic phenotypes are more vulnerable to elevated FP rates in GWAS  where the magnitude of signals from multiple QTL may be comparable to those resulting from PS []. Many approaches have been developed to account for PS and relatedness in a population-based GWAS  including genomic control (GC)  structured association (SA)  principal component analysis (PCA)  mixed linear models (MLM) and multiple regression analysis. Without a doubt  the GC method [] is simple and fast and is even applicable to pooled DNA samples []. However  it has lower power than other methods  especially in samples with a complex pattern of relationship and extensive PS [           ]. The SA approach [       ]  uses a set of null markers to infer PS information for each individual in the sample before conducting an association test []. Most popular SA methods assume that the ancestry of each individual is drawn from one or more discrete sub-populations (the so-called “islands” model) [  ]  an assumption that is not supported by real data [see  for an example]. SA methods have been shown to be suboptimal in protecting against FP in commercial crop or model organism populations [                  ]. The PCA method [  ] is fast  avoids assumptions on which the SA methods rely on and  unlike SA  is robust to the number of modeled principal components (PC) []. The idea of PC-adjustment for protecting against PS is valid under an island model but this might not be true for samples with complex PS. As a result  the method is only successful when applied to samples with mild PS [  ]. PCA may produce artefactual PC in the presence of outliers []  of long-range LD on the genome [        ] or of family structure or cryptic relatedness in the sample [  ]. The success of PC adjustment to control FP is conditional on whether sufficient numbers of PC are included in the model []. While inclusion of not enough PC may reduce the chance of controlling FP  inclusion of too many PC could undermine the power of the association study [  ]. On the one hand  pruning of markers has been suggested [] and applied as an ad-hoc procedure for reducing the correlation between adjacent markers e.g.  [] before applying PCA. However  this could lead to loss of some subpopulation differences []. On the other hand  if some of the markers that are truly associated with the trait of interest fall in the pruned regions  then adjusting for PC is counterproductive []. Overall  there still is uncertainty on the proper method of PC adjustment and the optimal criteria for selecting PC to be retained [  ]. One might identify the above approaches as two-step methods for correcting for PS. They can eliminate the true association signals whenever the strength of association due to PS is comparable to that of a QTL. Simultaneous inference of PS and testing for association has the advantage of being able to separate the true and false signals from each other [  ]. Yu et al. [] used a set of unidentified markers to detect population structure (Q) and familial relationship (K) in a maize sample dataset. They fit both Q and K into a mixed linear model to account for multiple levels of relationship in the dataset. This method was shown to perform better than other methods in controlling FP and FN rates [                  ]. However  the MLM approach is computationally expensive if applied to a large dataset [] and its success in finding associations may depend on the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the markers. In fact  with MLM strong phenotypic associations are easier to detect when the MAF is low []. In short MLM  and the other above-mentioned approaches  might not be suitable when applied to complex traits controlled by several large-effect loci []. In principle  PS simply can be adjusted for by including a set of ancestry-informative or null markers as covariates in the model. These markers or a function of them can effectively serve as proxies for the underlying PS [        ]. Valdar et al. [] suggested modeling PS explicitly in a multi-marker association analysis (MMA) framework. By comparing single-marker association (SMA) analysis with the MMA model  they showed that family structure should be considered in the SMA model to obtain reasonable power  whereas the MMA model could safely ignore this effect without compromising its power. However  when the sample was highly structured  the MMA model suffered from high FP []. Pikkuhookana and Sillanpaa [] compared the impact of including versus ignoring pedigree relationships in a Bayesian multiple regression (BMR) model using simulated and real data. They found that Bayesian MMA analysis without correction for relationship was capable of self-correcting for residual dependencies and did not produce spurious associations. In a comprehensive simulation study  Setakis et al. [] used logistic regression in a SMA study of a binary trait and were also able to account for PS without explicitly modeling it. In recent years  genomic selection (GS) [] has shown promising results for predicting breeding values (BV) of selection candidates []. In this approach  the effects of markers across the genome are estimated first in a reference population (training dataset) and then are used to predict the BV of individuals in an independent dataset (validation dataset). Simulation studies of GS in multi-breed admixed populations [  ] have shown that the estimated effects of markers in such samples might accurately predict the BV of purebred animals in a validation dataset  provided that marker density is sufficient to capture the shared ancestral LD across breeds. Thomasen et al. [] studied population structure in a Danish Jersey population composed of subgroups of animals that originated from Danish or United State Jersey populations and showed that a model that explicitly accounts for breed origin  does not improve genomic predictions compared to a model that ignores breed origin. These results suggest that the performance of QTL mapping in an admixed population  using a BMR approach with high-density markers  may not be hampered by the spurious FP when BC and relatedness have not been explicitly accounted for. Therefore  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of genome-wide QTL mapping in a highly structured admixed population typical of animal and plant breeding datasets using the BMR and to compare that with the performance of a MLM approach  which has been the method of choice for many recent GWAS. A base population of unrelated individuals was stochastically simulated and used as described below to create four pure breeds  and admixed and crossbred populations based on these breeds. To generate LD  the base population was randomly mated for 1000 generations  with an effective size (N) of 1000. To simulate the four purebred populations (referred to as breeds A  B  C and D  hereafter)  at generation 1001 four independent random samples of 100 animals were drawn from the base population and each was randomly mated for another 50 generations  with an N of 100. A previous study [] showed that this setting is successful for creating genetically diversified breeds. In generation 1051  pure breed population sizes were increased to N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000. Each population was composed of 50 half-sib families with an average size of 20 offspring per family  created by random mating of sires and dams from the previous generation. No attempt was made to keep family sizes equal. These breeds were then crossed to create (AB)  (AB)A  (AB)C and (AB)(CD) populations. This resulted in eight different populations (including the four pure breeds) of size 1000. Finally  a random sample of 1000 individuals was drawn from the pool of all populations and used as the admixed population. The pure breed A and admixed datasets at generation 1053 (referred to as the training generation hereafter) were used as the resource populations for QTL mapping. PCA based on whole-genome marker genotypes was used to verify the population structure in the simulated admixed dataset. A genome of size 600 cM composed of six chromosomes that each had 5000 equally spaced markers was simulated. Markers were bi-allelic  with starting allele frequencies of 0.5 and a reversible random mutation rate of 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. A binomial map function was used to simulate recombination and interference was allowed for by setting the maximum number of uniformly and independently distributed crossovers on the chromosome to 4 []. At generation 1053  1000 markers were selected from the remaining segregating markers for each chromosome. In the training generation  15 segregating markers (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.02) that were closest to certain positions on chromosomes 1 to 3 (Table ) were chosen to represent the QTL with an assigned effect. Chromosomes 4 to 6 (referred herein to as null chromosomes) did not contribute to the simulated phenotype. Markers that were assigned to be QTL were removed from the marker panel before association analysis. To keep the genetic variance constant across the simulated datasets  the allele substitution effects of the QTL were standardized such that each QTL explained a predefined percentage of the total genetic variance in the admixed population (Table ). Only additive effects were simulated. With equal probability  allele substitution effects were assigned to be negative or positive. Then  the scaled QTL effects were summed over all QTL for each individual to compute an individual’s true BV. Finally  a standard normal deviate was added to each true BV to provide the phenotype of an individual for a quantitative trait with heritability 0.30. The simulation was conducted for 32 different QTL minor allele frequencies. For each of these scenarios (which we refer to hereafter as a dataset)  we replicated the simulation 20 times  allowing some variation in the QTL position and the surrounding marker genotypes. The following models were used to analyze the simulated datasets. Simple regression analysis was used to examine association of each marker’s genotype with each individual’s phenotypic value. Markers were fitted one-at-a-time using the following linear model: where  is the vector of phenotypic values of size n   is a vector of ones of length n   is the population mean   is a vector of the genotypic values at a marker locus (0  1 or 2; number of copies of an arbitrary allele at the marker being tested)   is the fixed allele substitution effect and  is the vector of random residual errors. The model improperly assumes that . We applied this model only for the sake of comparison. The analysis was done using the PLINK software package with its  option []. The second model explicitly considered BC in the admixed population: where  is the n<U+2009>×<U+2009>q incidence matrix relating observations to BC and  is a fixed vector of BC. The true BC of each individual was assumed known without error. Furthermore  it is assumed that . All other parameters and assumptions were the same as in Model ().  [] was used for analysis. The Wald test  as implemented in the software  was used for significance tests of the marker-trait association and BC effects. Both the SMA and SMA models are inadequate in that they do not account for genetic relationships in the population. As a result  the assumptions under which the null hypothesis is being tested might not be valid. Conventional mixed model analysis  fitting one marker at a time  was applied using the following model: where  is the incidence matrix relating observations to the corresponding random effect and  is the vector of random additive genetic effects or BV. It was assumed that  and   where  and . Here  is the matrix of additive genetic relationships  where  is twice the coefficient of coancestry between individuals  and   and  is the additive genetic variance. Other parameters were as introduced before.  was used for analysis and testing of marker effect was based on the Wald test implemented in the software. This model was similar to Model () except that BC was also included as a fixed effect factor. Stochastic search variable selection is a hierarchical Bayesian model that stochastically searches for ‘promising’ subsets of predictors []. Properties of such models have been discussed in detail elsewhere [  ]. We used the BayesCp method of Habier et al. []. where  is a column vector of marker genotypes at locus  and  is a latent 0/1 variable showing absence or presence of marker  in the model. Here  is the random substitution effect of marker  and is assumed a priori independently distributed as: where  are assumed a priori independently and identically distributed () scaled inverted Chi square variables with scale and shape parameters of  and   respectively. Note that  determines the sparsity of the model. Residuals were assumed  and . Furthermore  it was assumed a priori that  follows a scaled inverted Chi square distribution with parameters  and   respectively. A deterministic approach was used to find the hyper parameters of the prior distribution of   as described in Habier et al. []. A Gibbs sampler was used to generate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain of 100 000 samples with a burn-in period of length 10 000. Convergence of the chain was examined using the R software package CODA [] and visual inspection of the chain plots. The posterior inclusion probability (PIP) e.g. [] of a marker    was calculated as the average of all post burn-in values of . This model was similar to model [] except that BC was also included as a fixed effect. To estimate the thresholds required for hypothesis testing  each of the null chromosomes was divided into non-overlapping bins of 40 markers (±<U+2009>2 cM). The average LD  measured as R  between consecutive loci 1 and 2 cM apart was about 5.5 and 3.5%  respectively. Generally speaking  the ±<U+2009>2 cM interval is the preferred precision of interest for QTL detection or efficient implementation of QTL information in marker-assisted selection (e.g.  []) and hence it was used here. For each bin  the minimum P-values for the non-Bayesian approaches (or the maximum PIP value for the Bayesian approaches) were recorded for each replicate. For each dataset that comprised 20 replicates  the sets of these values for all bins on the null chromosomes were combined and used to determine the 5% (or the 95% for the Bayesian approaches)  of their distribution using the  function in R []. We refer to this approach based on the empirical distribution of P- or PIP-values on the null chromosomes []  as the null-chromosome (NCHR) method of finding thresholds. The method might be considered comparable to a permutation test where the phenotypes are reshuffled to disrupt the marker-trait associations  as explained in Xu []. This method was used here to make the comparison between the non-Bayesian and the Bayesian approaches feasible  as suggested in Sahanaet al. []. For the non-Bayesian approaches  the SLIDE method of Han et al. [] was used as an alternative for finding thresholds. SLIDE first estimates the effective number of tests () using a sliding window Monte-Carlo approach. Then  a Bonferroni threshold can be calculated by dividing the nominal P-values by the . The sliding window MCMC approach approximates the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the test statistic and accounts for all correlations among markers within a sliding window. We ran SLIDE with a window size of 40 markers and applied 100 k cycles of an MCMC chain. The program estimated the  and then this number was used as the actual number of markers (rather than the 5985 markers that were actually on the panel) for calculating the Bonferroni adjusted P-values. Quantile–Quantile plots were used to characterize the extent to which the distribution of P-values on the null chromosomes deviated from their expected distributions for the different association analysis methods. For each replicate of a dataset  a QTL was declared detected if any of the markers within an interval of ±<U+2009>2 cM of the QTL (40 markers in total) had a P-value smaller than the 5% threshold P-value (for the non-Bayesian analysis)  or a PIP value larger than the 95% threshold PIP value (for the Bayesian analysis). Power was defined as the proportion of times that a QTL was detected out of 20 replicates in that dataset. Excluding the ±<U+2009>2 cM intervals harboring the QTL  the remaining parts of chromosomes 1  2 and 3 were divided into 4-cM long segments  as intervals where the null hypothesis was correct. If a marker was declared significant in any of these intervals  it was regarded as a false-positive. FPR was the proportion of false-positives across the genome and then averaged over all replicates of a single dataset. Comparing power of methods that have different FPR could be misleading because positive results might be due to PS as well. Therefore  two other measurements  accuracy and PPV were also used to evaluate the performance of the different models []. Positive and negative results falling in the H regions (intervals where H is false) were counted as true-positives (TP) and false-negatives (FN)  respectively. Similarly  positive and negative results in H regions were counted as false-positives (FP) and true-negatives (TN). Then  accuracy and PPV were computed as: All performance measures  i.e.  accuracy  power  FPR and PPV  were calculated on a per dataset basis and then averaged across all datasets. All QTL sizes showed a similar trend in the above performance measures  hence instead of calculating the performance measures for each QTL size  we report averages across all QTL in a dataset. PCA of the marker data for the purebred and admixed populations revealed distinct clusters of related animals within the admixed population  in contrast to the purebred population (Fig. ). In addition  the effect of BC was highly significant in all non-Bayesian analyses where this term was included in the model. This makes proper modeling of population structure compulsory in order to conserve the type I error rate.

Numbers in brackets show the percentage of variances explained by corresponding PC. Different colors represent various breed compositions Examination of the Q–Q plots of P-values of the markers on null chromosomes showed spurious FP in the association analyses of both the purebred and the admixed populations when relationships and/or BC were not modeled properly (Fig. ).

As expected  the SMA model had the lowest accuracy and PPV and the highest FPR among the four tested models. On the one hand  with the NCHR method of finding thresholds (Table )  modeling BC increased power of QTL detection and PPV by 60 and 20 to 30%  respectively  but at the cost of a nearly 20% inflation of FPR. With NCHR  the accuracy of QTL detection was the same for all methods used for analysis. On the other hand  modeling BC dramatically improved accuracy  FPR and PPV when the SLIDE method was used for finding thresholds (Table ); the accuracies of models accounting for BC were 30 to 60% higher than those that did not  improved PPV by 300% but resulted in loss of power by more than 50%. Table   shows the results of the Bayesian association analysis in the ADMX population. With a density of 10 markers per cM  adding BC as a fixed effect into the model reduced both power and FPR by 11 and 13%  respectively. However  accuracy and PPV of QTL detection remained nearly unchanged. In this simulation study  we compared three methods of GWAS in an admixed population: single marker simple regression  single marker mixed model and Bayesian multiple regression models  with- and without- fitting breed composition. The PCA showed that there was a distinct PS in the ADMX dataset. In a study by Toosi  Fernando and Dekkers []  who simulated different breeds using the same scenario as described here  the genetic distance between breeds was nearly 24% based on Wright’s  statistic. PS will be a source of spurious associations if both allele frequencies and mean phenotypic values differ between the sub-populations []. The effect of BC was highly significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) in both SMA and MLM analyses (data not shown). The PB dataset showed spurious FP when the pedigree relationships in the population were ignored  as expected (Fig. ). Unequal relatedness within a sample can result in increased FP rates in two ways: first  regions where QTL reside may be co-inherited with regions completely devoid of QTL [] and second  genotype correlations within larger families can have a larger impact on the association results compared to the smaller families []. Kennedy et al. [] showed that for both randomly mated and selected populations with complex pedigrees  the MLM approach provides unbiased estimates and exact tests of associations  whereas the ordinary least squares method does not. If dependencies among study subjects are not accounted for  many statistical tests of association are not strictly valid []. In the PB dataset  the MLM approach did control FPR at the nominal level on the null chromosomes  but it failed in the ADMX dataset without fitting BC. In this situation  any marker that has different allele frequencies between breeds shows association with the phenotype under study. The extent of FPR is a function of the extent to which the population is structured and not accounted for []. Therefore  for the highly divergent breeds simulated in our study  modeling BC was necessary for controlling FPR. In a GWAS of a massively structured population consisting of 1800 bulls of the German Fleckvieh breed  Pausch et al. [] applied the same SMA model as we did here and observed extensive significant association signals  possibly due to the variation of the relatedness between and within the families in the sample. Likewise  Wang et al. [] conducted a GWAS of several morphological and agronomic traits in a highly structured population of barley cultivars and compared different PS correction methods. When they used a similar naïve SMA model  an excessive number of significant associations were found. In their study  MLM that incorporated kinship (K) [] was superior to GC  SA and stepwise regression [] in controlling FP rate and yielded higher power []. The changes in the performance of SMA models with and without fitting BC were most evident with the SLIDE method of finding thresholds (Table ). On the one hand while modeling of BC improved the power of QTL detection with the NCHR method  this was not the case when SLIDE method was applied. On the other hand  for the SMA model  the FPR dropped dramatically when BC was fitted. This agrees with the result of Iwata et al. [] who made a similar comparison. However  care must be taken when comparing the power of two methods that have different FPR  since positive results could be due to both true QTL signals and PS []. This is evidenced by the high FPR of models that did not fit BC (compared to those fitting it)  when the SLIDE method was used for hypothesis testing. Furthermore  modeling BC sharply improved both the accuracy and the PPV of QTL detection. The SMA models performed similar to the MLM  although the SMA did not fully account for the kinship in the sample. It is possible that correcting for the PS has indirectly corrected some of the pedigree relationships between individuals in the sample and as a result  there were fewer spurious associations []. While there were no differences between accuracies of the SMA and MLM or the SMA and the SMA when the NCHR method was used (Table )  there were noticeable differences in these accuracies when the SLIDE method was applied. As an example for the SMA and SMA methods  consider their accuracy (0.58 and 0.92  respectively)  power (0.72 and 0.30) and FPR (0.44 and 0.007). It is evident from these results that many of the significant results of the SMA are false positives. Also  the difference between the accuracies of the SMA and SMA implies that modeling BC has dramatically increased the number of TN. However  preventing the confounding effect of PS by explicitly modeling it  comes at a cost of more FN [      ]. Adjusting for PS may cancel out the effect of QTL that contribute to phenotypic differences between breeds []. Anderson et al. [] conducted a GWAS on 32 lines of European inbred maize with different line origins. Comparing a model that adjusted for line origin versus one that did not  they showed that several true QTL remained undetected when line origin was accounted for  because these polymorphisms were confounded with line origin. This confounding is especially important for traits that have experienced adaptive selection and thus their variation may coincide with PS [  ]. In our study  fitting BC resulted in a considerable drop of power of QTL detection when the SLIDE method was used  but this was compensated for by a significant drop in FPR. Further inspection showed that in most instances  the smallest QTL were missed. This agrees with the findings of Iwata et al. []  who showed that smaller QTL have larger FN rates. To control family-wise type I error rate  SMA requires methods like Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Such adjustments are usually too conservative  especially in a large scale SMA with extensive LD between linked markers  and thus they may cause true associations to be missed [    ]. That is why for most complex polygenic traits  SMA only detects a very small proportion of genetic variants [  ]. Comparison of the performance of the BMR models with and without fitting BC (Table ) indicates that in the MMA framework  explicit modeling of PS might be unnecessary. The BMR model performed much better than the MLM and MLM. While modeling of BC in the MLM approach improved power of association (Table )  it resulted in loss of power when the BMR was used. As expected  the FPR of the MMA methods were lower than the FPR of the SMA methods (Table ). One major concern with SMA is that it ignores the information that is contained in the joint distribution of all markers [    ]. A marker’s marginal effect might be different from its effect when it is considered jointly with some other markers. The BMR approach had the capability of model selection and hence it could decide whether to add or skip adding a marker to the set of pre-existing markers in the model. This function yields lower FPR over a SMA model. On the MMA framework  once the marker with the strongest marginal correlation with the phenotype is in the model  other markers that are in LD with this marker but that do not provide additional information about the phenotype are automatically discarded [    ]. In addition  MMA analysis improves performance over SMA tests  first because a weak signal may be more apparent when other QTL are already accounted for  and second because a false signal may be weakened by inclusion of a stronger signal from a real QTL in the model []. Atwell et al. []  in a GWAS of more than 100 phenotypes in inbred lines of   showed that GWA yields unambiguous results for monogenic characters regardless of whether they corrected for PS or not. The authors concluded that the reason for this result was not that there were no confounding effects but because the true signals were showing the strongest associations. Therefore  they suggested that the problem of confounding due to PS in GWAS of complex traits might be better explained as a model misspecification  i.e.  modeling a polygenic trait using a SMA that ignores the multi-factorial background of the trait. Not only SMA models result in spurious FP across the genome but they may also find the strongest associations on chromosomes that are completely devoid of QTL []. Therefore  Platt et al. [] suggested that the real goal of GWAS in controlling PS effects should be to account for the confounding effects of multiple QTL  rather than modeling of PS per se. Our results agree with Setakis et al. []  Iwata et al. []  Iwata et al. []  Pikkuhookana and Sillanpaa []  Karkkainen and Sillanpaa [] and Valdar et al. []  who demonstrated that unlike SMA models  MMA models are able to self-correct for family structure. Iwata et al. [] proposed a Bayesian MMA for an empirical GWA in a rice germplasm collection. Their analysis of simulated data based on real marker genotypes revealed that their MMA could more successfully conserve both FP and FN compared to SMA models. In a GWAS of a highly structured population of barley cultivars  Wang et al. [] compared the performance of the <U+2009>+<U+2009> model with the -only model  and with the GC  SA and PCA models. The -only model outperformed all the other rivals. With high-density marker data  the  matrix contains all information on PS and hence the explicit modeling of PS might not be necessary [  ]. Apparently when marker density is sufficient  each marker might capture a part of the effects of kinship and PS  and as a result their overall effects are faded. This agrees with Sillanpää []  who argued that in MMA models variable selection is done simultaneously with the estimation of effects and thus  the large number of markers considered jointly might account for many types of variations. Gu et al. []  applied a modified forward multiple regression (MFMR) approach based on maximum order statistics in an empirical GWAS. Their simulation was based on a 115 k Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel and a dataset that was mainly composed of Caucasian  Black  and Hispanic races. They picked up three independent SNPs that were significantly correlated with race as QTL surrogates. When comparing the results of the SMA and MFMR analyses  they showed that the FPR of the MFMR approach was not affected by PS. This implies that once the QTL that is correlated with PS is included in the multiple regression model  the effect of PS has been accounted for []. Likewise  Pikkuhookana and Sillanpaa []  who used a BMR model for a clinical QTL study in a sample with family structure  showed that regardless of having a correction term for PS in the model  the MMA fits a few extra markers with small effects. As a result  the MMA model was able to conserve both FP and FN rates. Another interesting finding in Gu et al. [] that agrees with our result  was that fitting PS in the MFMR model reduced power without changing the FPR. Whenever attempting to control FPR in a GWAS  some FN are inevitable [    ]. If the distribution of a QTL is highly correlated with PS  the effect of the allele may be absorbed in the PS effects and the QTL will be obscured [          ]. Using a multi-population sample the detection of QTL that cause between-population differences is possible. A combined analysis of data from several populations takes advantage of the between-population genetic variability and hence is more powerful than single-population association study [      ]. A pooled sample of several breeds  for example  has potentially more informative recombination events and shorter haplotype lengths due to narrower LD distances across breeds [    ]. As we showed in this study  and in agreement with studies of Gu et al. []  Wurschum et al. [] and Zhao et al. []  explicit accounting for PS results in some FN. In fact  any method that effectively eliminates confounding due to PS will also effectively remove QTL that are highly correlated with PS []. This might be more of a problem with QTL with more subtle effects that are typical of complex traits and with the small sample sizes usually available for GWAS in animal breeding. While we showed here that the BMR method is capable of reducing FN due to implicit modeling of PS  the BMR also has the advantage of a lower FN compared to SMA that apply highly conservative multiple-test correction methods such as Bonferroni to their association results. Teo et al. [] showed the presence of opposing LD between populations  i.e.  differences in the LD phase between a marker and a QTL across populations  can have a negative impact on the power of case-control or family-trio association studies. Fitting all markers simultaneously might overcome this problem. It is unlikely that all markers that are in LD with a specific QTL have a different LD phase with the QTL across populations  especially if they are close enough to the QTL. In a multi-population sample  markers in strong LD with QTL tend to be less distant to the QTL compared to that in a single-population sample []. In contrast  the SMA models that use GC  SA or PCA to control for the confounding effects of PS  might not be able to correct for the LD differences that reduce power in a multi-population association study []. Several studies have shown that leveraging the LD differences across populations—by conducting GWAS in a multi-population sample—may amplify the signal of QTL  because markers that are strongly linked to a QTL in one population may not be even segregating in another population [    ]. As genomic selection approaches are gaining popularity  some recent GWAS in animal breeding dealing with multi-breed datasets have used methods similar to the BMR method we used here [  ]. In these studies  BC was added as a fixed effect in the model. If BC is confounded with some contemporary group effects (e.g.  slaughter date or geographical region) that are not already accounted for  adding it as a fixed effect in the BMR model might be necessary. This will suppress association signals that are due to the correlation of the phenotype with the contemporary group effect and thus reduces FP. However  if BC is not confounded with any other effect and a MMA model such as that used here is applied  then the cost of implicit accounting for PS might be an increase of FN. In conclusion  our results show the superiority of MMA models over SMA models. More specifically  our study confirms that MMA models are capable of automatically accounting for the confounding effects of kinship and population structure in GWAS  without compromising the power of QTL detection.

Incorporating information on the  genotypes based on the gene content method gave similar results as ssGBLUP. The three weighted ssGBLUP methods were efficient for detecting SNPs associated with protein content and for a better prediction of genomic breeding values than ssGBLUP. They also combined fast computing  simplicity and required ssGBLUP to be run only twice. The availability of molecular data has enabled the development and commercial application of genomic selection in various livestock species  such as dairy cattle [  ]  dairy sheep [  ]  meat sheep [  ] and dairy goats [  ]. Meuwissen et al. [] proposed genomic prediction of animals based on dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps  by deriving the effects of SNPs from a reference population  for which animals are both phenotyped and genotyped. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of selection candidates (i.e.  usually young individuals with genotypes but without phenotypes) can be estimated by summing up the effects of the SNP alleles carried by each animal. Methods such as genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) [    ]  are used to predict GEBV by replacing the pedigree relationship matrix used for pedigree-based BLUP with a realized genomic relationship matrix. The GBLUP method was further improved with single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) []  which uses simultaneously all phenotypic  pedigree and genotypic information  including phenotypic information on non-genotyped individuals. Therefore  in ssGBLUP  the relationship between each pair of animals (genotyped and non-genotyped) is estimated with a relationship matrix that combines pedigree and genotype information. Several studies have reported that the accuracy of genomic prediction obtained with these methods is higher than with genetic evaluation using pedigree-based BLUP [  ]. However  the accuracy obtained from genomic information depends on several parameters including reference population size [  ]  extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD)  heritability of the trait [  ]  relationship between training and validation populations [] and the genetic architecture of the trait  which relates to the relative size of allele substitution effects at quantitative trait loci (QTL) [  ]. The GBLUP and ssGBLUP methods usually assume that each SNP follows the same distribution [        ]  thus  all SNPs have the same variance and the same weight for SNP variance. However  different genomic evaluation methods have been developed to allow the variance of the effect of SNPs to differ between SNPs. A priori information can be used to modify the distribution of SNP effects. Giving more variance to some SNPs allows these methods to take the presence of major genes or QTL that affect the trait of interest into account. For instance  various Bayesian methods  which estimate the effect of SNPs from animals that are both genotyped and phenotyped  have been proposed [    ]. The main difference between these Bayesian methods lies in the definition of an a priori distribution of the effects of SNPs. SNPs can be attributed to different distribution classes  which explain different parts of the total genetic variance  with one class possibly containing the SNPs that have no effect on the trait. Because animals need to be phenotyped and genotyped to apply Bayesian methods  phenotypes from non-genotyped animals cannot be included. In dairy breeding programs  genotypes are mainly determined on the males whereas phenotypes come from the females. Thus  daughter yield deviations (DYD) or de-regressed proofs are calculated to obtain pseudo-phenotypes for the males. However  multi-step methods may create bias in genomic predictions []. Other methods based on the ssGBLUP framework such as weighted ssGBLUP (WssGBLUP) or on the trait-specific marker-derived relationship matrix (TABLUP) have been proposed []. WssGBLUP is an extension of ssGBLUP in which weights for SNP variances are used when forming the genomic relationship matrix []. WssGBLUP can set more weight to SNPs that are in high LD with a causal mutation or associated with QTL with a relatively large effect. These weights are estimated from the variance explained by each SNP as presented by Wang et al. []. The weighting of SNP variances was also investigated by Zhang et al. [] who proposed to use the same weight for SNPs that are within a defined window along the genome. The TABLUP method proposes to construct the genomic relationship matrix based on genotypes from a subset of pre-selected SNPs. Selection of SNPs can be performed after GWAS analysis or based on weights that are estimated with WssGBLUP. The selected SNPs are then equally weighted for the analyses []. Furthermore  an alternative to the previous methods is the gene content method proposed by Gengler et al. []  which is based on a multiple trait model and considers the gene content for specific genotypes as a new trait. This method can combine information from SNPs and genotypes for a causal mutation [  ]. The number of alleles carried by each animal is considered as a second trait correlated to the quantitative trait. Then  the causal mutation is integrated directly in the ssGBLUP multiple-trait model. Its advantage is that it can be extended to multi-allelic genes and used when genotypes for a causal mutation are missing []. In French dairy goats  the first step towards genomic selection for milk production traits  udder type traits and somatic cell score was taken by Carillier-Jacquin et al. [  ] for French Alpine and Saanen dairy goat breeds. Carillier-Jacquin et al. [  ] compared ssGBLUP and other methods of genomic evaluation that require several steps (GBLUP or Bayesian methods). GBLUP and Bayesian methods usually use performances based on pseudo-phenotypes (DYD) whereas ssGBLUP is based on female performance. These authors found that ssGBLUP gave more accurate predictions of the genetic merit of selection candidates than the previous official genetic evaluation that did not use genomic information  or the use of multi-step genomic methods. However  the increase in accuracy due to using genomic information was not expected to be high because the reference population was small. Currently  the next step in the genomic evaluation of French dairy goats is to investigate better ways to use genotyping information to improve the accuracy of genomic evaluation. One possibility is to take prior knowledge about major genes into account. Several major genes have been identified  such as  for fat content [] and  for protein content []. For protein content  Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] reported that the genetic variance explained by the  gene reached 38% in the Saanen and 43% in the Alpine breed. The caprine  gene has six alleles (         and ) that have been identified in the French dairy goat population. Allele  is predominant in the Alpine breed  whereas alleles    and  are the most frequent in the Saanen breed []. Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] showed that integrating the  gene for protein content with the gene content method improved the accuracy of genomic evaluation (+<U+2009>8 to 14% for Alpine and Saanen populations) compared with ssGBLUP. In this study  our aim was to investigate different methods of genomic prediction that estimate and integrate the fact that chromosomal regions are strongly associated with a trait. Protein content in French dairy goats was analyzed by applying WssGBLUP  two alternatives of the WssGBLUP method  the TABLUP method and the gene content method. These methods were compared with pedigree-based BLUP and ssGBLUP based on the accuracies of predicted breeding values. The dataset used in this study was provided by the French national milk records system and included animals from the two main French dairy goat breeds  Alpine and Saanen. Phenotypes for protein content  pedigree data  genotypes and environmental fixed effects used in the ssGBLUP method were obtained from the official genetic evaluation of January 2016 []. Analyses were performed with a multi-breed dataset (Alpine and Saanen animals combined) and in two separate within-breed analyses. The trait analyzed was protein content (g/kg) with measurements from 6 767 490 lactations and 2 458 453 females recorded between 1980 and 2010. Descriptive statistics (animal and record numbers  minimum  mean  maximum  coefficient of variation) for each breed are in Table . The pedigree consisted of 2 543 789 animals (1 449 991 Alpine and 1 093 798 Saanen). In addition  it was completed with 36 unknown parent groups. Unknown parent groups were defined for each breed and for animals born before 1975  and then for cohorts born in 2-year windows up to 2010. Animals that were genotyped with the Illumina goat SNP50 BeadChip (50K SNP) [] were also used in the analysis. Quality control (QC) for a dataset of 3347 genotyped animals (2020 Alpine and 1278 Saanen) and 53 347 SNPs was performed independently for each breed. SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 1% and a call rate lower than 95% were removed. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was also tested and the associated Chi squared statistic was calculated for each SNP. SNPs with a Chi squared statistic higher than 24 were removed. Finally  animals with a SNP call rate lower than 99% were discarded from the analyses. After QC  2955 (1749 Alpine and 1206 Saanen) animals and 46 849 SNPs remained for further analyses. Some SNPs within the  gene were present on the 50 K SNP but since they did not pass QC  they were removed []. Genotypes for the  gene were available for 3696 Alpine individuals (2154 males and 1542 females)  and 3506 Saanen individuals (2049 males and 1457 females) born between 1982 and 2012. The  gene is located on caprine chromosome 6 at 82 Mb and is multi-allelic in the French dairy goat population  with six different alleles (         and ) and 19 genotypes detected among the 21 possibilities ( and  genotypes have never been detected in the French dairy goat population) []. Genotypes of animals with one missing allele were removed from the analysis. The estimated effects of the 19  genotypes on protein content were computed and reported previously []. Table  includes the number of animals (males and females for Alpine and Saanen breeds) used in this study with information on their  and/or 50 K SNP genotypes. ssGBLUP was implemented in 2017 in the official genetic evaluations for the two main French dairy goats. This method and pedigree-based BLUP were used as the reference method in our study and compared with WssGBLUP  two alternatives of the WssGBLUP method  TABLUP and the gene content method. Analyses were performed using the blupf90 software []. For both multi-breed and within-breed scenarios  the following model was applied: where  is a vector of performances (female phenotypes) for protein content (phenotypes are based on standardized 250-day lactation records).  is a vector of fixed effects including herd within year (32 years from 1980 to 2012) and within parity (1  2 and =<U+2009>3) (188 933 levels in total); age at delivery within year and within region (four regions in France depending on goat breeding management) (3224 levels in total); month at delivery within year and region (1448 levels in total); and length of dry period within year and region (1107 levels in total); a fifth fixed effect for breed (two levels) was added for multi-breed analyses.  is a vector of random additive genetic effects assumed to be normally distributed    is a vector of random permanent environmental effects assumed to be normally distributed    is a vector of random residuals that is normally distributed .  is the incidence matrix relating phenotypes to the fixed effects (.  is the design matrix allocating phenotypes to breeding values () and  is the incidence matrix relating phenotypes to permanent environmental effects (). Matrix  is the genetic relationship matrix combining SNP information and pedigree data  implemented as in Legarra et al. []: where  is a pedigree-based relationship matrix with indices 1 for ungenotyped animals and 2 for genotyped animals  and  is the genomic relationship matrix derived as in Christensen and Lund []: where  is the number of SNPs   is the estimated allele frequency at locus  and  is a centered matrix of SNP genotypes. Variance components were estimated by using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method in the remlf90 software []. Model 1 was also used for WssGBLUP but  was constructed differently. Solutions of genomic breeding values from ssGBLUP (Model 1) can be decomposed into SNP effects as modeled in Wang et al. []: where  is a vector of SNP effects   is a diagonal matrix of weights (initially diagonal of 1 for the ssGBLUP)   is the centered matrix of SNP genotypes and  the vector of GEBV from genotyped animals only. Variances of the effect of SNP  were estimated as: where  is the allele frequency of SNP . The vector of variances of SNP effects was normalized (the normalization process ensured that the sum of the variances remained constant and was equal to the number of SNPs) and used as weights in matrix  to construct the weighted matrix  () as described in Wang et al. []: GEBV were estimated again with Model 1 by considering weights for each SNP via the  matrix included in the  matrix. This process was carried out iteratively with weights estimated at each iteration as described in Wang et al. []. Wang et al. [] have shown that WssGLUP with only very few iterations may be sufficient to reach a maximum accuracy of GEBV and SNP effects. In this study  we analyzed the influence of the number of iterations (1–10) on the accuracy of genomic predictions. As proposed by Zhang et al. []  other methods can be considered to calculate the weight for SNPs in the  matrix. These methods assign the same weight to several consecutive SNPs within a chromosomal region. Modifications of the WssGBLUP method were considered in this study and the individual weights were computed as follows: (1) the maximum weight of SNPs included in the chromosomal region  or (2) the sum of the weights of the SNPs included in the chromosomal region. These weights were calculated based on the weights estimated with the WssGBLUP. In the end  the vector of the weights was normalized in such a way that the sum of all weights remained constant and equal to the number of SNPs. Chromosomal regions of various lengths were tested: 2  5  10  20  40  80  100  150  200 and 250 consecutive SNPs with non-overlapping windows. Hereafter  these methods are named WssGBLUP where  denotes the method used to calculate the weights (Max or Sum). Only a subset of SNPs that are more or less associated with protein content was selected to build the  matrix. One of our objectives was to investigate how the genetic architecture of protein content could be taken into account in the ssGBLUP method. Thus  TABLUP was applied by selecting a subset of SNPs according to their effect on the trait (estimated from the WssGBLUP method described previously). A total of 5000  10 000  15 000  20 000  25 000  30 000  35 000 or 40 000 SNPs were selected to construct . Two scenarios were tested in which either the most or the least strongly associated SNPs were selected. GEBV were estimated with Model 1 and the  matrix that was built based on the selected SNPs without weights (). The gene content method estimates the GEBV for each animal by taking information on the  genotype  genotypes from the 50K SNP and pedigree into account through a multiple-trait model. The model used here was the same as in []: where  is a vector of female performances for protein content. Fixed effects ()  random effects (   and ) and incidence matrices    and  are the same as in Model 1.           and  are vectors of gene content for alleles          and . This corresponds to the number of copies carried by each animal (i.e.  0  1 or 2). For ungenotyped animals  the value was set to missing.           and  are the mean fixed effects for alleles          and             and  are the incidence matrices relating observations to the random genetic effect (         and ) of gene content for each allele and        and  are the random residual errors for each of the six alleles. For    are normally distributed such that  and   where  is the frequency of allele  at the  locus. Covariances between genetic values () and genetic effects of gene content (         and ) were modeled as in Carillier-Jacquin et al. []. Variance and covariance parameters from this model were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) algorithm implemented in the remlf90 software. Genomic evaluations were performed from all phenotypes recorded until January 2010  but we were also interested in the prediction of genotyped animals that constituted our reference population. This reference population was composed of 905 sires born between 1993 and 2012 and genotyped with the 50K SNP chip (Table ) and was split into a training population of 554 sires born from 1993 to 2007 (307 Alpine and 247 Saanen) with phenotypes of their daughters recorded until January 2010)  and 351 validation sires born from 2008 to 2012 (205 Alpine and 146 Saanen) with no daughters in January 2013 (daughters of these animals were removed from the dataset). Then  GEBV and DYD computed from the official genetic evaluation of January 2016 were compared for the 351 animals in the validation set. DYD were average performance values for the daughters corrected for environmental effects and merit of the dam  and they were weighted by effective daughter contributions as described in VanRaden and Wiggans []. Accuracy of genomic predictions was assessed as the Pearson correlation between GEBV estimated with each model and DYD. Pearson correlations obtained with different methods were tested using the Hotelling-Williams test []. The most frequent  genotypes are  for the males and  for the females in the Alpine breed  and  for the females and  for the males in the Saanen breed (present in more than 50% of the animals). Allele  is rather rare (less than 5% of the animals carry this allele) in the two breeds. The largest differences in genotype frequency between Alpine and Saanen populations were observed for genotypes  (49% in Alpine vs. 7% in Saanen)   (3% in Alpine vs. 32% in Saanen) and  (49% in Saanen . 30% in Alpine). These results were consistent with the previous work of Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] in which fewer genotypes were available. Protein content was analyzed knowing that this trait is highly heritable in both Alpine and Saanen populations (0.5) []. We compared different genomic methods. First  we used WssGBLUP because we wanted to identify the weights given to SNPs with this method  in order to determine if the chromosomal region including the  gene was considered in the analyses. WssGBLUP is an iterative method  and 10 iterations were performed for multi-breed analyses and within-breed analyses. Accuracy of genomic predictions was evaluated at each iteration (results not shown). The highest accuracies were obtained at the second iteration as reported by Wang et al. [] and then decreased slightly. Thus  all the results presented for the WssGBLUP multi-breed and within-breed analyses are those obtained for the second iteration (see Fig. ). The top 50 SNPs (with the biggest weights) were compared between the three analyses and were all located on chromosome 6 i.e. the multi-breed (between 71 and 86 Mb)  Alpine (between 64 and 101 Mb) and Saanen analyses (between 71 and 92 Mb)  and their weights ranged from 24 to 115 for multi-breed  from 23 to 45 for Alpine and from 30 to 108 for Saanen analyses. Among these SNPs  16 were common to the three analyses and located between 78 and 82 Mb; 11 SNPs were common to the Saanen and multi-breed analyses and located between 79 and 83 Mb; 16 SNPs were common to the Alpine and multi-breed analyses and located between 77 and 86 Mb; and only one SNP was common to both the Alpine and Saanen analyses and located at 76 Mb. Estimated weights of SNPs included in the second iteration of the WssGBLUP approach for multi-breed  Alpine and Saanen populations. WssGBLUP used GEBV of genotyped animals and genotypes to estimate weights for each SNP. The estimated weight of each SNP is represented along the genome WssGBLUP can be used not only for genomic prediction but also for QTL detection as in GWAS [  ]. In French dairy goat data  the chromosomal regions detected with WssGBLUP were on caprine chromosome 6  which includes a well-known region that was previously located and described by Martin et al. [] in a GWAS study. They performed linkage analyses (LA) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses on 1941 dairy goats distributed in 20 half-sib families using all females and their 20 sire genotypes and detected a large QTL between 82.5 and 82.8 Mb on chromosome 6. In our study  SNPs with the biggest weights for SNP variances were located within this region. The WssGBLUP method developed by Wang et al. [] has some limitations. Weights for SNP variances are estimated by using a whole-genome regression  which can result in their unstable prediction due to multi-collinearity between SNPs because of LD between SNPs. In our study  we tested common weights for several SNPs instead of individual weights for SNP variances  using WssGBLUP or WssGBLUP. These methods are expected to limit the large variation in prediction of weights for SNP variances by smoothing weights of SNPs that are in the same window. In our study  WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP gave higher accuracies of genomic prediction than the classical WssGBLUP. With WssGBLUP or WssGBLUP  window sizes were used to allocate the same weights to consecutive SNPs. Another approach would be to use the LD between SNPs  which could limit the multi-collinearity between the SNPs used in the genomic evaluation. Since the weight of SNPs is included through the  matrix  this matrix can be replaced by the weights derived from the GWAS approach. Figure  presents accuracies of genomic evaluation for pedigree-based BLUP  ssGBLUP  gene content and WssGBLUP in a multi-breed population and in the Alpine and Saanen breeds. Accuracies with pedigree-based BLUP (0.72 in multi-breed  0.71 in Alpine and 0.66 in Saanen) were lower than accuracies with ssGBLUP (0.77 in multi-breed  0.76 in Alpine and 0.73 in Saanen)  gene content (0.76 in multi-breed  0.76 in Alpine and 0.72 in Saanen) or WssGBLUP (0.79 for multi-breed  0.78 for Alpine and 0.77 for Saanen). The gene content method did not improve accuracy of genomic predictions for the three populations compared to ssGBLUP (accuracy was 1 percent point lower for gene content in the multi-breed and Saanen analyses and identical in the Alpine analysis). In addition  accuracies with WssGBLUP were significantly higher than with ssGBLUP for the Saanen population (+<U+2009>4 percent points). We did not observe any significant difference between ssGBLUP and WssGBLUP for multi-breed and Alpine populations. Validation correlations for validation males in multi-breed  Alpine and Saanen populations for pedigree-based BLUP  ssGBLUP  gene content and WssGBLUP approaches. Differences in accuracy between ssGBLUP and other approaches were tested with the Hotelling-Williams test (threshold: *5%  **3%  ***1%   non-significant) Previously  Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] used the gene content and ssGBLUP methods to analyze protein content in French dairy goats. Accuracies obtained with ssGBLUP were higher in our study than in Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] for the multi-breed (+<U+2009>5 percent points) and Alpine (+<U+2009>8 percent points) analyses  and slightly lower for the Saanen analysis (-<U+2009>2 percent points). A similar trend was observed with the gene content method  with +<U+2009>1 percent point for multi-breed  +<U+2009>8 percent points for Alpine and -<U+2009>14 percent points for Saanen in our study compared to Carillier-Jacquin et al. []. The main difference between our study and that of Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] was the number of animals genotyped with the 50 K SNP chip  number of  genotypes  and the size and composition of the training and validation sets. In our study  82 males and 2050 females genotyped with the 50 K SNP chip and 50 females and 878 males genotyped for the  gene were added. In Carillier-Jacquin et al. []  the reference population consisted of a training set with 677 animals born between 1993 and 2009 (384 Alpine and 293 Saanen)  and a validation set with 146 animals born between 2010 and 2011 (86 Alpine and 60 Saanen). In our study  we had 554 animals born between 1993 and 2007 (307 Alpine and 247 Saanen) in the training set and 351 animals born between 2008 and 2012 (205 Alpine and 146 Saanen) in the validation set. The main difference between the Carillier-Jacquin et al. study and that reported here was the size of the validation population (2 versus 5 years in our study). The slightly improved results that we obtained may be explained by the larger reference population (823 animals in Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] compared to 905 in our study)  a well-known factor in the literature on genomic selection. For instance  VanRaden et al. [] report a gain of +<U+2009>5 percent points between genomic prediction and parent average by adding 1000 animals in the training population. These results were consistent with the higher accuracy obtained in the multi-breed analysis compared to the within-breed analyses  especially if the trait has the same genetic determinism in the two breeds that are combined (which is the case for protein content). Accuracy is expected to improve even more the size of the reference population continues to grow over the years. Carillier-Jacquin et al. [] showed that the gene content method was more accurate than ssGBLUP (+<U+2009>3 percent points for multi-breed  +<U+2009>5 percent points for Alpine and +<U+2009>11 percent points for Saanen). However  in our study  accuracies of genomic prediction were the same for the gene content method and ssGBLUP. The goat  gene has six alleles in the two main French dairy goats and genotype frequencies vary considerably with some being rare. Predicting  genotypes with the gene content method for non-genotyped animals remains difficult in this case  especially in French dairy goats  for which the number of non-genotyped animals is large compared with that of genotyped animals (only 0.3% of the population is genotyped for the  gene)  and 40% of females have unknown parents. This may explain why the gene content method did not outperform ssGBLUP. The genetic architecture of protein content is similar between the Alpine and Saanen breeds. However  the gain in accuracy with the genomic evaluation methods (ssGBLUP  gene content and WssGBLUP) compared to pedigree-based BLUP was greater for the Saanen than the Alpine breed. As discussed by Carillier-Jacquin et al. []  the greater gain observed for the Saanen breed between pedigree-based BLUP and genomic evaluation may be explained by a higher level of inbreeding (2.3% in Saanen and 1.8% in Alpine)  and a higher kinship coefficient between the training and validation sets (2.4% in Saanen and 1.1% in Alpine using genomic data). For prediction of GEBV  WssGBLUP was more efficient than gene content  which may be due to the construction of the 50K SNP chip. The region around the  gene was enriched in SNPs in the 1-Mb region at 82 Mb on chromosome 6 (the region that contains the  gene). Overall  40 SNPs are present within this 1-Mb region  whereas on average only 20 SNPs per Mb are located outside of this region on chromosome 6 or on other chromosomes. Moreover  the Chi squared test between  genotypes and each SNP on chromosome 6 revealed a very strong correlation between  genotypes and SNPs on the 50K SNP chip in this region (results not shown). Giving more weight to SNPs that are more strongly associated with protein content seems to be more efficient to capture the effect of the  gene than using genotype data for this gene. Vallejo et al. [] investigated the efficiency of WssGBLUP for bacterial cold water disease resistance  for which several QTL are identified. They observed an improvement of 4 percent points with WssGBLUP compared to ssGBLUP. In our study  we observed similar gains with WssGBLUP. Su et al. [] also observed a superiority of the WssGBLUP over ssGBLUP in dairy cattle for milk traits. WssGBLUP was significantly more predictive than other genomic evaluation methods for protein content in the Saanen breed but not in multi-breed or the Alpine breed. Zhang et al. [] reported that WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP increase the accuracy of genomic evaluation more efficiently than WssGBLUP. We evaluated these methods and Tables    and  show the results on the validation population in the multi-breed  Alpine and Saanen populations  respectively using WssGBLUP and the two modified WssGBLUP methods (Max  Sum) according to the size of SNP windows. If identical results were obtained for different window sizes  they were merged in the same column. For the multi-breed population  accuracies of the analyses with WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP were very similar and differed only with non-overlapping SNP windows of 40  80  100  150  200 and 250 SNPs  the accuracy (0.81) of WssGBLUP being slightly higher than that of WssGBLUP (0.80). Otherwise  accuracies were equal to 0.79 with a window size of two SNPs and 0.80 for window sizes of five  10 and 20 SNPs. Finally  accuracies of WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP were slightly higher than that of WssGBLUP (0.79) and higher than that of ssGBLUP (0.77). For both within-breed analyses  increasing the window size barely influenced accuracies. In the Alpine within-breed analysis  a maximum accuracy of 0.79 was reached with the WssGBLUP method and a window size of 40 SNPs and thus  it outperformed WssGBLUP (0.78). For other window sizes (larger or smaller)  accuracies with WssGBLUP were equal to 0.78. With the WssGBLUP method  accuracies ranged from 0.77 for a window of two consecutive SNPs to 0.78 for windows of 5  10  20  40  80  100  150  200 and 250 consecutive SNPs. In comparison  genomic evaluations with WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP were more accurate than with ssGBLUP (0.76). In the Saanen within-breed analysis  accuracies of 0.78 were reached with WssGBLUP for windows of 40  80  100  150  200 and 250 consecutive SNPs  and with WssGBLUP for windows of 80 and 100 consecutive SNPs. WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP outperformed WssGBLUP (0.77) or even ssGBLUP (0.73). Accuracies of 0.77 were obtained with WssGBLUP for windows of 2  5  10 and 20 consecutive SNPs and with WssGBLUP for windows of 2  5  10  20  40  150  200 and 250 consecutive SNPs. WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP slightly improved the accuracy of genomic predictions for protein content in French dairy goats compared to WssGBLUP. Similar results were observed by Zhang et al. [] with WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP compared to WssGBLUP on simulated data for five QTL. Zhang et al. [] presented their results for a window size of 20 consecutive SNPs because when they used windows with more than 20 SNPs  accuracies decreased when many QTL affected a trait. This is due to most of the weight being assigned to the windows with large SNP effects and less weight to those with small SNP effects  which may introduce bias in the estimates. For the populations in our study  accuracies varied little with window size. However  20 consecutive SNPs were not sufficient to reach the highest accuracies and 40 consecutive SNPs were more appropriate. Thus  for a trait that is influenced by few QTL  WssGBLUP or WssGBLUP were more efficient to capture clear signals from QTL compared to WssGBLUP with one weight per SNP. To validate that ssGBLUP does capture the  gene information  we used TABLUP that consists in selecting a subset of SNPs for constructing the  matrix  i.e. we selected the SNPs that were the most or the least strongly associated with protein content. Figure  shows the accuracies obtained with ssGBLUP and TABLUP for the multi-breed population according to the number of SNPs conserved (5000 to 40 000 SNPs) to construct the  matrix. Since results for both Alpine and Saanen breeds were similar to those for the multi-breed population  they are not shown. Validation correlations for 351 validation males in the multi-breed population using the TABLUP approach. TABLUP consists in selecting a subset of the genotypes from the 50K SNPs according to their association with protein content (either the most strongly associated or the least strongly associated with protein content)  which is done by selecting SNPs according to their weights estimated with the WssGBLUP approach First  for the SNPs that were the most strongly associated with protein content  TABLUP with only 5000 such SNPs led to a high accuracy of genomic prediction (0.74)  which is close to that obtained with ssGBLUP (0.77). TABLUP reached the 0.77 accuracy of ssGBLUP with 20 000 such SNPs  which were distributed across the whole genome with on average 42% of the SNPs on each chromosome being retained and 54% on chromosome 6. This indicates that SNPs around the  gene have been more selected than the others. Increasing the number of SNPs from 20 000 to 40 000  did not increase the accuracy furthermore. Conversely  for the SNPs that were the least strongly associated with protein content  TABLUP with 5000 such SNPs led to a very low accuracy (0.47) and increasing their number to 40 000 led to an increase in accuracy of 24 percent points (0.47 with 5000 SNPs and 0.71 with 40 000 SNPs) but accuracy remained significantly lower than that obtained by using the whole 50K SNP BeadChip (0.71 against 0.77). Using different subsets of SNPs and the BayesA model  VanRaden et al. [] compared accuracies of genomic predictions in Holstein breed cattle for 33 traits. They used 60K and high-density (HD) SNP panels  and added specific SNPs selected from whole-genome sequence data  which were SNPs based on their annotation (located on exons  splicing sites  indels  2 kb upstream  1 kb downstream  untranslated regions  SNPs with large effects). They showed that the highest accuracies were obtained with the scenario that used 60K SNPs plus the top 1000 SNPs for all 33 traits. Increasing the number of SNPs (using the HD SNP panel for example) did not increase the accuracy of genomic predictions. However  adding selected SNPs from whole-genome sequence to a medium-density SNP BeadChip improved GEBV accuracies. These results agree with those that we obtained with the TABLUP method. In the near future  when whole-genome caprine sequence data become available  it will be possible to select sequence-based variants and add them to the 50K SNP data in the genomic evaluation model  which will improve the accuracy of genomic predictions in these species. We undertook additional analyses (results not shown) in which SNPs were removed chromosome-wise with the ssGBLUP  WssGBLUP and gene content methods. The same accuracies were observed  regardless of the chromosome from which the SNPs were removed  except for chromosome 6 for ssGBLUP (0.77)  WssGBLUP (0.79) and gene content (0.76). When SNPs from chromosome 6 were removed  accuracies dropped to 0.70 for ssGBLUP  0.66 for WssGBLUP and 0.74 for gene content. However  the loss in accuracy with gene content was smaller than with ssGBLUP and WssGBLUP  i.e. using genotypes for the  gene and SNPs from 28 chromosomes (except chromosome 6) is quite similar to using the 50K SNP chip. The missing genotypes from the 50K SNP chip (i.e. the SNPs on chromosome 6) did not add much information compared to the information contained by the genotypes for the . Results of TABLUP and chromosome-wise removal of SNPs showed that a part of the effect of the  gene was retained by the ssGBLUP method  which basically does not include information on causal mutations. These results can be explained by the high coverage of SNPs on chromosome 6 around the  gene. Our aim was to investigate different genomic evaluation methods (using  genotypes and/or 50K SNP information) to integrate information on the  gene in genomic evaluations of dairy goats. Using the trait-specific marker-derived relationship matrix did not improve accuracy of genomic evaluation  which was the same as that obtained by ssGBLUP with a selection of the 20 000 most important SNPs for protein content. With the gene content method  accuracies of genomic evaluation were not improved compared to ssGBLUP  which is probably due to the  gene having many alleles and to the small number of genotyped animals. Putting more weight on SNPs with larger effects improved accuracies of genomic evaluation using WssGBLUP  WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP. For WssGBLUP and WssGBLUP  accuracies were highest when a common weight was applied to non-overlapping windows of 40 SNPs. Gains in accuracies reached +<U+2009>12 percent points for the Saanen  +<U+2009>9 percent points for the multi-breed and +<U+2009>8 percent points for the Alpine populations compared to a pedigree-based BLUP evaluation. WssGBLUP using common weights for SNPs within non-overlapping windows is efficient if the trait is influenced by few QTL and the true number of QTL is not known. WssGBLUP also combines fast computing and simplicity  and requires ssGBLUP to be run only twice. Boichard D  Guillaume F  Baur A  Croiseau P  Rossignol MN  Boscher MY  et al.

In the absence of efficient therapeutic treatments  selective breeding for host resistance offers a promising strategy to control this disease. Our study aimed at investigating genetic resistance to VNN and genomic-based approaches to improve disease resistance by selective breeding. A population of 1538 sea bass juveniles from a factorial cross between 48 sires and 17 dams was challenged with RGNNV with mortalities and survivors being recorded and sampled for genotyping by the RAD sequencing approach.

Tests of genomic prediction suggested that incorporating genome-wide SNP data is likely to result in higher accuracy of estimated breeding values for resistance to VNN. RAD sequencing is an effective method for generating such genome-wide SNPs  and our findings highlight the potential of genomic selection to breed farmed European sea bass with improved resistance to VNN. European sea bass () is a popular and valuable species for Mediterranean aquaculture  with a production volume of more than 150 000 tons []. Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is a commonly-encountered pathogen  which has been detected in more than 70 wild or cultured marine and fresh water species []. Frequent mass mortalities of sea bass due to VNN have been reported  especially during the summer period  with fish being particularly susceptible during the larval and juvenile stages []. The disease is considered to be a primary problem in Mediterranean mariculture [] and  to date  there is no fully effective therapeutic agent or vaccine to tackle it []. Selective breeding can be a valuable tool to prevent the detrimental effects of disease outbreaks in farmed livestock and fish []. Moderate to high heritabilities for disease resistance have been reported in numerous aquaculture species  which indicates that genetic progress is possible through selective breeding []. For resistance to VNN in sea bass  a moderate heritability of 0.26 was recently reported []  which implies that selective breeding has potential as a component of VNN prevention and control. Recent technological advances in genome-wide sequencing and genotyping technology have facilitated cost-effective generation of genome-wide marker data  even in non-model organisms []. Such genotyping data can be used in selective breeding programs to increase the accuracy of breeding value predictions for selection candidates  as compared to the classical breeding approach where breeding values are typically estimated at the family level using pedigree data [  ]. The genetic architecture of most traits relevant to farmed animal production (e.g. growth and disease resistance) is polygenic [  ]  which explains why the application of marker-assisted selection in aquaculture has had limited success  with a few exceptions associated with major-effect loci [   ]. Therefore  as for terrestrial livestock  genomic prediction [] is an effective approach to improve selection accuracy compared to traditional pedigree-based approaches in aquaculture breeding programs [  ]. Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a reduced representation high-throughput sequencing technique for the concurrent detection and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multiplexed samples  each containing a unique nucleotide barcode []. RAD sequencing and similar genotyping-by-sequencing techniques rely on the digestion of genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme and subsequent high-depth sequencing of the flanking regions. Such genotyping-by-sequencing techniques have been applied in a wide range of aquaculture species []  both for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [  ] and genomic selection studies [    ]. The aim of this study was to investigate genetic resistance to VNN in sea bass juveniles  using a RAD sequencing approach to generate genome-wide SNP data from 1538 individual disease-challenged fish. Heritability estimates were obtained using both pedigree and genomic relationship matrices for survival status (dead/alive) on the underlying liability scale. GWA approaches were used to test associations of both individual SNPs and genomic regions with resistance to VNN. Finally  genomic prediction of breeding values for resistance to VNN was tested using several approaches to evaluate the potential of genomic selection for genetic improvement of resistance to VNN in seabass. The population of fish for the VNN disease challenge was obtained by artificial fertilization of 18 dams and 49 sires from the Ferme Marine de Douhet breeding nucleus (Oléron  France). Five factorial mating blocks  each comprising 9 to 10 sires and 3 to 5 dams  were created in February 2014. The fertilized eggs of each dam were transferred to individual incubators. Following egg hatching  equal numbers of larvae from each incubator were transferred in a single tank and reared in common environmental conditions. The fish (at a size of<U+2009>~<U+2009>10 g) were challenged at the Unité de Pathologies Virales des Poissons—ANSES facility (Plouzané  France). Autopsies and extensive bacteriological and virological analyses were carried out on receipt of fish to confirm their health status. After 4 weeks of acclimatization  1990 individuals distributed in three tanks were immersed for 2 to 3 h in static seawater  containing 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID) per ml of the W80 betanodavirus strain  which was produced and titered in striped snakehead cells (SSN-1)  as previously described []. Strain W80 belongs to the redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) genotype  the most common NNV type in the Mediterranean area []. A negative control tank that consisted of sea bass juveniles from the same population (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>200) immersed with non-infected SSN-1-cell supernatant was also included. After infection  all fish were maintained at 27<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 °C in an open water circuit. A pre-test of the experimental conditions was conducted to confirm the virulence of the pathogen. DNA was extracted from fin samples of the challenged fish using the REALPure genomic DNA extraction kit (Durviz S.L.) and treated with RNase. Each sample was quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop)  quality-assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis  and finally diluted to a concentration of 20 ng/µL in 5 mmol/L Tris  pH 8.5 using a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). The protocol for RAD library preparation followed the methodology originally described in Baird et al. []. Briefly  each sample (0.72 µg parental DNA per 0.24 µg offspring DNA) was digested at 37 °C for 60 min with the high-fidelity restriction enzyme I (that recognises the CCTGCA|GG motif)<U+2009>-<U+2009>(New England Biolabs; NEB) using 6 U  I per µg genomic DNA in 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>Reaction Buffer 4 (NEB) at a final concentration of 1 µg DNA per 50 µL reaction volume. Reactions (12 µL final volumes) were then heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min. Individual specific P1 adapters  each with a unique 5–7 bp barcode  were ligated to the  I-digested DNA at 20 °C for 60 min by adding 1.8/0.6 µL of 100 nmol/L P1 adapter  0.45/0.15 µL of 100 mmol/L rATP (Promega)  0.75/0.25 µL 10<U+2009>×<U+2009>reaction buffer 2 (NEB)  0.36/0.12 µL T4 ligase (NEB  2 M U/mL) and reaction volumes for each parental/offspring sample were completed to 45/15 µL with nuclease-free water. Following heat inactivation at 65 °C for 20 min  ligation reactions were slowly cooled down to room temperature (over 1 h)  then combined in appropriate multiplex pools. Shearing (Covaris S2 sonication) and initial size selection (300 to 600 bp) by agarose gel separation was followed by gel purification  end repair  dA overhang addition  P2 (individual specific adapters) paired-end adapter ligation  library amplification  as in the original RAD protocol [  ]. A volume of 150 µL of each amplified library (16 to 18 PCR cycles  library-dependent) was size-selected (400 to 700 bp) by gel electrophoresis []. Following a final gel elution step into 20 µL EB buffer (MinElute Gel Purification Kit  Qiagen)  66 libraries (24 animals each) were sent to BMR in Italy  for sequencing. Libraries were run in 14 lanes of an Illumina NextSeq 500  using 75 base paired-end reads (v2 chemistry). The sequence reads were deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number PRJNA407892. Sequence reads of low quality  with a missing restriction site  or with ambiguous barcodes and PCR duplicates were discarded. The remaining reads were aligned to the European sea bass reference genome [] assembly  using the Bowtie2 program []. Aligned reads were sorted into RAD loci and genotypes were called using Stacks software 1.4 []. The likelihood-based SNP calling algorithm [] implemented in Stacks evaluates each nucleotide position at each RAD-locus of all individuals  using a maximum likelihood approach to differentiate true SNPs from putative sequencing errors. SNP data for downstream analyses were obtained after the following quality control (QC) steps: RAD loci were formed using a minimum stack depth of 10 (parental samples) or 5 (offspring samples) reads. Only RAD loci with a maximum of two SNPs were considered for downstream analysis. SNPs that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.05 and more than 25% missing data and those that deviated from expected Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<U+2009><<U+2009>1e–06; parental samples) were discarded. Parentage assignment was performed with the R/hsphase program [] using all SNPs that passed QC and allowing for a maximum genotyping error of 3.5%. The pedigree obtained using this approach was further validated for potential erroneous assignments using the FImpute software []. Variance components were estimated using the R/BGLR software []. The probit link function was used to connect the observed binary phenotype (0<U+2009>=<U+2009>dead  1<U+2009>=<U+2009>alive) with the latent variable (the underlying liability). The following model was applied: where  is a vector of latent variables   a vector of the fixed effects (intercept and tank)   the incidence matrix relating phenotypes with the fixed effects   the incidence matrix relating phenotypes with the random animal genetic effects   the vector of random animal genetic effects with the following distribution   where  is the pedigree-based relationship matrix  which was replaced with the genomic relationship matrix  [] for certain analyses as described below   is the additive genetic variance  and  is a vector of residuals with the following distribution   where  is the residual variance and  the identity matrix. The parameters of this model were estimated by Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) Gibbs sampling (11 million iterations; burn-in: 1 million; thin: 1000). Convergence of the resulting posterior distributions was assessed both visually (inspecting the resulting MCMC plots) and analytically using the R/coda v0.19-1 software []. Heritability for survival on the underlying scale was estimated as: where  is the estimate of the additive genetic variance and  the residual variance  which was set equal to 1 because it is not identifiable in threshold models [  ]. To test the association of individual SNPs with resistance to VNN  a ‘classical’ genome-wide association study (CGWAS) was performed using the R/gaston software []. The mixed model applied for overall survival on the observed scale had the same format as in Eq. () but with the addition of the genotype of an individual SNP as a fixed effect. Variance components were estimated using the penalized quasi-likelihood approach []. The genome-wide significance threshold was calculated using a Bonferroni correction (0.05/N)  where N represents the number of QC-filtered SNPs across the genome. In addition to the CGWAS approach  weighted genomic best linear unbiased predictor (WGBLUP) was performed [] to estimate SNP effects by using genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) []. SNP weights were estimated using non-overlapping windows of 10 adjacent SNPs. Explained additive genetic variance was estimated using subsequent non-overlapping windows including adjacent SNPs within a distance of 0.5 Mb. Initially  the weighted genomic relationship matrix was created following the method of VanRaden [] as: where  is the design matrix relating genotypes of each SNP with phenotypes   is a weight matrix for all SNPs  and  is a weighting vector derived from the observed SNP frequencies. Briefly  WGBLUP was carried out as follows []: Initialize  and   where  is the identity matrix and  is the iteration number; Calculate ; Estimate GEBV using GBLUP; Estimate the SNP effects from GEBV based on the equation   where  represents the vector of SNP effects and  vector of GEBV; Calculate the weight for matrix  for each SNP:   where  represents number of adjacent SNPs; Normalize the weights of SNPs such that the total genetic variance remains constant; Loop to step (d) (three iterations). The percentage of additive genetic variance explained by each genomic region was estimated by non-overlapping windows of 0.5 Mb as follows: where  denotes group of SNPs within the tested window. This analysis was performed using the THRGIBBS1F90 program from the BLUPF90 software suite [  ] to estimate the GEBV  combined with three iterations using PreGSF90 and PostGSF90 []. To assess the potential of genomic selection for improved resistance to VNN in sea bass breeding programs  the accuracy of GEBV was assessed and compared to EBV obtained with pedigree-based approaches. Missing genotypes for the SNPs that passed QC filters were imputed using FImpute []. Several commonly used genomic selection models were applied to the data using the R/BGLR software []: rrBLUP  BayesA  BayesB [] and BayesC []. In addition  pedigree-based BLUP [] was evaluated using the same software. The general form of the fitted models was as in Eq. (): where  is the incidence matrix relating the underlying liability with the genotypes and  the vector of SNP effects using the corresponding prior distribution for each of the above Bayesian models. The parameters of each model were estimated by MCMC using Gibbs sampling (1.1 million iterations; burn-in: 100 000; thin: 100). Convergence of the resulting posterior distributions was assessed both visually (inspecting the resulting MCMC plots) and analytically using the R/coda v0.19-1 software []. Six-fold cross-validation was performed in order to test prediction accuracy of correctly classifying animals in the validation set as resistant or susceptible. The dataset was randomly split into sequential training (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1090 individuals) and validation sets (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>218). The number of survivors and mortalities in each validation set was proportional to the overall survival of the challenged population. In the validation sets  the phenotypes of the animals were masked  and their (genomic) estimated breeding values—(G)EBV—were estimated based on the prediction model derived from the training set. This cross-validation procedure was repeated five times. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the efficacy of classifying the animals as survivors or mortalities  using either the pedigree- or the genomic-based models. The area under the curve (AUC) metric [  ] was used to interpret the performance of the genomic prediction models  with values of 1 representing the perfect classifier. The challenge study was conducted for 7 weeks  with mortalities recorded daily. Characteristic clinical signs of VNN were observed in each disease-challenged tank. In this experiment  the total percentage of mortality reached 48% (ranging from 40 to 56% depending on the tank)  with four successive peaks of mortality (days 8  15  20 and 27); (see Additional file : Table S1). Presence of the virus was confirmed in the anterior kidneys and spleens of dead individuals at 1 week post-infection  using primary cell culture coupled with an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). No mortality was observed in the control tank. Two of the challenge tanks experienced a drop in oxygen concentration at day 27 post-infection  but the fast return to a normal situation within 24 to 48 h after the incident without observing abnormal behavior or excess mortality led to the conclusion that this temporary oxygen drop did not affect the rest of the experiment. Furthermore  oxygen-related mortalities (day 27 post-infection) were excluded  resulting in 1538 VNN-challenged animals used for downstream analysis. In total  6.34 million (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.95 million) and 2.83 million (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.38 million) sequence reads passed the QC filters for the parental and offspring samples  respectively. The mean number of putative RAD loci identified was 45 631 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>7099) and 43 538 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>4543) for parents and offspring  with mean coverages of 68× (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>32) and 26× (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>12)  respectively. The RAD loci were distributed relatively evenly across the sea bass genome assembly (see Additional file : Table S2). Only animals with fewer than 30% missing genotype data were retained for downstream analysis (67 parents and 1322 offspring). A total of 17 004 putative SNPs were identified  of which 9195 passed the QC filters and were retained for downstream analysis (Table ) and (see Additional file : Table S3). Animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11) with a genotypic similarity greater than 90% were discarded as potential replicated samples. Progeny were assigned to unique parental pairs  allowing for a maximum genotypic error of 3.5%. One thousand two hundred and ninety-seven offspring were uniquely assigned  which revealed that the challenged population (produced from the factorial batch-spawning design described above) comprised 140 full-sib families (48 sires and 17 dams)  with 1 to 32 animals per family and a mean size of 9 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>8). The contribution of individual dams to the population ranged from 1 to 267 animals  with a mean of 77 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>68)  while the contribution of sires ranged from 1 to 66  with a mean of 27 (s.d.<U+2009>=<U+2009>18). Further testing of parentage assignment results using FImpute identified four animals as potentially mis-assigned. These individuals were discarded  which left 1293 animals originating from 48 sires and 17 dams in the final dataset used for the subsequent genetic analyses. The overall survival of these individuals in the VNN challenge was 42% (Fig. ). The survival rate varied substantially among the offspring of individual sires (0–100%) and dams (0–69%)  which indicates genetic variation for resistance to VNN. Daily mortality rates during the VNN disease challenge Estimates of heritability of overall survival on the underlying liability scale were significant and moderate  at 0.27 (highest posterior density  HPD 95% interval 0.14–0.40) using the pedigree relationship matrix and at 0.43 (HPD 95% interval: 0.29–0.57) using the genomic relationship matrix. In the CGWAS  SNPs that exceeded the genome-wide significance level were located on chromosomes 3  20 and 25 (chromosome 25 corresponds to unassigned scaffolds and contigs of the reference genome assembly; <U+2009><<U+2009>1e–05; R: 0.03–0.05; Fig. ). The WGBLUP analysis provided support for the putative QTL on chromosome 3  with the 0.5-Mb window containing the QTL-associated SNPs estimated to explain approximately 4% of the genetic variation. The putative QTL on chromosomes 20 and 25 were estimated to explain 1.5 and 2% of the genetic variation  respectively  in the WGLUP. Additional putative QTL regions that explained more than 2% of the additive genetic variance were identified on chromosomes 9  18  21 and 22 (Fig. ).

The best classifications were obtained with the Bayes A and Bayes B methods  corresponding to a success rate of 70% (Table ) for correct classification (based on the AUC values of the ROC curves; Fig. ).

The plot was obtained from aggregation of a sixfold cross validation scheme European sea bass is a farmed species of paramount importance for Mediterranean aquaculture. Breeding for improved genetic resistance to VNN offers a promising avenue for reducing economic losses due to this disease and for improving animal welfare. A small number of family-based selective breeding programs exist for sea bass  with growth and disease resistance as the major target traits. Applying genomic information to selective breeding schemes facilitates direct selection for favorable alleles at major QTL (marker-assisted selection) and/or incorporation of genome-wide markers into the prediction of breeding values (genomic selection). Genomic prediction methods have been repeatedly shown to increase selection accuracy compared to pedigree-based approaches in aquaculture [    ]  which should translate to faster rates of genetic gain. High-density SNP arrays have been used for genomic selection  but these require substantial prior investment for development and application. As such  SNP arrays may be too expensive for routine genotyping in small to medium scale selective breeding programs  and more cost-effective genotyping methods are highly desirable. Techniques such as RAD sequencing  which require minimal prior investment  offer a cost effective alternative of generating genome-wide SNP datasets  even in the absence of  genomic resources []. RAD sequencing and other genotyping-by-sequencing approaches are therefore becoming increasingly commonplace in aquaculture genetics and breeding []. Our study is the first application of high throughput sequencing to study genetic resistance of sea bass to VNN. The estimated heritability of resistance was moderate to high (ranging from 0.27 to 0.43). The heritability estimate obtained by using the pedigree relationship matrix (0.27) was in accordance with a recently estimated heritability (0.26) for resistance to VNN in several sea bass populations  also using pedigree []. These significant heritability estimates indicate that the aquaculture industry can benefit from the application of selective breeding for sea bass resistant to VNN. The reason that a higher heritability estimate was obtained when using the genomic relationship matrix (0.43) is not clear  but it is plausible that linkage disequilibrium generated by recent selective breeding may cause overestimation of additive genetic variance when using a genomic relationship matrix []. The CGWAS identified genome-wide significant QTL in several genomic regions (chromosomes 3  20  25  with chromosome 25 representing unassigned genome contigs and scaffolds). The single SNP CGWAS approach may lack statistical power to detect QTL when compared to methods in which all SNPs are used simultaneously  because of a false assumption of independence between SNPs []. WGBLUP is an approach that combines the computational efficiency of GBLUP with an increase in statistical power for QTL detection []. The genomic region that explained the highest percentage of additive genetic variance in the WGBLUP (~<U+2009>4%) was located on chromosome 3 and was also detected in the CGWAS. However  this may be an overestimation of the explained additive variance because threshold models often lead to overestimates of genetic variance []. In spite of some degree of discrepancy between the two GWAS approaches used  both highlight significant QTL that may play a role in host resistance to VNN  but also suggest that the trait is polygenic or ‘oligogenic’ in nature. In a similar study on resistance to VNN in Asian sea bass  no major QTL were identified []  which supports the hypothesis that genetic resistance to VNN may be under the control of many genomic regions  each with a minor to moderate effect. In such situations  genomic selection is likely the most appropriate approach for using genetic markers to improve selective breeding. The results from the genomic prediction approach used in the current study were encouraging for practical implementation of genomic selection for genetic resistance in sea bass. For traits like disease resistance  which cannot be measured directly on selection candidates  genomic selection benefits from the use of within-family genetic variation  compared to pedigree-based BLUP  which uses between-family genetic variation only []. Improvements in selection accuracies due to genomic prediction for disease resistance traits have been documented in various finfish aquaculture species  including Atlantic salmon []  rainbow trout []  and gilthead sea bream []. The AUC metrics derived from the ROC curves take the rate of both false positives and false negatives into consideration and have been routinely used to test the efficacy of prediction models for binary traits both in humans [] and in livestock []. Interestingly  our study resulted in higher AUC values compared to livestock studies that used similar sample sizes and SNP density [  ]  with the best performing models on average correctly classifying 70% of the validation set. This may be related to long-range linkage disequilibrium as a result of close genetic relationships between training and validation sets  which include large numbers of full and half siblings. Genetic relationships between reference and test populations are known to be a key factor that influences prediction accuracies in genomic selection []. However  reliance on these close genetic relationships for genomic prediction implies that generalization of these results to other populations and reference population designs should be undertaken with caution. Furthermore  additional testing of genomic prediction at varying SNP densities on a wider population is required to ascertain the appropriate SNP density for commercial application of genomic selection. We applied RAD sequencing to study the genetic basis of resistance to VNN in a large sample of juvenile sea bass derived from a commercial breeding program. RAD-derived SNPs allowed us to perform pedigree assignment in this batch-spawning species  estimate genetic parameters  perform GWAS  and test genomic selection. Genome-wide significant QTL were identified with minor to moderate effects on host resistance  on chromosomes 3  20 and on an unassigned genome scaffolds. Genomic prediction using the RAD genotype data was effective  demonstrating significant improvement in prediction accuracy  and facilitating classification of surviving and mortality fish with a success rate of 70% using the cross-validation approach. This highlights the utility of genotyping-by-sequencing for genomic prediction of disease resistance in aquaculture species  and demonstrates that genomic selection can be an effective method for improving resistance to one of the most problematic infectious diseases in sea bass aquaculture.

The Russian fat-tailed breeds shared co-ancestry with sheep from China and Southwestern Asia (Iran). In this study  we derived the genetic characteristics of the major Russian local sheep breeds  which are moderately diverse and have a strong population structure. Pooling our data with a worldwide genotyping set gave deeper insight into the history and origin of the Russian sheep populations. The sheep () is one of the economically most important agricultural species and produces a wide range of valuable products including food (meat  milk) and raw materials (wool  sheepskin) []. Since their domestication approximately 11 000 years ago (YA) [  ]  sheep have spread to all continents where they were reared under different environmental  management  and selection conditions. Consequently  diverse local breeds with a unique composition of various traits were developed. Sheep breeding has always been an important branch of animal husbandry in Russia. The harsh climate conditions  which are characterized by low temperatures and 120 to 240 windy days per year  dictate a steady public demand for wool  sheepskins and felt products. Furthermore  Russia offers more than 75 million hectares of natural grasslands and pastures that are suitable for sheep rearing. Until 1990  Russia  along with Australia  China and New Zealand  was one of the world leaders in wool sheep production. However  the radical reformation of the economy reduced the number of sheep from 58 million in 1990  to 24.7 million in 2014 []. This trend was partly associated with a worldwide reduction of the demand of wool. Currently  sheep breeding is recovering and turning its production to meat instead of wool. Thus  the proportion of wool breeds has decreased from 90% in 1990 to 56% in 2014  while that of meat types has increased from 10 to 44% []. These developments threaten many wool breeds and they have even abolished several of them []. From the 45 breeds that were recorded in 1990  only 28 are still maintained []. Wool breeds comprise breeds with coarse wool and breeds with fine and semi-fine wool. The Russian coarse wool breeds originated from local sheep that were well adapted to the local environmental conditions of certain regions  such as the Edilbai and Kalmyk fat-rumped breeds in the hot dry steppe regions in the south of Russia  the Tuva short-fat-tailed breed in the Trans-Baikal area with a harsh continental climate  the Andean and Lezgin breeds in the mountain areas of the North Caucasus with poor forage resources  and Romanov sheep in the Central Russia with cold winters. The coarse wool breeds were created mainly by folk selection practices and were only slightly improved by crossbreeding with high-producing foreign breeds [  ]. Furthermore  the Russian coarse wool breeds exhibit a large diversity in tail fat deposition as well as in tail length  and they include the short-thin-tailed Romanov  the long-fat-tailed Kuchugur  Karakul and Caucasian Mountain breeds  the short-fat-tailed Buubei and Tuva  and the fat-rumped Edilbai and Kalmyk breeds. The Russian semi-fine wool breeds were established from local ewes and were substantially influenced by the Romney and Lincoln breeds [  ]. Most of the Russian fine wool breeds were developed during the Soviet period by improving local breeds with low productivity  mainly through crossbreeding with Merino-derived breeds such as Rambouillet and Australian Merino sheep. The development of high-throughput arrays for genotyping of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has revolutionized modern genetic studies [  ]. This technology allows unambiguous scoring and the combination of standardized data from different laboratories [  ]  thus providing a powerful tool to address a number of genetic issues [  ] including the successful application for studies on population structure in farm animals. During the last decade  detailed studies of the biodiversity and admixture levels in sheep breeds from Asia  Africa  America  Europe  Australia and New Zealand were performed using SNPs [    ]. To date  only a few Russian sheep breeds have been genotyped using the OvineSNP50K BeadChip []  whereas most of them have been analyzed using mitochondrial [] and microsatellite markers exclusively [  ]. In this work  we investigated the patterns of whole-genome diversity and the population structure of 25 local Russian sheep breeds using genome-wide genotype data. Furthermore  we determined the genetic relationship of the studied breeds with other breeds worldwide to elucidate the origin of the Russian sheep breeds. Three hundred and ninety-six tissue samples were collected from 25 local Russian sheep breeds. These breeds included nine fine wool breeds (Baikal fine-fleeced  Dagestan Mountain  Groznensk  Kulundin  Manych Merino  Salsk  Soviet Merino  Stavropol  and Volgograd)  five semi-fine wool breeds (Altai Mountain  Kuibyshev  North Caucasian  Russian Longhaired  and Tsigai)  and 11 coarse wool breeds. The latter comprised the short-thin-tailed Romanov  the fat-tailed Andean Black  Buubei  Karakul  Karachaev  Kuchugur  Lezgin  Tushin  Tuva breeds  and the fat-rumped Edilbai and Kalmyk breeds (Table )  (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Table S1). Tissue samples were collected by trained personnel under strict veterinary rules. Map of sampling locations for this study. Both maps illustrate the geographical points where the samples of the 25 Russian sheep breeds were collected for this study. The coarse wool breeds are in blue; the semi-fine and fine wool breeds are in red and green colors  respectively. The numbers for the breeds are as follows: 1. Andean Black  2. Buubei  3. Edilbai  4.

For a description of the sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) Genomic DNA was extracted using Nexttec columns (Nexttec Biotechnology GmbH  Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentrations of DNA solutions were determined using a NanoDrop-2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific  Wilmington  DE  USA) and a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter (Life Technologies). DNA concentrations and the OD260/OD280 ratio of DNA solutions were determined by NanoDrop. A Qubit dsDNA HS (high sensitivity  0.2–100 ng) Assay Kit was used to measure the concentration of dsDNA according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The DNA quality was checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Whole-genome SNP genotyping was performed using the OvineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). Two datasets were included in the analyses. The first one comprised 25 Russian sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1)  while the second one included 24 of the 25 Russian sheep breeds mentioned above (except for the Baikal fine-fleeced breed  which was excluded from the combined dataset due to the small number of samples) and 2791 samples from 58 worldwide sheep breeds from publicly available sources [    ]. To account for the effects of family structures within the subpopulations  the genome-wide relationships between all animal pairs were inferred by estimating a unified additive relationship (UAR) matrix according to Yang et al. []. After exclusion of one of 1157 pairs of highly related animals (relationship<U+2009>><U+2009>0.25)  the combined dataset comprised the SNP genotypes of 1592 relatively unrelated individuals from 82 breeds. Outliers were identified using a neighbor-joining tree based on identical-by-state (IBS) allele-sharing distances (–distance 1-ibs). Three outliers were found and removed from the Stavropol  Tushin  and Altai Mountain datasets. The worldwide breeds were pooled according to their historical geographic origin and included 13 breeds from the British Isles  five breeds from Northern Europe  six breeds from Central Europe  22 breeds from Southwestern Europe  three breeds from Asia  three breeds from Southwestern Asia  two breeds from South Africa  and four breeds from the Americas. Breed acronyms and color codes are available in Table S2 (see Additional file : Table S2). First  the accuracy and efficiency of SNP genotyping were assessed. Valid genotypes for each SNP were determined by applying a cut-off of 0.5 for the GenCall (GC) and GenTrain (GT) scores []. Next  PLINK 1.07 [] was used to exclude SNPs for which less than 90% of the individuals were genotyped (–geno 0.1)  that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 5% (–maf 0.05)  that departed from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at p<U+2009><<U+2009>10 (–hwe 1e-6) and that were in linkage disequilibrium (–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5). Finally  only SNPs that are located on autosomes were kept for further analyses. Individuals with more than 10% missing genotypes (–mind 0.1) were removed. A Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test was not performed for comparisons with worldwide breeds because too many SNPs would be excluded due to the Wahlund effect []. The R package ‘diveRsity’ [] was used to calculate expected heterozygosity (H) []  rarefied allelic richness (A) and pairwise  values based on SNP genotypes. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis based on pairwise identical-by-state (IBS) distances was performed with PLINK 1.07 (–cluster  –mds-plot 4) and visualized with the R package “ggplot2” []. Pairwise Nei’s genetic distances [] were calculated using the R package ‘adegenet’ []. Neighbor-net graphs both for the Russian and the combined dataset based on pairwise  values were computed using SplitsTree 4.14.5 []. Genetic admixture calculations were performed using Admixture v1.3 [] and plotted with the R package “pophelper” []. Values of K (the number of assumed ancestral populations) ranging from 1 to 25 for the Russian dataset and from 1 to 74 for the combined dataset as well as their respective cross-validation (CV) errors were evaluated. A map illustrating the area of sampling for each Russian sheep breed was obtained from the NatGeo Mapmaker Interactive database []. The outline map was plotted using the R package “maps” []. Trends of effective population size () were estimated from linkage disequilibrium (LD) as implemented in  []. Default parameters were applied  except for the sample size correction  occurrence of mutation (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.2; [])  and recombination rate between a pair of genetic markers according to Sved and Feldman []. The most recent estimate of  was taken five generations back (). Furthermore   estimates for =<U+2009>1 Mb (~<U+2009>50 generations ago; )  where  is the distance between the SNPs in Morgans  were used for comparison with results from Kijas et al. [    ]. A ‘ changing ratio’ () analysis was used as a proxy of the speed in  changes in the 20 most recent generations. The slope of each segment that links a pair of neighboring  estimates was calculated and normalized using the median of the most recent 20  estimates. R version 3.3.2 was used to create input files []. Descriptive statistics of the genetic diversity of the 25 Russian sheep breeds analyzed are in Table . Estimates of expected heterozygosity (H) and rarified allelic richness (A) in the Russian breeds under study were higher than 0.358 and 1.900  respectively. Only the Romanov breed had a lower level of genetic diversity with an H of 0.354 and A of 1.890. The mean  value was around 228  with the Karakul and Kuchugur breeds displaying the highest (543) and lowest (65) values  respectively. The recorded  values showed a similar trend i.e. 2171 for the Karakul and 357 for the Kuchugur breeds. The first component of the MDS analysis Fig.  accounted for 4.63% of the genetic diversity and discriminated Russian breeds with coarse wool from breeds with fine and semi-fine wool. The second component (3.73% of the genetic variability) clearly differentiated the Romanov breed from the remaining breeds. In general  the coarse wool and the fine wool breeds clustered into two distant groups with minor exclusions. According to the first and third components  the Kuchugur breed was positioned outside the cluster of coarse wool breeds (Fig. a). Regarding the fine wool breeds  the Dagestan Mountain and a few Baikal fine fleeced individuals were similar to the closely-related Tsigai and Altai Mountain breeds (Fig. a). The third component (Fig. b) provided a better understanding of the spatial distribution of the semi-fine wool breeds  which were separated from the other breeds  except for the Kuchugur breed. Furthermore  unlike the majority of the coarse and fine wool breeds  the semi-fine wool breeds did not form a united cluster. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of the Russian sheep breeds. The analysis was performed for the first two components (C1 and C2) () and for the first and third components (C1 and C3) (. The coarse wool breeds are indicated in blue; the semi-fine and fine wool breeds are in red and green colors  respectively. For a description of the sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) The  values computed for each pair of breeds (see Additional file : Table S3) and the pattern of the admixture analysis (Fig. ) were in accordance with the MDS results. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2  the Russian local breeds were separated into two main clusters according to wool type. The first cluster included the fine and semi-fine wool breeds and the second one comprised the coarse wool breeds. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3  we found a strong genetic differentiation of the Romanov breed from all other studied breeds that persisted at higher K-values. The other breeds were distributed across the two remaining clusters according to wool type. The distinct genetic remoteness of the Romanov breed was consistent with the average pairwise  values between the Romanov breed and the other breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.084–0.124) and the MDS findings. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4  a high degree of genetic heterogeneity was observed for the Kuchugur breed  which revealed mixed ancestry. Besides  from K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4 to higher values  the group of semi-fine wool breeds (except for the Russian Longhaired breed) demonstrated admixed ancestry with a clear share of the genetic background from fine wool breeds. On the contrary  the Russian Longhaired breed was the most differentiated within the semi-fine wool cluster (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.046–0.059). A high genetic similarity was detected between the Altai Mountain and Tsigai breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013)  and the North Caucasian and Kuibyshev breeds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020). The lowest cross-validation error was found at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>6  at which slight changes were detected within the coarse wool cluster. Thus  an additional ancestral component was observed in the coarse wool breeds  which was most dominant in the native fat-tailed North Caucasian breeds (Andean Black  Karachaev  Lezgin and Tushin). The results of the analyses performed at higher K-values (K<U+2009>><U+2009>6) overlapped with the above-mentioned results. Cluster structure of the 25 Russian sheep breeds revealed by admixture analysis. For a description of the sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) For the Russian breeds  the neighbor-net graph (Fig. ) was in agreement with the MDS pattern. Thus  most of the fine wool and coarse wool breeds formed two distinct groups. The semi-fine wool breeds were positioned between the above-mentioned clusters. At the same time  the neighbor-net graph showed the subdivision within the wool types more precisely. Thus  within the cluster of fine-wool breeds  the Volgograd breed formed its own independent branch  while the Dagestan Mountain and Baikal fine-fleeced breeds were separated from the fine wool group. The short-thin-tailed Romanov and the fat-tailed Kuchugur breeds separated from the cluster of coarse wool breeds  which comprised an independent branch of the fat-tailed Buubei breed and two fat-tailed sub-clusters (Karachaev<U+2009>+<U+2009>Tushin<U+2009>+<U+2009>Lezgin<U+2009>+<U+2009>Andean Black and Edilbai<U+2009>+<U+2009>Kalmyk<U+2009>+<U+2009>Karakul<U+2009>+<U+2009>Tuva). The semi-fine wool breeds separated into two groups: Altai Mountain<U+2009>+<U+2009>Tsigai  and Russian longhaired<U+2009>+<U+2009>Kuibyshev<U+2009>+<U+2009>North Caucasian  which were positioned on the opposite edges of the graph. Neighbor-net graph of 25 Russian sheep breeds based on pairwise Fst values. The branches corresponding to the Russian coarse wool  semi-fine and fine wool breeds are indicated in blue  red and green  respectively. For a description of the sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) The  analysis identified several sudden changes in effective population size (Fig. ). Specifically  two major peaks of  decline were recorded around eight and 13 generations ago in 24 (excluded Dagestan Mountain) and 22 (excluded Karakul  Dagestan Mountain and Soviet Merino) breeds  respectively. Other strong signals of  were recorded around generations 6 (Stavropol  Soviet Merino  Salsk  Kuibyshev  Romanov) and 7 (Baikal fine-fleeced  Groznensk  Tsigai  Andean Black  Kuchugur  Kalmyk) (see Additional file : Figure S1). Historical effective population size () based on LD estimates.  values for 50–1000 generations ago are shown for the fine wool (  )  semi-fine wool (  ) and coarse wool (  ) sheep breeds. For a description of the sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) To study the ancestry of the Russian sheep breeds  we pooled our data with publicly available genotype data of 58 sheep breeds from across the world [    ]. The neighbor-net analysis  (Fig. ) showed a clear pattern of consistent subdivision among the wool types as also evidenced by MDS (Fig. ) and admixture results (Fig. ). Accordingly  the fine wool breeds were clustered among the Merino and Merino-derived sheep breeds except for the Dagestan Mountain breed  which branched individually between the fine-wool cluster and the coarse-wool and crossbreed sheep breeds of the Americas and Africa. The fat-tailed Russian coarse wool breeds were clustered into one group with the Asian and Southwestern Asian sheep. The Romanov breed showed a clear Northern European origin and clustered together with the Finnsheep and Norway Spaelsau breeds. The Kuchugur breed was separated from the cluster of coarse wool sheep breeds. The semi-fine wool breeds split into two groups  with one including the Altai Mountain and Tsigai breeds and the other comprising the Kuibyshev  Russian Longhaired and North Caucasian breeds that clustered with Swiss  European and American crossbreeds and adjoined a group of sheep from the British Isles. Neighbor-net graph of Russian and worldwide sheep breeds based on pairwise Fst values. The branches corresponding to the Russian coarse wool  semi-fine and fine wool breeds are indicated in blue  red and green  respectively. The colors of the branches of the worldwide breeds correspond to their ancestral geographic origin and are identical to the colors in Table S3 (see Additional file : Table S3): green for the British Isles  black for Northern Europe  pale pink for Central Europe  cyan for Southwestern Europe  orange for Asia  yellow for Southwestern Asia  purple for Africa and gray for the Americas. For a description of the sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) The results of the model-based admixture clustering (Fig. ) were consistent with those of the neighbor-net analysis. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2  we observed that most of the local Russian fat-tailed coarse wool sheep breeds showed high similarity with Asian breeds (blue color)  whereas for the Romanov and Kuchugur breeds this trend did not predominate. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3  we detected a differentiated cluster including sheep from the British Isles and Northern Europe. It was obvious that their genetic background was shared with that of the Romanov and semi-fine wool Russian breeds as well as sheep from both Americas. At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4  the genetic background of the Merino breeds (Merino  Rambouillet  Australian Poll Merino) was clearly present in the Merino-derived fine wool Russian breeds. At K-values from 5 to 7  the Romanov breed showed high genetic relatedness to the other Northern short-tailed breeds (Finnsheep and Norway Spaelsau)  but a K value of 14 clearly differentiated the Romanov breed. According to the cross-validation error  the largest number of founder populations was 42. The fine wool Russian breeds with Merino and Rambouillet genetic backgrounds formed their own genetic group with a complex ancestry. The semi-fine wool breeds were close to the cluster of fine wool breeds but were obviously admixed with sheep breeds of the British Isles. We identified a relatively large Romney Marsh ancestry in the Kuibyshev and the North Caucasian breeds  while the Russian Longhaired breed showed a strong Galway component (such as the long-wool Lincoln breed) and admixture with the Kuchugur breed. Bar plot showing the extent of admixture of the Russian sheep breeds from worldwide breeds. Breed codes are indicated at the bottom of the bar plots. The breeds are grouped according to their ancestral geographic origin (Russia  the British Isles  Northern Europe  Central Europe  Southwestern Europe  Asia  Southwestern Asia  Africa and the Americas) and arranged in the order indicated in Table S2 (see Additional file : Table S2). For a description of the Russian sheep breeds (see Additional file : Table S1  Additional file : Table S2) and of the worldwide sheep breeds  (see Additional file : Table S2) The global admixture analysis revealed that the genetic backgrounds that predominate in Chinese and Iranian sheep are present in all Russian coarse wool breeds except for the Romanov and Kuchugur breeds. In addition  the fat-rumped Edilbai and Kalmyk as well as the short-fat-tailed Buubei and Tuva breeds shared a significant common genetic ancestry with Chinese (Tibet) sheep. We detected similar patterns for the Russian Karakul and the Iran Afshari breeds. Most of the Russian sheep breeds analyzed here revealed a complex ancestry  but two Russian indigenous breeds (Romanov and Kuchugur) formed specific genetic patterns that were not detected in the other studied sheep populations. We observed a high level of consolidation for the Romanov breed  while the extent of admixture for the Kuchugur breed was more obvious. Due to their vast extension and unique Eurasian geographical position  Russian local livestock are of special interest [    ]. The first key point of interest for us was to investigate the whole-genome diversity of the breeds under study. This was crucial since no Russian sheep breeds were included in the OvineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina) discovery panel. We found that the levels of variability of Russian breeds were similar to those reported for other sheep breeds [    ]. Regarding the slope changes in the  trend lines (see Additional file : Figure S1)  the major peak of  decline for 24 of the 25 breeds analysed occurred about eight generations ago. This decline is most likely due to the beginning of the restructuring of the Soviet economy  the so-called Perestroika  which resulted in the destruction of the planned economy system and in a deep crisis of the agricultural sector. The subsequent lack of forage and food resources led to a considerable decrease in the number of all livestock populations including sheep  which can be detected in the evolution of the . The negative consequences continued during the next decade of the post-soviet times  which could explain the shifts of the peaks in the  slopes of some breeds between 6 and 8 generations ago. However  one breed i.e. the Dagestan Mountain breed did not follow this trend and maintained its population size during the Perestroika. A possible explanation for this trend might be the great popularity of the Dagestan Mountain sheep in their breeding region because of their combined good meat and wool productivity. In addition  we observed that the coarse wool breeds did not display any further recent significant peaks  whereas fine and semi-fine wool breeds do. This could be indirectly associated with the growing interest of farmers in local coarse wool breeds that are highly adapted to specific regions. We observed a decline in  over time for the breeds analyzed (Fig. ). The most rapid decline in  occurred over the last 200 to 400 generations in all breeds. In general  this decrease corresponded to the results obtained by Kijas et al. [] on sheep breeds included in the HapMap Project data []. However  some breeds showed interesting patterns regarding changes in ancestral . Until 250 generations ago  the  curve of the Tsigai breed was almost parallel to the x-axis. The same tendency towards smooth curves until 200 to 250 generations ago was also observed for the Tuva  Karachaev  Kalmyk  Edilbai  Karakul and Lezgin breeds. This pattern most likely reflects their ancient origin and wide geographic distribution. In addition  all mentioned breeds currently have large  (Table ). However  in their latest study  Prieur et al. [] suggested that the 50K SNP BeadChip is not suitable for estimating the  more than 100 generations ago. Consequently  these inferences onto many generations ago based on a 50K DNA array data should be treated with caution. Overall  the current effective population size estimates () for the Russian sheep groups were larger than those of the other worldwide sheep breeds [    ]. The Kuchugur breed recorded the smallest  and  values (65 and 357  respectively)  which most likely reflect the low management conditions of the breed  for which no precise information on the population size is available []. However  although the  values are not as critical as those for Dorset Horn (<U+2009>=<U+2009>134) and Wiltshire (<U+2009>=<U+2009>100) breeds []  the most recent  estimate for the Kuchugur breed is around 50  which is considered as the threshold risk of extinction in the short term []. This implies that the breed should be monitored closely as a relevant candidate for conservation efforts. The analysis of a combined dataset of local and worldwide sheep genotypes allowed us to gain insight into the history and ancestry of the Russian sheep population. The Russian coarse wool breeds are characterized by differences in tail phenotypes and included sheep with thin tails and sheep with fat tails and fat rumps. Among these different tail types  the thin tail is likely to be the ancestral trait  since it is present in the mouflon  which is the most probable wild ancestor of modern sheep. According to archaeological findings  fat-tailed sheep were developed from thin-tailed sheep and were first mentioned about 5000 years ago []. In this regard  fat deposition in the tail is an important genetic trait that is considered one of the major post-domestic adaptations to harsh environments (drought seasons  extreme cold winters and food shortages) as well as an energy source for long migrations [  ]. In our study  the tail types of the Russian coarse wool breeds could provide valuable information on their origin. Here  we recorded a strong differentiation between the thin-tailed Romanov and the local fat-tailed and fat-rumped groups (Figs.         and ). A further subdivision was detected within the group with fat deposition in the tail. This group comprised the long-fat-tailed Kuchugur breed and two subclusters: Karakul (long-fat-tailed)  Buubei and Tuva<U+2009>+<U+2009>Edilbai<U+2009>+<U+2009>Kalmyk (short-fat-tailed and fat-rumped)  and Andean Black<U+2009>+<U+2009>Lezgin<U+2009>+<U+2009>Tushin<U+2009>+<U+2009>Karachaev (long-fat-tailed). For a better understanding of the results  some aspects of the origin of each breed are discussed below. The Romanov breed  which is the only short-thin-tailed Russian coarse wool breed  was created by local farmers in the seventeenth century in the Yaroslavl region. Today  the Romanov breed is famous worldwide for its extraordinary prolificacy  early sexual maturity and out-of-season breeding ability []. Compared with the other coarse wool breeds  the Romanov breed clearly showed different ancestry  which was well demonstrated by the results at the local level (Figs.     and ). Neighbor-net (Fig. ) and admixture graphs (Fig. ) confirmed the North European genetic roots of the breed. Indeed  the Romanov breed clustered outside the other Russian coarse wool breeds and formed a group with the Finnsheep and Norwegian Spaelsau breeds (Fig. ). Romanov and Finnsheep are the most well known and numerous representatives of the Northern European short-tailed breeds [  ]. It is believed that Norse Vikings spread these northern sheep to several countries from the late eighth century to the middle of the eleventh century AD []. The patterns obtained at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5  6 and 7 (Fig. ) also suggested a common ancestry between Romanov and Finnsheep. However  at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>14 and higher  all breeds clearly differentiated from one another (Fig. ). Originating from the same ancient Nordic ancestor group  each breed (including Romanov) most likely formed their unique gene pool under different selection  geographical and feed conditions. Such interpretation is in agreement with historical records  which consider the Romanov an independent branch of the Northern European short-tailed breeds []. Neighbor-net and admixture graphs (Figs.   ) suggested a common ancestry between the fat-tailed Russian coarse wool breeds  Asian (Chinese and Indian)  and Southwestern Asian (Iran) sheep. The range of the fat-tailed and fat-rumped sheep overlaps with the European and Asian Russian territory  which was proposed to be the consequence of nomadic expansions including invasions and the intensive east–west trading via the Silk Road [    ]. Specifically  sheep from the Middle Eastern domestication center were brought to the Caucasus  the area east of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia  and finally arrived in North and Southwest China and the Indian subcontinent via the Mongolian Plateau region [  ]. Furthermore  the gene flow could have taken place through the major Turkic migrations and later Mongol invasions [  ]  which were accompanied by sheep flocks. Indeed  this may explain the admixture of Caucasian Mountain fat-tailed sheep and the Chinese breeds. The fat-tailed local sheep  Andean  Karachaev  Lezgin  and Tushin formed the Caucasian Mountain fat-tailed cluster. Sheep husbandry has always been of special value to the Russian south regions  especially in mountain regions  and it represents an inseparable part of the local cultural heritage. Andean  Karachaev  Lezgin  and Tushin sheep are versatile breeds that produce meat  wool and milk in equivalent proportions. These sheep easily withstand long marches over great distances and are highly adapted to grazing the mountain and lowland pastures. The wool is used for manufacturing felt shoes and fabrics to sew the traditional men’s clothing. All these breeds were created by folk selection practices during the nineteenth and twentieth century in different mountain parts of the North Caucasus [  ]. The second cluster of the fat-tailed local sheep included breeds with more significant Asian ancestry (China and Tibet): Kalmyk  Edilbai  Buubei and Tuva. The fat-rumped Edilbai and Kalmyk sheep combine high meat and grease productivity with excellent adaptability to year-round grazing in extreme semi-desert and desert climatic conditions []. Although the breeds are reared mostly in the southern part of Russia (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Table S1)  they are of Asian ancestry. Thus  the Edilbai breed was obtained by crossing Astrakhan rams with Kazakh fat-rumped ewes between the Ural River and the Volga River. The Kalmyk originated from indigenous fat-rumped sheep from China and improved with sheep from the Edilbai and Torgudsk breeds. The close relation between Edilbai and Kalmyk sheep was very well illustrated by the formation of a common branch in the neighbor-net (Fig. ) and by the low pairwise  value (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007)  (see Additional file 3 Table S3). The Buubei breed is the result of long-term improvement of the indigenous Buryat sheep. This breed is characterized by a high prolificacy and good adaptation to the severe climatic conditions of the Republic of Buryatia [  ]. In the middle of the twentieth century  the indigenous Buryat sheep had become extinct []. In the 1980s’  a small group of indigenous Buryat sheep was found in China and was later transported to their historic homeland. This is compatible with our findings that the Chinese genetic background significantly contributed to the Buubei breed. The ancient Tuva breed was raised under the harsh climate of the Republic of Tyva by local nomadic tribes approximately 2000 YA. These sheep can survive on small amounts of forage while accumulating body fat and they can take snow instead of water  which is an important advantage for surviving in steppe and mountain pastures. Their coarse wool  which is composed of down  guard and dead hair  is the feedstock for shoes and felt fabrics for traditional clothing []. The Republic of Tyva has a common border with Mongolia across which the gene flow with China could have taken place. Furthermore  both Buubei and Tuva are short fat-tailed and are very similar to Chinese breeds. A study of the demographic history of Chinese native sheep showed that the expansion of short-fat-tailed sheep into China was mainly associated with the invasions of Mongols  who reared the short-fat-tailed sheep  from the Mongolian Plateau during the twelvetieth and thirtieth centuries []. Consequently  the Buubei  Tuva and Chinese breeds probably share Mongolian ancestry. The position within the fat-tailed coarse wool group of the Russian Karakul breed is not perfectly clear. The local neighbor-net (Fig. ) suggested a closer relation with the Kalmyk  Edilbai and Tuva breeds. However  the global admixture results (Fig. ) showed significant co-ancestry between the Karakul and Iranian breeds  which is more consistent with the breed’s origin. The history of the creation of the Karakul breed is still in question and there are two main theories. Some scientists believe that the Karakul breed results from crossing the black indigenous sheep of Bukhara (Turkestan) with Afghan and native fat-rumped sheep []. Others assumed that the Arabs brought the ancestors of the Karakul breed to Middle Asia in the eighth century []. Both theories agree with our findings. The long-fat-tailed Kuchugur showed a pattern of admixture that was quite similar to that of the other fat-tailed Russian coarse wool breeds at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5  6  7 and 14 (Fig. ). However  Kuchugur appeared as an outlier according to the neighbor-net analyses (Figs.  and )  with a branch that is positioned between the Tsigai<U+2009>+<U+2009>Altai Mountain cluster (with lower genetic distance) and the fat-tailed local cluster. This most likely reflects the crossbred origin of the Kuchugur breed. It is assumed that the Kuchugur breed resulted from the cross of indigenous crossbred coarse wool ewes with large Voloshian (Valakhian) rams []. Furthermore  the lowest pairwise  value for the Kuchugur breed was detected with the Tsigai breed (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.068) (see Additional file : Table S3). Since both the Tsigai and Voloshian breeds originated in the Balkans  they are genetically close and have influenced many sheep breeds in Eastern Europe [   ]  which also confirms the European ancestry of Kuchugur. Moreover  historical records suggest that a foreign breed—most likely one of the English Longwool type—was used to improve the local crossbreds towards curly wool and good body conformation []. Analysis of the phylogeny of the Russian semi-fine wool breeds revealed several ancestry backgrounds. The local neighbor-net analysis indicated the presence of two main clusters of which one includes the Altai Mountain and Tsigai breeds and the other the Kuibyshev  North Caucasian and Russian Longhaired breeds. The history of the creation of these breeds’ provided insight into this differentiation. Both admixture patterns (Figs.   ) showed a common genetic background for the Tsigai and Altai Mountain breeds. The Roman origin of the Tsigai sheep and its subsequent spread in the Balkans was previously suggested [    ]. The history of the Russian Tsigai began when Transylvanian farmers brought Tsigai sheep from Romania to the former Russian Empire in 1914 [  ]. Since the establishment of the Tsigai herd book  this breed was kept pure. However  possible admixture with fine wool breeds could probably have taken place at the early stages of Tsigai breeding after the breed was imported to Russia. Unfortunately  no original Romanian Tsigai SNP data is available to better evaluate the relationship between Russian and Romanian Tsigai sheep. The Altai Mountain breed resulted from crossing local coarse wool sheep with the Groznensk breed  as confirmed by the admixture analysis (Figs.   ). Furthermore  the Tsigai breed was involved in the breeding process of the Altai Mountain breed during the period from 1945 to 1970 [  ]. Their common ancestry is illustrated by the MDS  admixture plots and neighbor-net analyses (Figs.    and )  and confirmed by the low pairwise  values (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013) (see Additional file : Table S3). The origin of the other semi-fine wool sheep was closely associated with the English long-wool breeds. Thus  the Kuibyshev breed was obtained from an ancestry that involved Romney Marsh rams []. At the first stages of the North Caucasian breed creation  both Romney Marsh and Lincoln rams were widely used. Because the Lincoln progeny showed higher growth rates and were characterized by a better external phenotype  only Lincoln rams were maintained in the breeding process [    ]. Nevertheless  due to the close genetic relatedness between North Caucasian and Kuibyshev sheep (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020)  we assume that the Romney Marsh genetic background is still present in the modern North Caucasian sheep. The shared ancestry of both breeds and Romney Marsh was identified by the admixture analysis (Fig. ). Interestingly  the neighbor-net analysis identified some genetic overlap between the North Caucasian and the Russian longhaired breeds (Fig. )  which is consistent with the origin of the Russian Longhaired breed that was created with the participation of Lincoln sheep (see Additional file : Table S1)  and by a relatively large Galway ancestry component  the Galway breed being a long-wool breed as the Lincoln breed (Fig. ). Finally  Kuchugur is believed to have been involved in the development of the Russian Longhaired breed []. Although  values between these breeds were significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.09)  the presence of the Kuchugur background was obvious in the Russian Longhaired at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>42 in the global admixture plot (Fig. ). Ciani et al. [] conducted a study that focused on the Merino influence on the development of new breeds distributed throughout the world; however  the Russian Merino-derived sheep breeds were not included in the analysis. In the former USSR  wool production was one of the most prioritized branches of animal husbandry. In this regard  the majority of Russian fine wool breeds were created between 1920 and 1980. Thus  most fine wool breeds (Groznensk  Stavropol  Soviet Merino and Salsk) result from the improvement of local fine wool Mazaev and Novocaucasian ewes with commercial rams that have a high wool productivity such as the Spanish Merino  French and American Rambouillet  and Merino Précoce breeds [    ]. The Manych Merino breed was developed from Stavropol ewes that were improved with Australian Merino rams []. The close genetic relationship between Manych Merino and Stavropol was evidenced by both by the neighbor-net analyses (Figs.  and )  and by their low  value (0.012) (see Additional file : Table S3). The Volgograd sheep resulted from a complex crossing that involved Groznensk rams [] as suggested by the results of the neighbor-net analysis (Fig. ) and the  value (0.018) (see Additional file : Table S3). Later  from 1990 to 2004  Australian Merino sheep were used to improve the quality of the wool of most of the Russian fine wool breeds []. However  the genetic background of the Dagestan Mountain and Baikal fine-fleeced breeds is clearly different to that of other local fine wool breeds (Fig. ). This could most likely be due to the fact that local crossbred coarse wool ewes  specifically Gunib for Dagestan Mountain sheep and Buryat-Mongolian for Baikal fine-fleeced sheep  were used instead of Mazaev and Novocaucasian Merino sheep []. Nonetheless  an authentic Russian origin of the fine- and semi-fine-wool sheep is indicated by the K<U+2009>=<U+2009>42 pattern of the global admixture plot (Fig. )  in which these breeds share a (violet) ancestral component that is not present in any other breed. In this study  we investigated the genome-wide diversity and population structure of 25 Russian local sheep breeds for the first time. We identified three clusters corresponding to the wool type. We identified a main discriminating factor within the Russian coarse wool cluster i.e. tail type  with the short-thin-tailed Romanov breed clearly differentiated from the other fat-tailed or fat-rumped breeds. The combination of local Russian sheep data with a worldwide sheep SNP genotyping set provided admixture patterns that gave deeper insights into the origin of the local Russian sheep. Thus  our findings suggest shared ancestry of local fat-tailed coarse wool breeds and Southwestern Asian (Iran) sheep  which may be a consequence of nomadic migrations  including invasions and east–west trading. Although co-ancestry between the Romanov breed and the Northern short-tailed group was clearly confirmed  we also noted that this breed is genetically distinct  which may be clarified by future studies using a larger sample size  denser SNP panels or whole-genome sequencing. The computation of the most recent effective population sizes revealed a few local breeds with critically small values that constitute a warning flag for the implementation of conservation efforts (e.g. the Kuchugur breed). This study is the first step to design a more effective selection and conservation program for Russian local sheep breeds based on whole-genome SNP genotyping data. This is essential for sustainable sheep breeding at the global level and for the future prosperity of sheep breeding at the local level across Russia.

The objective of this study was to improve prediction of the horned and polled phenotypes using horn scores classified as polled  scurs  knobs or horns. Derived phenotypes polled/non-polled (P/NP) and horned/non-horned (H/NH) were used to test four different strategies for prediction in 4001 purebred Merino sheep. These strategies include the use of single ‘single nucleotide polymorphism’ (SNP) genotypes  multiple-SNP haplotypes  genome-wide and chromosome-wide genomic best linear unbiased prediction and information from imputed sequence variants from the region including the  gene. Low-density genotypes of these animals were imputed to the Illumina Ovine high-density (600k) chip and the 1.78-kb insertion polymorphism in  was included in the imputation process to whole-genome sequence. We evaluated the mode of inheritance and validated models by a fivefold cross-validation and across- and between-family prediction.ResultsThe most significant SNPs for prediction of P/NP and H/NH were OAR10_29546872.1 and OAR10_29458450  respectively  located on chromosome 10 close to the 1.78-kb insertion at 29.5 Mb. The mode of inheritance included an additive effect and a sex-dependent effect for dominance for P/NP and a sex-dependent additive and dominance effect for H/NH. Models with the highest prediction accuracies for H/NH used either single SNPs or 3-SNP haplotypes and included a polygenic effect estimated based on traditional pedigree relationships. Prediction accuracies for H/NH were 0.323 for females and 0.725 for males. For predicting P/NP  the best models were the same as for H/NH but included a genomic relationship matrix with accuracies of 0.713 for females and 0.620 for males.ConclusionsOur results show that prediction accuracy is high using a single SNP  but does not reach 1 since the causative mutation is not genotyped. Incomplete penetrance or allelic heterogeneity  which can influence expression of the phenotype  may explain why prediction accuracy did not approach 1 with any of the genetic models tested here. Nevertheless  a breeding program to eradicate horns from Merino sheep can be effective by selecting genotypes  of SNP OAR10_29458450 or  of SNP OAR10_29546872.1 since all sheep with these genotypes will be non-horned."

The most significant SNPs for prediction of P/NP and H/NH were OAR10_29546872.1 and OAR10_29458450  respectively  located on chromosome 10 close to the 1.78-kb insertion at 29.5 Mb. The mode of inheritance included an additive effect and a sex-dependent effect for dominance for P/NP and a sex-dependent additive and dominance effect for H/NH. Models with the highest prediction accuracies for H/NH used either single SNPs or 3-SNP haplotypes and included a polygenic effect estimated based on traditional pedigree relationships. Prediction accuracies for H/NH were 0.323 for females and 0.725 for males. For predicting P/NP  the best models were the same as for H/NH but included a genomic relationship matrix with accuracies of 0.713 for females and 0.620 for males. Our results show that prediction accuracy is high using a single SNP  but does not reach 1 since the causative mutation is not genotyped. Incomplete penetrance or allelic heterogeneity  which can influence expression of the phenotype  may explain why prediction accuracy did not approach 1 with any of the genetic models tested here. Nevertheless  a breeding program to eradicate horns from Merino sheep can be effective by selecting genotypes  of SNP OAR10_29458450 or  of SNP OAR10_29546872.1 since all sheep with these genotypes will be non-horned. Breeding for polled animals is a long-standing issue in horned species such as cattle  sheep and goats [  ] and analyzing its underlying genetic mechanism is interesting from both a breeding perspective and evolutionary perspective. In natural populations of ruminants  the occurrence of horns serves two major purposes. First  they help an animal to defend itself from predators  and second  horns are important to determine dominance between males and gain access to females. For farmers  the foremost reason to favour polled animals is that horned animals can pose a physical security risk to the farmer  but can also cause injury to other livestock  which results in downgrading of meat due to bruising. Breeding practices can reduce or completely remove the occurrence of horned animals from the population. In cattle  sheep and goats  several studies have attempted to describe the genetic mechanism that underlies the horned phenotype. In cattle  the most common mutation for the polled phenotype is mapped to the proximal end of bovine chromosome 1  where different genomic variants are described as causative (insertion  duplication  and haplotypes) in different European breeds [  ]. Also overexpression of the  and  transcripts in horn buds has been reported in cattle []  which are genes known to affect or potentially affect horn formation in sheep and goats. In goats  an 11.7-kb deletion located on chromosome 1 was identified as the causative mutation for the polled intersex syndrome (PIS)  this deletion also affecting the transcription of two flanking genes   and a non-coding RNA []. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for polledness in sheep has been mapped to chromosome OAR10 (OAR for ) []. Wiedemar and Drögemüller [] provided evidence that a 1.78-kb insertion in the 3'-untranslated region of the  gene causes a polled phenotype in sheep. However  Lühken et al. [] showed that this insertion does not completely explain the polled phenotype in various sheep breeds. The mode of inheritance of polledness is complex since expression of this phenotype differs between sexes and because no single-locus model with complete penetrance can explain the phenotypic variation both within and across breeds. Moreover  this issue is complicated by the existence of intermediate phenotypes such as knobs and scurs. A knob is a hard bony lump at the horn site which may have a horny cap  generally less than 2.5 cm long  and a scur is a horny growth  irregular in shape and smaller than a true horn []. In addition after castration of rams  the development of the horn is stopped or reduced []  which makes accurate collection of horn scores more difficult. Breeding strategies have been developed to increase polledness in several sheep breeding programs. Selection on polledness in both males and females (without the presence of genomic data) has been successful and resulted in polled breeds such as the polled Merino and Poll Dorset. With the availability of genomic data  it should be possible to optimize selection for polledness. A clear difference in allele frequency between polled and horned breeds is observed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are closely linked to the 1.78-kb insertion on OAR10 []. Currently  two such SNPs are used by the Australian sheep CRC to predict the phenotype i.e. OAR10_29546872.1 and OAR10_29389966_X.1. These SNPs were chosen from the Illumina Ovine 50k SNP chip  based on their significant association with polled phenotypes in Australian data from the CRC Information Nucleus Flock [] and the Sheep Genomics Flock []  respectively. SNPs that are located near the 1.78-kb insertion in the  gene are not present on the Illumina Ovine 50k chip or the OvineHD 600k chip  but four such SNPs have been included in the Illumina 15k Ovine array that was released in 2016. Currently  prediction accuracy of the horned phenotype is not equal to 1  because the predictive SNP is not in full linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the 1.78-kb insertion  or penetrance is incomplete  or because of epistasis  i.e. interaction between two or more genes. Recently  whole-genome sequence data of 726 European sheep from various breeds have become available. Thus  imputation of the 1.78-kb insertion into the Merino population could provide a better predictor than the current SNPs used for prediction. To further investigate the genetic architecture of the polled and horned phenotypes  we compared models that fit the effects of all SNPs as random effects with the same a priori distribution (genomic best linear unbiased prediction; GBLUP) and the effects of the most predictive SNPs as fixed effects  in order to estimate the variance explained by all SNPs genome wide  conditional on the genotypes of the most predictive SNPs in the  region. In this study  we evaluated various strategies for predicting horned or polled phenotypes in 4001 purebred Merino sheep  which include the use of single-SNP genotypes  multiple-SNP haplotypes  genome-wide and chromosome-wide GBLUP and information from structural variants in the  region imputed to sequence level. Data were extracted from two research datasets known as the Information Nucleus Flock (INF []) and the Sheep Genomics Flock (SGF []) and consisted of purebred Merino sheep that represented both polled Merino and Merino subtypes. For the analyses  we used 4001 sheep  which were born between 2007 and 2011 and distributed among eight flocks. These sheep originated from 182 sires  which had between one and 51 offspring with dams that had on average 1.5 offspring present in the dataset. The phenotypes polled  scurs  knobs or horns were recorded. Analysis was performed on two binomial traits that were classified as polled/non-polled (P/NP) and horned/non-horned (H/NH). Table  shows the distribution of the polled and horned status between females and wethers (since all male sheep were castrated before horn scoring). Horn scoring was done around three to six months after marking. The frequency of horns was much lower in Merino sheep registered as ‘polled’. Sheep registered as ‘polled’ represented 40% of the data and included 6% horned  56% polled and 38% sheep with scurs or knobs. Merino sheep not registered as ‘polled’ (60% of the data) included 22% horned  25% polled and 53% scurs or knobs. Of the 4001 animals  3708 were genotyped with the OvineSNP50k BeadChip and the remaining 293 were genotyped with the Illumina-Ovine 12k SNP chip. Four hundred and forty-five animals were also genotyped with the Illumina Ovine HD (600k) (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA). Quality controls for each SNP chip were the same: SNP genotype records were removed if the call rate was less than 90%  if the GC (GenCal) score was less than 0.6  if deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<U+03C7><U+2009>><U+2009>600) was strong  and if the minor allele frequency (MAF) was lower than 0.01. In addition  only autosomal SNPs were used for imputation. Finally  11 377  48 559 and 510 174 SNPs remained for the 12k  50k and HD SNP chips  respectively. The 12k genotypes were imputed up to 50k using the Beagle software v3.2 [] and the 50k genotypes were imputed up to HD using FImpute v2.2 []. For both programs  default settings were used. In both imputation steps  all available genotyped animals from INF and the Sheep Genomics Flock were used  to increase imputation accuracy (22 684 animals for the 50k and 2450 for the HD chip). Accuracy of imputation was tested elsewhere [  ] and was generally high (on average a correlation of 0.98). Four different methods were applied to predict the P/NP and H/NH phenotypes. In method (1)  we used a single-SNP genotype to predict the phenotype. To select the best SNP  we ran an association study for all SNPs on OAR10 by fitting each SNP as a covariate. Each single-SNP genotype was either fitted as a single predictor variable (base model)  or was fitted jointly with a polygenic effect. This polygenic effect was assumed to be normally distributed with a covariance structure that was proportional to either the numeral relationships expected based on pedigree information or a structure described by a genomic relationship matrix (GRM). To account for the binomial nature of the response variables  we used logistic regression with the statistical package ASReml v4 []. In method (2)  we used multiple SNPs to predict the phenotype. A haplotype was formed using the most significant SNPs from the single-SNP GWAS using either three  five or ten SNPs. The three haplotypes covered a region of 5  55 or 125 kb both up- and downstream of the 1.78-kb insertion in the  gene. Haplotypes were formed after phasing the genotyping data using EAGLE v1.0 []. Each animal has either no  one or two copies of the available haplotypes. For haplotypes with a frequency lower than 2%  we used one class of residual haplotypes. The number of unique haplotypes found for combinations of three  five or ten SNPs  were equal to 3  3  and 7  respectively. This limited number of haplotypes for each SNP combination reflects the high LD between the SNPs used. Haplotypes were fitted as random effects  jointly with a polygenic effect (either through a numerator relationship matrix or a GRM). Method (3) applies a GBLUP analysis using a GRM [] based on either all SNPs from the HD chip or only the SNPs located on OAR10. In addition  a dominance relationship matrix was added to the model [] based on these same sets of SNPs using the GCTA package []. The statistical software package MTG2 v2.06 [] was used to predict additive genetic and dominance effects. From the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) and dominance genetic values of the animals in the reference set  effects of SNPs were back-solved based on their genotypes  and these SNP solutions were used to estimate the breeding values of the validation animals. Additive and dominance effects were summed across all SNPs to obtain the predicted phenotype. In method (4)  we tried to identify the 1.78-kb insertion described by Wiedemar and Drögemüller [] based on whole-genome sequence data from 122 Merino sheep sequenced by the SheepCRC project and we imputed this structural variant in the studied population. Whole-genome sequence fastq reads were quality-controlled and aligned with BWA mem as described in Daetwyler et al. []. The reference whole-genome sequence in sheep (OAR3.1) was obtained from a polled Texel animal that carries the 1.78-kb insertion. To detect this variant that predicts horned animals  we used two software programs that are suitable for detecting large deletions  i.e. Pindel v0.2.5b9 [] and Breakdancer v1.1.2 []. We ran both programs using the bam files from each of the 122 sequenced Merino sheep. These 122 animals did not have phenotype records and therefore did not overlap with the 4001 Merinos used in this study although they were related to them. The Pindel package uses split-read approaches to identify large deletions. Breakdancer uses discordant paired reads and incorporates the coverage of the reads and the size of the region defined by the discordant pairs into a confidence score. Both programs were run with default settings to call structural variants. Consensus between Pindel and Breakdancer was required to call the 1.78-kb insertion reported by Wiedemar and Drögemüller []. Pindel can detect whether an individual carries no  one or two insertions  while Breakdancer only detects the presence of the insertion. Seventy-four animals  which were concordant between Breakdancer and Pindel  were used for imputing the 1.78-kb insertion in the population of 4001 Merino sheep using EAGLE v1.0 for phasing [] and Minimac3 [] for imputation. Forty-seven animals were homozygous for the insertion  10 were heterozygous and 17 were homozygous for absence of the insertion. We compared various models to investigate the mode of inheritance (effect of dominance and sex) of the polled and horned phenotypes fitting a single SNP (fitted as random effect): where  is a vector of length N (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>4001) with phenotypic observations for all animals   is the intercept   is the incidence matrix relating observations to an individuals’ polygenic effects   is the vector of polygenic breeding values [   is a vector of length N with genotypes for SNP  coded as 0  1 or 2 representing the three classes of genotypes   is the random allele substitution effect at SNP   for which the most significant SNP from the GWAS was used and  is a vector of residuals. In Model 2  a dominance effect was fitted where  is a vector of length N with heterozygous animals at SNP  coded as 1 and homozygous animals as 0  and  being the random dominance effect at SNP . Model 1 was the null model  in which the SNP was fitted as an additive effect. Model 2 included both an additive and dominance effect for the SNP. An interaction term with sex (wether or female) was included in Models 3  4 and 5 for the additive  or dominance  or both effects  respectively. Models were compared based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC []). We compared the difference in AIC value (<U+0394>AIC) between models. Model 1 was the null model: fitting an additive effect only. The more the AIC is negative  the better is the model fit. The model  which had the best fit (i.e. the lowest AIC)  was used for further analyses. The models described here (1–5) did not allow for incomplete penetrance. A fivefold cross-validation was repeated five times to compare prediction accuracy of the five models. Prediction accuracy was defined as the Pearson correlation between the predicted phenotype in the test set and the binomial traits P/NP or H/NH. The mean of accuracy and the standard deviation across folds are reported. P/NP and H/NH may not represent fully monogenic traits and we wanted to further investigate the inheritance pattern of these traits. Therefore  we applied another validation strategy that contrasted the use of family information versus no family information in predicting phenotype. The dataset was split by using two different approaches. First  within-family prediction was estimated by using phenotypic data from approximately half of the animals in each half-sib family to predict the phenotypes of the other half of the animals (intra-family comparison). Second  across-family prediction was estimated by using phenotypic data from approximately half of the families to predict the phenotypes of the animals in the other half of the families (inter-family comparison). Sires with more than 13 offspring were selected for family validation. One hundred and thirty-eight sire families and 3671 sheep were used for this validation. The mean of accuracy (Pearson’s correlation) and standard error across a fivefold validation are reported. The local association study for P/NP and H/NH clearly confirmed that the  region is significantly associated with the phenotypes and identified highly significant SNPs at about 29.5 Mb on OAR10 (Fig. ). The most significant SNP for polled was OAR10_29546872.1 (-<U+2009>log(-value)<U+2009>=<U+2009>126)  which differed from the most significant SNP for horned  i.e. OAR10_29458450 (-<U+2009>log(-value)<U+2009>=<U+2009>51)  although both SNPs are close to each other (0.5 Mb apart  located upstream of the insertion) and in high LD (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.985). Both SNPs always ranked as number 1 or 2 in terms of significance level  and were used to test the accuracy of prediction for the single SNP analyses. The region around the 1.78-kb insertion also contained other significantly associated SNPs  e.g. in the region between 29 and 30 Mb  the average -<U+2009>log(-value) across all 228 SNPs was equal to 24 for P/NP and 11 for H/NH. Note that  in general  -values less significant for the H/NH phenotype because the frequency of horned phenotypes in the dataset was low  especially in females (Table )  which resulted in less power to detect SNP effects. Both SNPs were present on the Illumina Ovine HD chip and SNP OAR10_29546872.1 was also present on the OvineSNP50k chip. Local genome-wide association plot for the traits  polled/non-polled and  horned/non-horned of OAR10. The grey rectangle indicates the location of the  gene (29.4–29.5 Mb). The most significant SNP is indicated in red with its name In Tables  and   the proportions of genotypes for the most significant SNP for phenotypes P/NP and H/NH are provided for each sex. All males and females  except one that had genotype 2 for SNP OAR10_29458450  were non-horned (Table ) although not all are polled (84% of females and 78% of males were polled). The probability of each genotype to carry a particular phenotype was derived simply from the mean of the binary trait for that class of genotypes. The probability of an animal with genotype 0 to be horned is less than 1  and this probability is especially low in females (0.07) compared to males (0.67). Table  shows the results for the mode of inheritance for P/NP and H/NH. For P/NP  the best model included an additive and sex-dependent effect for dominance. For H/NH  the best model included sex-dependent additive and dominance effects (i.e. a sex-by-gene interaction). Figure  shows the degree of dominance per sex for P/NP and H/NH. H/NH showed complete dominance in males  whereas P/NP showed incomplete dominance in males and females. Degree of dominance per sex.  Degree of dominance for polled/non-polled. Non-polled is coded as 1 and polled as 0. The dotted line indicates an additive model  where the solid line includes dominance (best fitted model). The lines for females and males are blue and red  respectively.  Degree of dominance for horned/non-horned. Horned is coded as 1 and non-horned as 0. The dotted line indicates an additive model  where the solid line includes dominance (best fitted model). The lines and males are blue and red  respectively Mean prediction accuracies and standard deviations across the five replicates and fivefold validation are in Table  for H/NH and in Table  for P/NP. Prediction using single-SNP models without additional family information (via either pedigree or genomic relationships) resulted in accuracies for P/NP equal to 0.547 and 0.642  in males and females  respectively. For H/NH  the accuracy was much lower in females (0.155) and higher in males (0.714). Adding pedigree relationships in the model led to a substantial increase in prediction accuracy for H/NH in females (0.323)  whereas for P/NP  the increase was small i.e. 0.582 and 0.671 in males and females  respectively. Replacing the numerator matrix with a GRM increased accuracies mainly for P/NP  i.e. 0.620 in males and 0.713 in females. A similar increase was not observed for H/NH (accuracies of 0.723 and 0.303 in males and females  respectively). The methods using haplotypes from multiple SNPs (three  five or ten SNPs) did not increase prediction accuracies substantially  compared to single-SNP prediction models. For example  prediction accuracies for P/NP in males using three  five or ten SNP-haplotypes and using a GRM were equal to 0.714  0.716 and 0.700  respectively  compared to 0.713 when using a single-SNP haplotype. Creating a haplotype from more than five SNPs even decreased prediction accuracy (not significant). Method (3) used the sum of two GRM (matrix  for additive and matrix  for dominance) based on either all SNPs across all chromosomes or SNPs on OAR10 only. The prediction accuracies using SNPs on OAR10 only were similar to those obtained by fitting a single SNP for P/NP. For example  prediction accuracy for P/NP in females was equal to 0.640 when the  model based on SNPs of OAR10 was used compared to 0.642 when the single SNP model was used. The accuracies obtained with the  model were lower for H/NH in males compared to those obtained with single-SNP or multiple-SNP haplotypes (0.597 for OAR10 vs. 0.714 using single-SNP haplotype). In general  the  model based on all chromosomes resulted in lower prediction accuracies than fitting only the SNPs on OAR10. Method (54) used the imputed insertion for prediction. This insertion was fitted as a single SNP (coded as 0  1 or 2) and modeled according to the model with the best mode of inheritance [Table   Model (4) for P/NP and Model (5) for H/NH)]. This method gave a low prediction accuracy for P/NP  i.e. 0.571 versus 0.671 in females and 0.483 versus 0.584 in males. All models included a polygenic effect based on pedigree relationships. We obtained similar results for H/NH. When using both the 1.78-kb insertion and the single-SNP  prediction accuracies were very similar to using only the best single SNP for P/NP and H/NH. The results for across- and within-family prediction are in Table . The model including a single-SNP gave the highest correlations compared to using BLUP (by fitting pedigree only) both for across- and within-family prediction. No differences between the correlations for across- and within-family prediction were observed with the  model (excluding the prediction accuracy for horned females). Although prediction accuracies in across- and within-family comparisons were quite similar  standard errors (SE) on the estimated correlations were higher for the across-family predictions. For example  within-family prediction for females for P/NP using pedigree information had a SE of only 0.013 compared to 0.10 for across-family prediction. Fitting a single SNP greatly reduced the SE of the correlation to values of 0.01 and 0.004 for across- and within-family prediction. The most significant SNPs for P/NP and H/NH  i.e. OAR10_29546872.1: 29512572 and OAR10_29458450: 29458450  respectively  were very close to the 1.78-kb insertion in the  gene (at position 29456047 through 29457881 on OAR10). OAR10_29546872.1 has been used by the Australian Sheep CRC since 2012 as the main predictive SNP for the polled phenotype in Merino sheep (J. van der Werf  personal communication)  with OAR10_29389966_X.1 (reported by Dominik et al. []) as a second predictive genotype (in case of a failed genotype with the first SNP). This OAR10_29389966_X.1 SNP was also in the top 10 most significant SNPs in the GWAS of our study. The SNP reported by Johnston et al. [] (OAR10_29448537.1: 29415140) was not included in the top 100 SNPs of our GWAS. SNP OAR10_29448537.1 is located upstream and SNP OAR10_29546872.1 downstream of the 1.78-kb insertion. In our population  SNP OAR10_29448537.1 had a higher MAF (0.46) than the other two SNPs i.e. 0.30 and 0.29 for OAR10_29458450 and OAR10_29546872.1  respectively. The difference in significance between the SNP reported by Johnston et al. [] and the most significant SNP in our study is also reflected in the squared correlation r of 0.19 between OAR10_29448537.1 and OAR10_29546872.1. The difference in allele frequency and LD patterns can result in the selection of other SNPs for genomic prediction between studies in different populations. In the literature  different modes of inheritance have been discussed for the polled phenotype in sheep. Differences in the effects of horned and polled alleles for males and females were already suggested by Wood in the 1900s [] and Dolling in the 1960s specifically for Merino sheep [  ]. Johnston et al. [] suggested that the mode of inheritance of horns was dominant in males and additive in females  but could not rule out the possibility that other genetic regions may explain the remaining polygenic variation in horn phenotype. Dominik et al. [] suggested a dominant maternal imprinted effect both in males and females. Recently  Lühken et al. [] discussed the inheritance of the insertion at the 3'UTR of  in many breeds with a variety of horn status. Inconsistent results with the insertion are observed mainly for sheep breeds with sex-dependent or variable horn status. In wild Bighorn sheep  a significant sex<U+2009>*<U+2009>QTL interaction was observed for two horn traits that are co-located on OAR10 []. In Merino sheep  horn status is sex-dependent  and the occurrence of scurs and knobs is observed especially in females. Our results indicate that the degree of dominance differs between P/NP and H/NH (Fig. ). Figure  shows the predicted phenotype given its genotype class by including dominance or assuming additivity only. H/NH showed complete dominance in males whereas P/NP showed incomplete dominance in males and females. The effect of sex on P/NP is not large (both show incomplete dominance)  on the contrary  Merino females hardly have horns which makes prediction for H/NH in females difficult (Table  and Fig. ). Our findings confirm the importance of dominance in both males and females  but do not confirm any maternal imprinted effect (results not shown). This is the first study to show statistical evidence for sex-dependent differences in the additive and dominance effects for horned and polled phenotypes. In this section  we discuss three different observations from our study. First  we discuss the importance of a model that explicitly includes SNPs with large effects on the trait  then the genetic architecture of the polled and horned phenotype and the influence of genes outside the  region  and finally the importance of identifying the 1.78-kb insertion for an accurate prediction. The four methods used to predict polled and horned phenotypes were evaluated based on the correlation between phenotype and predicted phenotype from a fivefold validation. The method with the lowest correlation was GBLUP and the method with the highest correlation was a single-SNP model or a model that fits a haplotype with three highly significant SNPs. When the single-SNP was not explicitly fitted such as in the GBLUP model  prediction accuracy decreased (for H/NH in males  and P/NP in males and females)  indicating the importance of explicitly fitting highly significant SNPs close to the known causative mutation. Applying the GBLUP method  which shrinks all SNP effects equally  will result in a lower prediction accuracy in the presence of a large QTL. Similar results were described by Lee et al. [] who analyzed coat colour in mice  which is affected by a number of known causal loci with large effects. Similar results were also observed in dairy cattle for the  gene that has a large effect on milk fat percentage. Bayesian methods  which select fewer relevant SNPs compared to GBLUP and allow these to explain more variation  outperformed GBLUP in prediction accuracy [  ]. Also a study in pigs in which a large QTL for number of teats in pigs was explicitly fitted  resulted in increased accuracy of prediction []. For the prediction of both horned and polled phenotypes  including a polygenic effect in the model achieved better prediction accuracies compared to using only a single SNP  with little difference between modeling the polygenic covariance structure via pedigree-based relationships versus genomic relationships. The variance explained by models including a polygenic effect was larger than that explained by models without pedigree information. For the horned trait  variance components of the model indicated that 70% of the phenotypic variance was explained by a single SNP  and this figure increased to 78% when pedigree was also included. Heritability estimated for H/NH on the underlying scale (using the numerator relationship matrix) without fitting the significant SNP was equal to 0.40 and dropped to 0.06 when fitting the significant SNP as a fixed effect (i.e. it was excluded from the genetic variance). For the polled trait  51% of the phenotypic variance was explained by a single SNP and 70% of the phenotypic variance when pedigree was also included. Heritability estimated for P/NP on the underlying scale (using the numerator relationship matrix) without fitting the significant SNP was equal to 0.60 and dropped to 0.13 when fitting the significant SNP as a fixed effect. These results indicate that the single SNP does not explain all the genetic variance. However  prediction of non-horned sheep is 100% accurate in males when selecting for the  genotype of SNP OAR10_29458450  and almost perfect in females (one  genotyped female was horned). Although selection against horns can be successful  other forms of horns will still exist such as knobs and scurs. The potential influence of other genes outside the  region was further investigated via within- and across-family validation. Polygenic traits such as milk production or growth tend to show a pattern in which across-family prediction is lower than within-family prediction. Assuming that non-genetic effects (e.g. common environment) are correctly taken into account and that other effects due to population structure such as genetic groups are accounted for  within-family prediction uses both linkage and LD information for prediction  whereas across-family prediction can only depend on LD []. In our study  differences between across- and within-family predictions were small (Table )  which clearly shows that the effect of other genes  captured by the polygenic effect  was not strong for the polled and horned phenotypes []. Alternatively  to show the potential influence of other genes  the significant SNP (OAR10_29546872.1 or OAR10_29458450) can be fitted as a fixed effect and then the GWAS is run across all remaining SNPs. None of the GWA plots showed clear and consistent significant associations (see Additional file : Figure S1). In addition  we detected no other significant regions outside the  region when sheep with knobs and scurs were tested against horned sheep in the GWAS (see Additional file : Figure S2)  which indicates that the trait is not polygenic and the majority of the variation is determined by the  region. In this study  imputation of the 1.78-kb insertion within the  gene [] did not result in better prediction accuracies. The most likely reason for the lower prediction accuracy is that none of the animals in this study were sequenced and  thus the insertion was not detected directly on the animal itself but rather obtained through imputation. The accuracy of imputation could have been a limiting factor for not reaching a better prediction accuracy. Estimated LD between the insertion and the most significant SNP (OAR10_29546872.1) was estimated at 0.46 for the imputed dataset (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>4001) and 0.49 for the sequenced dataset (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>72). Even lower LD estimates of 0.194 were found between the insertion and SNP OAR10_29511510.1 (position 29 476 678) for sheep breeds with a variable horn status []. Estimates of LD for polled or horned breeds were much higher (0.635). Low LD between SNPs up- and downstream of the 1.78-kb insertion will result in lower imputation accuracy for the insertion. However  even if the insertion is correctly identified  horned and polled phenotypes are expected not to be 100% accurately predicted. Incomplete penetrance  allelic heterogeneity or other (environmental) interactions could cause variability in the horn status within genotype. Our findings suggest that prediction of polled and horned phenotypes based on DNA polymorphisms is not 100% accurate. However  prediction of horn status based on predictive single SNPs provides close to maximum accuracy and can be used succesfully in sheep breeding programs to reduce the frequency of horned phenotypes. Implementation into a breeding program including a cost–benefit analysis is discussed (Granleese T  Clark SA  Duijvesteijn N  Bradley PE and van der Werf JHJ: Strategies and cost–benefit of selecting for a polled sheep nucleus using DNA testing  submitted). An important factor for a successful breeding program is to ensure accurate phenotype recording. Although the trait seems simple  classifying between horns  scurs  knobs or polled is still a challenge especially with the interference due to castration of males. Clear guidelines for such recording are necessary to improve the overall prediction of horned and polled phenotypes. Recently  a new SNP chip (15k) was developed  which includes SNPs present in the 1.78-kb insertion. Currently  the number of phenotypes and genotypes is not sufficient to evaluate the accuracy of prediction based on these SNPs  although the expectation is that these SNPs could increase the prediction accuracy even more. The mode of inheritance for polled and horned phenotypes is sex-dependent. Horned vs. non-horned and polled vs. non-polled in males both show an additive and dominance effect  whereas non-horned is dominant. Prediction of horned females is difficult since this phenotype is rare and no genetic model is clearly favourable  while polled vs. non-polled shows a similar mode of inheritance in females and males (additive<U+2009>+<U+2009>dominance  and polled is dominant). Prediction of polled and horned phenotypes when using a single SNP gives an accuracy of ~<U+2009>0.7. Prediction accuracy is not 100% since the causative mutation was not genotyped  and the model of inheritance is not completely known yet  e.g. incomplete penetrance  allelic heterogeneity or other (environmental) interactions can cause variability of prediction within genotypes. Neither the models including more SNPs by forming haplotypes  nor those fitting a GRM and dominance matrix based on all SNPs (whole genome and OAR10 only) resulted in higher prediction accuracies. Addition of pedigree information via a numerator relationship matrix or a GRM to a single SNP model did result in an increased accuracy  but only in a slight one. However  interaction with or effects of genes outside the  region were not detected. Nevertheless  a breeding program aimed at eredicating horns from Merino sheep by selection on genotype  of SNP OAR10_29458450 or genotype  of SNP OAR10_29546872.1 (all non-horned) could be successful.

Our results demonstrated that the accuracy of across-breed GP can be improved by using markers that are pre-selected from WGS based on their potential causal effect. We also showed that simply increasing the number of markers up to the WGS level does not increase the accuracy of across-breed prediction  even when markers that are expected to have a causal effect are included. Genomic prediction (GP) has become a routine procedure in livestock breeding schemes [  ]  and its adoption has resulted in a significant increase in the rate of genetic gain. This is especially evident in dairy cattle  where its application has led to a doubling of the rate of genetic gain []  as compared to the traditional progeny-testing scheme. Genomic prediction has been very successful mainly because it enables the estimation of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for young bulls  thereby drastically reducing the generation interval. This method has been implemented mainly for within-breed genetic evaluation for which both the reference and the validation sets come from the same breed. The use of the effect of markers that are trained in one breed to obtain GEBV for animals from a different breed  a method called across-breed GP has been rather unsuccessful. Reported accuracies for across-breed GP using the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model are clustered around 0 [   ]  except in rare cases in which the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie the trait are known and information about these QTL is used in the prediction model [  ]. The poor performance of across-breed GP could be due to a number of reasons  some of which include differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) phase between markers and QTL across breeds  QTL segregating in only one breed and not the other  differences in minor allele frequencies (MAF) and allele substitution effects due to the different genetic background of the breeds [  ]. An earlier hypothesis was that accuracies of across-breed prediction increase when higher density marker panels are used e.g.  De Roos et al. []. An important question in this regard is how much gain in accuracy of across-breed prediction can be achieved if whole-genome sequence (WGS) markers are used instead of the lower density marker panels. Given that multi-locus LD across breeds is conserved only over short distances []  the expectation is that for a large proportion of the markers  LD with causal loci changes across breeds  thus they become independent of the causal loci. Our hypothesis is that independent  non-causal markers from WGS data exhibit a dilution effect on accuracy of across-breed prediction. In other words  these markers have no explanatory value and only serve as additional sources of noise in prediction models  which in turn negatively impact the accuracy of predicting GEBV across breeds. For example  in their simulation study  Wientjes et al. [] obtained an increase in the accuracy of across-breed GP of approximately 53% by selecting only the markers that surround the causal mutations rather than using all those available  effectively eliminating the non-causal markers that are not in LD with the causal loci. Similar results were obtained by Van den Berg et al. []. To fully use WGS data for across-breed GP  it may become necessary to first pre-select markers with a potential causal effect on the trait of interest and use only these for prediction. Thus  our objective was to investigate the effect of using WGS data instead of the lower density marker panels on the accuracy of across-breed genomic prediction. In addition  we assessed the importance of pre-selecting markers  using the significance and the conditional and joint (COJO) effects of markers in a meta-GWAS as selection criteria. We investigated this objective using 595 New Zealand Jersey and 957 New Zealand Holstein bulls  as well as 5553 Dutch Holstein bulls  all of which had deregressed proofs (DRP) for stature and bovine HD genotypes that were imputed to WGS. Stature was used as a model trait in all analyses. Estimated breeding values (EBV) and number of daughters were available for 735 Jersey (NZJ) and 1239 Holstein (NZH) bulls from New Zealand and 5553 Dutch Holstein (DH) bulls. Data were provided by CRV BV (Cooperative Cattle Improvement Organization  Arnhem  the Netherlands). The EBV for stature for all bulls were deregressed to obtain deregressed proof (DRP) using the iterative procedure described in Calus et al. []. This approach  called matrix deregression corrects for information of the parents of an individual on its EBV and shrinkage to the mean. To avoid double-counting of information  matrix deregression also corrects for information of other relatives that are included in the same reference population as the individual whose EBV is being deregressed. The output from this procedure were the DRP and deregressed effective daughter contributions (EDC). Animals with deregressed EDC of 0 were removed  resulting in 595 NZJ  957 NZH and 5553 DH bulls in the final dataset. Deregressed EDC were used as weights for the DRP in subsequent analyses. For the DH set  the mean EDC was equal to 52  while for the NZH and NZJ sets  it was equal to16 and 17  respectively. The set of DH individuals included in the meta-GWAS of Bouwman et al. [] was the exact same set of DH individuals used in our study. The bulls were either genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip (HD; 734 403 SNPs; Illumina Inc.  San Diego  USA)  or with a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip and imputed to HD. The HD genotypes were subsequently imputed up to WGS using the sequenced population from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project Run 4 as reference population. This multi-breed reference population contained 1147 sequenced animals with on average 11-fold coverage. The reference population contained 311 Holstein and 61 Jersey animals  but all individuals were used as reference because earlier studies showed that a multi-breed sequenced reference population can be beneficial for imputation accuracy  especially for SNPs with a low minor allele frequency (MAF) [  ]. Polymorphic sites  including SNPs and short insertions and deletions (indels) were identified in the 1147 individuals simultaneously as described in Daetwyler et al. []. The genotype calls of the 1000 bull genomes reference population were improved with BEAGLE 4.0 []. The sequence data contained 30 339 468 bi-allelic markers (SNPs and indels) with four or more copies of the minor allele in the reference population  which were used for imputation. Further details about the 1000 bull genomes reference population  variant calling and filtering of variants are in Daetwyler et al. []. Imputation of HD genotypes to WGS was done using standard settings in MINIMAC2 [] and the pre-phased reference genotypes (SNPs and indels) that resulted from BEAGLE 4.0 (default settings) []. The imputed data were allele dosages that were subsequently converted to most probable genotypes. The output from MINIMAC2 included an r value  which is the estimated correlation between imputed and true genotypes. Markers that had an r lower than 0.5 and those that were either monomorphic or had only opposing homozygous genotypes were filtered out. We also filtered out markers that had less than 10 copies of the minor allele in the populations. This criterion was the same as setting a MAF threshold of  where  is the number of genotyped individuals. Filtering based on MAF was done separately for the NZH  NZJ and DH sets. Furthermore  in the final dataset we retained only markers that segregated in all three populations. The results of a meta-GWAS analysis conducted on 58 265 individuals with imputed WGS were used to select variants associated with stature []. This meta-analysis was performed on 17 populations from eight breeds  including Holstein and Jersey  from different countries. The DH population was included in the meta-GWAS  whereas both the NZH and NZJ populations were not included. The meta-analysis across the populations found 24 230 genome-wide significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10e–8) WGS markers in 163 distinct QTL regions that were spread across 27 autosomes (excluding chromosomes 24 and 27). For each of the 163 regions  the lead marker (160 SNPs and three indels) was determined based on its highest significance. In our first scenario  we used all available markers in the WGS data for GP  to test the hypothesis that the number of markers used determines the accuracy of across-breed predictions. We also created scenarios that contained only markers that showed statistical significance in the previously conducted meta-GWAS analysis to evaluate whether the non-significant markers from the meta-GWAS only add noise in a GP model. Since markers can show spurious associations based on the effect of LD and family structure  simply selecting markers based on statistical significance is not sufficient to filter out all the potentially non-causal markers. Hence  we performed a forward selection of markers to create other scenarios using the conditional and joint (COJO) effect method described in Yang et al. [] and implemented in the GCTA software []. The COJO option in GCTA is a stepwise marker selection procedure that selects independently associated markers  given some parameter thresholds and the summary level result from a GWAS. As outlined in the main paper of Yang et al. []  the marker selection model is initiated with the most significant marker that is below the threshold  followed by a calculation of the conditional  values for the remaining markers i.e. conditional on the marker that is already in the model. The marker with the lowest conditional  value is then selected and added to the model  and the process is repeated. It is possible that the marker being tested is in high LD with other markers that are already in the model. To avoid having such markers in the model  a collinearity threshold is set. If the threshold is exceeded  the marker being tested is dropped and the next one is considered instead. A window size in mega base pairs (Mb) is defined  outside of which markers are assumed to be in linkage equilibrium. Once all the markers have been considered and those that are independently significant have been identified by the model and selected  the selected markers are then jointly fitted in a model and those with a p value higher than the threshold are dropped. These steps are repeated iteratively until no more markers can be added or removed from the model. In total  10 scenarios were created depending on whether or not variants were pre-selected from WGS data and the criteria of selection that were used. All the scenarios are described in Table . The total number of markers in each scenario and their mean MAF are in Table . In each scenario  a genomic relationship matrix () was calculated for all the animals according to the first method of VanRaden []. This was done using calc_grm [] as: where  is the frequency of the allele of marker  with the homozygous genotype being coded as 2  and  is the centred (<U+2009>=<U+2009> - 2) genotype matrix.  is the genotype of marker  for animal   with the elements of  coded as 0  1  2. Using the estimated  and the DRP of the reference animals as phenotypes  a genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) analysis was run in ASReml [] to estimate the proportion of genetic variance captured by the markers in each scenario. In the GREML model  deregressed EDC were used to scale the residual of each animal in the model such that animals with a high deregressed EDC has effectively a small residual. The weighting procedure is described in more detail below in the genomic prediction sub-section. Normally  the residual variance obtained from such analyses is defined for a weight of 1  but because the deregressed EDC that were used as weights were considerably higher than 1  the resulting residual variances were inflated. To correct for this  we scaled the residual variances by the mean of the deregressed EDC in the data []. For example  if the mean of deregressed EDC in the data is   we computed the phenotypic variance as:  where  is the genetic variance and  is the residual variance. For GP  the composition of reference and validation sets are in Table . Estimation of GEBV and the proportion of genetic variance captured by markers as explained in the previous section was carried out simultaneously using the same   phenotype data and model. A single-trait animal model was fitted in ASReml [] as follows: where  is a vector containing stature DRP for the reference set (missing for the validation set)  µ is the mean of the DRP   is a vector of additive genetic effects for all animals   is the design matrix that links  to the DRP in  and  is a vector containing the residuals. Both  and  are assumed to be normally distributed as  and  where  the genetic variance   the residual variance and  is a diagonal matrix that contains the inverse of deregressed EDC  which in this case were used as weights for the DRP in the model. We measured the accuracy of GP as the correlation between the GEBV and the DRP of the validation animals. The standard error (SE) of accuracy was calculated based on the sampling variance of a correlation as   where  is the accuracy and  is the sample size (number of validation candidates). Furthermore  prediction bias was assessed by regressing DRP of validation animals on their GEBV. Stature is measured on a different scale in New Zealand and in the Netherlands. As a result  the GEBV of the NZH and NZJ bulls that were obtained by using a DH reference population will be on the DH scale  while their DRP are on a different scale. To estimate the slope and intercept of regression  we rescaled the DRP and GEBV so that they are on the same scale and expressed in their standard deviation units as: where  and  are the rescaled DRP and GEBV of the validation animals   is the DRP of the validation animals on their original scale   is the standard deviation of  and  is the standard deviation of the DRP of reference population. We estimated the proportion of genetic variance captured by markers in the different scenarios. This was done separately for the DH  NZH and NZJ datasets and the results are presented in Fig. . Across the three populations  the proportion of genetic variance captured increases almost linearly with the number of markers up to 50k. Above 50k  the proportion of genetic variance captured plateaus. Consequently  using WGS markers did not lead to any significant gain in the proportion of genetic variance captured compared to the lower density panels. Proportion of genetic variance captured by markers in the different scenarios. The standard errors are indicated at the top of each bar Except for the extreme cases of the Top-markers  COJO8 and COJO3 scenarios that contained only 133  360 and 1570 markers  respectively  the proportion of genetic variance captured did not differ markedly between scenarios. With only 133 markers that were identified as lead markers in a meta-GWAS analysis [] and across the three populations  41 to 59% of the genetic variance was captured  which is more than half of the genetic variance captured by the WGS data  which include approximately 14 million markers (76 to 97%). Across all the scenarios  more genetic variance was captured in the DH population followed by the NZH population. This was expected  given that the DH bulls were included in the meta-GWAS that was used to select the markers  whereas the New Zealand populations were not included. Moreover  about 40% of the animals used for the meta-GWAS were Holsteins whereas only about 5% of the animals were Jerseys from Australia. Another important reason in this regard is the large size of the DH population compared to those of NZH and NZJ. Our main objective was to investigate how much gain in accuracy of genomic prediction can be achieved across breed and across country by using WGS data instead of the lower density marker panels. As presented in Table   using WGS data did not lead to any gain in the accuracy of GP compared to using HD or 50k markers. Accuracy of prediction was close to 0 (0.02 to 0.08) in the across-breed  across-country (DH and NZJ) GP scenario. Similarly  accuracy of prediction obtained using WGS data ranged from 0.06 to 0.09 in the across-breed but within-country (NZH and NZJ) GP scenario. In the within-breed  across-country (NZH and DH) GP scenario  accuracies of prediction were considerably higher  ranging from 0.41 to 0.51. However  even in this case the accuracies obtained using WGS data were lower than those obtained using the 50k and HD marker panels. The remaining scenarios  apart from those with WGS data  which contained unselected markers (50k and HD)  also performed poorly in across-breed prediction with accuracies ranging from -<U+2009>0.04 to 0.13. The Top_markers were subsequently added to the 50k and HD markers to form new scenarios (50k_Top and HD_Top  respectively). However  using the combined marker sets (50k_Top and HD_Top) in across-breed GP resulted in low accuracies of prediction (-<U+2009>0.04 to 0.13)  similar to those obtained by using only the 50k and HD markers. Using the 50k_Top and HD_Top markers in within-breed GP  but across countries  also resulted in similar accuracies as those obtained by using only 50k and HD. Overall  adding the potentially causal markers to the 50k and HD markers did not result in any gain in the accuracy of GP. The prior-selection of markers from WGS data  which was based on their potential causal effect  and the benefit of using such markers for across-breed GP were also investigated in this study. Accuracies of across-breed prediction obtained by using the pval5 markers ranged from 0.14 to 0.32  whereas accuracies obtained with the pval7 markers ranged from 0.07 to 0.35. Accuracies of prediction using the Pval5 and Pval7 markers are already 3 to 4 times higher than those obtained using WGS data  although they contained only very small fractions of the number of markers that are in WGS data. In the within-breed  across-country GP scenario  we also observed a slight increase in the accuracy of GP using pval5 and pval7 markers compared to all the scenarios with unselected markers. One can argue that selecting markers purely on significance in a GWAS is naive  in the sense that some of these markers are selected simply because they are in LD with causal mutations and that they provide redundant information in GP. It was for this reason that we performed forward marker selection to limit the effect of LD  thus resulting in the COJO3 and COJO8 scenarios. The COJO scenario contained independently significant markers from the meta-GWAS at a significance level of 5e–3 for COJO3 and 5e–8 for COJO8. Accuracy of across-breed prediction using the markers in the COJO3 scenario ranged from 0.14 to 0.31  whereas that in the COJO8 scenario ranged from 0.16 to 0.25. This indicates that the COJO scenarios have about the same level of accuracy as the Pval scenarios  in spite of having fewer markers. The accuracy of across-breed prediction using only the 133 top markers from the meta-GWAS ranged from 0.08 to 0.27  which for some across-breed prediction scenarios (NZJ as reference population or DH as reference population to predict GEBV for NZJ) is approximately 3 times higher than the accuracy obtained using WGS data. In this study  we assessed prediction bias based on the slope of regression when the DRP of the validation animals were regressed onto their GEBV; the results are in Table . For across-breed  across-country GP  the slope ranged from 0.01 to 0.81  and there was no apparent difference between the scenarios with selected and unselected markers sets. For across-breed  within-country GP  predictions were also biased. GEBV for the NZJ predicted from the NZH were underestimated  whereas GEBV for the NZH predicted from the NZJ were overestimated. Exceptions were the scenarios HD  HD_Top  50k and 50k_Top  which all had negative slopes  although these estimates had high standard errors and were not significantly different from zero. These scenarios using unselected marker sets  also had close to zero (and slightly negative) prediction accuracies (Table ). For within-breed  across-country GP  when DH was used as reference population to predict GEBV for NZH  slopes deviated more from 1 in the scenarios with pre-selected markers (0.55–0.72) than those with unselected markers (0.77–0.85). When GEBV for DH were predicted from NZH  the use of pre-selected markers or unselected markers made a difference in either over- or under-predicting the breeding values. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential gain in accuracy of across-breed prediction when WGS data are used instead of lower density marker panels. Our results showed that simply increasing the number of markers up to WGS does not result in an increased accuracy of across-breed prediction and that  in some cases  it can even result in lower accuracies compared to when 50k or HD marker panels are used. These results are in agreement with previous studies that showed no added benefit of using WGS data for GP [   ]  although in these studies  GP was carried out within breed. One of the explanations for the low accuracy of across-breed GP is the inconsistency of LD between markers and causal mutations across breeds []. On the one hand  this challenge can be circumvented by simply increasing the number of markers up to the point that each causal locus is in LD with at least one marker across breeds. For example  in cattle it was shown that about 300 000 SNPs are sufficient to ensure the consistency of LD phase across breeds []  which is far less than the 14 million markers that we used in this study. On the other hand  increasing the number of markers up to WGS increases the chance that causal mutations are in LD with a large number of non-causal markers  even across breeds. Thus  the effect of the causal markers are picked up by a linear combination of many other non-causal markers  with which the causal markers are in LD. In other words  with a GREML model  the effect of the causal markers is shrinked towards the mean to obtain a uniform distribution of marker effects  as is the assumption in the infinitesimal model. As a result  the model is not able to pinpoint the true effect of the causal markers across breeds  thereby resulting in low accuracies of prediction. Another possible explanation for our result  which was also put forward by Wientjes et al. []  is that the accuracy of estimating marker effects is low. The low accuracy of estimating marker effects can be due to differences in allele substitution effects at the causal loci between the breeds []  resulting from differences in genetic background  differences in MAF between breeds  possible gene-by-environment interactions  different contributions of non-additive gene effects and the limited size of available data. The differences in allele substitution effects at the causal loci reflect the genetic correlation between breeds [  ]  which in theory sets an upper limit for the accuracy of across-breed GP. Although the low accuracies that we observed for across-breed prediction might have been exacerbated by the low accuracies of estimating marker effects  we believe that another major underlying reason is the increased model complexity and over-parameterization that comes along with the use of WGS data in GP. In this study  we investigated the effect of prior selection of markers from a meta-GWAS study on the accuracy of across-breed GP. Our results clearly demonstrated that when markers in the WGS data are selected a priori based on their potential causal effect and that the potentially non-causal markers are excluded  the accuracy of across-breed prediction can be increased significantly. We believe that the non-causal markers in WGS data exhibit some kind of dilution effect on the accuracy of genomic prediction. Although a slight dilution effect of non-causal markers was noted for within-breed  across-country GP i.e.  when we used DH to predict NZH and the other way round  this effect was more pronounced in an across-breed GP scenario. A possible explanation is that within breeds  LD extends over long distances  which increases the chance that every marker in the dataset is in LD with a causal locus and with other markers in LD with the same causal locus. Thus  many of the markers  although having no causal effect on their own  still have an explanatory value due to LD. However  LD between markers and causal loci across breeds is conserved only across short distances []. This means that across breeds  there are probably many markers that are not linked to any causal locus  i.e.  they have different LD patterns in different breeds  which in a way make them serve as sources of noise and dilution factors in across-breed GP. The proportion of these ‘lone standing’ markers and the corresponding noise effect increase when for example instead of 50k or HD marker panels  WGS data are used for GP across distantly related breeds. Our results agree completely with those of van den Berg et al. [] who found in their simulation studies that GP using markers that are in LD with causal loci was more accurate than when all markers (both those in LD with causal loci and those that are not) were used together. Similar results were obtained by Brondum et al. []. We have empirically shown that there is a good prospect for the use of WGS data in across-breed GP  provided the potentially causal markers in such data are accurately identified and used for prediction. In this study  we benefitted from the results of a very powerful meta-GWAS []. Thus  there is a high level of confidence that the pre-selected markers from the meta-GWAS are either the causal variants themselves or are in high LD with the causal variants. This explains the significant improvement in accuracies of across-breed GP resulting from the use of pre-selected markers compared to the use of unselected marker sets (Table ). Such a powerful meta-GWAS for pre-selection of markers is currently rather unique  hence pre-selection of markers for other traits is not a trivial task. Other ways to pre-select markers from whole-genome sequence based on their significance for the trait of interest include GWAS using (a subset of) the reference population or variable selection models. Performing a GWAS using data on the reference population and using preselected markers based on their significance from the GWAS for GP in the same population was shown to be less optimal than using unselected markers sets for GP []. Veerkamp et al. [] found that the use of pre-selected markers from a GWAS for GP in the same population that was used for the GWAS resulted in lower accuracy of prediction and increased prediction bias compared to the use of unselected marker sets. If the use of such pre-selected markers results in decreased accuracy of within-breed prediction  the expectation is that using such markers for across-breed GP will result in little to no benefit  given that there may be differences in the properties of the markers across breeds. In theory  similar or better prediction accuracies than those reported in this study can be obtained if data on all the individuals in the meta-GWAS are available  and if they are combined in a single multi-breed reference population to predict the GEBV of validation animals  using a Bayesian variable selection model. There are  however  two major limitations to this approach  the first being the willingness of all parties involved to share both phenotype and genotype data. In the meta-GWAS  this limitation was non-existent because the partners in the consortium shared only the summary level results of their ‘in-house’ GWAS [] and did not have to share their phenotype or genotype data. Second  implementing a Bayesian variable selection model with 58 265 individuals all of which have WGS data is computationally not practical [  ]. Alternatively  a Bayesian variable selection model can be used to analyse the WGS data of the reference population in this study and the results could be applied for across-breed GP. However  with Bayesian variable selection models  like most other models  inference about marker effects or variances depends highly on sample size [  ]  i.e.  the size of the reference population. In that sense  the inferential power or accuracy of a Bayesian variable selection model using a training population of at most 5553 individuals is expected to be much lower compared to that of a meta-GWAS carried out using 58 265 individuals with WGS. Moreover  with a single breed reference population  strong family relationships and long stretches of LD can hinder the accurate pinpointing of the causal regions underlying complex traits  irrespective of the type of model applied [    ]. For example  Habier et al. [] showed that  in the presence of LD  prediction accuracies obtained using different models including BayesB decayed rapidly across generations. If the argument holds that such a decay in accuracy is a result of differences in LD patterns across generations  then difference in LD patterns across breeds will hinder the accurate prediction of GEBV across breeds using a single breed reference population  even with a Bayesian variable selection model. In GP  prediction bias is commonly estimated as the regression coefficient (ß) when DRP of validation animals are regressed onto their GEBV. The expectation of 1 for ß does not hold in an across-breed GP scenario  mainly because the prediction model does not take all the uncertainty into account i.e. differences in LD phase between breeds and differences in allele substitution effect at the causal locus (genetic correlation less than 1) between breeds []. When markers are in high LD with causal mutations within the reference population  their estimated effects are likely to be close to the true effect of the causal loci  at least proportional to the extent of LD with the causal loci []. However  if the LD between these markers and the causal mutation does not hold across breeds  then these markers lose their effect across breeds. This loss in the effect of markers across breeds is not accounted for in the prediction model and therefore can result in the inflation of the variance of GEBV of the validation animals []  and thus in lower slope values  as observed in most of the scenarios in our study (Table ). The DH population used in our study was included in the meta-GWAS that was used to pre-select the markers. When the DH population was used as a reference population to predict the GEBV of another Holstein population (NZH)  predictions were more biased downwards in the scenarios with pre-selected markers than in the scenarios with unselected markers. One of the reasons for this might be that the markers are discovered in (partly) the same population as the one used to train the effects of the markers for GP  resulting in an overestimation of the effects of the markers and consequently of the variance of GEBV  a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “Beavis effect” []. For example  the variance of the GEBV estimated by using WGS data was equal to 0.36  while it was 0.46 when the pre-selected top-markers were used instead. Moreover  the DH and NZH populations are related  since some of the DH individuals were used as sires for the NZH population. Therefore  using DH as a reference population to predict the GEBV of NZH could have resulted in prediction error covariance between the DRP and GEBV of the validation animals []  hence the biased predictions. Veerkamp et al. [] also showed that predictions were more biased when they used pre-selected markers from WGS data based on the result of a GWAS  than when unselected marker sets were used. Moreover  in their study  the discovery (GWAS) population was the same as the reference population used for GP. When GEBV are estimated with low accuracy  they are strongly regressed towards the mean  resulting in a narrow range of values for GEBV  which means that the slope of regression (bias) becomes very sensitive to even slight changes in GEBV between scenarios. For example  when the numerically small NZJ population was used as a reference population to predict GEBV for NZH  the slope of regression drastically changed from 0.87 in Full_seq to -<U+2009>0.58 in HD. These scenarios have very low prediction accuracies (Table ) and very narrow ranges of values for GEBV (-<U+2009>0.22 to 0.26 for Full_seq and -<U+2009>0.26 to 0.29 for HD). Because the DRP remained the same between the scenarios (-<U+2009>3.37 to 3.2)  only a slight change in GEBV between these scenarios could have resulted in such a huge difference in the estimated slope  accompanied by high standard errors (Table ). With higher accuracies  for example in the scenarios with pre-selected markers  the GEBV become less regressed to the mean compared to the scenarios with very low prediction accuracies. For example  GEBV ranged from -<U+2009>1.26 to 1.33 when using the Top-markers and from -<U+2009>1.1 to 1.1 when using the COJO8 markers. As a result  the slopes are estimated more precisely in these scenarios  i.e.  with low standard errors and the slopes do not change drastically between the scenarios (Table ). An important message from our results is that expectation for the bias is not 1  when across-breed differences are not properly accounted for  especially when a numerically small reference population is used. Furthermore  with low accuracies of across-breed prediction  the range of GEBV for the validation animals becomes very small due to shrinkage to the mean  and estimated bias in such cases can be very unreliable  since they are estimated with high standard errors. The use of whole-genome sequence data holds the potential to increase the accuracy of across-breed GP because it is expected to contain all the causal mutations that underlie the traits of interest. Contrary to common belief [  ]  our results showed that simply using all markers in the WGS data in a linear GREML model results in a very low accuracy of across-breed GP. In addition to possible differences in allele substitution effects at the causal loci between breeds  this could be due to the increased model complexity and over-parameterization that accompany the use of WGS data. Furthermore  the results of this study showed that the problem of over-parametrization can be avoided partly by prior selection of markers in WGS data to contain only those with a potential causal effect. This approach enables the model to focus directly on the important regions and can result in an increase in accuracy of across-breed prediction that is more than twice that obtained by using 50k and HD marker panels or unselected WGS data. However  for some scenarios in our study  accuracies of prediction were still low even when doubled by the use of pre-selected markers instead of WGS. Dalton R. No bull: genes for better milk.

We show that GRL is a fast and accurate method of parentage assignment that can use dense  non-independent SNPs  with variable call rates and unknown genotyping error rates. By offering an alternative way of assigning parents  GRL is also suitable for estimating the expected proportion of inconsistent parent–offspring genotypes for exclusion-based models. In the field of animal genetics  low-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  microsatellites  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) have long been the preferred types of genomic data for parentage assignment due to their low cost [  ]. In practice  the foundation of parentage assignment rests on exclusion- and likelihood-based methods []. Exclusion-based methods rely on their ability to exclude false parent–offspring combinations when the offspring’s candidate parents’ genotypes violate Mendel’s laws. These methods are often used due to their ease of interpretation  but the number of expected exclusions depends on allele frequencies in the population and on genotype call rates and error rates []. Exclusion-based methods also require more loci than likelihood-based methods since only genotypes with Mendelian inconsistencies are used []. Likelihood-based methods often calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of the genotype of the offspring  which is the probability of the offspring’s genotype given the genotypes of the candidate parents  relative to the probability of observing the genotype in the population by chance. The LR statistic effectively gives more weight to rare alleles. Different loci are typically assumed independent  such that total LR is multiplied over all loci. Likelihood-based methods have higher power than exclusion-based methods  but their interpretation is more complicated. Both likelihood- and exclusion-based models usually assume known and homogenous genotype error rates and independent loci  and do not account for variation in genotype call rates [    ]  which are all important assumptions when working with high-density SNP data. For dense SNP chip data  the assumption of independent inheritance among loci is not realistic (i.e.  alleles are inherited on large DNA segments)  which may lead to inflated LR values when using conventional likelihood-based methods. Parentage can also be assigned and tested by using realized genomic relationships. The interrelationship between parents governs the expected inbreeding in offspring  as well as parent–offspring relationships. Realized genomic relationships assess the average genomic similarity across loci and do not assume independence of the loci. Increasing the number of markers in the calculations  increases the precision of the genomic relationships. Our aim was to study whether genomic relationships can be used to perform computationally fast and accurate parentage testing with high-density SNP data. Estimates of genomic relationships require large numbers of loci []  and their expectation is proportional to the genetic covariance between individuals. The proposed method for parentage testing is developed for trio parentage testing  i.e. using a single offspring and two parental candidates. The method uses genomic relationships estimated by VanRaden’s first method []  in which the genomic relationship between two individuals is calculated as follows: where  is the genomic relationship between individuals  and    and  are the genotypes (coded 0  1 or 2 for the alternative homozygous  the heterozygous  and the homozygous reference genotypes  respectively) for individuals  and  at locus    is the allele frequency in the population at locus   and  is the number of loci (i.e. SNPs). Genomic relationships can be calculated even for extremely dense genomic data (even up to full sequence)  and do not assume independence of the loci. Figure  shows the relationships in a trio consisting of an offspring and two (candidate) parents. A trio of offspring (O)  first parent (P1) and second parent (P2). The variables near the arrows indicate genetic relationships between individuals  while the variables over P1 and P2  and below O  are the individuals’ genetic relationships to themselves  respectively. Sexes are included in the figure but are not used by the GRL method We used Eq. () to estimate the genomic interrelationships between parents and offspring  i.e.  the relationship of the offspring with itself ()  relationships of the two parent candidates with themselves ( and )  relationships of the offspring with both parent candidates ( and )  and relationships between the parent candidates ()  see Fig. . Expected genomic relationships of an offspring with its true parents (TP) are []: In other words  the relationship of an offspring with a parent is the average of the genomic relationship of the parent with itself and the relationship between the two parents. The expected relationship of the offspring with itself is []: where  is the expected inbreeding coefficient of the offspring. Three residual relationships are defined as differences between actual and expected genomic relationships: Inbreeding is accounted for when using the above residuals  as well as the direction of the relationships. For example  using the offspring as a candidate parent  and/or using a true parent as the offspring  will result in large residuals  i.e.  realized relationships that deviate substantially from the expectations of a true parent–offspring trio. The above residual relationships are used to calculate a genomic relationship log-likelihood using a multivariate normal density function  assuming: where  and  is a vector of the overall means for the residuals for true parent–offspring trios. In the absence of genotyping errors  the residuals are expected to be approximately normally distributed around zero (  see [Additional file : Figure S1]. The central limit theorem states that the sum of many independently and identically distributed variates will be approximately normally distributed. The variates in Eq. () may be considered as originating from a common (albeit unknown) distribution  but not all are independent (i.e.  the effective number of loci is lower than the actual number of loci). Still  given a substantial number of loci distributed over the entire genome (i.e.  most of the loci are indeed independent)  genomic relationships (summed over all variates) are still likely to approach a normal distribution (see []  Theorem 27.4). Plotting the residual relationships for true parent–offspring trios revealed that they were approximately normally distributed [see Additional file : Figures S1  S2 and S3]. Since genotyping errors can occur in real data (and the expected residual relationship may thus deviate from 0)  parameters of the distribution of residual relationships were estimated using an iterative method (see Section “Estimation of model parameters” below). Matrix  is the 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 (co)variance matrix of the three residual variates in true parent–offspring trios and was also estimated using the iterative method. The genomic relationship likelihood (GRL) was defined as: which is proportional to the natural logarithm of a multivariate normal density function. Based on (iteratively assigned) parent–offspring trios  a threshold for acceptable GRL values can be defined. In this study  we assumed that a parent–offspring trio had to have a GRL value that was within the highest 99% of the known parent–offspring GRL values  thus accepting a false negative rate of 1%. To reduce the false positive rate and increase the true negative rate  the value of  was also assessed based on: where   is the (second) highest GRL value achieved for an offspring across all candidate parent–offspring trios. This is analogous to the <U+0394> statistic used in Marshall et al. []  with more details in Appendix . In datasets where both parents of an offspring are present and no other relatives are available   will typically be very high  since no other realistic trio exists. When other close relatives of the offspring are included among the candidate parents   may be lower due the potential existence of multiple “likely” false parent candidates  e.g. uncles  aunts  grandparents  siblings or descendants of the offspring. High relatedness to the offspring alone is not sufficient to obtain a high value for  since the method accounts for interrelationships of the whole trio. For example  if the parent candidates consist of one true parent and one full-sib of the offspring  interrelationships of the trio will typically be inconsistent because of the high relationship between the two parental candidates  although the relationships of the offspring with itself and with the parent candidates may be “normal” (these should be elevated if the relationship among the two parent candidates is high). In cases where a parent is missing but many other close relatives of the offspring are present   can  in rare cases  exceed the threshold for -values  but then  will typically be low  since multiple highly-related candidate parents are present. Thus  thresholds for assignment must be set for both  and . Estimation of the GRL-parameters  i.e.    and the GRL threshold  is undertaken with an iterative method which is briefly described below. The  threshold was set to 6.9  which implies that the best parent pair should be at least 1000 (=<U+2009>e) times more likely than the second-best parent pair. See Section 2 in Additional file : for more details. Random matings between individuals from the dataset are performed in silico to produce simulated offspring. For simplicity  all loci are assumed to be inherited independently. The simulated trios are then used to obtain initial estimates of the GRL parameters. A smaller subset of the loci may be used in this step. Trios are initially assigned using the GRL method based on the parameters estimated in Step 1. The method relies on the presence of true trios (albeit unknown) in the data. Parameters  and  are then re-estimated using the newly assigned trios from evaluation data  and then used as the basis of the next assignment iteration. Iteration stops when the number of assignments is smaller than in the previous iteration. Thus  the GRL training procedure iteratively assigns trios while (re-)estimating the GRL-parameters until no more trios can be assigned. See Section 1 in Additional file : for more information about the training procedure.The parameter estimates obtained in the second-to-last iteration are considered optimal. To limit the number of plausible trios to test  only individuals with a relationship larger than 0.25 with an offspring were considered as potential parents  i.e.  and . The GRL threshold is not re-estimated in this step. When pre-defined parameter estimates are used  the assignment process starts without estimating parameters. This is equivalent to running only the second-to-last iteration of Step 2. A simulation study was conducted to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the GRL method. QMSim [] was used to produce simulated datasets. The initial size of the historical population was set to 500 and remained constant for 5000 generations to achieve mutation/drift equilibrium. In generation 5001  the population size was reduced to 300  of which 100 were males and 200 were females. Twenty chromosomes were simulated  each 1 Morgan long  and the number of SNPs was set such that approximately 54 000 SNPs (53 427 to 55 517) with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05 existed in the population. The SNP mutation rate was set to 0.00003  assuming a recurrent mutation model (i.e. only two possible alleles exist). After the historical population  a recent population was simulated over five generations  with 1000 individuals per generation (5000 individuals in total). These were produced by random mating of 100 sires and 200 dams per generation  with one sire mated with two dams and each mating resulting in five recorded offspring. Of these  the last two generations were used in the parentage assignment tests. Fifty repetitions of the QMSim simulations were performed to produce 50 datasets. Genotype errors (1 and 3%) and call rates (80–100%) were added using a custom script written in the Python programming language  allowing both erroneous and missing genotypes among individuals  see Section 2 in Additional file : for more information. The GRL method was programmed in the C++ programming language that emphasizes parallel processing. The program was run in a Linux cluster environment using multiple CPU. Tests were run using the training procedure on all (evaluation) datasets. In addition  pre-estimated parameters were obtained from some of the runs with training. The datasets were not divided into offspring and parents  and thus all true offspring and parents had the potential to be assigned parents both correctly (offspring only) and incorrectly (parents and offspring). There are three possible outcomes of the assignment process: (1) ‘Correct’  meaning correct assignment of true parents to the unknown offspring (parents must be present)  (2) ‘Incorrect’  meaning wrong candidate parents were assigned and (3) ‘No-assign’  meaning no assignment was made. These were quantified for each analysis. To compare GRL with other methods  we analyzed five of the simulated datasets  arbitrarily chosen from all 50 datasets  by using the Colony2 software V2.0.6.3 []. Colony2 uses a likelihood-based method that jointly assigns both sibship and parentage based on a simulated annealing process [  ]. This increases the assignment power compared to methods that use a single unknown individual (the offspring) and one or two candidate parents. Colony2 was run using a 1% genotype error (true and assumed). In addition  the following settings were chosen: (1) do not update allele frequencies  (2) assume no inbreeding  (3) no sibship scaling  (4) no sibship prior  (5) short run length  (6) use the pairwise likelihood score (PLS) and (7) allelic dropout rate set to zero for all markers. The ‘ParentPairs’-file produced by Colony2 was used to check accuracy of assignments. Any assignments for which mother  father or both were missing  or for which the assignment probability reported by Colony2 was less than 0.5  were categorized as a “No-assign”. Suggested parent pairs with at least one incorrect parent were categorized as “Incorrect” assignments and pairs with both parent candidates correct were categorized as “Correct” assignments. We developed an exclusion-based method in which one of the parameters was estimated using GRL-assigned trios using custom scripts written in the R programming language. Exclusion ratios (ER) for the GRL-assigned trios were calculated  the ratio of the number of exclusions for a trio and the number of loci for which all three individuals in the trio had called genotypes. We used a binomial distribution as a basis for the new assignments  i.e.   where  is the number of trio exclusions   (number of trials) is the number of calls for the trio  and  (success probability) is the median ER from the GRL assigned trios. To limit the number of trios for binomial exclusion assignment  we used the same parent–offspring genomic relationship threshold that we used for the GRL assignments  i.e.  and . Assignment was done in a similar manner as with GRL  using both a confidence cutoff and a -score. For more information  see Section 3 in Additional file :. We refer to this method as the binomial exclusion method (BEM) in the text. Assignment results using Colony2 are shown in Fig.   and the analogous GRL- and BEM results are shown in Figs.  and . The most noticeable differences in results between GRL- and BEM are shown in Figs.  and . Here  both methods used training estimates from a dataset with a 3% genotype error  while the true error was 1%. Results that were similar between GRL and BEM are shown in Figures S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10 and S11 [see Additional file : Figures S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10 and S11]. In Figures S4 (GRL) and S5 (BEM)  parameters were pre-estimated at a 3% genotype error (true and assumed). Figures S6 (GRL) and S7 (BEM) show the results for a true error of 3% and an assumed error of 1%. Figures S8 (GRL) and S9 (BEM) show the results for training with a 1% error rate  and Figures S10 (GRL) and S11 (BEM) for training with a 3% error rate. Total results over all datasets are shown in Table S1 [see Additional file : Table S1].

Individuals with (left panel) and without (right panel) available parents are present in the dataset. Results from 50 simulated datasets are averaged The Colony2 software was tested using a 1% true genotype error rate (assumed and true). When parents are available  Colony2 had a correct assignment rate of 22.4%  a no-assign rate of 75.4% and an incorrect assignment rate of 2.2%. For individuals without parents  the incorrect assignment rate climbed to 14.7% and the (correct) no-assign rate climbs to 85.3% (see Fig. ). Figures  and  show the comparison between GRL and BEM when parameter estimates from an arbitrarily chosen dataset were used. When parents were available in the dataset and the genotype error rate (true and assumed) was 1%  using GRL resulted in 99.5% of the individuals being correctly assigned both parents (Fig. )  while 99.9% were assigned correctly with the (GRL-trained) BEM (Fig. ). In both cases  no individuals with parents in the dataset were assigned incorrect parent pairs. When parents were not available  the incorrect assignment rate for GRL climbed to 0.01% for both 1% and 3% genotype error rates (Fig.  and Additional file : Figure S4). The most notable difference in results between GRL and BEM was found for a true genotype error rate of 1% when parameter estimates were from a dataset with a 3% error rate (Figs.  and ). Here  GRL did not assign any trios. However  BEM assigned all trios correctly when parents were available  but incorrectly assigned 1.0% of the trios when parents were not available. When the true and assumed genotype error rates were reversed (i.e. a true error rate of 3% and an incorrectly assumed error rate of 1%)  neither method assigned any trios  while the GRL method incorrectly assigned 0.02% trios  both when parents were available and when they were missing [see Additional file : Figures S6 and S7] and [see Additional file : Table S1]. An alternative to assuming a set of predefined parameters is to estimate these by using the evaluation data directly. Averaged results for each dataset are shown in Figures S8 and S9 [see Additional file : Figures S8 and S9] (1% genotype error) and in Figures S10 and S11 [see Additional file : Figures S10 and S11] (3% genotype error). These results are very similar to the results shown in Figs.  and  (1% true and assumed error rates)  and Figures S4 and S5 [see Additional file : Figures S4 and S5] (3% true and assumed error rates). Parentage assignment is mostly performed using likelihood-based models with microsatellites [  ]  low-density SNPs [] or exclusion-based models []. However  assignments methods often impose idealized assumptions  such as known age  generation and gender of all individuals  a limited number of known parental candidates  independent markers  little or no inbreeding  no stratification of the population or sample  no biased sampling of individuals  Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and little or no variation in genotype error or call rates within and between samples. For GRL and BEM  we perfomed assignments with unknown age  generation and gender  with no assumption as to independence of markers  HWE  inbreeding  family size or family composition  and with dense (SNP) markers  closely related individuals and varying genotype error and call rate. Colony2 assumes HWE  independent markers and no inbreeding. Residual relationships were approximately normally distributed even when genotype errors were present [see Additional file : Figures S2 and S3]  but with different expectations compared to genomic data without genotype errors [see Additional file : Figure S1]. It did not appear to be a problem that the parent and offspring generations were unknown when using GRL and BEM. High accuracies were achieved  although individuals had numerous close relatives that were eligible as parent candidates  such as the true parents  full- and half-sibs  own offspring  uncles/aunts and nieces/nephews. Similar results were obtained when the genotype error was increased to 3%  which was used to show that the GRL and BEM work even when the genotype error rate has quite extreme values. These properties may be useful for populations with large sibling groups  such as in fish  poultry or pigs  when generations cannot be clearly differentiated  or when the genotype error or call rates vary a lot. A strength of the GRL training procedure is that no reference dataset with known pedigree is required for training and that the training is only partly done by simulation (allele-dropping). As long as there is a sufficient number of true (but unknown) trios present for assignment  the training can proceed. The method requires a pre-defined  threshold (i.e. the minimum acceptable value). The  is (the log of) the odds for correct assignment  given that the correct trio is among the two best trios (this is nearly always the case if true parents are present). In this study  the threshold was set to 6.9  i.e.  the best trio should be at least e<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000 times more likely than the second-best trio. Relaxing this assumption will increase both the true and false positive assignment rates of the model  while setting a stricter threshold will have the opposite effect. In some cases  the iterative training method may fail because the initial iteration results in no assignments. This may be caused by two factors: (1) the number of loci used in the allele-dropping simulation step may be set too high (giving too idealized parent–offspring relationships compared with evaluation data)  or (2) there are no true trios present in the evaluation dataset. If reducing the number of SNPs used in the allele-dropping step does not start the iteration process  the latter may be the case. During training  there is no need to estimate or assume a genotype error rate with the GRL method  as long as the training procedure is done using the evaluation dataset. Exclusion using parent–offspring duos (i.e. offspring and a single candidate parent) or trios is a relatively simple method for parentage assignment  by identifying incorrect parents by genotypes that violate the laws of Mendelian inheritance (“exclusion genotypes”). The GRL method is a fundamentally different approach and can be used to estimate exclusion-based parameters in true parent–offspring trios (assigned by GRL). Assignment of a single parent to an offspring is also possible using a similar method as for trios  but this was not explored in this study. The training-based GRL has the advantage that it requires no prior assumption with respect to genotype error rate or expected number of exclusions. Estimation of the -parameter for the BEM was done using trios that were assigned using GRL. An alternative to using GRL-assignments is using a training dataset with genotyped trios and known pedigree. Such a training dataset would need to have a similar genotype error rate as the evaluation dataset since having a discrepancy between the true and assumed genotype error rate could lead to decreased accuracy [see Additional file : Table S1]. Since pedigree information is not always reliable  we prefer to use GRL assignments (preferably using a relatively big dataset) for parameter estimation. The GRL and BEM resulted in much more accurate assignments of parents than Colony2. Parameters for Colony2 were chosen to minimize running time  so assignment accuracy may be improved by adjusting the parameters  but at the expense of time and/or computing resources required to perform the analysis. Colony2 incorrectly assumes that marker loci are independently distributed  while GRL and BEM do not. This is likely the main reason for the poor results obtained with Colony2 on these relatively dense marker datasets. Using BEM resulted in a slightly higher accuracy than GRL when the genotype error assumption was correct  or when GRL-parameters were estimated using the evaluation data (Figs.  and ) and [see Additional file : Figures S4  S5  S8 and S9]. However  when pre-estimated model parameters are used  assuming a too high genotype error rate will lead to some false assignments with BEM (Fig. )  and assignment failure for the GRL method (Fig. ). Thus  GRL can be used when it is crucial to minimize the false-positive rate. Assuming a too low genotype error rate resulted in both methods failing to correctly assign any trios  but GRL had a small fraction (0.016%) of false assignments while BEM did not [see Additional file : Table S1]. Although the success parameter (  see Methods) of BEM was estimated using already GRL-assigned trios  the results indicate that the two methods are somewhat complementary and can be used together to increase overall assignment accuracy. When the assumed genotype error rate was correct (Figs.  and ) and [see Additional file : Figures S4 and S5] or when the evaluation dataset was used to estimate parameters [see Additional file : Figures S8  S9  S10 and S11]  nearly all the individuals were assigned correctly and there were hardly any false assignments with either method. Thus  parameters should be estimated using the available data whenever possible  which should be the case in most situations. A possible novel use for the GRL method is analysis of genomic data that contain possibly duplicated genomes (e.g.  by sampling of clones in plants or monozygotic twins in animals  or by duplicated sampling of DNA from the same individual). Using traditional likelihood-based or exclusion-based methods  duplicated samples/clones should be removed prior to the analysis  as these may be assigned as their own parents. For the GRL method  duplication of offspring genotypes is not a problem since GRL looks at patterns in parent–offspring relationships rather than the likelihood of each single genotype. For example  if clones of a non-inbred offspring are inserted as one or both putative parents  the GRL method would expect the offspring to be highly inbred  which will not match the observed relationship of the offspring with itself  and thus yields a low GRL value. However  duplication of parental genotypes will inevitably lead to assignment failure  since two or more trios will appear equally likely. The GRL method is a promising trio parentage assignment method which is well suited to perform parentage assignment with high accuracy on high-density SNP datasets. GRL can be applied with success on datasets with high and/or unknown genotype error rates  highly dependent marker loci  closely-related individuals  inbreeding and in some cases clones. Estimation of the GRL parameters can be done without having a pre-existing reference dataset with known parent–offspring trio combinations. In addition  GRL can be used for training of exclusion-based methods. Heaton MP  Leymaster KA  Kalbfleisch TS  Kijas JW  Clarke SM  McEwan J  et al.

In this article  only the hypothesis of true parents is used for the GRL method: We assume  where  is the vector of residual genomic relationships  i.e. it holds the residual values for trio assignments. We define  as being the most probable trio  while  is the second most probable trio  that is . The difference   where  and  refer to the best and the second best trio candidates  respectively  can be shown to be identical to the natural logarithm of the probability of observing  given  divided by the probability of observing  given . Since  is assumed to be normally distributed  the multivariate normal probability density function used is: where  is the 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector of genomic residuals   is 3x1 vector of expected residuals and  is the 3x3 covariance matrix. If we define  (i.e. how many times more likely is  given  compared to  given )  we find that: If we take the natural logarithm of this ratio we get: The above formula shows that  has a logarithmic point probability ratio expectation. We can compare this to the  test statistic which is defined as in []  that is: where  is defined as: LOD is defined to be the LOD-score of the most likely trio  while LOD is the second most likely trio. Then: Both  and  can be written as follows: where  is the probability of observing the offspring genotype given the father and mother genotypes under  at locus    is the probability of observing the father genotype at locus    is the probability of observing the mother genotype at locus    is the probability of observing the offspring genotype under  at locus  and  is the number of loci. Since   we can simplify  to be: Since  is the likelihood ratio of the most likely trio and  is the likelihood ratio of the second most likely trio (defined above)  we can write  and  as: and where  and  are the genotypes of the father and mother in the most likely trio at locus   respectively  and  and  are the genotypes of the father and mother at locus  in the second most likely trio  respectively. Since the same offspring is used in both trios   is the same for both  and  for locus . Inserting  and  into the -formula above we get: where the explanation for      is the same as above  while        and  are the genotypes for the offspring (or child)  for most probable father and mother and for the second most probable father and mother  respectively  over all loci in vector-notation. The  method only uses the probability of observing the child genotypes given that  and   or  and  are the true parents. The fact that the information in the  hypothesis is not used makes the  method similar to   we see this when the two method definitions are compared: Both methods produce an estimated logarithmic ratio of the probability that  is the child of the two most probable parent candidates versus the probability that  is the child of the two second most probable parent candidates  hence the results produced by the two methods can be considered analogous.

The direct genetic variance for ADG (g/d) increased from week 1 to 3 [from 8.03 to 13.47 (g/d)] and then decreased [6.20 (g/d) at week 5]  while the indirect genetic variance decreased from week 1 to 4 [from 0.43 to 0.22 (g/d)].

Indirect genetic effects are larger just after mixing animals at weaning than later in the fattening period  probably because of the establishment of social hierarchy that is generally observed at that time. Accounting for IGE in the selection criterion maximizes genetic progress. The genes that an individual carries and the environment in which it lives determine its phenotype. In various situations  during the pre-weaning period or in the case of group housing for instance  other individuals are part of the environment of the focus animal. Thus  the phenotype of an individual is influenced by its interactions with other individuals of the group. Such interactions may be positive (e.g. maternal effects or sterile helpers in social insects []) or negative (e.g. competition for limited resources or aggressive social behavior [  ]) and are driven by other phenotypes of the group mates that generally are not recorded or measurable but can have a genetic component. Consequently  genetics of group mates or the dam may influence the focal phenotype. Such effects are known as indirect genetic effects (IGE) [  ] and have been reported to be important components of various traits in different species [    ]. Their role in the evolutionary processes of wild species and in response to selection in livestock species have also been explored []. The intensity of social interactions can depend highly on external factors  such as the number of interacting individuals [  ] and rearing conditions. For instance  Piles et al. [] recently showed that IGE for average daily gain (ADG) were stronger for rabbits under a restricted feeding regime than for rabbits fed ad libitum. In addition  interactions between group members can also vary over time. Several studies have shown that aggressive behavior of animals in group housing conditions is generally stronger at mixing and tends to decrease over time [  ]  which suggests that IGE can vary over time. Nonetheless  very few genetic studies have investigated changes of IGE over time for traits under selection in livestock species. To overcome this  the objectives of our study were to analyze longitudinal records of ADG in rabbits using a structured antedependence (SAD) model [] that includes IGE and to evaluate  by simulation  response to selection on longitudinal ADG using different selection strategies. The idea of the SAD approach is to model an observation at time  by regression on the preceding observations. We chose to model a longitudinal trait with IGE using a SAD model because of the following advantages over the two main classical approaches used in genetic studies for longitudinal data  i.e. character process (CP) and random regression (RR) models: (1) the SAD approach can account for non-stationarity at the level of variances and correlations []  in contrast to the CP approach  while the RR approach cannot model a situation with stationarity at the variance level and correlation between time points different than 1; and (2) extension of the SAD approach to the multiple-trait case is straightforward  in contrast to the CP approach  and requires fewer parameters than the RR approach []. The same applies to the case of correlated random effects in the analysis of just one phenotype  which is the case of correlated direct and indirect effects in our study. Animals were raised on the experimental farm of IRTA in Spain between July 2012 and June 2014. A detailed description of the experiment is in Piles et al. []. In short  after weaning (32 d of age)  kits were housed in cages (0.38 m) of eight individuals and fed under a restricted feeding regime corresponding to 75% of ad libitum feed intake during 5 weeks. To obtain a feed restriction of 25%  the amount of food given during week  was computed as 0.75 times the average feed intake of contemporary kits that were on a full feeding regime during week -<U+2009>1  plus 10% to account for the estimated increase in feed intake of growing animals. For week 1  the amount of feed for the restricted feeding regime was computed from data recorded in previous experiments on the same line from animals on a full feeding regime raised during the same season (multiplied by 0.75  10% increase not included). Feed (commercial pellets for rabbits with (weeks 1 to 4) or without (week 5) antibiotics  as detailed in Piles et al. []) was distributed once a day in a 3-place feeder. Water was available ad libitum (one nipple drinker per cage). Individual body weights (BW) were recorded at weaning and weekly after weaning. Average daily gain (g/d) for each week was calculated as the change in BW from the beginning to the end of the week divided by the number of days elapsed (7<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 d). On the weighing day  information regarding the animal health status was also recorded. Groups with animals showing disease symptoms (not caused by antagonist behaviors) or groups who suffered death events during the week were discarded from the analyses. The final dataset comprised 11 255 ADG records from 3096 individuals born in 1106 litters. The pedigree included information on 7701 rabbits. Descriptive statistics for the weekly ADG records are in Table . Let ()  be the ADG of animal  (1<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>3096)  born in litter  (1<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1106)  raised in group  (1<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>387)  during week (1<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>5). The linear mixed model used to study ADG was: where  () represents the fixed effects at week    the set of the seven group mates of focal individual   and  ()   ()   ()   () and  () are the direct genetic  indirect genetic  litter  group  and pseudo-permanent animal effects for week   respectively. The litter  group and pseudo-permanent random effects were independent from each other and distributed as:   and   where  and  are 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>5 covariance matrices corresponding to litter  group  and pseudo-permanent animal effects  respectively  for the 5-week period of observation  and  and  are identity matrices of appropriate size. Conversely  the direct and indirect genetic effects were correlated   where  is the 10<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (co)variance matrix for the genetic effects (5 weeks for the direct genetic effects and 5 weeks for the indirect genetic effects) and  is the additive relationship matrix based on pedigree. Possible non-null covariances between random effects at different times were taken into account using a SAD approach [  ]. It should be noted that this model does not include a residual term to help convergence and to avoid identifiability problems between structured permanent and classical residual covariance matrices []  as in previous studies using the SAD approach [  ]. Thus  the residual variance was by definition included in the (co)variance matrix of the pseudo-permanent animal effects of the model. For a given random effect  independent from the other random effects of the model   for instance  the general form of the SAD model of order  for animal  was:   where  is the th antedependence parameter for week   and  () is the error term  normally distributed with mean 0 and innovation variance  (). Parameters  and  () were assumed to be continuous functions of time:   for a function of degree   and   for a function of degree . The SAD models were then defined by the order of the antedependence ()  the degree of the polynomial for each antedependence parameter ( to )  and the degree of the polynomial for the innovation variance (). We denote the different SAD models with those parameters as follows: . For instance  a SAD1-12 model corresponds to a SAD model with antedependence of order 1  and degrees 1 and 2 for the polynomial functions of the antedependence parameter and the innovation variance  respectively. A detailed description of this model is in Additional file . In the case of correlated random effects (direct and indirect genetic effects)  the dependence between the two terms was also considered using a SAD model  which is a particular case of the multiple-trait SAD model that was proposed by David et al. []. The general form of the SAD model for correlated effects of order  and ' can be written as (for two effects  DGE and IGE  and for : where notations are the same as for the SAD model for independent effects and  is the cross-antedependence parameter at week . The parameter  was assumed to be a polynomial function of time. The fixed effects included in the model and described in Piles et al. [] were first selected step by step by comparing nested models using the likelihood ratio test. The fixed effects were week * body size (10 levels) and week * batch (70 levels) combinations  litter size (7 levels)  and parity level (4 levels). After selection of fixed effects  the order and degree of the antedependence parameters were selected for each random effect in a model that assumed independence between direct and indirect genetic effects. Selection was performed by comparing nested models using the likelihood ratio test. Then  the correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects was included in the model. The degree of the cross-antedependence function () was also selected using the likelihood ratio test. The SAD model was fitted to the data using ASReml [] and the OWN Fortran program that combines the single and multiple-SAD programs that we have recently developed ( [])  such that the two approaches can be applied in the same model  making it possible to consider cross-antedependence between direct and indirect genetic effects. The OWN program is freely available online at . Once the SAD model has converged  parameter estimates () can be used to compute estimates of the (co)variance matrix of the different random effects. For a given random effect    where  is a diagonal matrix with innovation variance estimates as components   is a lower triangular matrix with 1’s on the diagonal and negatives of the cross-antedependence parameter estimates below the diagonal entries []. The total phenotypic variance was calculated for each week  and for a group size of 8 as []: where    and  are the direct and indirect genetic variances and their covariance for week   respectively     and  are the litter  group and pseudo-permanent variances for week   respectively  and  is the average genetic relationship among cage mates  which was 0.16 in this study []. Estimates of direct  indirect and total heritabilities were computed for each week  as the ratio of the direct genetic  total indirect genetic ( []) and total heritable variance ( [])  respectively  relative to the total phenotypic variance. To obtain standard errors of the co-variance and heritability estimates  we performed a multivariate normal sampling approach of   as described in Houle and Meyer []:   where  is the inverse of the information matrix at convergence. We sampled  10 000 times  computed  and heritabilities for each sample  and removed samples that led to a non-positive semi-definite matrix of . Estimates of heritabilities and  were the mean of the heritabilities and  across samples and their standard errors were the standard deviation of the samples. In addition  we calculated correlations between elements of  to assess the estimability of the covariance components in this complex model. To evaluate the advantage of the SAD model with IGE for genetic selection of longitudinal traits that are affected by IGE in comparison with a model that ignores IGE  we performed a simulation study with genetic selection. The simulated population was a closed nucleus of discrete generations and constant size. The base population consisted of 30 unrelated sires and 120 unrelated dams. Each founder sire was mated to four founder females to give birth to 960 offspring (8 offspring per mating and a 50/50 sex ratio). Then  among the offspring  one male per sire and 120 females were randomly selected to be breeders of the next generation. During the genetic selection process over seven generations  the best male per sire (i.e. 30 males) and the best 120 females were selected at each generation to be breeders of the next generation. The choice of the “best” animals was based on their estimated breeding values (EBV) that were calculated according to the genetic evaluation strategies described below. Each selected male was randomly mated to four of the selected females  avoiding individuals from the same sire family. The population and phenotypes were generated to match the previously described experimental data design. Individuals in each generation were assigned to groups of eight animals  with each group originating from four full-sib families and each family contributing two progeny. Individual phenotypes (5 records per animal  corresponding to 5 weeks of fattening) were constructed according to a multiple trait model that considered ADG as a different trait for each week. Average daily gain of each animal was computed for each week as the sum of: a week effect  the animal’s direct genetic effect for the corresponding week  the indirect genetic effects of the seven other pen mates for the corresponding week  a week-specific group effect  and a pseudo-permanent effect (correlated within animal):   (=<U+2009>Eq. () without litter effects). For each generation  multivariate normal distributions with unstructured covariance matrices were used to simulate the random effect values for each time point (genetic effects  group effect and pseudo-permanent effect). To stick as close as possible to reality  (co)variance values used in the unstructured matrices were close to those obtained with the SAD model in the data analysis step (detailed values in Additional file ). For the genetic effects  to better assess the impact of the correlation between direct and indirect effects on selection response  we considered three sets of parameters for the genetic (co)variance matrix to mimic weak  moderate  and strong genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects. For these sets  the genetic covariance matrix was the same as that obtained in the data analysis part of the study but three different sets of values were assigned to the direct–indirect covariances: values similar to those estimated in the data analysis part of the study (strong antagonism)  those values divided by 2 (moderate antagonism) or by 4 (weak antagonism). Direct and indirect breeding values of the founders were simulated as for the other random effects. Then  the direct and indirect breeding values of an offspring were simulated as the average breeding value of its parents plus a Mendelian sampling deviation  which was sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with covariance corresponding to half of the genetic covariance matrix. Three selection scenarios were investigated. In scenario (1)  a SAD model that ignored IGE was used to predict genetic effects [  SAD1-11 for all random effect functions] and the sum of the weekly direct EBV was used as the selection criterion. In scenarios (2) and (3)  a SAD model (same orders and degrees for the polynomial functions as those selected in the data analysis part of the study) with IGE was used to predict direct and indirect genetic effects for each time point [Eq. () with litter effects excluded]. The estimate of the total breeding value for each time point (i.e. weekly TEBV) was then computed as the sum of the direct EBV plus 7 times the indirect EBV of the corresponding time point leading to five TEBV per animal. In scenario (2)  the selection criterion was the TEBV of the first week  while the sum of the weekly TEBV was used as the selection criterion in scenario (3). Variance components were estimated with the SAD model that included IGE [selection strategies (2) and (3)] or not [selection strategy (1)] using the 4800 records of the 960 offspring of the base population. Then  variance components were fixed to their estimates and considered as known to predict EBV in the different generations of the selection population. The simulation was replicated 150 times. After all replicates were run  we assessed the capability of the SAD model with IGE to correctly account for the longitudinal structure of the data by assessing the standard deviation and the mean bias of each estimated variance component. Responses to the three selection strategies were compared based on the mean ADG in each generation. Mean ADG was 26.5 g/d for week 1  increased by 50% from week 1 to 3  and then remained constant (Table ). This increase was associated with a small decrease in the coefficient of variation for ADG (38% for week 1 and <U+2009>26% for week 5). Weekly ADG ranged from 0.7 to 89.0 g/d  which is quite large. After selection of models  we retained the SAD1-11 model for all random effect functions and a polynomial function of degree 1 for the cross antedependence parameter  that models the covariance between the direct and indirect genetic effects. The likelihood ratio test comparing this full SAD model to the same SAD model in which IGE were excluded was 40.52 (8 degrees of freedom). Estimates of variances of the pseudo-permanent  litter  and group effects for each week and their correlations between weeks that were obtained from the parameter estimates of the SAD model are presented in Figs.    and   respectively. The pseudo-permanent effect variance increased with time from 23.1 to 52.8 (g/d). The ratio of the standard error to the pseudo-permanent effect variance was quite stable over time (~<U+2009>0.03). Estimates of correlations between the pseudo-permanent effects for different weeks were rather low and not significantly different from 0  except between consecutive weeks from week 2 to week 5  for which they were low and negative[-<U+2009>0.08 (±<U+2009>0.02) for weeks 2 to 3  -<U+2009>0.13 (±<U+2009>0.02) for weeks 3 to 4  and -<U+2009>0.18 (±<U+2009>0.03) for weeks 4 to 5]. The variance of litter effects decreased with time from 8.7 to 4.2 (g/d). Estimates of correlations between the litter effects for the different weeks were always positive and tended to decrease with the time interval between weeks. These correlations were higher between the four last weeks (ranging from 0.37 to 0.84) than between week 1 and the other weeks (ranging from 0.14 to 0.38). The estimate of the variance of the group effect increased with time from 5.7 to 16.4 (g/d). Estimates of correlations between the group effects of consecutive weeks tended to be negative (ranging from -<U+2009>0.20 to -<U+2009>0.26) and null otherwise. Estimates of pseudo-environmental variances for each week (on the diagonal  SE in brackets) and of correlations between weeks (below the diagonal.) Estimates of litter variances for each week (on the diagonal  SE in brackets) and of correlations between weeks (below the diagonal) Estimates of group variances for each week (on the diagonal  SE in brackets) and of correlations between weeks (below the diagonal) Estimates of genetic variances and correlations are in Fig. . Estimates of genetic variances were not significantly different between consecutive weeks for both direct and indirect genetic effects. However  the observed general trend was an increase of the direct genetic variance from weeks 1 to 3 [from 8.03 to 13.47 (g/d)] followed by a decrease [6.20 (g/d) at week 5]  and a decrease of the indirect genetic variance [from 0.44 to 0.22 (g/d)] from weeks 1 to 4. Then  for week 5  the indirect genetic variance increased but the associated standard error was substantial [0.31 (±<U+2009>0.18)]. Estimates of correlations between the direct genetic effects for different weeks were moderate to high (ranging from 0.46 to 0.86) and tended to decrease with the time interval between measurements. The same trend was observed for the indirect genetic effects for weeks 2 to 5 (correlations ranging from 0.62 to 0.91). Estimates of correlations of indirect genetic effects of the first week with those of other weeks did not follow the same pattern and were weaker (ranging from 0.33 to 0.47). Estimates of genetic correlations between direct and indirect effects were negative within (ranging from -<U+2009>0.57 to -<U+2009>0.89) and between weeks (ranging from -<U+2009>0.33 to -<U+2009>0.84). Estimates of genetic variances for each week (on the diagonal  SE in brackets) and of correlations between weeks and between direct and indirect genetic effects (below the diagonal) Heritability estimates are in Table . Estimates of direct heritability were moderate for weeks 1 to 4  ranging from 0.15 to 0.24  and its associated standard error was stable over time (0.02 to 0.03). For week 5  the estimate of direct heritability was lower [0.08 (±<U+2009>0.02)]. The estimate of the heritability of indirect genetic effects ( was moderate (ranging from 0.16 to 0.44). Although estimates of indirect heritability were not significantly different between weeks  we observed that this heritability was 2.5 times higher for week 1 than for the other weeks. Estimates of total heritability were low to moderate (ranging from 0.05 to 0.19) and were associated with large standard errors (0.04 to 0.10). Although estimates of total heritability were not significantly different between weeks  we observed that it tended to decrease from week 1 to 4. Estimates of variance components converged for both SAD models (with or without IGE) for only a percentage of the simulation replicates (for 79  77 and 48% of the replicates for the scenarios with weak  moderate  and strong simulated antagonism between direct and indirect genetic effects  respectively). Consequently  replicates for which one of the two SAD models did not converge were removed from the analysis. Table  includes the bias and variability over the replicates that converged for each variance component from the SAD model that included IGE. Bias and variability of variance components were not affected by size of the genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects  except for estimates of the indirect genetic variance and indirect genetic correlation. Coefficients of variation () were in the same range for the direct genetic and group variances (~<U+2009>19 and 17%  respectively) but were higher for the indirect genetic variances and increased from 39 to 58% as the genetic antagonism decreased. The direct genetic variance was correctly estimated (the mean relative bias    ranged from 1 to 2%)  while the group variance tended to be slightly underestimated (mean relative bias<U+2009>~<U+2009>-<U+2009>4%) and the indirect genetic variance was overestimated (mean relative bias ranging from 18 to 27%). All correlations were correctly estimated  with a bias close to 0  except the indirect genetic correlation  which was slightly overestimated (bias ranging from -<U+2009>0.09 to -<U+2009>0.03). The standard deviations of the group and the direct genetic correlations were in the same range (~<U+2009>0.07)  while the standard deviation for the direct–indirect genetic correlation was higher (~<U+2009>0.15) and the standard deviation for the indirect genetic effects was the highest (~<U+2009>0.26). Changes in the mean ADG per generation are shown in Fig.  for the three selection strategies and the three sets of genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects. For the three scenarios  the mean ADG increased linearly with generation when a SAD model including IGE was used to predict EBV. For the three sets of genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects  the increase was highest when selection was performed using the sum of the weekly TEBV obtained with a SAD model that included IGE. Selection on the TEBV of week 1 obtained with a SAD model that includes IGE or on the direct EBV obtained with a SAD model that ignores IGE resulted in similar increases in ADG per generation  except when a strong genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects was simulated. In that case  the model with IGE outperformed the model without IGE  for which there was no response to selection. For all selection strategies  response in ADG declined as the genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects increased. Changes in the mean ADG across generations for each selection strategy. SAD–DGE-selection criterion: sum of the weekly direct EBV obtained with a SAD model without IGE; SAD1-selection criterion: sum of the weekly TEBV obtained with a SAD model with IGE; SAD2-selection criterion: TEBV of the first week obtained with a SAD model with IGE. Straight line  line with (dot) and line with<U+2009>+<U+2009>represent strong  moderate and weak simulated genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects  respectively The effects of the different selection strategies and scenarios across the different weeks of growth were also explored by assessing the mean ADG by week in the 7th generation  relative to the base generation (Fig. ). When a weak to moderate genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects was simulated  the same pattern was observed: ADG increased for all weeks and for all selection strategies. As expected  response to selection at week 1 was higher with selection on the TEBV of week 1 obtained with a SAD model that included IGE. The pattern was different with a strong genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects. On the one hand  with selection on the sum of the weekly TEBV obtained with a SAD model with IGE  the mean ADG increased for weeks 1  3  4 and 5  while no changes were observed for week 2. On the other hand  with selection on the TEBV of week 1 obtained with a SAD model with IGE  there was a high increase in the mean ADG for week 1  a clear decrease for weeks 2 and 3  no changes for week 4  and a moderate increase for the last week of observation. When a SAD model without IGE was used to select animals  the pattern was the opposite (increases in weeks 2 and 3 and reductions in weeks 1 and 5).

A large number of parameters (100) are necessary to model the covariance structure of our data using an unstructured model with the same random effects as described here. Several flexible approaches exist to model the covariance structure of the data with a reduced number of parameters  such as random regression (RR)  SAD []  and character process (CP) models [  ]. Among these  we chose the SAD approach for several reasons: (1) it relaxes the stationary correlations assumption made in CP models []; (2) it has been shown to better fit the data compared to the RR model in many situations [    ]; (3) it is less sensitive to the drawbacks reported for the RR model  such as border effects [] and inability to properly estimate correlations that decrease rapidly over time []; and (4) it generally requires fewer parameters than the CP model to model covariance structures. The SAD approach has been used to perform genetic studies of several longitudinal traits  such as repeated measurements of weight  feed intake  reproduction traits [    ]. It has also been used to model residual (co)variances in models for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection in the framework of functional mapping [] of longitudinal traits in animals [] and plants []. To our knowledge  this is the first time that a SAD approach has been used in quantitative genetic mixed models to model a trait with indirect genetic effects. It should be noted that we tried to apply a RR model to these data using the REML approach but the estimation procedure never converged. The mean weekly ADG reported here are consistent with those reported over the whole fattening period under a feed restriction of 80% by Drouilhet et al. [] (40.4 g/d). Because of the limited amount of food  the ADG of restricted animals was lower than that of animals fed ad libitum from the same population of rabbits []. In addition  there was an effect of feeding restriction on the growth pattern  with the deceleration phase and the inflexion point of the growth curve being delayed. Because animals were raised in collective cages  we included indirect genetic effects in the model to account for the competition between individuals to access feed. In a previous analysis of the same dataset that did not consider the longitudinal characteristics of the data  Piles et al. [] confirmed that indirect genetic effects play an important role in ADG under restricted feeding. The significance of IGE was also confirmed in our study when the longitudinal characteristics of the data were accounted for by the likelihood ratio test that compared the SAD model with and without IGE. The importance of indirect genetic effects on the ADG of group-housed animals has also been reported in other species such as pigs [  ] and in other breeding conditions (e.g. conventional barren  enriched pens []). Estimating IGE can be challenging [] because the statistical power for detecting IGE is determined by the group-population structure [  ] and there is a risk of confounding IGE with environmental (i.e. group) effects  leading to non-identifiability of the (co)variance components of the social model []. Even if the structure of the design in our study (small group size  large number of groups and 4 * 2 full-sibs per group) meets the requirements to detect IGE and a group effect was included in the model as a random effect to help identifiability of parameters  identifiability of the (co)variance components is not guaranteed []. Exploring the information matrix  helps to detect identifiability problems for an unknown parameter vector  []. The condition number (square root of the ratio of the first to the last eigenvalue) of the information matrix  of the SAD model used here was large (512)  which may lead to the occurrence of identifiability problems. Nonetheless  the condition number of the submatrix of  that considered only the first regression coefficients of the SAD functions for all random terms (11 * 11 matrix) was equal to 35  which indicates that dependencies of parameter estimates were not between parameters of different random effects. In fact  close inspection of the correlation matrix among parameter estimates (Fig.   ) showed that correlation between regression coefficients within polynomial functions were high  while correlations between SAD parameters related to different random effects were low. For instance  the correlations between parameter estimates for the genetic effects and those related to the group effect were moderately high (ranging from -<U+2009><U+2009>0.57 to 0.56  and averaging 0.14)  which indicates that the information provided by the data was sufficient to disentangle common environment effects from indirect genetic effects in the SAD model. To better understand the relationship between variance components of the random effects obtained with estimates of the SAD model  we also computed the correlation between estimates at the level of the (co)variance components using the 10 000 random samples of  in . The corresponding 100 * 100 matrix is shown in Additional file . Correlations between (co)variance component estimates of different random effects were generally low. Those of the five indirect genetic variances with the five group variance estimates were less than 0.27 (in absolute value)  while those of the 25 direct–indirect genetic covariances with the group (co)variance estimates were less than 0.18 (in absolute value). Such results favor the possibility to separate the variance estimates of the different random effects in the model. Correlation matrix between parameter estimates. For group  litter and permanent random effects (“perm”); parameters are presented in the following order: the two regression coefficients of the antedependence parameters  then the two regression coefficients of the innovation variance. For the genetic effects (“gen”)  the parameters are presented in the following order: the first six parameters correspond to the regression coefficients of the antedependence parameters for the direct (first and second parameters)  indirect (third and fourth parameters) effects  and the regression coefficients of the cross-antedependence parameters (fifth and sixth parameters). The four last parameters correspond to the regression coefficient for the innovation variance of the direct (seventh and eighth parameters) and indirect (ninth and tenth parameters) genetic effects. Cell with a (dot) indicates an absolute correlation value higher than 0.6 The relative importance of the litter effect was moderate  in accordance with previous studies [  ]. It decreased with time (from 18 to 5% of the total variance)  probably as a consequence of the well-known decrease over time of the maternal influence on progeny performance [  ]. The relative importance of the group effect (approximately 15% of the total variance) was in line with previous results in other species (18% []). Because residuals were assumed to be independent among the individuals of a given group  the variance of the group effect included in the model originates from both social interactions between individuals (correlated residual effects) and physical differences between pens (location in the building for instance) []. Accounting for the environmental dependence between group mates in this manner is possible if  and only if  the covariance among residuals of group mates is positive []. This condition was verified week by week for this population in a previous study (correlation between residuals of group mates over weeks were 0.11  0.17  0.19  0.18 for weeks 1 to 4  respectively) []. The slight increase in the relative importance of the group effect over the study period (from 11 to 20% of the total variance) could be related with this previously reported slight increase in the weekly correlation between residuals of group mates. We obtained moderate estimates of the direct heritability  which is consistent with previous estimates reported in the literature for the same species 0.22 [] and 0.18 []. The decrease in the direct genetic variance  and thus in heritability  at week 5 is probably related to the change in feed composition that occurred that particular week. The moderate heritability of indirect genetic effects is in line with those reported in previous studies for pigs (~<U+2009>0.13 [] and<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.39 []). It is interesting to note that the indirect genetic effects were higher for week 1  which is in accordance with studies on the behavior of animals raised in groups that report a higher level of aggressiveness at mixing  which reflects the establishment of social hierarchy that generally occurs within 3 days after mixing. In the same population as used here  Dalmau et al. [] observed signs of antagonistic behavior such as biting  displacement  and animals jumping on top of each other over the whole growing period but especially during week 1. In mice and pigs  indirect genetic effects are known to induce antagonistic behavior at mixing [  ]. Furthermore  we observed that the genetic correlation of the IGE in week 1 with the IGE in other weeks was lower than the correlation between IGE in weeks 2  3  4  and 5  which also indicates that IGE expressed just after mixing is a different trait from IGE expressed later in life. The genetic correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects was negative regardless of the week considered  which indicates that individuals with a positive (direct) breeding value for their own growth tend to have a negative (indirect) breeding value for the growth of their cage mates and vice versa. This is consistent with the idea of competition between animals for a fixed amount of feed. Nonetheless  although we found no evidence of lack of identifiability for the parameters in our analysis  we suspect that the estimates of the genetic correlations between direct and indirect genetic effects are higher than their real value. An antagonism probably exists between direct and indirect genetic effects but not with such a strong negative correlation. The antagonism of these two effects has also been reported in previous studies on restricted feeding. Muir [] described a moderate to high negative (-<U+2009>0.56) genetic correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects on weight at 6 weeks of age of Japanese quail in groups of 16 birds. However  Bergsma et al. [] found a neutral relationship between direct and indirect genetic effects for pigs in groups of 6 to 12 pen mates of the same sex. Based on our results  we hypothesize that the growth of animals under a restricted feeding regime can be improved and that the delay of their growth curve can be shortened by reducing the negative impact of indirect effects  especially during the first week after mixing. One way to do this is to provide an enabling environment that decreases indirect effects by limiting the feed restriction during the first week after mixing (85 instead of 75% of ad libitum feed intake instead  for instance). Currently  this strategy is applied on several rabbits farms (Tudela F.  personal communication). Another strategy is to perform genetic selection to improve the ADG  as investigated here by simulation. For the simulations  unstructured (co)variance matrices were used to simulate the data and the SAD model was used to estimate variance components for different weeks. To obtain convergence of complex SAD models  such as those used in this study; the most appropriate method involves starting with a simple SAD model (low antedependence orders and low degrees for the polynomial functions) and to increase the degree and order step-by-step by using estimates of the preceding reduced model as starting values. For the simulations  we did not use this method (because it required too much computing time) and applied the full SAD models right away. This explains the lack of convergence of the SAD model for several replicates. However  it should be noted that the percentage of replicates that did not converge increased with the degree of genetic antagonism between direct and indirect genetic effects. This confirms that when one parameter (the genetic correlation in our case) is close to the boundary of the parameter space  estimation of model parameters becomes difficult. Using a larger dataset is one approach to overcome this problem []. Across the replicates that converged  the bias in estimates of the variance components and the correlations between weeks were moderate  which indicates that the SAD model was able to estimate the different variance components. Nonetheless  it should be noted that the indirect genetic variances tended to be overestimated  while the group variances were slightly underestimated  which confirms the difficulties (but not the impossibility) of separating IGE from group effects. Thus  in practice  when applying such a complex model  it is highly recommended to inspect closely the average information matrix to determine whether the data structure supports the fitted model. We proposed three selection scenarios. All scenarios used the SAD model to compute TEBV and took the longitudinality of the data and the possibility that ADG corresponds to different traits at different time points into account. In scenario (1)  IGE were not accounted for in the SAD model. As expected  applying a model with IGE for selection led to a larger increase in ADG than when IGE were ignored in the evaluation model [comparison of selection strategies (1) and (3)]. The benefit of including IGE in the evaluation model by simulation was reported previously []. The difference between the two selection strategies decreased as the genetic antagonism between direct and indirect effects decreased and is expected to be low in case of cooperation instead of competition between animals. In the extreme case of a strong direct–indirect genetic antagonism  the mean ADG was not improved by selection if IGE were not considered in the evaluation model. Based on the five TEBV per animal (5 weeks)  different selection indexes can be computed  with different weights for each week [selection strategies (2) and (3)]. In scenario (2)  since the most important negative antagonistic behaviors between cage mates occurred during the first week after mixing  the weight was 1 for week 1 and 0 for the other weeks. In scenario (3)  we considered equal weights for all weeks. Response to selection for scenario (2) was as expected: a strong increase in ADG for the first week after mixing. However  this response was associated with a detrimental effect on ADG for the two following weeks when data were simulated with a strong genetic antagonism between direct and indirect genetic effects. Such negative responses for weeks 2 and 3 were the consequence of negative correlations of the TEBV for week 1 with those of weeks 2 or 3 (-<U+2009>0.30 and -<U+2009>0.07  respectively)  while the correlation was null with week 4 and slightly positive with week 5 (0.05). To avoid this detrimental correlated response  the selection criterion should take all weeks or at least weeks 1 and 2 into account. When the genetic antagonism between direct and indirect genetic effects was weak to moderate  correlations between TEBV for different weeks were positive and the detrimental effects for ADG in weeks 2 and 3 were not observed. However  using equal weights for all weeks in the selection criterion resulted in a higher mean ADG over weeks than when the TEBV of only the first week was used for selection regardless of the importance of the genetic antagonism between direct and indirect genetic effects. The selection scenarios (2) and (3) reflected two extreme strategies but it would be possible to refine the selection index by considering other sets of weights for the different weeks. It would probably be beneficial to increase the weight for week 2 to avoid a decrease in ADG by applying selection for this particular week in case of a strong genetic antagonism between direct and indirect genetic effects  or to build a selection index as a combination of the TEBV for week 1 and the direct EBV for the other weeks. Note that the simulations were performed under the assumption that there were no genotype-by-environment interaction within a week  i.e. the direct and indirect genetic effects of an animal were the same regardless of the direct and indirect genetic effects of its group mates. This assumption may be questionable. Using a SAD model  we showed that IGE that act on ADG vary over time and that IGE are more important during the first week after mixing. Combining TEBV obtained from a SAD model that includes IGE in a selection index is the most effective strategy to improve longitudinal ADG when IGE occur.

Male  were found to converge initially at a faster rate than female   with approximately 90% convergence achieved within seven generations across both sexes. This study of commercial data provides some support to results from theoretical and simulation studies that the source of selective advantage from OCS comes from . The implication that genomic selection (GS) improves estimation of  should allow for even greater genetic gains for a predefined rate of inbreeding  once the synergistic benefits of combining OCS and GS are realised. Selection theory [  ] states that sustained genetic gain () is obtained from creating a covariance between the Mendelian sampling terms () and long-term genetic contributions () of selection candidates. This in turn provides the framework for an effective solution for the management of genomic diversity  due to the relationship between  and rate of inbreeding (). Various methods [      ] have been proposed for managing genetic resources using this framework  which has become known as optimal contributions selection (OCS). OCS has been shown to generate greater  for a predefined   and to generate lower  for a given   compared to earlier methods that used truncation selection [  ]. So far  the source of the selective advantage provided by OCS has only been investigated in theoretical and simulation studies [    ]  with the conclusion that it arises from placing greater selection pressure on estimates of Mendelian sampling terms of selection candidates () than in truncation selection. This study is the first to test these predictions in a real population by assessing the weightings placed on estimated breeding value () versus   both before and during OCS. Given the findings of Avendaño et al. [] and Grundy et al. []  the following three hypotheses were tested: (1) OCS places more emphasis on  compared to  for determining the initial selection of parents; (2) OCS places more emphasis on  compared to  for determining which parents make a non-zero ; and (3) OCS places more emphasis on  compared to  for determining the magnitude of . Timescales for the convergence of  of selected parents were also examined. The commercial population analysed in this study consisted of 115 428 pigs comprising a single closed nucleus line that was bred continuously between 12th April 1997 and 16th August 2012  with pedigree information available for all individuals. The line was developed and also expanded over this period  leading up to the cohort studied here.  that were calculated using a weighted index of traits were used at the time of selection  but the  used for assessment in this study were only available at a single time point (16th August 2012). Individuals without a calculated  on themselves or on their parents were excluded to ensure that the estimated Mendelian sampling term    could be calculated for each individual. This left a total of 107 895 individuals (54 881 males and 53 014 females) for analysis  with the earliest individual being born on 23rd February 1999  which is denoted as time . Woolliams et al. [] defined the long-term genetic contribution    of an ancestor  to an individual  as the proportion of the genes of  that are expected to be derived by descent from ancestor . Using this definition of   each individual  had its long-term contribution () calculated as follows: where the sum  was over all individuals born in the 2012 cohort and  was the total number of animals in the cohort. Generation intervals were based on the definition of Bijma and Woolliams []  such that the total number of generations at time  was defined as   where the sum is over all individuals  born from time 0 up to and including time . Individuals of generation  were defined as all individuals born at time  for which . Using this definition  10.4 generations were born between 23rd February 1999 and 16th August 2012  representing a generation interval of <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.29 years  with the base generation () consisting of individuals born between 23rd February 1999 and 21st May 2000. The value of  for individual  in a closed population will converge towards an asymptote over time []. To ensure the validity of the results from this study   was required to approach convergence. To test this convergence  contributions were examined as a function of time after birth for all individuals selected as parents and born during 1999. The final contributions for this 1999 cohort were those obtained from Eq. ()  i.e. their average contribution to the 2012 cohort  i.e. 13 years later. Contributions of the 1999 cohort to the cohorts born in each of the intermediate years  2000–2011  were also calculated  denoted as   where  denotes time after birth  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  …  12 years. For each intermediate year  the following linear regression model was used to determine the degree of convergence in that year: where  is an error term and both the response and explanatory variables are adjusted by   which is the mean of the final contributions for all the individuals selected as parents and born during 1999. At convergence   and . This model was applied separately to contributions of males and females. A similar methodology to that applied annually was used to assess the convergence of  on a generational scale using all individuals selected as parents in the base generation   i.e. . Contributions of individuals in the base generation to each intermediate generation were calculated for generations 1 through 8 as   where   and final contributions were calculated as those made to   i.e. the final complete generation. This final generation consisted of individuals born between 6th December 2010 and 5th May 2012. An OCS algorithm was introduced for selection in this population in 2002 and was based on the approach described by Newman et al. [] and Kinghorn []. An iterative algorithm was applied to calculate a response surface  with the aim of achieving maximal  for a given . Prior to the introduction of this algorithm  selection had been by truncation with ad hoc restrictions aimed at controlling inbreeding. The full transition to this method of selection was completed by the end of 2005 and was used throughout the remainder of the period studied. Individuals were assigned to either the Pre-OCS group  the OCS group  or neither of these groups using  defined above. Comparisons between and within the Pre-OCS and OCS groups were conducted to test the three hypotheses described below. A total of 17 165 individuals born between 23rd February 1999 and 7th December 2001 were assigned to the Pre-OCS group  which represented two generations with . Since the OCS algorithm was introduced in 2002  only two generations were available prior to the change to OCS. A further 25 068 individuals  born between 23rd February 2006 and 7th October 2008  were assigned to the OCS group  also consisting of two generations  . Analysing two generations in the OCS period maintained consistency with the Pre-OCS period in the analyses. In addition to   the selection score () was determined for all individuals in the Pre-OCS and OCS groups from the recorded birth of offspring (  if the individual had offspring  and  otherwise); it is clear that  implies . Table  shows the numbers of individuals in the Pre-OCS and OCS groups by sex and contribution history. Estimates of Mendelian sampling terms for each individual     were calculated as the deviation of the individual’s  from the average  of its parents. In the analyses that follow  the  were calculated as deviations from the mean EBV of contemporaries  defined by all animals born within 30 days before or after birth of that individual. This on average resulted in 1497 contemporaries. Unless stated otherwise  the remaining references to  refer to this adjusted . No adjustment for  was required since it has an expectation of 0 for all animals. The average reliability of the  across both sexes () was approximately 0.16 in the pre-OCS period  increasing to 0.25 thereafter. Selection took place at off-test (~<U+2009>6 months of age)  so both sexes had about the same volume of information available for estimating their initial breeding values. In 2012  the average  across both sexes was 0.28. Inbreeding coefficients () for individuals were obtained by subtracting 1 from the diagonal elements of the numerator relationship matrix []. Annual rates of inbreeding were calculated for the birth cohorts at year  using two methods: (i)   calculated as: where  is the average  for all individuals in the cohort; and (ii)   calculated as: where the sum is over all individuals in the cohort and  is defined by Eq. ()  regardless of convergence. Bivariate regressions were used to determine whether  or  provided the source of the selective advantages before and during OCS. The source of the selective advantage was examined for: (1) which individuals were initially selected as parents  (2) which parents went on to make a non-zero  to the population  and for (3) determined the magnitude of . Bivariate regression was used to determine whether  or  was the principal variable that determined the initial selection of an individual as a parent  separately for the Pre-OCS and OCS ancestors. A generalised linear model with a binomial distribution and a logit link function was fitted together with a parameter for over-dispersion  assuming a beta-binomial distribution for  conditional on the fixed effects. Let the probability of selection for individual  be   then if  is the logistic link function  the following model was fitted: where  is an intercept and  and  are the respective regression coefficients on  and . Changes in deviance conditional on all other model terms were used to assess the relative importance of individual model terms. This analysis was conducted separately for each sex using the ‘quasi-binomial’ option in the ‘glm’ package of R  which estimates over-dispersion from the Pearson residuals. To examine the maintenance of contributions over time  models were fitted only to the subset of individuals that had been selected as parents  i.e. conditional on   because long-term contributions are always 0 for individuals that are not selected. For this subset   if   and 0 otherwise. The methods described for Step 1 were repeated with  instead of   such that  in Eq. (). An intrinsic property of OCS is the targeting of a desired magnitude of  for each individual. The source of the selective advantage for determining the magnitude of  was assessed using: (1) all individuals that were initially selected as parents  i.e.   regardless of their long-term contributions  and (2) restricted to parents with a non-zero long-term contribution (). The strength of the relationships of the magnitude of  with both  and  were investigated separately for each sex in the Pre-OCS group and in the OCS group using the following linear regression model: Finally for the selected subgroup with   contour plots of  against  and  were used to visualise and aid in interpreting the relationship of  and  with the magnitude of . Contour plots were produced using the ‘akima’ package [] of R v2.15. A plot of the accumulation of  over time is in Additional file : Figure S1  starting with the first individual born in the Pre-OCS group until the last selected individual  which was born on 23rd September 2011. The rate of accumulation was relatively constant over time  with a levelling off of the cumulative  midway through 2011  which reflects individuals that were currently undergoing selection. The regression coefficient of accumulated  on time was 2.14<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 per day  equating to an average generation interval of 468 days. Figure a illustrates the male and female adjusted R-squared for the model of Eq. () for each year. The adjusted R-squared increased rapidly at first for both males and females  with males exceeding 75% after 3 years. For males   continued to converge but at a slower rate  reaching an adjusted R-squared of approximately 95% by 9 years. Females were slower to approach convergence  with the adjusted R-squared only exceeding 75% after 5 years  but still exceeding 95% within 9 years. For selected individuals born in 1999  the standard deviation of  within the 2012 cohort was 1.05<U+2009>×<U+2009>10.  Adjusted R-squared of linear regression of the final assumed long-term genetic contribution (in 2012) of all selected males and females born in 1999 () on their contributions to individuals born in each year  from 2000 to 2011.  Adjusted R-squared of linear regression of the final assumed long-term genetic contribution (in generation 9) of all selected males and females born in generation 0 on their contributions to individuals born in each generation  from 1 to 8 The adjusted R-squared for the model of Eq. () on a generational basis is in Fig. b. This trend line had greater linearity than the yearly analysis. For this analysis  males again initially converged at a faster rate than females  with both sexes achieving an average adjusted R-squared of approximately 75% in five generations. For individuals in the base generation  the standard deviation of  in generation 9 was 1.09<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. Plots of  and  over time are shown in Fig. . The elevated value for  observed in 2006 was strongly influenced by a prolific male that sired 1419 offspring  which alone contributed 0.012 to   representing 63.5% of the total contributions to  for the year. The impact of this prolific individual would not be expected on a plot of   since its impact is spread across future generations beyond the endpoint in Fig. .  is prospective in the sense that it measures the impact further down the pedigree arising from an individual’s gene flow [  ]  whereas  is retrospective in the sense that it measures the accumulated impact of changes in contributions across all previous generations. Annual rate of inbreeding based on pedigree  and long-term genetic contributions ) Estimates of regression coefficients from the logistic regression of the selection score  on  and  are in Table . There was no evidence of extra-binomial variation among Pre-OCS females (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) but there was significant evidence in the remaining subgroups (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001): the estimated parameters for over dispersion were 1.02  1.08  3.7 and 2.3 for Pre-OCS and OCS females  and Pre-OCS and OCS males  respectively. In the Pre-OCS group   was negatively associated with selection in males (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  but was positively associated with selection in females (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). In both male and female OCS groups  both  and  were significant factors (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) in promoting selection as a parent  with more positive values of either favouring selection  but with  having greater regression coefficient estimates. The relative importance of these two terms differed slightly between male and female candidates. Estimates from univariate logistic regression are in Additional file : Table S1. Estimates of regression coefficients from the logistic regression of  on  and on  in the OCS period are in Table . In the Pre-OCS group  there was no significant effect of  for either sex but a positive association with  was observed for the females (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). In the OCS males   was positively associated with maintaining  (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  whereas  was negatively associated with maintaining a positive contribution across generations  (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  conditional on initial selection as a parent. Among OCS females  both  (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and  (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) were positively associated with maintaining a positive contribution. Estimates of univariate regression coefficients are in Additional file : Table S2 and show that  in these models   and  were always positively correlated with maintaining non-zero contributions. There was no evidence of extra-binomial variation (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) for any of the four sub-groups. Estimates of regression coefficients from the bivariate regression of  on  and  conditional only on  are in Table  and those conditional on  are in Table . The additional restriction imposed by  substantially increased the standard errors of the estimates and  as a result  estimates in Table  do not differ qualitatively from those in Table  if these uncertainties are taken into consideration. In males (conditional on )   had a significant effect on  during both Pre-OCS (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and OCS (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01). In females (conditional on )  neither  nor  had a significant effect on  Pre-OCS  but in the female OCS group   was a significant determinant of  (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Estimates of univariate regression coefficients  conditional only on  and conditional on  are in Additional file : Tables S3 and S4  respectively. A contour map illustrating the relationship of  with  and with  is in Fig.  for selected males with  and in Fig.  for selected females with . More active control of  was generally observed in the OCS selection period compared to the Pre-OCS period. There was a shift in the coloured area of the plot both horizontally to the right and vertically upwards following the introduction of OCS  which shows that animals with  had higher  and  in the OCS period than animals with  in the Pre-OCS period. Examining the colour dispersal of the Pre-OCS contour plot revealed that   along the x-axis  was the more important determinant for the magnitude of  in the Pre-OCS period. In the OCS period  there was a change in the distribution of   with warmer colours found predominantly in the upper-most half of the contour plot. This demonstrates that after the introduction of OCS  the   on the y-axis  was more important for determining the magnitude of . For males  the largest concentration of warmer colour in the OCS plot was in the upper right hand corner of the plot (Fig. )  highlighting that both  and  were important for males with the very highest .

Due to differences in the maximum value of  between the sexes  a different scaling of  was used between the male and female plots The research reported here was made possible by the availability of data from a single  large (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>107 895) nucleus breeding line from Genus-PIC. This was a novel opportunity to use hypothesis-driven analyses to assess the source of the selective advantage under different selection strategies using longitudinal data. The particular hypotheses investigated were that adoption of OCS  to maximise gain conditional on the target rate of inbreeding  shifts the emphasis of selective advantages from  towards estimates of Mendelian sampling terms    based on both theory and previously published simulations []. The outcome of the analyses provides some qualified support for these hypotheses in females. To maximise accuracy and minimise bias in an assessment of OCS  a number of conditions are required: (i) adequate periods of convergence for each method of selection; (ii)  that are relevant to decision-making; (iii) stability in breeding objectives  selection pressures and rates of inbreeding; and  (iv) adequate population size over time. Not all these conditions were met in this commercial operation. In relation to (i)  analysis of convergence of contributions for selected individuals (Fig. ) suggested that eight generations were required to reach convergence  rather than the five generations found in simulations []  and this was achieved only for the Pre-OCS group. However  the process of convergence within the OCS group was well advanced after five generations (Fig. ) and this is supported by the evidence from the Pre-OCS group where the correlation between contributions at 5 and 8 generations after birth was 0.86. In relation to (ii)  an individual’s  and  are dynamic and increase in accuracy as more information becomes available from descendants. Selection decisions were made using  and  that were available at the time of selection  but for the current study these values were only available at a single time point (16th August 2012). Therefore  the accuracies of  and  used in the analyses varied among individuals. Differences in accuracy are greatest between animals selected as parents  i.e. those that have offspring  and those that were not selected. Therefore  analyses conditional on initial selection as a parent (steps 2 and 3) are likely to be less affected by variation in accuracies of  and  than analyses for step 1. In relation to (iii)  it is expected that changes in breeding objectives occur over time within a commercial population  and the approximate correlation between the selection index applied in 2000 and that applied in 2005 (calculated from the (co)variance matrix of the  in the indices and the two sets of weights applied) was only moderate at 0.39. It is clear from Table  that selection intensity increased after initial establishment and expansion of the line  which affects quantitative comparisons of Pre-OCS and OCS groups. In relation to (iv)  empirically  this population of more than 100 000 individuals born over the course of 15 years was sufficient to detect sources of selective advantages. The standard errors of the partial regression coefficients for  and  for selected males were relatively large compared to those for females  as a result of the higher selection intensity applied to males. This higher selection intensity in males increased the magnitude of the potential effects []  but also greatly reduced the sample size. One advantage of the study is that it was conducted on data collected on a real population rather than simulation  but this also means that day-to-day decision-making is inevitably driven by commercial requirements rather than strictly following selection recommendations. In summary  although the Pre-OCS group acted as a practical control for the OCS-group  the commercial setting of the data indicates that comparisons between the Pre-OCS and OCS groups should be considered qualitatively and with care. However  the comparison of outcomes from the OCS group with the theoretical expectations remains valid. The observed linear increase in the accumulation of  demonstrated a relatively uniform generation interval over time of approximately 468 days. Alternative generation intervals can be calculated for this population by either averaging the age of parents at birth of their first offspring (368 days)  or after the birth of the first offspring that is selected (415 days). The latter is closer in concept to the generation interval in quantitative genetics since it includes the concept of replacement  and moves towards that provided by   which is the length of time to renew the gene pool that is destined to maintain the population in the long term. There was evidence that the generation interval calculated from parent ages increased over time (results not shown) and this was likely associated with operational decisions concerned with expansion of the line (see Table ). The stochastic simulation work of Bijma and Woolliams [] and Woolliams et al. [] found that the generation interval calculated using  was shorter than that using the average age of parents of a cohort under simple mass selection with a pre-determined age structure. The primary reason for this qualitative difference between these two methods for calculating generation intervals is that there is a selective advantage to offspring born to younger parents in the mass selection scenario  since their parents have higher breeding values than the population average. With mixed-model evaluations  e.g. best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)  the genetic trend across cohorts is accounted for  which results in more effective selection among candidates of different ages. The OCS algorithm guides the optimum  over generations until convergence  through consideration of both an individual’s  as well as its degree of relatedness with the rest of the population. This approach is expected to reduce the  of individuals from over-represented families  allowing the selection of superior animals from families with lower . As a result  individuals with greater  are selected to provide comparatively larger  [  ]. This process results in the maximum gain () conditional on the target rate of inbreeding ()  since  (i.e. not ) and  (see Woolliams et al. []). In the case of perfect accuracy of  (e.g. with a heritability ) and no interdependence of generations  this would take the form of a linear allocation above a cut-off  whereby selected individuals would be those with  above a threshold and  is expected to be linearly related to   conditional on selection []. Where these conditions do not hold  the relationship between  and  will have additional random noise and the true breeding value or  will also influence . To examine these different aspects  the selection process was broken down into three consecutive steps  each more closely focused on the ultimate genetic contributors to the population  and each with its associated hypothesis. The first hypothesis was concerned with whether  or  was the principal factor that determined the selection of an individual to become a parent. In practice  the selection of an individual to become a parent  unlike the development of   is only influenced by selection decisions within a narrow time-period. For females   was observed to be the most important determinant for selection of an individual to become a parent  although it was unclear if this had emerged as a result of the introduction of OCS  in spite of the influence being stronger in the OCS group. The most convincing evidence for the importance of  in determining  when using OCS selection came from analyses that addressed the third hypothesis  which related the magnitude of  to  and   conditional on  being selected initially. Of the analyses conducted in this study  these analyses most closely followed a previous simulation study [] and directly examine the theoretical expectation that OCS will guide contributions in direct relation to  among animals that are initially selected. The footprint of OCS that was expected from the simulation study was observed among females of the OCS group  with  positively associated with  and dominating the influence of . However  the reverse was observed for males  for which inferences are made more difficult due to the large standard errors of the bivariate coefficients. It is possible that short-term commercial needs that do not follow the outcome of the OCS algorithm are more likely to occur among males  compared to females  as male selection opportunities are greater and offer a more rapid response to the need. This work represents the first evaluation in commercial practice of the impact and validation of the theory underlying OCS  which predicts a closer alignment of  with  than with . There was some evidence of a re-weighting in the emphasis of selection away from the  towards  in the final magnitude of   with females providing stronger evidence for these conclusions. The evidence from males was equivocal  in part because of higher selection intensity among males  leading to smaller numbers of males with which to conduct the regression analyses. As a result  this study provides some support to the assertion that there is an advantage in combining OCS with genomic information  which can achieve more accurate prediction of  at an earlier age  to generate greater genetic progress over time  without negatively impacting the rate of inbreeding.

In spite of typically very high mortality rates  a group of survivors was identified and genotyped on a 600K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to identify genetic differences between survivors  and age- and genetics-matched controls from unaffected flocks.  In a previous analysis of this dataset  a heritable component was identified and several regions that are associated with outcome of the infection were localized but none with a large effect. For complex traits that are determined by many genes  genomic prediction models using all SNPs across the genome simultaneously are expected to optimally exploit genomic information. In this study  we evaluated the diagnostic value of genomic estimated breeding values for predicting AI infection outcome within and across two highly pathogenic avian influenza viral strains and two genetic lines of layer chickens using receiver operating curves. We show that genomic prediction based on the 600K SNP chip has the potential to predict disease outcome especially within the same strain of virus (area under receiver operating curve above 0.7)  but did not predict well across genetic varieties (area under receiver operating curve of 0.43). Avian influenza (AI) is a devastating disease and the current approach that is used to control it is based on isolation and extermination of affected flocks in order to stop the spread of the virus. Alternative approaches  including the use of vaccines  have been only 60% effective in chickens [  ] due to the high mutation rate of the virus and lack of cross-protection between viral strains. Moreover  most countries do not allow importation of vaccinated birds due to the inability to distinguish between antibodies originating from the vaccine versus infection. Even in the case of high mortality rates caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infections  typically above 85% in unvaccinated birds []  there is usually a limited number of birds that survive following infection. Factors that underlie individual survival are likely multifactorial  but probably include a strong genetic component. Susceptibility to infectious disease (including influenza A virus) is highly heritable in humans [  ] and there is evidence from inbred lines of chickens that this is also true for viral diseases in poultry  including AI [   ]. A genetic approach using genotypes from the 600K Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip was undertaken by Drobik-Czwarno et al. [] to identify differences between survivors of two HPAI outbreaks (H5N2 in the US and H7N3 in Mexico) and their genetics- and age-matched controls from unaffected flocks. Heritability of survival to HPAI was estimated to be between 0.18 and 0.24  which indicated that almost 20% of the differences in survival could be attributed to genetics []. In addition  several of the genomic regions identified were associated with survival but none with a major effect  indicating a complex polygenic nature of resistance to the disease. An alternative to searching for causal mutations  is to use high-density SNP genotypes for genetic improvement of disease resistance by using all genetic markers across the genome to predict breeding values of selection candidates through the concept of genomic prediction and selection []. Genomic prediction involves the estimation of the effects of all genetic markers on the phenotype in a training dataset  followed by the use of these estimates to predict the genetic or breeding value of selection candidates based only on their SNP genotypes across the genome. If there is a significant genetic component to resistance  this prediction and selection method can be effective even if no clear signals are obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In clinical epidemiology  the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is often used to evaluate diagnostic methods in terms of their ability to distinguish between healthy and sick subjects. This method has several advantages  including independence of prevalence of disease or choice of the decision criterion []. In this study  we used ROC curves to evaluate the diagnostic value of genomic breeding values for predicting AI infection outcome within and across different viral strains and genetic lines of layer chickens. Three sets of samples were used for this study (see [] for a more detailed description): Hy-Line US commercial samples (205 survivors and 397 controls) from the 2015 H5N2 outbreak  Hy-Line Mexico commercial samples (480 survivors and 176 controls) from a 2012 H7N3 outbreak  and non-Hy-Line US commercial samples (47 survivors and 45 controls) from the same 2015 H5N2 outbreak in the US. All birds were from White Leghorn varieties. Blood samples from HPAI survivors and their age- and genetics-matched unaffected controls were collected on FTA Elute Microcards (GE Healthcare  Piscataway  NJ). Controls were selected from contemporary Midwest flocks that were not affected by HPAI because it was impossible to collect samples from dead birds on the affected farms for biosecurity and practical reasons. Because mortality in the H5N2 outbreak was higher than 99%  it was assumed that age-matched random birds from the same genetic varieties would be susceptible. DNA was extracted and genotyped on the 600K Affymetrix Axiom chicken SNP panel []. After quality control  420 458 SNPs were retained for analysis  including some that were fixed within some subsets of samples. In case-control studies  population stratification is always a concern because it can lead to spurious associations. However  using multidimensional scaling analysis  Drobik-Czwarno et al. [] showed that there were no structural differences between survivors and controls within the analysed populations. The phenotype of survivor/control (0/1) was analysed using the BayesB method by fitting all SNPs simultaneously  in GenSel []  separately for each dataset. The proportion of SNPs assumed to have no effect on survival was set to 0.999 in order to keep the number of SNPs in the model on the same scale as the number of available phenotypic observations. A mixed linear model with the fixed effect of an overall mean and random additive effects of SNPs was fitted. The length of the chain was 52 000 iterations with the first 2000 discarded as burn-in. Priors for variance components were 0.05 for genetic variance and 0.15 for residual variance  which is equivalent to a heritability of 0.25  with 4.2 degrees of freedom for residual variance to reflect the high level of uncertainty. Posterior estimates of SNP effects were used to compute genomic breeding values for survival to HPAI of genotyped birds that were not in the training data. To verify the potential of genomic prediction for genetic improvement of AI resistance  random fivefold cross-validation was performed within Hy-Line US and Mexico commercial samples  as well as prediction of the Hy-Line US commercial samples from the Hy-Line Mexico commercial samples  to represent prediction across different virus strains  and prediction of non-Hy-Line US commercial samples from Hy-Line US commercial samples  to represent prediction across different genetic varieties of layer chickens. The usefulness of the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for predicting disease outcome was summarized by ROC curves. Sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were calculated across the whole range of thresholds to classify birds as survivors versus controls based on their GEBV  i.e.  for a given GEBV threshold  sensitivity is the proportion of survivors among birds with GEBV above this threshold and specificity is the proportion of controls among birds with GEBV below the threshold. Sensitivity was plotted against (1-specifity) (=<U+2009>false positive rate) to create the ROC curves  together with a 45° line that represents random assignment of survivors and controls. Summary statistics of area under the curve (AUC) and significance test for AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5 (or breeding values being equivalent in predictive ability to random assignment) were performed using the program easyROC []. Windows explaining more than 1% of the genetic variance within each dataset are included in Table . A 1-Mb window on chromosome 1 at 126 Mb consistently explained the largest amount of genetic variance in Hy-Line Mexico commercial samples (27 to 32%). This is in agreement with the strongest association signal identified by Drobik-Czwarno et al. [] on chromosome 1  using different GWAS on the complete dataset. In the Hy-Line US commercial samples  the windows explaining the largest proportion of genetic variance differed between the folds (Table ) and the estimates of variance explained were smaller than in the Hy-Line Mexico commercial samples. This suggests a more polygenic determination of survival of infection with the H7N3 virus than with H5N2. The use of birds from unaffected flocks as controls instead of dead birds from the respective affected flocks could have reduced power of the analysis and decreased the accuracy of genomic prediction. However  because mortality was very high (><U+2009>99%)  the risk of including some potential survivors in the control group is expected to be limited. The ROC curves are in Fig.  and AUC results are in Table . ROC curves for predicting AI resistance. Top left panel: within Mexico commercial (H7N3) data; top right panel: within US commercial (H5N2) data; bottom left panel: between virus strains; bottom right panel: across genetic lines The ROC curves show significant improvement (Table ) in accuracy of prediction compared to random assignment for all tested scenarios  except when predicting across different genetic varieties of chickens. The best diagnostic performance of GEBV was observed when training and validation were within the same virus strain and the same genetic variety (Table ). In spite of differences in the windows that explained the largest proportion of genetic variance between the different virus strains  prediction from Mexico to US Hy-Line samples was significantly better than random assignment (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.58  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02). These results show that genomic predictions based on the 600K SNP chip have potential to predict disease outcome  especially within the same strain of virus  but do not predict well across genetic varieties. Methods to implement this type of crossbred performance for pure line selection using genomic data was discussed by Ibán<U+1EBD>z-Escriche et al. []. Poor performance of genomic prediction across layer lines for egg production was previously reported by Calus et al. [] using genotypes from a 60K SNP chip and interpreted as evidence of low consistency of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs and QTL between chicken lines. This limitation is expected to be overcome by the use of high-density genomic data (up to the sequence level) but so far sequencing costs have been prohibitive for generating large-scale training populations based on sequence data in chickens and the gains in accuracy for within-line predictions using sequence data have been limited []. In addition  if the SNP chip density is higher  a larger number of samples is required to estimate genotype effects accurately  which with the extremely high mortality in HPAI outbreaks may make it very difficult to collect sufficient numbers of survivor samples. Thus  at this point  the use of sequence data appears more promising for the identification of causal mutations than a practical application for genomic prediction.  Genomic predictions based on the 600K SNP chip have potential to predict avian influenza infection outcomes  especially within the same strain of virus but do not predict well across genetic varieties.

Previous studies showed the potential of selective breeding to increase n-3 LC-PUFA levels in salmon tissues  but knowledge on the genetic parameters for individual muscle fatty acids (FA) and their relationships with other traits is still lacking. Thus  we estimated genetic parameters for muscle content of individual FA  and their relationships with lipid deposition traits  muscle pigmentation  sea lice and pancreas disease in slaughter-sized Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to evaluate the selection potential for increased n-3 LC-PUFA content and provide insight into FA metabolism in Atlantic salmon muscle.ResultsAmong the n-3 PUFA  proportional contents of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) and DHA had the highest heritability (0.26) and EPA the lowest (0.09). Genetic correlations of EPA and DHA proportions with muscle fat differed considerably  0.60 and 0.01  respectively. The genetic correlation of DHA proportion with visceral fat was positive and high (0.61)  whereas that of EPA proportion with lice density was negative. FA that are in close proximity along the bioconversion pathway showed positive correlations with each other  whereas the start (ALA) and end-point (DHA) of the pathway were negatively correlated (-<U+2009>0.28)  indicating active bioconversion of ALA to DHA in the muscle of fish fed high FO-diet.ConclusionsSince contents of individual FA in salmon muscle show additive genetic variation  changing FA composition by selective breeding is possible. Taken together  our results show that the heritabilities of individual n-3 LC-PUFA and their genetic correlations with other traits vary  which indicates that they play different roles in muscle lipid metabolism  and that proportional muscle contents of EPA and DHA are linked to body fat deposition. Thus  different selection strategies can be applied in order to increase the content of healthy omega-3 FAin the salmon muscle. We recommend selection for the proportion of EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA in the muscle because they are both essential FA and because such selection has no clear detrimental effects on other traits."

Previous studies showed the potential of selective breeding to increase n-3 LC-PUFA levels in salmon tissues  but knowledge on the genetic parameters for individual muscle fatty acids (FA) and their relationships with other traits is still lacking. Thus  we estimated genetic parameters for muscle content of individual FA  and their relationships with lipid deposition traits  muscle pigmentation  sea lice and pancreas disease in slaughter-sized Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to evaluate the selection potential for increased n-3 LC-PUFA content and provide insight into FA metabolism in Atlantic salmon muscle. Among the n-3 PUFA  proportional contents of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) and DHA had the highest heritability (0.26) and EPA the lowest (0.09). Genetic correlations of EPA and DHA proportions with muscle fat differed considerably  0.60 and 0.01  respectively. The genetic correlation of DHA proportion with visceral fat was positive and high (0.61)  whereas that of EPA proportion with lice density was negative. FA that are in close proximity along the bioconversion pathway showed positive correlations with each other  whereas the start (ALA) and end-point (DHA) of the pathway were negatively correlated (-<U+2009>0.28)  indicating active bioconversion of ALA to DHA in the muscle of fish fed high FO-diet. Since contents of individual FA in salmon muscle show additive genetic variation  changing FA composition by selective breeding is possible. Taken together  our results show that the heritabilities of individual n-3 LC-PUFA and their genetic correlations with other traits vary  which indicates that they play different roles in muscle lipid metabolism  and that proportional muscle contents of EPA and DHA are linked to body fat deposition. Thus  different selection strategies can be applied in order to increase the content of healthy omega-3 FAin the salmon muscle. We recommend selection for the proportion of EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA in the muscle because they are both essential FA and because such selection has no clear detrimental effects on other traits. Traditionally  farmed Atlantic salmon ( L.) were fed diets rich in fish oil (FO) and fishmeal. Limited and decreasing availability of raw materials from wild fisheries have led to the replacement of a large portion of the marine ingredients with more sustainable plant-based ingredients in aquaculture feed []. Well-documented consequences of this change are decreased levels of the health-promoting omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA; 22:6n-3) in salmon filets  because these fatty acids (FA) are not present in plant oils [  ]. Atlantic salmon store most of their energy in the form of lipids in their muscle. The largest portion of such lipids is in the adipocytes along connective tissue sheets known as myocepta [  ]. Lipids present in the myocepta have a high proportion of triacylglycerol (TAG)  with a FA composition that is strongly influenced by the diet. Thus  muscle lipids have high levels of 18-carbon unsaturated FA 18:1n-9  18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 and saturated FA palmitic acid (PA; 16:0) []. Another important lipid group in muscle is phospholipids (PL)  which are located mainly in cell membranes []. Compared to TAG  PL have high levels of n-3 LC-PUFA  and their FA composition is more strictly regulated in order to maintain cell membrane functionality [  ]. Fat percentage in the muscle increases with growth and development of the fish [  ]. A higher fat content results in an increased ratio of TAG versus PL and  thus  influences FA composition. Muscle FA composition is strongly influenced by the diet  although not in an entirely linear way []. It is a function of several processes  each regulated on a cellular  tissue and whole-body level for maintaining lipid homeostasis []. Several studies have reported selective oxidation and deposition of individual FA in salmonids [   ] and Vegusdal et al. [] provided evidence of preferential uptake of specific FA into the muscle. Another process that influences the FA composition is bioconversion. Salmonids can convert the shorter-chained FA alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3)  which is commonly found in some plant oils  into longer chained EPA and DHA [  ]. This metabolic pathway was first described in mammals by Sprecher [] and consists of a series of desaturation and elongation reactions. The first step is <U+0394>6 desaturation of 18:3n-3 to produce 18:4n-3 that is elongated to 20:4n-3. Alternatively  18:3n-3 is elongated to 20:3n-3 followed by a <U+0394>8 desaturation. 20:4n-3 is desaturated by <U+0394>5 desaturase to form EPA [  ]. DHA synthesis from EPA requires two more elongation steps  a second <U+0394>6 desaturation  and a chain-shortening step by peroxisomal ß-oxidation []. Activity of the desaturase and elongase enzymes determines the relative amounts of EPA and DHA formed. Several factors influence the activities of these enzymes: nutrition  environment  hormones and genetics. In salmonids  liver  intestinal and muscle cells can convert ALA to DHA [  ]. Thus  this bioconversion is expected to influence the muscle FA composition  although less than the diet. There is evidence that genetics affects muscle FA composition in Atlantic salmon []; Schlechtriem et al. [] reported individual variation in the content of n-3 PUFA in the flesh of Atlantic salmon fed the same feed  which indicates a strong genetic influence on this trait. Similarly  Leaver et al. [] found that the content of total n-3 LC-PUFA in salmon muscle differed between families and was highly heritable. Selection for increased liver expression of genes encoding enzymes in the bioconversion pathway has led to increased levels of DHA in the liver of salmon []. Hence  there is potential in using selective breeding as a tool to increase levels of n-3 LC-PUFA in Atlantic salmon muscle by increasing the salmon’s natural capacity to convert the shorter-chained 18:3n-3 FA from plant oils into n-3 LC-PUFA and to efficiently deposit these FA in the muscle. However  knowledge on the genetic parameters of individual muscle FA and their relationships with lipid deposition traits and other breeding traits (e.g. carcass  quality and disease) is lacking  but is key to predicting the consequences of selection for higher n-3 LC-PUFA levels. Thus  the objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of individual FA in the muscle of farmed Atlantic salmon to evaluate the potential for selection for increased n-3 LC-PUFA levels and provide insight into the muscle’s FA metabolism. The data represented one year-class of the Atlantic salmon breeding population of SalmoBreed AS. The fish were transferred to net pens in the sea at a mean weight of 113.1 g and harvested at a mean slaughter weight of 3605 g. In total  668 fish that were reared under the same conditions were included in this study. They were fed a commercial broodstock feed with a high FO content (see Additional file ) and were fasted 13 to 14 days prior to slaughter. These fish came from 194 full-sib families that originated from 92 sires and 194 dams. All sires had four or more offspring from more than one dam. The following traits were recorded at slaughter: body weight (g); length (cm); sex  determined visually by inspection of the gonads; muscle pigment (mg/kg)  the carotenoid astaxanthin was measured immediately after slaughter using a commercial NIR imaging scanner (Tomra Sorting Solutions  Leuven  Belgium) [  ]; liver fat  an indicator of the degree of fatty liver  determined visually on a scale of 1 (darkest color i.e. healthy) to 5 (lightest color i.e. fatty liver)  which is reversed compared to the scale presented in [] to facilitate interpretation of the results; visceral fat  determined visually on a scale of 1 (lowest amount of fat) to 5 (highest) []. Muscle samples from the Norwegian Quality Cut (NQC) of the fillet were collected at harvest from each fish  frozen  and stored at -<U+2009>20 °C. Data from sea lice and pancreas disease (PD) challenge tests of siblings of the analyzed fish were obtained from SalmoBreed AS  as part of their larger challenge tests of the 2014 year class. In the sea lice challenge test  2207 post-smolts (body weight<U+2009>~<U+2009>60 g) were infected by mixing sea lice copepodites in a water basin (12 °C) with an infection rate of about 30 copepodites per fish. The sea lice strain was LS Gulen from 2006. The fish were sedated and the number of lice per fish was counted after sea lice reached the motile stage (~<U+2009>14 days) (personal communication Borghild Hillestad). Sea lice density was calculated as lice count/body weight  following []. In the PD challenge test  2426 post-smolts (body weight<U+2009>~<U+2009>65 g) were infected with the SAV3 virus by direct intraperitoneal injection  following the VESO Vikan protocol that was approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority (personal communication Borghild Hillestad). The total PD survival rate at the end of the challenge was 60%. Total lipids were extracted from homogenized NQC muscle samples of individual fish sampled at slaughter  according to the method described by Folch et al. []. Using 1 mL of the chloroform–methanol phase  FA composition of the total lipids was analyzed according to the method described by Mason and Waller []. The extract was dried quickly under nitrogen gas and the residual lipid extract was trans-methylated overnight with 2 2-dimethoxypropane  methanolic-HCl  and benzene at room temperature. The methyl esters formed were separated in a gas chromatograph with a split injector  using an SGE BPX70 capillary column (length 60 m  internal diameter 0.25 mm  and film thickness 0.25 µm; SGE Analytical Science  Milton Keynes  UK) and a flame ionization detector. The results were analyzed using the HP Chem Station software (Hewlett Packard 6890; HP  Wilmington  DE  USA). The carrier gas was helium  and both injector and detector temperatures were 270 °C. The oven temperature was raised from 50 to 170 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min and then raised to 200 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min and finally to 240 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Individual FA methyl esters were identified by reference to well-characterized standards. The proportional content of each FA was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of FA in the analyzed sample. Absolute content of each FA was calculated as described in Folch et al. []: FA in g per 100 g muscle<U+2009>=<U+2009>(% FA of total FA/00)<U+2009>×<U+2009>(Muscle fat %<U+2009>×<U+2009>0.9). Presentation of the results will focus on the most abundant FA in the fillet (16:0  18:1n-9  18:2n-6) and the following FA that are part of the bioconversion pathway: 18:3n-3  20:3n-3  20:4n-3  20:5n-3  22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. Variance and covariance components were estimated by residual maximum likelihood procedures using the ASReml Package []. Bivariate analyses were performed to estimate genetic correlations between traits  using the following bivariate animal model []: where  is a matrix of phenotypic records for individuals <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  …   and traits <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2   is a matrix of the fixed effects of animal  on trait    is a matrix of fixed effect solutions.  is a matrix containing the random effects of animal  on trait   with variance   where  is the relationship matrix between individuals and  is a genetic variance–covariance matrix among traits.  is a matrix of residual effects  that is assumed to have a variance of   where 1 and 2 indicate traits. Univariate analyses were performed to estimate heritabilities for all traits. For the univariate analyses  matrices      and  were reduced to vectors and matrices  and  were reduced to scalars. Heritability estimates () were calculated as the ratio of additive genetic () to total phenotypic () variance (). Correlations between two traits () were calculated as the covariance divided by the square root of the product of two variances i.e. . Body weight was included as a covariate and sex was included as a fixed effect for FA  pigment  visceral fat  liver fat and muscle fat. For PD survival  cage was included as random effect. For lice density  the person performing the counting and the day of recording were included as fixed effects and cage was included as a random effect. Four generations of pedigree information on direct ancestors of the fish in the tests were available (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11 801). Estimates were considered as significantly different from zero if they deviated more than two times their standard error from zero (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). The coefficients of variation (CV) showed that traits varied extensively among the sampled fish (Table )  especially body weight  visceral fat and liver fat  which each had a CV above 20%. The average fat content of NQC muscle samples was 19% (Table )  which is high for fish of this size but not extreme. The average liver fat score was within the normal range (2.13). The major muscle FA were 18:1n-9  18:2n-6 and the saturated FA 16:0 (Table ). The mean muscle contents of EPA and DHA were approximately twice as high as in commercially-produced salmon  which reflects the high level of these FA in the feed (see Additional file ). The absolute content of individual muscle FA varied greatly  as shown by their CV  which ranged from 15 to 33%  with EPA showing the largest variation. The muscle content of each individual FA was approximately normally distributed. The distributions of proportional contents of individual FA in the muscle across fish are in Additional file . The FA that are not shown in Table  amounted to approximately 30% of total FA. The proportional contents of muscle FA changed with increasing body weight (Fig. ). The content of PA (16:0) remained stable  whereas that of 18-carbon FA increased and those of EPA and DHA were the only ones that decreased with increasing body weight. In the remaining results  all estimates were corrected for body weight. Relationship between fish body weight and proportional content of fatty acids in the muscle The heritability of the absolute content of the n-3 PUFA  in g per 100 g muscle  was generally moderate to high  which reflects the high heritability of muscle fat (0.46) (see Additional file ). DHA had the highest heritability (0.46) (Table ). The absolute content of EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA had a heritability of 0.35 (Table )  whereas proportional content had a heritability of 0.09 (SE 0.06). For proportional contents of FA  the start and end-point of the bioconversion pathway (ALA and DHA) had the highest heritabilities  whereas EPA had the lowest heritability (0.09  Table ). Estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations both showed the same pattern: contents of FA that were in close proximity in the pathway had positive correlations with each other  whereas correlations between contents of the start- (ALA) and end-points (DHA) of the pathway were negative (Table ). The genetic correlation between the contents of 20:4n-3 and DHA was high. Muscle fat had positive phenotypic correlations with proportional contents of PA and EPA (Table )  but a negative correlation with the proportional contents of the 18-carbon FA. Phenotypic correlations of proportional contents of DPA (22:5 n-3) and DHA with muscle fat were close to zero. Estimates of genetic correlations between muscle fat and proportional contents of FA showed the same pattern  but were higher than the phenotypic correlations  except for the proportional contents of the very long-chain (VLC) (=<U+2009>C) PUFA DPA and DHA  which had genetic correlations of nearly zero with muscle fat when correcting for body weight. As expected  genetic correlations between absolute amounts of all FA and muscle fat were highly positive  because an increase in muscle fat increases the absolute amount of all FA (see Additional file )  and because muscle fat percentage was used to calculate the absolute amount of FA. Estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations of visceral fat correlations with FA reflected those with muscle fat for all FA except for EPA  20:4n-3  and DHA (Table ). Proportional contents of both EPA and PA had positive genetic correlations with muscle fat; PA also had a positive genetic correlation with visceral fat (0.66) but EPA had a negative correlation with visceral fat (-<U+2009>0.17). DHA had a high positive genetic correlation with visceral fat (0.61). Correlations of FA with liver fat were weaker than those with visceral fat but showed the same pattern (Table ). The genetic correlations for liver fat were similar to the phenotypic correlations  except for EPA  which had a positive phenotypic but a negative genetic correlation with liver fat. Overall  Table  shows that  for fish at the same age and weight  a fatter muscle had a higher absolute content but lower proportion of the 18-carbon FA and higher absolute and proportional contents of EPA and PA  than a leaner muscle. The proportional content of DHA did not increase with increasing muscle fat at a constant body weight. PD survival had a negative genetic correlation with muscle fat (-<U+2009>0.29) but  surprisingly  a positive genetic correlation with liver fat (0.28  Table ). The correlations between PD survival and the proportional contents of FA were generally weak. The estimate of heritability for sea lice density was 0.21. Proportional contents of EPA and DPA had negative genetic correlations with sea lice density. The proportional content of all other FA had close to zero genetic correlations with sea lice density. Pigment was positively correlated with all three fat deposit traits. Only the proportional content of the saturated FA PA had a positive correlation with pigment  while the proportional contents of all unsaturated FA had negative correlations with pigment. These correlations with pigment reflected the correlations of muscle fat with the proportional contents of FA in Table   except for EPA and DHA. Genetic parameters of individual muscle FA and their correlations with lipid deposition traits and other traits (carcass  quality  and disease traits) were estimated for 668 slaughter-sized (3.6 kg) Atlantic salmon that were fed a high FO-diet. Our aim was to evaluate the selection potential for increased long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated FA and provide insight into FA metabolism in salmon muscle. The results showed presence of additive genetic variation in the individual FA contents of salmon muscle  thus changing FA composition by selective breeding is possible. For several FA  both absolute and proportional contents had a high heritability (Tables  and ). The absolute and proportional contents of DHA had heritabilities of 0.46 and 0.26  respectively. The start- and end-points of the n-3 bioconversion pathway (ALA and DHA) had higher heritabilities than the intermediate FA (20:3n-3  20:4n-3  20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3). A possible explanation for this is that the levels of intermediate FA may not be stable since they are shuttled through the pathway. In addition  since contents of these FA are very low  errors in their measurement increase. The proportional content of EPA was high (5.42%) but had the lowest heritability of all FA (0.09) (Tables  and )  which may be explained by its many metabolic roles in the body  i.e. it is converted to DHA  used for eicosanoid synthesis  or directed to produce energy []. Thus  the “pool” of EPA is highly variable over time []  which was reflected by the high CV of EPA content  compared to that of the other FA (Table ). Overall  the results of this study show that additive genetic variation can be exploited to change the muscle FA composition by selective breeding. This agrees with studies in both pigs [] and Atlantic salmon [] that showed that n-3 LC-PUFA content in muscle has a heritable component. Our estimates of heritability are not as high as those reported by Leaver and Taggart []  probably because they used pooled family records instead of individual records  and because of differences in the age and diet of the fish studied. Our statistical model included body weight as a fixed effect  which decreased the heritability estimates  because of the high heritability of body weight. We corrected for the effect of body weight because the fish studied displayed a large variation in body weight  and body weight had a significant effect on most traits. When correcting for this trait  we removed the effect seen in Fig.   i.e. that the proportional contents of some FA increased or decreased with increasing body weight  which renders the relationships between these FA predictable. The additive genetic variation observed in muscle FA composition could be due to differences in the transport and deposition of these FA from the feed  or due to differences in endogenous production of these FA. When Atlantic salmon are fed diets with high levels of DHA  their endogenous capacity for bioconversion from ALA to DHA is expected to decrease because DHA is known to down-regulate the activity of the <U+0394>6-desaturase enzyme []. It has also been reported that FA desaturation activity decreases with the age of the fish []. However  although the bioconversion capacity is relatively low  our data indicates that active bioconversion of 18:3n-3 (ALA) to 22:6n-3 (DHA) in muscle takes place in slaughter-sized salmon that are fed a high FO diet. One indicator for this active bioconversion is the negative phenotypic correlation (-<U+2009>0.56) between proportional contents of ALA and DHA  the start and end-points of the pathway (Table ). Another indicator is the positive correlations between adjacent FA in the pathway. This assumption is supported by recent studies that indicated that  although the <U+0394>6-desaturase conversion of 18:3n-3 to 18:4n-3 is greatly inhibited in fish fed a high FO diet  the activity of the last <U+0394>6-desaturase step of the bioconversion pathway (converting 24:5n-3 to 24:6n-3) is not lower than in fish fed a low FO diet [  ]. Therefore  DHA production from ALA is  to some extent  maintained [  ]  which has been suggested to be due to an increase in the direct elongation of 18:3n-3 to 20:3n-3  bypassing the first <U+0394>6 step (18:3n-3 to 18:4n-3). The FA 20:3n-3 is then converted to 20:4n-3  which is shuttled into the main pathway and then converted to EPA and DHA. Our detection of 20:3n-3 in the muscle further supports this assumption because 20:3n-3 is a FA that is not commonly present in significant amounts in Atlantic salmon feed. The genetic correlation of 20:3n-3 was negative with ALA and positive with DHA (Table )  which also agrees with the above results. Although our study used large fish on a FO-rich feed  there were still indications of bioconversion influencing muscle FA composition. Because levels of EPA and DHA in the feed are proven to affect bioconversion activity  it would be interesting to perform the same analysis on fish fed a low FO diet. Unpublished results from our group have shown that the fish with the highest conversion capacity on a high FO diet also retained this capacity when the amount of FO in the feed was reduced (personal communication Bente Ruyter). In addition  n-3 bioconversion is not expected to be the only factor that determines the FA composition of the muscle. Thus  the results of our study are relevant also for salmon in commercial production in which diets with low contents of marine ingredients are used. Although our dataset of 668 fish is larger than data used in previous studies on the genetic variation of FA composition in fish (416 fish in [] and 514 fish in [])  only some of the genetic correlations were significant and all had large standard errors. Thus  the interpretation of the results is based on the patterns of correlations estimates across traits  rather than on individual estimates. Individual FA appear to play different roles in the lipid metabolism  since their proportional contents differed in heritability and in correlations with fat deposition traits. In general  we found that proportional contents of all 18-carbon FA had similar correlations with the fat deposition traits  and that they followed a pattern; correlations of these FA with visceral fat and liver fat reflected those with muscle fat  and the genetic and phenotypic correlations were similar. The correlations of the saturated FA PA (16:0) with the fat deposition traits displayed opposite signs compared to the 18-carbon FA  but followed a similar pattern. However  correlations of proportional contents of EPA  DPA and DHA did not follow this pattern; their correlations with visceral fat and liver fat did not reflect their correlations with muscle fat  and the genetic correlations often differed from the phenotypic correlations. The proportional content of EPA had favorable genetic correlations with different body fat deposits; a higher proportion of EPA in the muscle was associated with a higher amount of fat in the muscle but with less fat in liver and viscera (Table ). The proportional content of DHA had a positive genetic correlation with visceral fat (0.61)  indicating a possible genetic link between high deposition of DHA in the muscle and a high level of visceral fat (Table ). The DHA:ALA ratio had an even higher genetic correlation with visceral fat. The basis for these correlations is unknown. Genetic correlations between proportional contents of EPA and DHA in muscle and different fat deposits for salmon fed a traditional high FO-diet have never been reported. However  feeding trials have shown that very high levels of EPA and DHA in the diet reduce the amount of visceral adipose tissue in Atlantic salmon []  whereas very low dietary amounts of EPA and DHA are linked to fatty liver [  ]. Since there were no health-risk levels of liver fat in the fish of this study  the correlations of liver fat with other traits found here are not comparable to those found in feeding trials or other studies that analyzed fish with a high occurrence of health-impairing fatty liver. It should be noted that the accuracy of the visual scoring method used for liver and visceral fat is low compared to that of chemical analyses  especially of liver fat in big fish. The metabolic role of EPA may explain the correlation found between its proportional contents and sea lice density (-0.47 (0.28)  Table )  which indicated that a high proportion of EPA in muscle is associated with increased resistance to sea lice. Since the EPA content in muscle is reflected in the skin []  this correlation may be due to the increased levels of EPA in the skin having anti-inflammatory and immunological effects []. The effect of EPA may be similar to that of other anti-inflammatory factors that protect Atlantic salmon against sea lice infection []. To date  there is no evidence that supports a possible genetic effect of EPA on sea lice resistance  but it could be of great practical importance to the industry. However  because of the large standard error of the genetic correlation estimated here  this finding requires further investigations and should be verified in salmon fed a low FO diet. The limitations of the method used to determine liver fat must also be taken into account when considering the observed positive correlation between liver fat and PD survival  as we do not have a biological explanation for this correlation. We found a negative genetic correlation between PD survival and muscle fat  which suggests that increased levels of fat in the muscle reduce the PD survival rate. Pancreas disease is caused by a virus that triggers inflammation in pancreas  heart and skeletal muscle tissues []. High levels of lipids increase the amount of inflammatory factors []  which may explain why resistance to the PD virus infection decreases. Muscle fat had a positive genetic correlation with pigment (Table ). This may result from the hydrophobic nature of carotenoids  which results in their transport and absorption being closely linked to the transport of FA [  ]. Estimates of genetic correlations between proportional content of FA with pigment reflected those of the proportional content of FA with muscle fat  except for EPA  DPA and DHA. Since the proportional content of EPA had a positive genetic correlation with muscle fat  it was expected to have also a positive correlation with pigment  but a negative correlation of -0.09 was found. Proportional contents of DPA and DHA also had negative correlations with pigment. Previous studies reported that n-3 LC-PUFA have positive effects on the pigment content of salmon fed low levels of FO []. The reason why we observed the opposite may be that the fish in this study were fed high levels of these FA. Highly unsaturated FA are more susceptible to oxidation []  which can lead to degradation of carotenoids []. From a breeder’s perspective  the goal is to increase the content of healthy omega-3 FA in salmon fillets. This can be achieved in two ways: by increasing the absolute content (grams per 100 g muscle)  or by increasing the proportional content (percentage of total muscle FA). The absolute content is an important trait from the perspective of human health. The heritability for absolute content was quite high for all FA  which is linked to the high heritability of muscle fat (0.46) since estimates of genetic correlations between the absolute content of FA and muscle fat were close to 1. Thus  increased absolute contents of  e.g.  EPA and DHA could be achieved by selecting for muscle fat [which had positive genetic correlations with both visceral and liver fat (see Additional file )]. However  the salmon breeding industry considers increased levels of muscle fat as undesirable (personal communication Håvard Bakke). Since this applies for the absolute content of all FA  the following discussion is based on proportional content only. Based on the overall analysis of the results  among all FA  the proportional content of EPA showed the most beneficial genetic correlations with other traits  since an increased proportion of EPA in the muscle was concurrent with less liver fat and visceral fat  as well as increased resistance to sea lice. Thus  increasing the proportion of this FA could be a desirable objective  but unfortunately  its heritability is relatively low (0.09). DHA was the most abundant n-3 LC-PUFA in the muscle and had the highest heritability (0.26). Selecting for fish with a high proportion of DHA in the muscle would lead to small and lean fish  because the proportional content of DHA decreases with increasing body weight as the TAG:PL ratio increases (Fig. ). However  our results show that there is variation in the proportional content of DHA that is independent of body weight. The proportion of DHA corrected for body weight was not genetically correlated with muscle fat content but was positively correlated with visceral fat content. Selection for higher proportional content of DHA in the muscle may lead to improved bioconversion capacity  but it may also affect other physiological mechanisms related to FA  e.g. transport  oxidation  and deposition. Another trait relevant for selection is the DHA:ALA ratio  since it can be an indirect measure of the bioconversion of ALA to DHA. We found that it had moderate heritability (0.20) and its correlations with other traits were similar to those of proportional content of DHA  but its correlation with visceral fat was even higher (although with a high standard error). The viscera represent a natural and healthy place for the salmon to store excess energy as fat  and thus  biologically it is meaningful. However  for Atlantic salmon breeding and production companies  visceral fat represents production loss. Visceral fat content is part of the existing breeding programs and can be dealt with as for other negatively correlated traits by using selection index theory []. In addition  optimizing the protein-to-lipid ratio of the feed can significantly reduce visceral lipid deposition in Atlantic salmon [  ]. Hence  combining selection and feeding management could prevent increased amounts of visceral fat while selecting for DHA or DHA:ALA ratio. Increasing the ratio of DHA:ALA could increase the bioconversion capacity but would not necessarily increase the absolute amount of DHA in the fillet. Furthermore  beyond bioconversion capacity  several other factors and processes probably play a role in determining the FA composition of the fillet. From a human health perspective  selective breeding should ideally result in increases of the content of both essential FAs EPA and DHA in salmon muscle. Since EPA and DHA have different physiological functions and correlations with other traits  it may be relevant to include both FA in the selection strategy for achieving a healthy end-product. The sum of EPA and DHA (EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA) showed similar estimated genetic correlations with PD survival  lice density and pigment as the intermediate of the genetic correlations of EPA and DHA with these traits. The estimate of heritability of EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA was similar to that of EPA (0.09). In spite of this relatively low heritability  our recommendation is to genetically improve the proportion of EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA in Atlantic salmon muscle  mainly because of its aforementioned human health benefits and because it has no clear detrimental effects on other traits. Implementing selection for changes in FA composition requires costly and time-consuming chemical analyses  which make large-scale data recording challenging. New methods for predicting FA composition may provide rapid  cost-effective measurements of muscle FA composition  and thus practical implementation of selection for this trait may become more realistic in the future. We conclude that there is additive genetic variation in the content of individual FA in salmon muscle  thus changing its FA composition by selective breeding is possible. Combined  our results indicate that individual n-3 LC-PUFA play different roles in the lipid metabolism of muscle since their heritabilities and phenotypic and genetic correlations with other traits varied. Proportional contents of EPA and DHA in the muscle were linked to body fat deposition in different ways. Several observations indicated that an active bioconversion of 18:3n-3 (ALA) to 22:6n-3 (DHA) in muscle takes place in slaughter-sized salmon fed a high FO diet. Different selection strategies could be applied to increase the content of the healthy omega-3 FA in salmon muscle. We recommend selection for proportion of EPA<U+2009>+<U+2009>DHA in the muscle since both are essential FA and because such selection has no clear detrimental effects on the other traits. FAO.

Human/animal interactions in livestock production have led to major phenotypic changes in animal traits  which are mainly due to the effect of selection []. Anthropogenic selection  along with natural selection and adaptation  have increased the frequency of favorable alleles and resulted in changes in the frequencies of their surrounding loci []  thereby establishing genomic signatures of positive selection. In turn  the methods used to identify this type of signature of selection represent powerful tools to detect evidence of selection during the process of animal domestication or breed formation  and ultimately they aid in elucidating the mechanisms that underlie the morphological  productive and functional traits of a species []. Cattle are domestic animals used worldwide  with two divergent groups: taurine () and indicine () cattle  each of which includes several breeds  which have been established for different purposes by humans. One common strategy for investigating past selection in cattle involves the systematic comparison of the genomes of breeds that have evolved under different selection regimes  e.g.  dairy versus beef breeds [  ]. The motivation behind such comparisons is to identify strongly differentiated genomic regions between different groups of animals. However  analysis of within-breed stratification may allow the identification of signatures of selection within a single breed for which genetically distinct lines have been established. One example of such a study in cattle involved Holstein lines that were divergently selected for milk yield  in which the identified signatures of selection co-localized with known quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect milk traits [  ]. Nelore cattle (originally named Ongole in India) are an indicine breed  which is predominantly raised in Brazil for meat production. Apart from the national Nelore breeding programs  there is an experimental program with three selection lines that has been running since 1978 at the APTA Beef Cattle Center—Institute of Animal Science (IZ)  Sertãozinho—Brazil. This program was initiated to demonstrate to producers the benefits of selection for growth traits and its economic impact on the bovine industry []. Briefly  three selection lines were established in 1980 by dividing an experimental herd representative of the main Nelore lineages that currently exist in Brazil. Since then  a line referred to as Nelore Control (NeC) has been maintained under stabilizing selection  in which animals with a yearling body weight (YBW) close to the average of the contemporary group are annually selected for reproduction. The two other lines  Nelore Selection (NeS) and Nelore Traditional (NeT)  have independently undergone selection for increased YBW. While the NeS and NeC lines are maintained as closed lines  the NeT line has received sires from the two other lines (7 from NeC and 47 from NeT) and commercial herds. After almost 40 years of selection  distinct phenotypic differences are observed between the lines undergoing stabilizing and directional selection  including differences in average body weight at various ages  body measurements  scrotal circumference and carcass quality [  ]. Inbreeding level in these lines is controlled by adopting breeding strategies such as exclusion of siblings as sires  short mating time for each selected sire (only two seasons)  and avoidance of mating between closely-related animals. In 2003  the observed coefficients of inbreeding in the three lines ranged from 4 to 4.3% []  while in animals born in 2012 they ranged from 4.2 to 6.4%. The existence of these experimental bovine lines has instigated studies on candidate genes  with the goal of detecting polymorphisms that show extreme differences in allele frequencies between lines  which may be linked to phenotypic differences [  ]. However  genome-wide screening of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels to detect selection is probably more suitable for revealing genomic regions that have undergone selection in this population and should help to understand the genetic mechanisms that underlie response to selection. Thus  the aims of this study were (1) to assess the effect of selection within this experimental Nelore population and (2) to scan for signatures of selection left by recent directional selection. Since the experimental program was established in 1980  the NeC  NeS and NeT lines are composed of 60  120 and 170 cows with four  six and up to eight bulls  respectively  with 50% of the bulls at 2 years of age (first mating) and 50% at 3 years (second and last mating). The females that were initially assigned to each line were randomly chosen from an experimental herd of 350 cows  and since then  the annual culling rate of cows is approximately 20%  with replacement females for each line being selected based on their YBW at 550 days of age and raised on pasture. The bulls that were initially assigned to each line were chosen based on their YBW at 378 days of age  after 168-day feedlot performance tests. The bulls that were assigned to the NeC line had a YBW close to the average value for bulls with the same birth year (1977 or 1978)  while those assigned to the NeS and NeT lines had a higher YBW. This bull selection scheme was maintained to the present day  by replacing annually the 50% older bulls within each line. Average annual selection intensities of 0.05 ± 0.24  0.42 ± 0.29 and 0.56 ± 0.28 were applied to NeC  NeS and NeT females  respectively  while the corresponding values for males are equal to - 0.03 ± 0.20  1.46 ± 0.30 and 1.60 ± 0.54. Figure  shows the phenotypic differentiation in YBW between the lines obtained via selection. The individuals’ generation coefficients (GC) were determined by the method described by Brinks et al. []  where the GC of each calf was the average of its parents’ GC values plus 1. The founder animals used for establishing the experimental lines were assigned a GC of 0. Direct responses to selection for yearling body weight across generations.  and  Average yearling body weights (YBW) in Nelore Control (NeC)  Nelore Selection (NeS) and Nelore Traditional (NeT) lines  within generation coefficient (GC) classes with intervals of 0.25   and  4 year old sires from the NeS (left) and NeC (right) lines We used a subsample of 782 animals born between 2004 and 2012 (92 NeC  192 NeS and 498 NeT) that were previously genotyped because of phenotypes related to feed efficiency [  ]. The average GC for this subsample was equal to 6.1 (ranging from 4.4 to 7.7) and generation 6 had the broadest representation of animals from each line [see Additional file : Table S1]. The average estimated inbreeding coefficients in the genotyped subsample were equal to 0.05 ± 0.02 for NeC (ranging from 0.02 to 0.18)  0.03 ± 0.01 for NeS (ranging from 0.01 to 0.06) and 0.03 ± 0.01 for NeT (ranging from 0.01 to 0.08). Table  presents the average additive relationships between the genotyped animals of the three lines  which were estimated based on the full pedigree (see Silva et al. [] for a complete pedigree description). Each animal was genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (San Diego  CA). Quality control (QC) procedures were performed using Plink (version 1.07) []: samples with call rates lower than 0.90 were removed  and SNPs with call rates lower than 0.95  non-autosomal  unmapped  and duplicated SNPs or those that were monomorphic in all lines were also discarded. In addition  SNPs that might be misplaced were removed based on the decay of r as a function of physical distance. Following an algorithm adapted from Bohmanova et al. []  this QC procedure consisted of: (1) recording the distance between each SNP and the top 10 syntenic SNPs with the highest r values; (2) flagging a particular SNP once for each distance greater than 10 Mb within the list of its top 10 r and compiling a list of candidate misplaced SNPs for each chromosome; (3) excluding from further analysis the SNPs with the highest flag counts on each chromosome; and (4) repeating steps (1)  (2) and (3) with the list of candidate misplaced SNPs  until the list is empty (an example of the removal of a misplaced SNP is in Figure S1 [see Additional file : Figure S1]). Finally  529 172 SNPs remained for further analyses [see Additional file : Table S2]. Next  imputation of missing genotypes and haplotype phasing were performed by combining all the samples together  regardless of their respective line  using Beagle software (version 3.3.2) []. Two different methods were used to assess population stratification. First  a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was applied using the genomic distance matrix and the “cmdscale” function from the “stats” package in R software []. The genomic distance between two individuals was estimated as 1 minus the proportion of identical by state (IBS) alleles that they share. Second  an admixture analysis was performed to measure the proportion of individual ancestry from different numbers of hypothetical ancestral populations  using the ADMIXTURE software (version 1.04) []. Thus  an unsupervised model-based approach that relies on maximum likelihood was applied to the genotype matrix  using hypothetical ancestral population (K) numbers of 2 and 3  which reflect the different selection regimes and the number of lines in the subsample used for this study  respectively. Wright’s fixation index () was computed for each pairwise combination of lines based on the estimator corrected for unequal sample sizes [] implemented in the “fsthet” package [] in R software []  using all SNPs that had passed the QC procedures. Then   and heterozygosity averages were estimated for genomic windows of 100 kb across the autosomes  with an overlap of 75 kb. Putative signals of divergence were detected with two empirical strategies that are typically used in studies involving  tests  one that identifies the top-ranking windows [  ] and another method that identifies outliers from the background level of -heterozygosity [  ]. Thus  windows were considered to show putative signatures of selection if they contained more than five SNPs  presented an average  within the top 1%  and outside the 95% confidence interval of their heterozygosity bin in both cross-line comparisons of NeC with one of the lines under directional selection (“NeC vs. NeS” and “NeC vs. NeT”) [see Additional file : Figure S2]. The extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) metric is defined as the probability of randomly choosing two identical extended haplotypes that surround a specific locus []  for which higher values are expected for selected alleles with a frequency that increased rapidly due to selection. In our study  we applied two somewhat complementary EHH-derived methods to detect signatures of selection  the cross population EHH (XP-EHH) [] and the integrated haplotype homozygosity score (iHS) []  both of which were estimated using the SELSCAN software (version 1.1.0) []. Whereas XP-EHH is a cross population method that is useful to detect signals of divergent selection between lines  iHS is a within-population method that allows the identification of signals of ongoing positive selection. The XP-EHH test was applied to the comparisons between NeC and each of the lines under directional selection (“NeC vs. NeS” and “NeC vs. NeT”). XP-EHH values were averaged for 100-kb windows with an overlap of 75 kb  and a cut-off threshold of 2.58 ( < 0.005) was applied to determine candidate signatures of selection. Only windows for which the average XP-EHH exceeded the upper cut-off in both cross-line comparisons and contained more than five SNPs were considered to harbor a signature of selection [see Additional file : Figure S3]  which was characterized by the presence of some high-frequency haplotypes in the NeS and NeT lines but not in the NeC line. The iHS test was performed by considering the lines under directional selection (NeS and NeT) together after removing SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01  since iHS is a within-population methodology that is not appropriate for analyzing SNPs close to fixation. One allele of each SNP was arbitrarily assigned as the “reference” allele  and absolute values of iHS (|iHS|) were then used to identify signatures of selection  as in Cohen-Zinder et al. []. The “reference” allele was randomly determined based on the high similarity observed between iHS values obtained from a subset of SNPs  with or without ancestral allele information retrieved from two cattle reference allele lists [  ] [see Additional file : Figure S4]. The |iHS| values of 494 372 SNPs were divided into 20 bins based on the frequency of the assigned ancestral allele  and the values were then standardized within each bin. The |iHS| values were averaged across 100-kb windows  with an overlap of 75 kb. Windows with |iHS| scores higher than 2.58 ( < 0.005) were considered as putative signatures of selection. Known QTL that overlapped with each detected signature of selection were retrieved from the CattleQTL database []. Genes were identified within each putative selected region using the Ensembl cow gene set 84 []. Enrichment of genes in specific biological processes and molecular pathways was then analyzed using the DAVID database (version 6.7) []  however since no significant pathway was detected  the results are not shown. After QC  the genotyped population was composed of 89  189 and 485 samples from NeC  NeS  and NeT lines  respectively [see Additional file : Table S1]. The NeC line presented the largest number of monomorphic SNPs and the lowest heterozygosity (Table )  which may be due to its smaller effective population size (N) relative to the population sizes of the other two lines. Current N values of 51  88 and 177 were estimated for the NeC  NeS and NeT lines  respectively  based on the increase in individual inbreeding since the establishment of these lines  according to Gutiérrez et al. []. However  directional selection in successive generations  as experienced by the NeS and NeT lines  can result in the loss of rare alleles and an increase in apparent inbreeding  which may explain why these three lines that differ significantly in effective population size  present similar proportions of SNPs with a low MAF [see Additional file : Figure S5]. The first two principal coordinates obtained from multidimensional scaling (MDS) accounted for 7.88% of the total genomic variance in the subsample used in this study. PC1 completely separates NeC from NeS and NeT  while PC2 partially separates the NeS and NeT lines (Fig. a). The observed variation within each cluster was roughly proportional to its size  although the relatively higher diversity in NeT may be due to the gene flow that occurred in this line. The pattern of dispersion with the two selection lines being separated from NeC suggests that selection might be a significant force leading to genomic differentiation between these lines. However  since it is known that larger numbers of sires were transferred from NeS to NeT than from NeC to NeT  which results in NeS and NeT being more genetically connected  this might also have contributed to the observed pattern. Population structure  as revealed by MDS and admixture analyses.  Depicts the distribution of samples based on the first two principal coordinates (PC) provided by their genomic distance matrix. The variance explained by each PC is indicated within brackets.  and  The results of admixture analyses with inferred numbers of clusters i.e. K = 2 () and K = 3 (). White dashed lines separate the experimental lines. Each sample is represented by a vertical bar partitioned into stained segments according to its proportion of ancestry in each of the clusters We performed an admixture analysis to estimate the proportions of ancestry in NeC  NeS and NeT with various numbers of clusters (K)  which represent hypothetical ancestral populations. When K = 2  the clustering algorithm clearly separated NeC from NeS and NeT (Fig. b)  and the gene flow into NeT became evident with K = 3 (Fig. c). Both MDS and admixture analyses identified NeT animals that showed a high degree of shared ancestry with the NeS cluster (Fig. a  c)  which is likely due to the possible use of NeS sires for reproduction in the NeT line.  is a widely used metric for identifying population differentiation with values ranging from 0 to 1  where values close to 0 indicate more homogeneous populations and values close to 1 indicate more genetically diverged populations. The estimated average  values in cross-line comparisons were equal to 0.05 ± 0.04 for “NeC vs. NeS”  0.06 ± 0.04 for “NeC vs. NeT” and 0.02 ± 0.02 for “NeS vs. NeT”. These results reflect only subtle differentiation on a genome-wide scale  even after 40 years of intensive directional selection  which is consistent with the results of Flori et al. []  who found minor genomic divergence between evolving lines of a single bovine breed. In spite of the low  averages  their ranking was consistent with the population structure  with higher values being observed between NeC and one of the lines undergoing directional selection than between the two selection lines. The  test revealed windows with significant levels of differentiation on most of the bovine chromosomes  while XP-EHH and iHS only recognized signals on chromosomes 14 and 16 and on chromosomes 1  3  9  14  16 and 23  respectively (Fig. ). Unusually negative XP-EHH scores  as observed on chromosome 12 (Fig. )  may represent signatures of selection in the NeC line. However  we did not treat such scores as a signature of selection because stabilizing selection is expected to maintain haplotype diversity  rather than reduce it []  thus producing subtle signatures of selection that cannot be detected by the XP-EHH test. Therefore  the low diversity in these regions is presumably due to genetic drift caused by the small N of the NeC line. Genome-wide   XP-EHH and iHS scores averaged for 100-kb windows (75 kb overlapped). Blue lines indicate the significance threshold adopted for each test. The  and XP-EHH values represent the means for the same windows in the “NeC vs. NeS” and “NeC vs. NeT” comparisons. Red dots represent windows that surpass the upper-cutoff windows in both comparisons  hence putative signatures of selection After combining adjacent windows that displayed signatures of selection  48  7 and 17 genomic regions were identified by the   XP-EHH and iHS tests  respectively (see the full lists in Tables S3 and S4 [see Additional file : Tables S3 and S4]). In agreement with previous studies  most of the signals were detected by only one of the three approaches [  ]. Only six genomic regions were identified as containing signatures of selection based on two of the three metrics (Table ). For the signatures of selection that were identified based on two metrics  an identical extended haplotype had the highest frequency in the lines maintained under directional selection (Fig. )  which suggests that selection for increased YBW improved the frequencies of those haplotypes in Nelore populations  thus shaping a special pattern in these regions. The signature of selection on BTA14:83 850 000–84 000 000  which was identified by both cross-line comparison metrics ( and XP-EHH)  overlaps with a QTL that affects efficiency of metabolizable energy utilization for maintenance and growth  as previously observed in Nelore cattle []. The  () gene present in this region encodes a collagen isoform that plays a role in muscle development []. The signature of selection on BTA14:32 150 000–32 275 000  identified by both iHS and XP-EHH  overlaps with a QTL that affects several growth traits in beef breeds [    ]. The most interesting candidate gene residing in this region   ()  regulates appetite and controls the release of growth inhibitors in various organisms [  ]. Two additional candidate signatures of selection  detected via iHS and XP-EHH  co-localized on chromosome 16  and overlapped with a QTL reported to affect calving ease []. Haplotype frequencies for the four signatures of selection detected by two methods. Genomic regions were detected by both  and iHS (  )  XP-EHH and iHS (    ) or both F and XP-EHH (). Different colors  except the grey color  refer to haplotypes with a frequency higher than 0.1 in at least one of the three lines In addition to the two coincident signals detected by both iHS and  and the signal identified by both iHS and XP-EHH  within the 21–32 Mb region on chromosome 14  several other narrow regions were identified exclusively based on one of the tests (Fig. ). In beef breeds  several studies have reported signatures of selection within this genomic interval  which are mainly in close vicinity to the  gene (BTA14:25 007 291–25 009 296) [    ]  which is one of the major genes that affect bovine stature and other growth traits []. This genomic segment also includes QTL that were previously detected in Nelore cattle and affect sexual precocity  meat quality  body and carcass weight [    ]. Fortes et al. [] reported a significant association between several SNPs residing in this region and IGF1 serum levels in Brahman cattle. The segregation of this QTL in the Nelore breed could explain the signatures of selection that were detected in the lines undergoing directional selection for increased YBW  since IGF1 is a growth stimulator. Graphical representation of signatures of selection detected via XP-EHH and iHS within a hotspot region on chromosome 14. Grey and blue represent XP-EHH and iHS scores  respectively  for 100-kb windows; light green  orange and yellow boxes indicate signals detected via iHS   and XP-EHH  respectively. The dark green boxes indicate overlap between two tests Some interesting genomic regions were detected exclusively based on one of the three metrics. For instance  the signature of selection on BTA6:58 700 000–58 925 000 that was revealed by the  test overlaps with a previously reported signature of selection in Limousin cattle []. The candidate gene located in this region   ()  encodes a well-known body weight regulator in several species  including humans  mice  chickens and pigs [    ]  that is directly related to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle cells []. Another candidate signature of selection identified via   BTA6:118 650 000–118 800 000  is linked to a QTL for average daily gain that was previously detected in the same population as that used here []. This signature of selection could reflect the influence of the selection for YBW on the daily rate of weight gain. This region includes the  (-) gene and coincides with a copy number variant (CNV) region reported in Nelore cattle []. Previous studies have indicated a high level of coincidence between signatures of selection and CNV regions in cattle  which suggests that CNV may have a role in recent selection [  ]. Three of the signatures of selection detected via XP-EHH in our study (BTA14:77 975 000–78 875 000  BTA14:80 525 000–84 675 000 and BTA16:69 100 000–70 900 000) correspond to signals of recent positive selection that were previously reported in Nelore cattle []. In addition  the  () gene resides in the signature of selection on BTA14:24 150 000–24 300 000  which is a well-characterized gene associated with growth traits in cattle  including Nelore birth weight and meat tenderness [  ]. In addition to the signatures of selection that could be associated with directional selection for growth  the iHS test revealed signatures of selection that represent historical selection for attributes that have become fixed in the Nelore breed. For instance  the signature of selection on BTA23:25 450 000–25 625 000 overlaps with the - gene  which is involved in the bovine immune system and may be related to adaptation and high resistance to parasites. In addition  the signature of selection on BTA14:30 850 000–31 650 000 coincides with a QTL that was reported in the Nelore breed [] and affects alignment and appropriate angles of feet and legs  which are phenotypes that have been strongly selected for in animals registered with the Brazilian breed association ever since the breed was first established in the country. We describe a genomic scan in an indicine breed that has been selected for growth traits and is crucial for beef production in tropical environments. Our findings demonstrate that genetic stratification has occurred in this experimental Nelore population due to almost four decades of divergent selection. Three complementary approaches for the detection of signatures of selection were used to identify candidate regions on the autosomes  most of which overlapped with or were near known QTL and candidate genes that affect essential economic traits of beef cattle. The panel of identified loci includes well-known genes related to growth traits  such as     and   as well as novel candidates  such as    and . The candidate signatures of selection and the list of candidate genes presented here provide a basis to better understand the metabolic mechanisms that underlie the growth traits  which have been modified by selection for YBW. Moreover  these results provide candidate genes for further fine-mapping studies.  Lush JL. Animal breeding plans. 3rd ed. Ames: Iowa State College Press; 1945. Smith JM  Haigh J.

Alongside substantially expanding the ruminant lncRNA repertoire  the outcomes of our analysis demonstrate that stochastic sampling can be partly overcome by combining RNA-seq datasets from related species. This has practical implications for the future discovery of lncRNAs in other species. Mammalian transcriptomes include many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)  a collective term for transcripts of more than 200 nucleotides that resemble mRNAs (many being 3' polyadenylated  5' capped and spliced) but do not encode a protein product []. Proposed functional roles of lncRNAs include transcriptional regulation  epigenetic regulation  intracellular trafficking and chromatin remodelling (see reviews [       ]). Some view lncRNAs as transcriptional noise [  ]. Full length lncRNAs are difficult to assemble: many are expressed at low levels []  with high tissue-specificity [  ]  at specific developmental time points (e.g. [  ])  and with few signs of selective constraint [  ]. Many are also expressed transiently  and thus may be partly degraded by the exosome complex []. The initial recognition of lncRNAs as widespread and  outputs of mammalian transcription was based on the isolation and sequencing of large numbers of mouse and human full-length cDNAs [  ]  many of which were experimentally validated [] and shown to participate in sense-antisense pairs []. They were captured in significant numbers because the cDNA libraries were subtracted to remove abundant transcripts. More recent studies have used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to assemble larger catalogues of lncRNAs []. Because of the power-law relationship of individual transcript abundance in mammalian transcriptomes []  unless sequencing is carried out at massive depth  the exons of lowly-abundant transcripts (such as lncRNAs) are subject to stochastic sampling and are detected inconsistently between technical replicates of the same sample []. RNA-seq is also a relatively inaccurate means of reconstructing the 5' ends of transcripts []. To overcome this constraint  the FANTOM Consortium supplemented RNA-seq with Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data  characterising—in humans—a 5'-complete lncRNA transcriptome []. RNA-seq libraries from multiple tissues  cell types and developmental stages are commonly pooled to maximise the number of lncRNA gene models assembled. Genome-wide surveys have expanded the lncRNA repertoire of livestock species such as cattle (18 tissues  sequenced at approximately 40 to 100 million reads each) []  pig (10 tissues  sequenced at approximately 6 to 40 million reads each) []  horse (8 tissues  sequenced at approximately 20 to 200 million reads each) [] and sheep (8 tissues  sequenced at approximately 16 million reads each) []  complementing tissue-specific lncRNA catalogues of  for example  cattle muscle [  ] and skin []  and pig adipose [  ]  liver [] and testis []. The low level of lncRNA conservation (at some loci  it appears that only the act of transcription  rather than the transcript sequence itself  is functionally relevant []) reduces the utility of comparative analysis of the large RNA-seq datasets available from humans [  ] and mouse []. Among 200 human and mouse lncRNAs that are each characteristic of specific immune cell types  there was less than 1% sequence conservation []. Here we focus on more closely related species. We have generated atlases of gene expression for the domestic sheep   []  and the goat   (manuscript in preparation). Since these two species are closely related (sharing a common ancestor less than 10 million years ago (mya) []) and their respective RNA-seq datasets contain many of the same tissues  it is possible to use data from one species to infer the presence of lncRNAs in the other. Cattle and humans are more distantly related to small ruminants  nevertheless they are substantially more similar than mice. We extend our approach by using existing human and cattle lncRNA datasets to identify a consensus ruminant lncRNA transcriptome  and use the sheep transcriptional atlas to confirm that candidate lncRNAs identified by cross-species inference are reproducibly expressed. The lncRNA catalogues that we have generated in the sheep and goat are of interest in themselves [] and contribute valuable information to the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) project [  ]. Previously  we created an expression atlas for the domestic sheep []  using RNA-seq data that were largely collected from adult Texel<U+2009>×<U+2009>Scottish Blackface (TxBF) sheep. Experimental protocols for tissue collection  cell isolation  RNA extraction  library preparation  RNA sequencing and quality control are as previously described []  and independently available on the FAANG Consortium website (). All RNA-seq libraries were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh Genomics  Edinburgh  UK) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform (Illumina  San Diego  USA). The majority of these libraries were sequenced to a depth of more than 25 million paired-end reads per sample using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA library preparation protocol (polyA-selected) (Illumina; Part: 15031047  Revision E). A subset of 11 transcriptionally rich ‘core’ tissues (bicep muscle  hippocampus  ileum  kidney medulla  left ventricle  liver  ovary  reticulum  spleen  testes  thymus)  plus one cell type under two conditions (bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)  unstimulated and 7 h after simulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS))  were sequenced to a depth of more than100 million paired-end reads per sample using the Illumina TruSeq total RNA library preparation protocol (rRNA-depleted) (Illumina; Part: 15031048  Revision E). The choice of ‘core’ tissues was informed by those included in previous human and mouse transcriptional atlases [  ]  and reflect the high proportion of protein-coding genes transcribed in each species. Other samples—in particular  bone marrow derived macrophages—were included in the sheep expression atlas as a known source of novel mRNAs []. For characterising lncRNAs  we assume that the transcriptional diversity of protein-coding RNAs reflects the transcriptional diversity of non-coding RNAs. Sample metadata for all tissue and cell samples are deposited in the EBI BioSamples database under submission identifier GSB-718 (). The raw read data  as.fastq files  are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under study accession PRJEB19199 (). All RNA-seq libraries for goat were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh Genomics  Edinburgh  UK) (as above) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform (Illumina  San Diego  USA). These libraries were sequenced to a depth of more than 30 million paired-end reads per sample using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA library preparation protocol (polyA-selected) (Illumina; Part: 15031047  Revision E). Sample metadata for all tissue and cell samples are deposited in the EBI BioSamples database under submission identifier GSB-2131 (). The raw read data  as.fastq files  are deposited in the ENA under study accession PRJEB23196 (). Previously  we described an RNA-seq processing pipeline for sheep []—using the HISAT2 aligner [] and StringTie assembler []—for generating a uniform  non-redundant set of de novo assembled transcripts. The same pipeline was applied to the goat RNA-seq data. This produced a single file per species  merged.gtf; that is  the output of StringTie—merge  which collates every transcript model from the 54 goat assemblies (each assembly being both individual- and tissue-specific)  and 429 of the 441 assemblies within the sheep expression atlas [] (12 sheep libraries were not used for this purpose since they were replicates of pre-existing bone marrow-derived macrophage libraries  which were prepared by using an mRNA-seq rather than a total RNA-seq protocol). Not all transcript models in either GTF will be stranded. This is because HISAT2 infers the transcription strand of a given transcript by reference to its splice sites; this is not possible for single exon transcripts  which are un-spliced. The GTF was parsed to distinguish candidate lncRNAs from assembly artefacts  and from other RNA  by applying the filter criteria of Ilott et al. []  excluding gene models that (a) were longer than 200 bp  (b) overlapped (by more than 1 bp on the same strand) any coordinates annotated as ‘protein-coding’ or ‘pseudogene’ (these classifications are explicitly stated in the Ensembl-hosted Oar v3.1 annotation and assumed true of all gene models in the ARS1 annotation)  or (c) were associated with multiple transcript models (which are more likely to be spurious). For single-exon gene models  we used a more conservative length threshold of 500 bp—the lower threshold of 200 bp could be otherwise met by a single pair of reads. We further excluded any novel gene model that was previously considered protein-coding in each species’ expression atlas (as described in []); these models contain an ORF encoding a peptide homologous to a ruminant protein in the NCBI nr database []. These criteria establish longlists of 30 677 candidate sheep lncRNAs (14 862 of which are multi-exonic) and 7671 candidate goat lncRNAs (3289 of which are multi-exonic). The sheep genome  Oar v3.1  already contains 1858 lncRNA models  of which the StringTie assembly precisely reconstructs 1402 (75%). In spite of this pre-existing support  these models were included on the sheep longlist for independent verification. The goat genome  by contrast  was annotated with a focus on protein-coding gene models []  by consolidating protein and cDNA alignments—from exonerate [] and tblastn []—with the annotation tool EVidence Modeller (EVM) []. Consequently  there are no unambiguous lncRNAs in the associated GTF (  accessed 23rd October 2017) (unlike the Ensembl-hosted sheep annotation  the goat annotation is currently only available via NCBI). Each longlist of candidates was assessed for coding potential using three different tools: CPAT v1.2.3 []  which assigns coding probabilities to a given sequence based on differential hexamer usage [] and Fickett TESTCODE score []  PLEK v1.2  a support vector machine classifier using k-mer frequencies []  and CPC v0.9-r2 []  which was used in conjunction with the non-redundant sequence database  UniRef90 (the Uniref Reference Cluster  a clustered set of sequences from the UniProt KnowledgeBase that constitutes a comprehensive coverage of sequence space at a resolution of 90% identity) [  ] (  accessed 18th August 2017). CPC scores putatively coding sequences positively and non-coding sequences negatively. We retained only those sequences with a CPC score less than - 0.5 (consistent with previous studies [  ]) and a CPAT probability higher than 0.58 (after creating sheep-specific coding and non-coding CPAT training data  from Oar v3.1 CDS and ncRNA  this cut-off is the intersection of two receiver operating characteristic curves  obtained using the R package ROCR []; this cut-off is also used for the goat data  as there are insufficient non-coding training data for this species). For each remaining gene model  we concatenated its exon sequence and identified the longest ORF within it. Should CPC  CPAT or PLEK make a false positive classification of ‘non-coding’  this translated ORF was considered the most likely peptide encoded by the gene. Gene models were further excluded if the translated ORF (a) contained a protein domain  based on a search by HMMER v3.1b2 [] of the Pfam database of protein families  v31.0 []  with a threshold E-value of 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  or (b) shared homology with a known peptide in the Swiss-Prot March 2016 release [  ]  based on a search with BLAST<U+2009>+<U+2009>v2.3.0 []: blastp with a threshold E-value of 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. Shortlists of 12 296 (sheep) and 2657 (goat) candidate lncRNAs—each with three independent ‘non-coding’ classifications and no detectable blastp and HMMER hits—are in Tables S1 and S2 [see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2]  respectively. Using the set of Oar v3.1 transcription start sites (TSS)  which was obtained from Ensembl BioMart []  and the set of ARS1 gene start sites (  accessed 23rd October 2017)  we classified novel candidate lncRNAs for each species as done in []  as either (a) sense or antisense (if the coordinates of the lncRNAs overlap  or are encapsulated by  a known gene on the same  or opposite  strand)  (b) up- or downstream  and on the same or opposite strand (if <<U+2009>5 kb from the nearest TSS)  or (c) intergenic (if =<U+2009>5  10  20  50  100  500 kb or 1 Mb from the nearest TSS  irrespective of strand). The HISAT2/StringTie pipeline  used to generate these transcript models  could not infer the transcription strand in all cases  particularly for single-exon transcripts. Accordingly  some lncRNAs will overlap the coordinates of a known gene  but its strandedness with respect to that gene—whether it is sense or antisense—will be unknown. To assess the sequence-level conservation of sheep and goat lncRNA transcripts  we obtained human lncRNA sequences from two databases  NONCODE v5 [] (  accessed 27th September 2017) and lncRNAdb v2.0 [] (  accessed 27th September 2017) (which contain 172 216 and 152 lncRNAs  respectively). A previous study of lncRNAs in cattle [] also generated a conservative set of 9778 lncRNAs  all of which were detectably expressed in at least one of the 18 tissues (read count ><U+2009>25 in each of three replicates per tissue). These sets of sequences constitute three independent BLAST databases. For each sheep and goat lncRNA  blastn searches [] were made against each database using an arbitrarily high E-value of 10  as substantial sequence-level conservation was not expected. For each of the human (GRCh38.p10)  sheep (Oar v3.1)  cattle (UMD3.1) and goat (ARS1) reference genomes  we established those regions in each pairwise comparison where gene order is conserved  obtaining reference annotations from Ensembl BioMart v90 [] (sheep  cattle and human) and NCBI (goat;   accessed 27th September 2017). By advancing a sliding window across each chromosome gene-by-gene from the 5' end  we identified the first upstream and first downstream gene of each focal gene  irrespective of strand. For the purpose of this analysis  the first and last genes on each chromosome are excluded  since they have no upstream or downstream neighbour  respectively. Then  for each pairwise species comparison  we determined which sets of blocks were present in both—that is  where the HGNC symbols for upstream gene/focal gene/downstream gene were identical. These syntenic blocks  of three consecutive genes each  are regions in the genome where gene order is conserved both up- and downstream of a focal gene: between sheep and cattle  there are 2927 regions (comprising 5601 unique genes); sheep and goat  2038 regions (3883 unique genes); cattle and goat  2982 regions (5258 unique genes); sheep and human  380 regions (930 unique genes); goat and human  527 regions (1262 unique genes); cattle and human  443 regions (1063 unique genes). If in each syntenic block a lncRNA was found between the upstream and focal gene  or the focal and downstream gene  in only one of the two species  a global alignment was made between the transcript and the intergenic region of the corresponding species. Alignments were made using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm  as implemented by the ‘needle’ module of EMBOSS v6.6.0 []  with default parameters. By effectively treating lncRNA transcripts as if they were CAGE tags (that is  short reads of 20 to 50 nucleotides [])  we considered successful alignments as those containing one or more consecutive runs of 20 identical residues  without gaps. The probability that a transcript randomly matches 20 consecutive residues  within a pre-defined region  is extremely low. For successful alignments  the target sequence (that is  an extract from the intergenic region) was considered to be a novel lncRNA. For this analysis  the sheep and goat lncRNAs used are those from their respective shortlists [see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2]. Locations of lncRNAs in other species are obtained from previous studies that applied similarly conservative classification criteria. For cattle  9778 lncRNAs were obtained []  each of which were longer than 200 bp  considered non-coding by the classification tools CPC [] and CNCI []  lacked sequence similarity to the NCBI nr [] and Pfam databases []  and had a normalised read count higher than 25 in at least two of three replicates per tissue for 18 tissues. For human  17 134 lncRNAs were obtained []  each of which were assembled from transfrags longer than 250 bp  considered non-coding by the classification tool CPAT []  lacked sequence similarity to the Pfam database []  and had active transcription confirmed by intersecting intervals surrounding the transcriptional start site with chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from 13 cell lines. For the 11 ‘core’ tissues of the sheep expression atlas  plus unstimulated and LPS-stimulated BMDMs (for details Table S2 in [] and available under ENA accession PRJEB19199)  expression was quantified using Kallisto v0.43.0 [] with a k-mer index (k<U+2009>=<U+2009>31) derived after supplementing the Oar v3.1 reference transcriptome with the shortlist of 11 646 novel sheep lncRNA models (Additional file : Table S1) and those lncRNAs assembled in either human (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>18)  goat (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>164)  or cattle (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1219)  and which map to a conserved region of the sheep genome [see Additional file : Table S3]. Oar v3.1 transcripts were obtained from Ensembl v90 [] in the form of separate files for 22 823 CDS (  accessed 27th September 2017) and 6005 ncRNAs (  accessed 27th September 2017). An equivalent set of expression estimates was made for goat  across the 21 tissues and cell types of the goat expression atlas (i.e.  54 RNA-seq libraries available under ENA accession PRJEB23196). 47 193 transcripts  from assembly ARS1  were obtained from NCBI (  accessed 27th September 2017)  and supplemented both with the shortlist of 2657 novel goat lncRNA models [see Additional file : Table S2]  and those lncRNAs assembled in human (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15)  sheep (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>507)  or cattle (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1213) [see Additional file : Table S3]. After quantification in each species  transcript-level abundances were summarised to the gene-level. Expression levels were categorised as done in the Human Protein Atlas []  and as previously employed in the Sheep Gene Expression Atlas []. Each gene is considered to have either no detectable expression (average TPM <<U+2009>1  a threshold chosen to minimise the influence of stochastic sampling)  low expression (10<U+2009>><U+2009>average TPM<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)  medium expression (50<U+2009>><U+2009>average TPM<U+2009>><U+2009>10)  or high expression (average TPM<U+2009>=<U+2009>50). Three sample specificity indices were calculated for each gene  as in []. These include   a scalar measure of expression breadth bound between 0 (for housekeeping genes) and 1 (for genes expressed in one sample only) []  and the mean TPM (across all samples) divided by the median TPM (across all tissues). Genes with greater sample specificity will have a more strongly skewed distribution (i.e. a higher mean and a lower median)  and so the larger the ratio  the more sample-specific the expression. To avoid undefined values  if median TPM is equal to 0  it is set to 0.01. We also calculated a preferential expression measure (PEM)  as in []. PEM is calculated per tissue per gene (unlike ) and quantifies the expression of a given gene in a given tissue in relation to its average expression across all tissues (more tissue-specific genes will have higher PEM values for that tissue). For each gene  in tissue   PEM()<U+2009>=<U+2009>S - A  where S<U+2009>=<U+2009>expression of gene  in tissue   and A<U+2009>=<U+2009>arithmetic mean expression of gene  across all tissues. As there are biological replicates of each tissue  we considered  to be the mean TPM per gene and  to be the mean of all values of . Before PEM was calculated  all values less than 1 were considered to be 1  and a log-transformation was then applied. Each gene is also assigned one or more categories  to allow an at-a-glance overview of its expression profile: (a) ‘tissue enriched’ (expression in one tissue at least five-fold higher than all other tissues [‘tissue specific’ if all other tissues have 0 TPM])  (b) ‘tissue enhanced’ (five-fold higher average TPM in one or more tissues compared to the mean TPM of all tissues with detectable expression [this category is mutually exclusive with ‘tissue enriched’)  (c) ‘group enriched’ (five-fold higher average TPM in a group of two or more tissues compared to all other tissues (‘groups’ are analogous to organ systems  and are as described in the sheep expression atlas [])  (d) mixed expression (detected in one or more tissues and neither of the previous categories)  (e) ‘expressed in all’ (more than 1 TPM in all tissues)  and (f) ‘not detected’ (less than 1 TPM in all tissues). Network analysis of the sheep expression level data was performed using Graphia Professional (Kajeka Ltd  Edinburgh  UK)  a commercial version of BioLayout  [  ]. A correlation matrix was built for each gene-to-gene comparison  which was then filtered by removing all correlations below a given threshold (Pearson’s <U+2009><<U+2009>0.95). A network graph was constructed by connecting nodes (genes) with edges (correlations above the threshold). The local structure of the graph—that is  clusters of co-expressed genes—was interpreted by applying the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm [] at an inflation value (which determines cluster granularity) of 2.2. To test whether lncRNAs that are co-expressed with protein-coding genes are more likely to be closer to them (from which we can infer that they are more likely to have been derived from an enhancer sequence affecting that protein-coding gene)  we used a randomisation test as in []. First  we obtained clusters of co-expressed genes from a network graph of the sheep expression level dataset (see above). We then calculated   the number of times the distance between each lncRNA and the nearest protein-coding gene within the same cluster was higher than the distance between each lncRNA and the nearest gene within <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000 randomly selected  equally sized  subsets of protein-coding genes  drawn from the same chromosome as each lncRNA. Letting <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>  then the p-value of this test is <U+2009>+<U+2009>1/<U+2009>+<U+2009>1. Previously  we created an expression atlas for the domestic sheep []  using both polyadenylated and rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data that were collected primarily from three male and three female adult Texel<U+2009>×<U+2009>Scottish Blackface (T<U+2009>×<U+2009>BF) sheep at 2 years of age: 441 RNA-seq libraries in total  comprising five cell types and multiple tissues spanning all major organ systems and several developmental stages  from embryonic to adult. To complement this dataset  we also created a smaller-scale expression atlas—of 54 mRNA-seq libraries—from 6-day old crossbred goats  which will be the subject of a dedicated analysis. For both species  each RNA-seq library was aligned against its reference genome (Oar v3.1 and ARS1  for sheep and goat  respectively) using HISAT2 []  with transcripts assembled using StringTie []. This pipeline produced a non-redundant set of de novo gene and transcript models  as previously described []  and expanded the set of transcripts in each reference genome to include ab initio lncRNA predictions and novel protein-coding genes. As the primary purpose of the sheep expression atlas was to improve the functional characterisation of the protein-coding transcriptome  the novel sheep protein-coding transcript models generated by this pipeline are discussed in [] (novel protein-coding transcripts for goats will be discussed in a dedicated analysis of the protein-coding goat transcriptome). Using similar filter criteria to a previous study []  the de novo gene models were parsed to create longlists of 30 677 (sheep) and 7671 (goat) candidate lncRNAs  each of which was longer than 200 bp and was not associated  on the same strand  with a known protein-coding locus. The fourfold difference in the length of each longlist can be attributed to the relative size of each dataset. The sheep atlas contains 8 times as many RNA-seq libraries  spans multiple developmental stages (from embryonic to adult)  and has a subset of its samples that was specifically prepared to ensure the comprehensive capture of ncRNAs—unlike any sample in the goat dataset  this subset is sequenced at a fourfold higher depth (><U+2009>100 million reads  rather than ><U+2009>25 million reads) using a total RNA-seq  rather than mRNA-seq  protocol. Each model on both longlists was assessed for coding potential using the classification tools CPC []  CPAT [] and PLEK []  alongside homology searches of its longest ORF—with blastp [] and HMMER []—to known protein and domain sequences (within the Swiss-Prot [  ] and Pfam-A [] databases  respectively). Those gene models classified as non-coding by CPC  CPAT and PLEK  and having no detectable blastp and HMMER hits  are considered novel lncRNAs. This pipeline creates shortlists of 12 296 (sheep) and 2657 (goat) lncRNAs [see Additional file : Table S1 and Additional file : Table S2]  respectively)  representing approximately 40% (sheep) and 35% (goat) of the gene models on each longlist. The mean gene length is similar in both shortlists—6.7 kb (sheep) and 8.8 kb (goat)—as its summed exon length  averaging 1.2 kb in each species. Consistent with previous analyses in several other species [  ]  6956 (57%) of the sheep lncRNAs  and 1284 (48%) of the goat lncRNAs  were single-exonic. For sheep  the shortlist contains 11 646 previously unknown lncRNA models and provides additional evidence for 650 existing Oar v3.1 lncRNA models (Additional file : Table S1). A small proportion of longlisted gene models were considered non-coding by at least one of CPC  CPAT or PLEK  nevertheless they showed some degree of sequence homology to either a known protein or protein domain: for sheep  226 (including 13 existing Oar v3.1 models) [see Additional file : Table S4]  and for goats  153 [see Additional file : Table S5]. The number of novel lncRNAs identified is also given per chromosome  for sheep [see Additional file : Table S6] and for goat [see Additional file : Table S7] and per type  for sheep [see Additional file : Table S8] and for goat [see Additional file : Table S9]  the majority of which—in both species—are found in intergenic regions  10 to 100 kb from the nearest gene. Overall  the addition of these lncRNA models increases the total number of genes in the reference annotation by approximately 30% (sheep) and 12% (goat). Even with full length cDNA sequences  comparative analysis revealed that the majority are not conserved between species: estimates of the proportion of human lncRNAs with mouse counterparts range from 14 []–27% [] (see also review []). When comparing the sets of sheep and goat lncRNAs  few predicted transcripts—in either species—show sequence-level similarity either to each other or to other closely or distantly related species (cattle and humans  respectively  which shared a common ancestor with sheep and goats approx. 25 and 95 mya []). Of the 12 296 shortlisted sheep lncRNAs  less than half (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5139  i.e. 42%) had any detectable pairwise alignment—of any quality and of any length—to either the shortlisted goat lncRNAs  a set of 9778 cattle lncRNAs from a previous study [] or two sets of human lncRNAs (Fig.  and Table S10 [see Additional file : Table S10]). Minimal overlap of lncRNAs at the sequence level. Venn diagrams show the number of sheep ( and ) or goat ( and ) lncRNAs that can be aligned—either with an alignment of any length or quality (A and B)  or with =<U+2009>50% identity over =<U+2009>50% of the length of the target sequence ( and )—to either shortlist of goat ( and ) or sheep ( and ) lncRNAs  and to sets of cattle and human lncRNAs from previous studies. The majority (58% of sheep lncRNAs  and 49% of goat lncRNAs) have no associated alignment. Alignments are detailed in Additional file : Table S10 (sheep) and Additional file : Table S11 (goat) High confidence is possible only for a small proportion of these alignments  i.e. the alignment has a % identity higher than 50% within an alignment longer than 50% of the length of the target sequence. Of the 5139 sheep lncRNAs that could be aligned to any species  only 293 (5.7%) could be aligned with high confidence to goat and 265 (5.2%) to cattle transcripts. Similarly  of the sheep lncRNAs that could be aligned to either of two human lncRNA databases—NONCODE [] and lncRNAdb []—68 (1.6% of the total alignable lncRNA) aligned with high confidence to the NONCODE database  and none to the lncRNAdb. Similar findings are observed with the 2657 shortlisted goat lncRNAs: 1343 (50.5%) had a detectable pairwise alignment  of any quality  to either set of sheep  cattle or human lncRNAs. However  of these 1343 lncRNAs  only 113 (8.4%) aligned with high confidence to sheep  88 (6.6%) to cattle  55 (4.1%) to the human NONCODE database  and 1 (0.1%) to the human lncRNAdb database (Fig.  and Table S11 [see Additional file : Table S11]). These observations allow for two possibilities. First  lncRNAs may  in general  be poorly conserved at the sequence level  which is consistent with previous findings [  ] and the observation that only 6% of the sheep/goat alignments have more than 50% reciprocal identity. However  an alternative is that in spite of the apparent depth of coverage  we have only assembled a subset of the total lncRNA transcriptome in each species. A reasonable a priori prediction is that lncRNAs conserved in a closely related species—which are more likely to be functionally relevant—are also more similarly expressed. Whereas human and mouse lncRNAs identified as full length cDNAs were generally less conserved between species than the 5' and 3'UTR of protein-coding transcripts  their promoters were more highly conserved than those of protein-coding transcripts  some extending as far as chicken [  ]. These findings suggested that the large majority of lncRNAs that were analyzed displayed positional conservation across species. Accordingly  rather than comparing the similarity of two sets of lncRNA transcripts  we mapped the lncRNAs assembled in one species (e.g. sheep) to the genome of another (e.g. goat)  deriving confidence in the mapping location from synteny. For each of the pairwise sheep/cattle  sheep/goat  cattle/goat  sheep/human  goat/human  and cattle/human comparisons  we identified sets of syntenic blocks: regions in the genome where gene order is conserved both up- and downstream of a focal gene (see Table  and the “” section). In the sheep/cattle comparison  approximately 5% of the syntenic blocks contain at least one lncRNA with a relative position conserved in both species  either upstream (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>139 lncRNAs) or downstream (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>141) of the central gene in each block [see Additional file : Table S12]. In the sheep/goat and cattle/goat comparisons  respectively  approximately 2 and 3% of the syntenic blocks contain a lncRNA (for sheep/goat  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>42 upstream  40 downstream; for cattle/goat  86 upstream  83 downstream) [see Additional file : Tables S13 and S14]. With increased species divergence  far fewer lncRNAs have relative positions conserved in either the upstream or downstream positions of the sheep/human  goat/human and cattle/human syntenic blocks (typically  <<U+2009>1% of the syntenic blocks contain a lncRNA) [see Additional file : Tables S15  S16 and S17]. These comparatively small proportions highlight the minimal overlap between each set of assembled transcripts  which is consistent with stochastic assembly—lncRNAs expected to be present in a particular location are captured in only one species  not both. As such  very few lncRNAs in either of the sheep  goat and cattle subsets have evidence of both shared sequence homology and conserved synteny. When comparing sheep and cattle  16 unique lncRNAs have high-confidence pairwise alignments within a region of conserved synteny  and six when comparing sheep and goat [see Additional file : Table S18]. In most of the syntenic blocks examined  if a lncRNA was detected in one location in one species (either up- or downstream of a focal gene)  no corresponding assembled lncRNA was annotated in the species used for comparison  although for both species a similar range of tissues was sequenced. For example  of the 2927 syntenic blocks in the sheep/cattle comparison  347 (12%) of the sheep blocks  and 506 (17%) of the cattle blocks  contain a lncRNA in the ‘upstream’ position (that is  between genes 1 and 2)  with little overlap between the two species: in only 139 blocks (5%) is a lncRNA present in this position in both species [see Additional file : Table S12]. Similar results are found if the ‘downstream’ position is considered  as well as the sheep/goat  goat/cattle  sheep/human  goat/human and cattle/human comparisons: approximately 2 to 5 times as many lncRNAs are found in either of the two species than are found in both [see Additional file : Tables S13  S14  S15  S16 and S17]. Each set of syntenic blocks  by definition  represents a set of conserved intergenic regions. Given that the majority of the lncRNAs are intergenic [see Additional file : Table S8 and Additional file : Table S9]  these regions are reasonable locations for mapping candidate transcripts (strictly speaking  concatenated exon sequences) directly to the genome. For the syntenic blocks in each species comparison  we made global alignments of the lncRNAs in species  to the intergenic region of species   and vice versa (see Methods section). Retaining only those alignments in which the lncRNA can match the intergenic region with 20 or more consecutive residues (the majority of these alignments in any case have more than 75% identity across their entire length)  we predicted 1077 additional lncRNAs in cattle  1401 in sheep  and 1735 in goat  although only 44 in humans (Table ). The fact that comparatively few ruminant lncRNAs are recognisable at the sequence level in humans (and vice versa) is consistent with the rapid turnover of the lncRNA repertoire between species []. In the case of the goat  the number of new lncRNAs predicted by this approach is 50% more than the number captured (and shortlisted) using goat-specific RNA-seq (Fig. ). Stochastic detection and assembly of lncRNAs by RNA-seq libraries. These results—a consequence of limitations in sequencing breadth and depth—suggest that for a given species  only a subset of the total lncRNA transcriptome is likely to be captured. Nevertheless  the number of candidate lncRNAs for that species can be increased if directly mapping  to a positionally conserved region of the genome  the lncRNAs from either a related (sheep  goat  cattle) or more distant (human) species. Many of these mapped lncRNAs (which could not be completely reconstructed with the RNA-seq libraries of that species) are nevertheless detectably expressed This suggests that for the purposes of lncRNA detection  datasets from related species can help overcome limitations of sequencing breadth and depth. This is even apparent with comparatively large datasets—the sheep RNA-seq  for instance  spans more tissues and developmental stages than goat  but in absolute terms  it still fails to generate assemblies of many lncRNAs. To determine the expression level of the sheep lncRNAs  we used a subset of 71 high-depth (><U+2009>100 million reads) RNA-seq libraries from the sheep expression atlas []. This subset constitutes a set of 11 transcriptionally-rich tissues (bicep muscle  hippocampus  ileum  kidney medulla  left ventricle  liver  ovary  reticulum  spleen  testes  thymus)  plus one cell type under two conditions (bone marrow derived macrophages  unstimulated and 7 h after simulation with lipopolysaccharide)  each of which was sequenced in up to six individuals (where possible  three adult males and three adult females). For each sample  expression was quantified—as transcripts per million (TPM)—using the quantification tool Kallisto [] [see Additional file : Table S19]. Kallisto quantifies expression by matching k-mers from the RNA-seq reads to a pre-built index of k-mers  derived from a set of reference transcripts. For sheep  we supplemented the complete set of Oar v3.1 reference transcripts (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>28 828 transcripts  representing 26 764 genes) both with the shortlist of 11 646 novel lncRNAs (each of which is a single-transcript gene model) [see Additional file : Table S1]  and those lncRNAs assembled from either human  goat and cattle (respectively  18  164 and 1219 lncRNA; see Table )  the presence of which was predicted in sheep by mapping the transcript to a conserved genomic region. Of these 13 047 novel lncRNAs  8826 were detected at a level of TPM higher than 1 in at least one of the 71 adult samples  including 14 of the human transcripts (78%)  128 of the goat transcripts (78%)  and 772 of the cattle transcripts (63%) [see Additional file : Table S19]. At a depth of coverage of 100 million reads  we would expect to detect transcripts reproducibly at between 0.01 and 0.1 TPM if they are expressed in all the libraries that are derived from the same tissue/cell type. Indeed  of the 13 047 total novel lncRNAs  5353 (41%) were detected with at least one paired-end read in all six replicates of the tissue in which it is most highly expressed [see Additional file : Table S19]. Those lncRNAs derived from goat and cattle transcripts are similarly reproducible: 83 (51%) of the goat transcripts were detected with at least one paired-end read in all 6 replicates of its most expressed tissue  as were 570 (47%) of the cattle transcripts  and 7 (39%) of the human transcripts [see Additional file : Table S20]. By extension  we can consider sheep  cattle and human lncRNAs to be goat lncRNAs  and create a Kallisto index containing candidate lncRNAs that are extracted from the goat genome after mapping sheep and cattle transcripts. Using such a Kallisto index (which contains the 2657 shortlisted goat lncRNAs [see Additional file : Table S2]  507 sheep lncRNAs  1213 cattle lncRNAs  and 15 human lncRNAs)  1478 (34%) of a total set of 4392 candidate goat lncRNAs were reproducibly detected (><U+2009>0.01 TPM) in all four sampled goats [see Additional file : Table S20]. Hence  data from the sheep expression atlas can be used to provide additional functional annotation of the goat genome  in spite of the much smaller number of tissue samples compared to sheep. In general  lncRNA expression is low: 12 325 sheep lncRNAs (94% of the total) have a mean TPM less than 10 across all 71 samples. The mean and median maximum TPM for each lncRNA across the total sheep dataset was 18.4 and 2.2 TPM  respectively [see Additional file : Table S19]). Other reports have described pervasive  but low-level  mammalian lncRNA transcription []  and—given that the mean TPM exceeds the median—a high degree of lncRNA tissue-specificity [  ]. Indeed  for those lncRNAs detected at a TPM less than 1  the average value of —a scalar measure of expression breadth bound between 0 (for housekeeping genes) and 1 (for genes expressed in one sample only) [] (see Methods section)—is 0.66. Although most of the lncRNAs (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4972  65% of the 7627 lncRNAs with an average TPM higher than 1 in at least one tissue) have idiosyncratic ‘mixed expression’ profiles (see Methods section)  1339 lncRNAs (17%) are nevertheless detected at an average TPM higher than 1 in all 13 tissues [see Additional file : Table S19]. Many are enriched in specific tissues  with 905 (12%) lncRNAs exhibiting either a testes-enriched (that is  fivefold higher expression in testes than other tissues) or testes-specific expression pattern (that is a TPM higher than 1 in the testes and equal to 0 in all other tissues)  which is consistent with a previous study that identified numerous lncRNAs involved in ovine testicular development and spermatogenesis []. Many lncRNAs are expressed most strongly  even if not uniquely  in the testes. Each gene can be associated with a tissue in which it has the highest preferential expression measure (PEM; see Methods section). For the majority of genes  this tissue is the testes (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3770  49% of the 7627 lncRNA with an average TPM higher than 1 in at least one tissue) [see Additional file : Table S19]. In the largest assembly of predicted lncRNAs  from humans  the transfrags (transcript fragments) assembled from 7256 RNA-seq libraries were consolidated into 58 648 candidate lncRNAs []. Before assembling transfrags  machine-learning methods were used to filter  from each library  any library-specific background noise (genomic DNA contamination and incompletely processed RNA). Then  filtered libraries were merged before assembling the final gene models  which in effect is equivalent to pooling together transfrags (which may be partial or full-length transcripts) from all possible libraries. Consequently  a given set of transfrags can be assembled into a consensus transcript for a lncRNA  but that consensus transcript might not actually exist in any one cellular source. The only unequivocal means to confirm the full-length expression would be to clone the full-length cDNA. However  additional confidence could be obtained by increasing the depth of coverage in the same tissue/cell type in a technical replicate. In the sheep expression atlas  31 diverse tissues/cell types were sampled in each of six individual adults (three females  three males  all unrelated virgin animals approximately 2 years old). By taking a subset of 31 common tissues per individual  each of the six adults was represented by ~<U+2009>0.75 billion reads. In a typical lncRNA assembly pipeline  read alignments from all individuals are merged  to maximise the number of candidate gene models (using  for instance  StringTie—merge; see Methods). With <U+2009>=<U+2009>6 adults (and ~<U+2009>0.75 billion reads per adult)  there are 2<U+2009>-<U+2009>1<U+2009>=<U+2009>63 possible combinations of data for which GTF can be made with StringTie—merge. The reproducibility of each shortlisted lncRNA  in terms of the number of GTF it is reconstructed in  is shown in Table S21 [see Additional file : Table S21]. The GTF themselves are available via the University of Edinburgh DataShare portal; . Only 812 of the 12 296 sheep lncRNAs (6.6%) could be fully reconstructed by any of the 63 GTF combinations [see Additional file : Table S21]. One caveat in this assessment is that these sheep libraries are exclusively from adults. Many of the 12 296 lncRNA models may instead be expressed during embryonic development. There is evidence of extensive embryonic lncRNA expression in humans [  ] and mouse [  ]. The lack of embryonic tissues could also explain why fewer lncRNAs were assembled in goat. Nevertheless  when considering all 429 RNA-seq libraries in the sheep expression atlas (i.e. including non-adult samples)  there are only  on average  29 libraries (7%) in which any individual lncRNA can be fully reconstructed (Fig.  and Additional file : Table S22). Proportion of sheep expression atlas samples for which a candidate lncRNA cannot be fully reconstructed. The sheep expression atlas comprises 429 RNA-seq libraries  representing 110 distinct samples; that is  each sample is a tissue/cell type at a given developmental stage  with up to six replicates per sample. Twenty-two candidate lncRNAs cannot be reconstructed in any given sample (i.e.  the proportion of samples is 100%). These lncRNAs could be assembled only after pooling data from multiple samples. Data for this figure are in Additional file : Table S22 In many cases  full-length sheep lncRNAs cannot be reconstructed using all the reads sequenced from a given individual. For instance  the known lncRNA ENSOARG00000025201 is reconstructed by 28 of the 63 possible GTF  but none of these GTF was built using reads from only one individual [see Additional file : Table S21]. Only 189 lncRNAs (1.5%) were fully reconstructed in all 63 possible GTF. Notably  154 of these are known Ensembl lncRNAs [see Additional file : Table S21]. Enhancer sequences positively modulate the transcription of nearby genes (see reviews [  ])  and may be the evolutionary origin of a fraction of these lncRNAs (as suggested by [  ])  including a novel class of enhancer-transcribed ncRNAs  enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)  which—although a distinct subset—are arbitrarily classified as lncRNAs []. eRNAs are likely to be co-expressed with protein-coding genes in their immediate genomic vicinity. To identify co-regulated sets of protein-coding and non-coding loci  we performed network cluster analysis of the sheep expression level dataset [see Additional file : Table S19] using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm []  as implemented by Graphia Professional (Kajeka Ltd.  Edinburgh  UK) (see Methods section) [  ]. To reduce noise  only those novel lncRNAs with reproducible expression (i.e. that have a TPM higher than 0.01 in every replicate of the tissue in which it is most highly expressed) are included in this analysis (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5353). The resulting graph contained only genes with tightly correlated expression profiles (Pearson’s <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95) (Fig. ) and was highly structured  organised into clusters of genes with a tissue or cell-type specific expression profile [see Additional file : Table S23]. 3D visualisation of a gene-to-gene correlation graph. Each node (sphere) represents a gene. Nodes are connected by edges (lines) that represent Pearson’s correlations between the two sets of expression level estimates  at a threshold greater than or equal to 0.95. The graph comprises 11 841 nodes and 2214 099 edges. Genes cluster together according to the similarity of their expression profiles (i.e. their degree of co-expression)  with clusters (coloured sets of nodes) determined by using the MCL algorithm. Expression level estimates for the lncRNAs in this graph are in Additional file : Table S19. The genes comprising each co-expression cluster are in Additional file : Table S23. The lncRNAs that are co-regulated with protein-coding genes are found within the same co-expression cluster We expect that for a given cluster of co-expressed genes (which contains  lncRNAs and  protein-coding genes  each on chromosome )  the distance between an enhancer-derived lncRNA and the nearest protein-coding gene should be significantly shorter than the distance between that lncRNA and a random subset of protein-coding genes. For the purposes of this test  each random subset  of size   is drawn from the complete set of protein-coding genes on the same chromosome  (that is  the same chromosome as the lncRNA)  irrespective of strand and their degree of co-expression with the lncRNA. The significance of any difference in distance was then assessed using a randomisation test (see Methods section). Of the 5353 lncRNAs included in the analysis  1351 (25%) were found on the same chromosome as a highly co-expressed protein-coding gene [see Additional file : Table S24]  with 252 of these (19%) significantly closer to the co-expressed gene than to randomly selected genes from the same chromosome (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) [see Additional file : Table S25]. Even when the lncRNA is reproducibly expressed in each of the six animals  there is still substantial noise in the expression estimates which compromises co-expression analysis. We therefore calculated the Pearson’s  correlation between the expression profile of each reproducibly expressed lncRNA and its nearest protein-coding gene (which may overlap it)  located both 5' and 3' on the sheep genome [see Additional file : Table S26]. The distance to the nearest gene correlates negatively with the absolute value of Pearson’s   both for genes upstream (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.19  <U+2009><<U+2009>2.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and downstream (<U+2009>=<U+2009>- 0.21  <U+2009><<U+2009>2.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) of the lncRNA [see Additional file : Table S26]. This suggests that  in general  the expression profile of a lncRNA is more similar to nearer than more distant protein-coding genes. Using a variant of the above randomisation test  we also tested whether the absolute value of Pearson’s   when correlating the expression profiles of the lncRNA and its nearest protein-coding gene  was significantly greater than the value of  obtained when correlating the lncRNA with 1000 random protein-coding genes drawn from the same chromosome. For this test  analysis was restricted to the lncRNA that were drawn from complete chromosomes rather than the smaller unplaced scaffolds. 27% of lncRNAs had a Pearson  higher than 0.5 with either the nearest upstream or downstream gene  and in around 20% of cases   was significantly different (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) from the average correlation with the random set [see Additional file : Table S26]. There are  in total  2<U+2009>×<U+2009>6720 lncRNA/protein-coding gene pairs (i.e.  the lncRNA both with its nearest up- and nearest downstream gene  excluding 491 lncRNAs on unplaced scaffolds  for which pairing was not possible)<U+2009>×<U+2009>13 tissues/cells in which the expression of each gene is assessed. Of these 174 720 possible observations  there are 45 959 instances (26%) in which the lncRNA and the nearest protein-coding gene are both detectably expressed (TPM higher than 1)  of which the largest number are found in the testes (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2477 lncRNAs) and hippocampus (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2393) [see Additional file : Table S26]. In conjunction with a generally closer proximity to co-expressed protein-coding genes  this further suggests there is biological relevance for particular lncRNA/mRNA pairings  particularly in these tissues. Comparative analysis of lncRNAs that are assembled using RNA-seq data from several closely related species—sheep  goat and cattle—demonstrates that the de novo assembly of lncRNAs requires very high-depth RNA-seq datasets with a large number of replicates (more than six replicates per sample  each sequencing with many more than 100 million reads). The transcription of many lncRNAs that are identified by this cross-species approach is conserved  which is a reasonable confirmation of their existence. We identified a subset of lncRNAs in close proximity to protein-coding genes with which they are strongly co-expressed  which is consistent with the evolutionary origin of some ncRNAs in enhancer sequences. Conversely  the majority of lncRNAs are not co-expressed with neighbouring protein-coding genes. Overall  alongside substantially expanding the lncRNA repertoire for several livestock species  we demonstrate that the conventional approach to lncRNA detection—that is  species-specific de novo assembly—can be reliably supplemented by data from related species.

Six subspecies have been described based on morphological characteristics and/or geographical variations in wild and domesticated populations. In this paper  based on DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial D-loop  we investigated the genetic diversity and structure  genealogical relationships  divergence time and demographic history of  populations including domesticated individuals.ResultsAnalyses of 612 wild and domesticated turkey mitochondrial D-loop sequences  including 187 that were collected for this study and 425 from databases  revealed 64 haplotypes with few mutations  some of which are shared between domesticated and wild turkeys. We found a high level of haplotype and nucleotide diversity  which suggests that the total population of this species is large and stable with an old evolutionary history. The results of genetic differentiation  haplotype network  and genealogical relationships analyses revealed three main genetic groups within the species: mexicana as a population relict (C1)  merriami (C2)  and mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola (C3). Haplotypes detected in domesticated turkeys belong to group C3. Estimates of divergence times agree with range expansion and diversification events of the relict population of  in northwestern Mexico during the Pliocene–Pleistocene and Pleistocene–Holocene boundaries. Demographic reconstruction showed that an expansion of the population occurred 110 000 to 130 000 years ago (Kya)  followed by a stable period 100 Kya and finally a decline ~<U+2009>10 Kya (Pleistocene–Holocene boundary). In Mexico  the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt may be responsible for the range expansion of the C3 group. Two haplotypes with different divergence times  MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2  are dominant in domesticated and commercial turkeys.ConclusionsDuring the Pleistocene  a large and stable population of  covered a wide geographic distribution from the north to the center of America (USA and Mexico). The mexicana  merriami  and mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola genetic groups originated after divergence and range expansion from northwestern Mexico during the Pliocene–Pleistocene and Pleistocene–Holocene boundaries.

Six subspecies have been described based on morphological characteristics and/or geographical variations in wild and domesticated populations. In this paper  based on DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial D-loop  we investigated the genetic diversity and structure  genealogical relationships  divergence time and demographic history of  populations including domesticated individuals. Analyses of 612 wild and domesticated turkey mitochondrial D-loop sequences  including 187 that were collected for this study and 425 from databases  revealed 64 haplotypes with few mutations  some of which are shared between domesticated and wild turkeys. We found a high level of haplotype and nucleotide diversity  which suggests that the total population of this species is large and stable with an old evolutionary history. The results of genetic differentiation  haplotype network  and genealogical relationships analyses revealed three main genetic groups within the species: mexicana as a population relict (C1)  merriami (C2)  and mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola (C3). Haplotypes detected in domesticated turkeys belong to group C3. Estimates of divergence times agree with range expansion and diversification events of the relict population of  in northwestern Mexico during the Pliocene–Pleistocene and Pleistocene–Holocene boundaries. Demographic reconstruction showed that an expansion of the population occurred 110 000 to 130 000 years ago (Kya)  followed by a stable period 100 Kya and finally a decline ~<U+2009>10 Kya (Pleistocene–Holocene boundary). In Mexico  the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt may be responsible for the range expansion of the C3 group. Two haplotypes with different divergence times  MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2  are dominant in domesticated and commercial turkeys. During the Pleistocene  a large and stable population of  covered a wide geographic distribution from the north to the center of America (USA and Mexico). The mexicana  merriami  and mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola genetic groups originated after divergence and range expansion from northwestern Mexico during the Pliocene–Pleistocene and Pleistocene–Holocene boundaries. Old and new maternal lines of the mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola genetic group were distributed within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt where individuals were captured for domestication. Two haplotypes are the main founder maternal lines of domesticated turkeys.  is an original neartic species with a distribution that extends from Mexico to southeastern Canada and to the eastern and southern regions of the USA [  ]. Six subspecies of  have been described based on their geographical distribution and morphological characteristics such as size  coloration or iridescence of plumage  color of the legs  and color of the tip and base of the feathers  i.e. (1)  (domesticated) described by Linnaeus in 1758  (2)  (Silvestre) described by Vieillot in 1817  (3)  (Gould) described by Gould in 1856  (4)  (Río Grande) described by Sennett in 1879  (5)  (Florida) described by Scott in 1890  and (6)  (Merriam) described by Nelson in 1900 (for more details see [   ]).  is the one and only important domesticated animal species of North American origin []. Molecular studies based on mtDNA have suggested that the domesticated turkey is representative of the extinct wild subspecies  [  ]. Knowledge from historical registries indicates that different prehispanic Mexican groups such as the Purepecha  Huicholes and other ethnic groups of domesticated turkeys were present between 200 and 700 BC []. Leopold [] and Nelson [] proposed that domestication occurred in the highlands of Michoacan  Mexico  and according to Schorger [] domesticated turkey stocks were established by at least ca. 200 BC to 700 AD within the Tehuacan Valley (Puebla)  with bones dated from approximately 700 AD being identified in Guatemala. There are few molecular genetic studies on domesticated turkeys from rural Mexican communities. As far as we know  there is only one analysis that used microsatellite markers to analyze domesticated turkey populations from the five physiographic regions of Michoacan in Mexico and that revealed three genetically distinct groups []. Some studies focused on commercial or heritage turkeys  and for example  a microsatellite analysis showed that the commercial turkey is closer to the heritage Narragansett  Bourbon Red  Blue Slate turkeys than to the Spanish Black and Royal Palm turkeys []. A genomic study that included seven commercial lines  three samples of wild turkeys from Chihuahua in Mexico  and the heritage Beltsville Small White  Royal Palm and Narraganset varieties revealed that all commercial lines shared the same origin and that specific haplotypes may have been selected in the modern domesticated turkey []. Other studies have focused on the analysis of the diversity between subspecies and conservation of wild populations [    ]. Finally  an analysis of samples from bones and coprolites from archaeological sites in the southwestern USA and from the six proposed  subspecies using mitochondrial markers proposed two sites of turkey domestication that each involve wild turkey populations i.e. (1)  in south-central Mexico and (2) / with a subsequent introduction of domesticated stocks in the southwestern USA []. For agriculturally important species such as chicken () [   ]  duck () [   ]  cattle () [  ]  and pigs [  ]  phylogenetic and genealogical molecular analyses have helped to better understand the process of their domestication and to demonstrate the origin and inter- or intraspecific relationships of these species. Moreover  the use of mtDNA sequences in phylogeography analyses has been extensively tested and offers a highly sensitive method to analyze evolutionary processes []. Currently  they are the most widely used markers for such studies in vertebrates. In this study  our aim was to investigate the genetic diversity and structure  genealogical relationships  divergence times and the demographic history of   by putting emphasis on domesticated individuals to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this species. For these analyses  we used sequences of the mtDNA D-loop from domesticated  commercial and wild turkeys. Blood and tissue samples were collected from domesticated and wild turkey populations between 2001 and 2011. For each individual  blood samples of 0.1 to 0.2 mL were taken from the brachial vein or tissue fragments as large as a grain of rice were obtained and placed in 2 mL vials with 0.5 mL of storage and lysis buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0  100 mM EDTA pH 8.0  10 mM NaCl and 2% SDS)  saturated with salt-DMSO for tissue samples []. Then  samples were stored at room temperature during transport (about 1 week) and subsequently stored at 4 °C until further analysis. Samples were deposited in the Collection of Biological Samples of the Centro Multidisciplinario de Estudios en Biotecnologia (CMEB) of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo. A total of 187 samples were available for analysis: 161 originated from domesticated populations of  collected in Mexican rural communities from different localities in Puebla and from the five physiographic regions in Michoacan (Bajio  Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt  Balsas  Sierra  and Costa) [] (see Fig.  and Table ); four samples of domesticated turkeys were obtained from the Izabal department in the northeastern region of Guatemala; nine samples of the commercial line Bronze were collected on a farm in Ario de Rosales  Michoacan  Mexico (Fig.   Table ); nine samples of  individuals were obtained from a management unit for wildlife conservation in Canatlan  Durango in Mexico  a population that was reintroduced from Yecora  Sonora in Mexico; and four samples of  were donated by hunters that held a permission to hunt in Villa de Casas  Tamaulipas in Mexico (Fig.   Table ). Geographical origin of the turkey samples used for this study. Localities of sampling of turkeys for this study (green dots)  and locations of the NCBI GenBank database sequences (blue dots); the shaded polygons correspond to the following geographical regions of Mexico: SMOc<U+2009>=<U+2009>Sierra Madre Occidental (yellow)  SMOr<U+2009>=<U+2009>Sierra Madre Oriental (green)  TMVB<U+2009>=<U+2009>Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (blue)  and the MP<U+2009>=<U+2009>Mexican Plateau (not shaded) DNA was extracted from tissue and blood samples using the phenol-free method described by FitzSimmons []. The mtDNA D-loop sequence was amplified using the oligonucleotides NAU313 (5' GCCACCTGTGAAGAAGCC 3') and NAU185 (5' ACGGCTTGAAAAGCCATTGTTGT 3') []. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µL as follows: PCR buffer 1× (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.4  50 mM KCl  1.5 mM MgCl)  200 mM of each dNTP  10 pmol of each oligonucleotide  1.5 U Platinum  polymerase (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of DNA. The reaction mixtures were placed in a thermocycler (Gene Amp 2700  Applied Biosystems) under the following amplification conditions: 95 °C for 5 min  followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min  60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min  with a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy technique on both strands [] using the commercial service Macrogen USA. In addition to these 187 sequences  we analyzed 425 sequences from wild and domesticated individuals that were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database (Table )  which amounted to 612 sequences. Figure  shows the location of the individuals sampled for this study and the geographical origin of the sequences obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. Sequence editing  alignment  and construction of data matrices were carried out with Sequencher v4.1 [] and PhyDE []. The number of haplotypes (H)  polymorphic sites (S)  and nucleotide (p) and haplotype (Hd) diversity estimates for the domesticated and wild populations were calculated with DnaSP v5 []. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [] was used to calculate genetic variation and genetic differentiation between populations by performing 10 000 permutations. In addition  computed pairwise comparisons of  values with 1000 permutations were obtained with ARLEQUIN v3.1 []. To establish genealogical relationships between haplotypes and their frequencies  a haplotype network was constructed using the median-joining method [] with the software NETWORK v4.6.0.0 [] and setting default parameters. The relationships between haplotypes were also analyzed using phylogenetic inference. Matrices for these analyses included haplotypes that were identified in this study and haplotypes for each subspecies that are reported in the NCBI GenBank database (Table ). The sister species  was included as outgroup (Table ). Models of molecular evolution were evaluated with jModelTest v2.1.1 [] and selected using the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC) []. The best model obtained using this criterion was Hasegawa  Kishino and Yano []<U+2009>+<U+2009>Invariant sites  i.e. HKY+I. Reconstructions of genealogical relationships were generated using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) frameworks with RAxML v8 [] and MrBayes v3.2 []  respectively. Branch support values were estimated by bootstrap analysis (BP) of 500 replicates and by calculating posterior probabilities (PP). MrBayes was run with the following parameters: four independent runs of four chains each (one cold chain and three hot chains) for 10 million generations  sampling one tree every 1000 generations. Trees and parameters were summarized after discarding 25% of the data as burn-in. The remaining trees were summarized as a majority consensus tree and visualized using FigTree v1.4.0 []. The data matrix included two sequences of  and one sequence of  (GenBank Access HQ022888.1). Divergence times were estimated using BEAST v1.7.4 []. An uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model was selected with the HKY+I model of evolution. Because of the nature of the data  a tree prior with a coalescent model assuming a constant population size was used []. One calibration point with a lognormal prior distribution (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0  standard deviation (SD)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0  offset<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.6) and the oldest  fossil (2.6 Mya) that is registered in the PaleoDB fossil database (82 258) [] were used. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses were run for 10 million generations  sampling one tree every 1000 generations. The results were summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.7.4 []. Ten percent of the trees were discarded as burn-in  and the remaining trees were summarized as a maximum clade credibility tree including average divergence times and their associated 95% high posterior densities (HPD). Trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.0 []. We used =<U+2009>/2 to estimate the rate of substitutions per site []. We used a Bayesian skyline plot [] that was estimated by BEAST v1.7.4 [] and mismatch distribution [] to infer demographic history. Five independent runs with 30 million generations were conducted. The substitution model HKY+I with empirical base frequencies  was used with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model and a piecewise-constant coalescent Bayesian skyline tree prior with 10 starting groups. Trees and parameters were sampled every 1000 iterations  with a burn-in of 10%. The results of each run were combined in LogCombiner v1.7.4 [] and the result was visualized by using TRACER 1.5 []. In addition  mismatch distributions were obtained with the ARLEQUIN software package []. Mismatch distributions were calculated using the sudden expansion model [] with 1000 parametric bootstraps. The sum of squared deviations (SSD) and Harpending´s raggedness index (Hri) were calculated to assess the validity of the sudden expansion assumption. From the DNA samples of  collected for this study  we obtained 187 sequences (556 to 672 bp long) of the mtDNA D-loop that were registered in GenBank (Accession numbers: MF161996 to MF162182). Fifteen haplotypes were identified within the domesticated and wild turkey individuals analyzed in this study with an overall moderate Hd and low p (Table )  among which 11 were found in the domesticated turkeys from Mexico  Guatemala  and the commercial line Bronze with nine polymorphic sites  moderate Hd and low p. For the  individuals  we detected five haplotypes with eight polymorphic sites  high Hd and low p. Finally  only one haplotype was identified in . For the domesticated population from Mexico  we detected two dominant haplotypes designated MICH1 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>107) and MICH2 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>44) present in 61.49 and 25.28% of the individuals in the population  respectively. Interestingly  95 domesticated individuals from Michoacan  eight from Puebla  all those from Guatemala  one from the commercial line Bronze  all  individuals  and one  individual  which was originally designated as carrying the MGMDgoB haplotype  shared the MICH1 haplotype. Thus  considering that MGMDgoB and MICH1 are the same haplotype or maternal line  it was hereafter designated as the MGMDgoB/MICH1 haplotype. In addition  36 other domesticated individuals from Michoacan  two from Puebla  and six from the commercial line Bronze shared the MICH2 haplotype. These results revealed that many of the domesticated turkeys of Mexico and Guatemala and the individuals of the Bronze commercial line shared the same haplotypes; therefore  in the following analyses  they were treated as a single group called domesticated/commercial. Next  to corroborate and strengthen our results  the mtDNA D-loop sequences of all domesticated (described as ) and wild individuals reported in the NCBI GenBank database were included in the following analyses (Table ). The total population analyzed (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>612) showed overall high Hd and p (Table ). All the sequences of domesticated turkeys that were present in the NCBI GenBank database were included in the domesticated/commercial group. The analysis of domesticated/commercial turkeys showed moderate Hd and low p (Table ). Among the wild populations  diversity levels varied with the  population showing the lowest Hd and p levels  and the  and  populations the highest levels (Table ). Analysis of the genetic differentiation between the domesticated/commercial group and the wild populations showed that there is differentiation among these populations (Table ). The highest differentiation was observed between domesticated/commercial turkeys and . In addition  the lowest genetic differentiation values were found between  and . Based on these results  we defined three groups of : mexicana  merriami  and intermedia/silvestris/osceola/domesticated/commercial. The distribution of genetic variation obtained by AMOVA without a priori defined groups revealed that the genetic variation was highest within populations (Table ). The percentage of genetic variation among populations and the high fixation index indicated a structure with subpopulations within species. When we divided the population into three groups  the percentage of genetic variation between them was equal to 31.14%. The fixation index  reached a high value indicating a high level of genetic differentiation among groups (Table ). We constructed a haplotype network to visualize the relationships between haplotypes and their frequencies for the 612 domesticated/commercial and wild turkey sequences (see Additional file : Table S1). The analyses revealed 64 haplotypes that differed from each other by a small number of mutations. The network (Fig. ) shows eight haplogroups  each with a dominant haplotype. Four mexicana haplotypes clustered with those obtained from the NCBI GenBank database  forming a haplogroup with 34 individuals that shared the dominant haplotype Mgm (Fig. ). A haplogroup that derives from haplotype Mgm has the dominant haplotype Mg  which is shared by intermedia  merrami  and silvestris samples. Merriami turkeys integrate a haplogroup with the dominant haplotype Mgmer that is shared with the archeological samples []. Haplotypes of the intermedia individuals are dispersed and shared with domesticated/commercial  oceola  and silvestris turkeys. A haplogroup that contains mainly silvestris turkeys showed a dominant haplotype (Mgs) that is shared with domesticated (from Puebla  Mexico)  osceola  intermedia  and merriami individuals  and with peripheral haplotypes forming a star. Moreover  Mgs is related to the dominant haplotypes Mgo  MGMDgoB/MICH1  and MgArch through one mutation. Two haplogroups were linked with the dominant haplotypes MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2. Haplotype MGMDgoB/MICH1 is shared by domesticated turkeys from Mexico  Guatemala  Canada  and the USA  individuals of the commercial line Bronze and wild turkeys in the intermedia and mexicana populations. It was also detected in individuals that were previously identified as wild  for which samples were collected in 1903 in Veracruz and Michoacan  Mexico []. Additional haplotypes derived from MGMDgoB/MICH1 are present in domesticated turkeys of Michoacan  individuals of the commercial line Bronze  and mexicana  intermedia  and silvestris turkeys. Haplotype MICH2 is shared between domesticated turkeys from Mexico and Canada  most individuals of the commercial line Bronze  an osceola individual  and it corresponds to the same haplotype of an individual that was identified as wild  from Michoacan and collected in 1903 []. Derived from the MICH2 haplotype  peripheral haplotypes were identified that are present in the commercial line Bronze and domesticated turkeys from Michoacan (Fig. ). Median-joining haplotype network. The relationships between haplotypes identified in domesticated and wild   including 612 individuals and 64 haplotypes are shown. The size of the circles is proportional to the haplotype frequency. Black circles represent hypothetical intermediates or unsampled haplotypes. Dotted gray lines indicate loops that were broken according to Crandall and Templeton [] Phylogenetic analyses were performed to estimate the genealogical relationships between these haplogroups using the haplotypes that were detected in this study and the sequences that are designated as subspecies or domesticated in the NCBI GenBank database  which amounts to 64 haplotypes (Table ). In the ML and BI consensus tree  haplotypes from the wild mexicana population  which was identified as a haplogroup in the network  are basal (C1) (Figs.   ). Although the topology of the consensus tree shows polytomies  we can observe a clade (C2) that integrates intermedia and merriami haplotypes  which were detected as a haplogroup in the network  and a subclade that contains merriami haplotypes  which are linked with the haplogroup with the dominant haplotype Mgmer (Figs.   ). In addition  a large clade (C3) includes haplotypes that were identified in domesticated/commercial  archeological  intermedia  merriami  silvestris  oceola  and mexicana (MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MGMDgoD) individuals  which belong to five haplogroups detected in the haplotype network (Figs.   ). In one polytomy  we found haplotypes of the Mgo  Mgs and MGMDgoB/MICH1 haplogroups. The C3 clade also contains six subclades or expansions: three major ones (SCI  SCII  and SCIII) and three with two haplotypes each (SCIV  SCV  and SCVI). In SCI  the haplotypes corresponding to the haplogroup with the dominant haplotype MICH2 were included (MICH2  MICH5aqui  MICH8coah  Com9  MG80 and MG52) (Figs.   ). SCII  which covers mainly archaeological samples and one merriami individual  corresponds to the haplogroup with the dominant haplotype MgArch. SCIII is comprised of silvestris haplotypes  which correspond to the expansion of the haplogroup with the dominant haplotype Mgs (Figs.   ). Finally  the three subclades with two haplotypes each also correspond to expansions of haplotypes shared by silvestris and osceola turkeys  which in the network are related to the haplotype Mgs through one mutation.

The out-group is the sister species . Names of distinct clades/groups are indicated. Values over the branches represent posterior probabilities and bootstrap values (PP/BP). (*) Values below PP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5 or PB<U+2009>=<U+2009>50. The keys of the taxa are in Table  Using Bayesian inference  we analyzed divergence times to estimate when the separation of groups and expansions occurred. The results placed the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the genera  and  at 33.66 million years ago (Mya).  and  shared the MRCA during Pliocene-Miocene time limits [5.35 Mya  HPD (95%)<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.72–10.17]. Within   the differentiation of the basal group from northwestern Mexico (mexicana population) began during the Pliocene (3.39 Mya) (Fig. ). The more ancestral haplotypes of the intermedia and merriami turkeys share a MRCA in the Pleistocene (1.65 Mya) (Fig. ). In clade C2  the subclade  which is composed exclusively of merriami turkeys  originated 1.02 Mya during the Pleistocene and underwent a subsequent diversification with two haplotypes 0.43 Mya during the Pleistocene (Fig. ). In clade C3  diversification occurred at different times during the Pleistocene. Subclades SCI with haplotypes that were detected in domesticated turkeys originated 0.65 Mya  SCII with merriami and archeological haplotypes diverged 0.39 Mya  and SCIII with silvestris haplotypes originated 0.92 Mya (Fig. ). The three other subclades diverged 0.08 (SCIV)  0.28 (SCV)  and 0.07 (SCVI) Mya (Fig. ). However  these results should be considered with caution because of the low level of genetic variability in the data analyzed. Finally  to describe the changes in effective population size through time  we investigated the demographic history of the species. The mismatch distribution graph shows that the highest frequency of pairwise differences is around 2  which indicates that the population analyzed in this study has few mutations  and represents closely-related individuals. The values recovered from SSD (0.010  =<U+2009>0.35) and Hri (0.027  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.37) indicate that the analyzed data fit the sudden expansion model [] (Fig. a). Mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline plots. Mismatch distribution for the domesticated group (). Histograms correspond to the observed frequencies; the line represents expected frequencies under the sudden expansion model. Bayesian skyline plots shows the population history of  ()  with the black line indicating median population size estimates expressed in N. through time; colored areas represent 95% HPD intervals In the skyline plot  the y-axis shows population size expressed in   where  is the effective population size and is the generation time  which is approximately one year in  [  ]. The time axis was scaled using the rate of 0.0046 substitutions/site/million years (SSM) that was obtained in this study. The skyline plot analysis of all  individuals as a population shows a demographic reconstruction starting from 300 000 years ago (Kya) (Fig. b). Between 300 to 130 Kya  the population remained stable  followed by period of growth and then again a stable period from 90 to 10 Kya. In addition  a slight population decline at approximately 10 Kya was observed in the skyline plot. Based on the analysis of sequences generated for this study and from the NCBI GenBank database  our results show a high level of haplotype and nucleotide diversity which suggests that the turkey population has remained stable with an old evolutionary history []. Analysis of metrics of genetic diversity by group revealed particular histories. Domesticated/commercial turkeys showed moderate Hd and low p  which indicates that they originated from a small number of founders []. Silvestris  osceola  and intermedia populations showed the highest Hd and a low p  which suggests a bottleneck followed by a rapid expansion []  whereas the merriami population had a moderate Hd and a high p  which suggests that it has remained stable []. Regarding the sequences of mexicana individuals that were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>27)  all except one individual displayed the Mgm haplotype that we detected in this work  which results in this population having both low Hd and p  suggesting a bottleneck (Table ) []. Nevertheless  since we identified five haplotypes for nine mexicana individuals  we believe that increasing sample size and extending the geographic area analyzed would lead to the detection of additional haplotypes. In agreement with the levels of pairwise genetic differentiation and distribution of genetic variation by AMOVA analysis  approximately three groups of  were identified: (1) mexicana  (2) merriami  and (3) intermedia/silvestris/osceola/domesticated/commercial. This result indicates that although these groups share haplotypes  the proportion of unshared haplotypes exclusive to each group is significant and variable []. We found 64 haplotypes that differ from each other by a small number of mutations  with some of these haplotypes being shared by domesticated and wild populations  which indicates that in  there is no sub-speciation; this is in agreement with previous reports for the species [      ]. Eight haplogroups  each with a dominant haplotype  were identified. These haplogroups corresponded with the three groups that were identified by the analyses of genetic differentiation and distribution of genetic variation as follows: (1) mexicana (haplogroup with the dominant haplotype Mgm)  (2) merriami (haplogroup with the dominant haplotype Mgmer)  and (3) intermedia/silvestris/osceola/domesticated/commercial (haplogroups with the dominant haplotypes Mgs  Mgo  Mg  MGMDgoB/MICH1  MICH2  and MgArch) (Fig. ). Considering that the haplotypes identified in domesticated/commercial turkeys are shared with those in wild turkeys  we designated the third group as mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola. Figure  shows the geographic distribution of the haplotypes  which agrees with the three detected groups. It should be noted that the detection of the dominant haplotype Mgs in domesticated turkeys from Mexico and wild populations indicates that its distribution ranges from the central to northeastern and southeastern USA  and from northeastern to central Mexico (Fig. ). The fact that the dominant haplotype Mgs and its peripheral haplotypes form a star  is typical of population expansions from a small number of founders []. This coincides with the genetic diversity analysis of the silvestris population  for which high Hd and p levels and a negative  although not significant  Tajima’s D value (Table ) were found  which also suggest expansion of the population []. Map of the geographical distribution of . The shaded areas represent the distribution of the species according to Porter and Kirwan []. Pie charts represent the geographical distribution of haplotypes found in each sampling locality On the one hand  our results indicate that the dominant haplotypes MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2 are the main founding maternal lines of domesticated turkeys. On the other hand  since these two maternal lines were detected in individuals of the commercial line Bronze and in domesticated individuals from Canada and the USA  they probably constituted the basis of the current highly selected commercial lines. Our results agree with those of a study that evaluated the genetic diversity of different turkey populations by using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  i.e. that the heritage turkey varieties Royal Palm and Narragansett and commercial populations derive from the wild mexicana population  that the commercial lines share the same origin  and that possibly specific haplotypes (nuclear DNA) were selected in the modern domesticated turkey []. In addition  our finding that some individuals sampled from Guatemala carry the MGMDgoB/MICH1 haplotype indicates that there has been an exchange between northern Mesoamerica and the Maya cultural region  as proposed by Thornton et al. []. To confirm this  it would be necessary to analyze individuals from Central America. Our estimate of the date of divergence between the common ancestor of  and  genera i.e. 33.66 Mya agrees with the estimates reported by Claramunt and Cracraft []. The separation between  and  5.35 Mya coincides with the Miocene–Pliocene boundary  which indicates a deep divergence between lineages. We identified different diversification events in turkey particularly during the Pleistocene  which coincides with reports on fossils dated between 0.3 and 2.6 Mya []. At the base of the tree  mexicana turkeys (haplogroup Mgm)  which currently inhabit northwestern Mexico  are a relict population of . Similar to the results reported by Mock et al. [] and Speller et al. []  we found that the mexicana group  represented by the MGM60  MGMDgoA  MGMDgoC  and MGMDgoE haplotypes  is ancestral (C1 in Fig. ). Our results suggest a diversification process in the mexicana population during the Pliocene (3.39 Mya). We propose that the range of this population expanded towards the north in Arizona and New Mexico and towards the center of the USA. A second group (C2) that comprises the intermedia and merriami haplotypes (haplogroup Mg) originated in the same area (Figs.     ). Currently  merriami and mexicana populations occupy ponderosa pine and pine-oak woodlands of the southwestern USA and northern Mexico  respectively. Apparently  the great deserts of North America  are an efficient geographic barrier for the groups detected in the current analysis. In western North America (southwest of USA and northwest of Mexico)  we identified some genetic discontinuities that are associated with the Sonora-Mojave and Chihuahua deserts  which we suppose have isolated and promoted the divergence between mexicana and merriami populations. Based on our results on the establishment of several haplogroups in the geographical space  genealogical relations and genetic differentiation (Figs.    and Table )  we propose that the mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola genetic group (C3) expanded its range from the center of the USA east to the Atlantic coast and to the south through the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOr) until it reached the center of Mexico (Figs.   ). Genetic discontinuities have been identified within different vertebrate and plant species in the eastern of USA []. Based on our results  in  there is no genetic discontinuity in the region (Fig. ). However  the occurrence of shared haplotypes in individuals from locations in northeastern Mexico (intermedia) to Michoacan led us to propose that the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) may be responsible for the expansion of the range of the C3 group (Figs.   ). We assume that the Mexican Plateau acted as a geographic barrier that limited the contact between populations of mexicana and the C3 group (northeastern-northwestern of Mexico) (Figs.   ). Finally  we found that the haplotypes present in domesticated turkeys originate from the genetic group C3  which includes the MGMDgoB/MICH1 haplotype and its peripheral haplotypes  and by expansion from the SCI  which includes the MICH2 haplotype and its peripheral haplotypes. Thus  domesticated turkeys do not originate from an extinct subspecies . The presence of the MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MGMDgoD haplotypes in the mexicana relict population  indicate that the mexicana population and the C3 group have been in contact  probably in central-northwestern of Mexico (Figs.     ). However  we did not identify mexicana relict haplotypes in domesticated turkeys  thus this contact between the mexicana population and the C3 group probably took place through the expansion of the species from the center to the northwest of Mexico. It is important to note that a previous analysis based on microsatellite markers showed that the MGMDgoB/MICH1  and MGMDgoD haplotypes are present in the wild mexicana population []. In addition  the fact that the samples of wild turkeys collected in 1903 in the Michoacan and Veracruz areas of Mexico shared the haplotypes MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2 indicates that these old and new maternal lines persisted in the wild population of central Mexico until the last century. In contrast to other domesticated species for which events of interspecific hybridization or multiple origins have been observed [        ]  the domestication of the turkey is less complex; according to our results  domestication of this species has a unique origin that is likely in the center of Mexico  whereas Nelson [] and Leopold [] both proposed that it was in Michoacan  Mexico. However  the low nucleotide diversity in the D-loop sequence of  makes it difficult to determine the center of origin with more precision. The rate of substitutions per site obtained in this study coincides with the range of substitutions per site per million years of mitochondrial genes for birds reported in the literature []. The multimodal-shaped mismatch distribution suggests demographic stability (Fig. a). However  our data also support an expansion (SSD and Hri) that coincides with the population expansion observed in the skyline plot approximately 110 Kya (Fig. )  which also coincides with the Eemian interglacial period (during the marine isotope stages MIS5e and MIS6d that occurred 133 to 103 Kya [])  (Fig. ). Our results of the analysis of genetic diversity (high nucleotide and haplotype diversities) support the observation that the population remained large and stable 90 to 10 Kya (Table ). The observed population expansion followed by a stable period from 90 to 10 Kya is possibly associated with the expansions detected in the C3 group 80 and 70 Kya (Fig.   SCIV and SCVI). The slight decline of the population about 10 Kya coincides with the cooling during the Younger Dryas. Moreover  it has been reported that 12 900 years ago an extraterrestrial impact occurred in northern North America that contributed to the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions and adaptive shifts among Paleoamericans in North America []. Environmental changes caused by the combination of these events in North America may have impacted the availability of resources and consequently promoted the declines of the population observed in this study. Although it also is possible that human activities had some impact on the observed demographic decline  there is no evidence of intensive consumption of turkeys by Amerindian tribes (in USA)  since they showed preference for large prey during hunting [  ]. A large and stable population of  occupied a wide geographical distribution from the north to the center of America (USA and Mexico) during the Pleistocene. Due to the expansion of their geographical range and to divergence events during the Pliocene–Pleistocene and Pleistocene–Holocene boundaries  three genetic groups originated within the species: mexicana  merriami and mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola. The MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2 haplotypes and their peripheral haplotypes that belong to the mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola group  are the main maternal lines that were captured for domestication in the center of Mexico (Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt)  the only region of turkey domestication. Domesticated turkeys populations from backyards in Michoacan come from the founding domesticated population. To confirm these results further  sampling of turkeys should be extended to key regions of Mexico (Sonora  Zacatecas  Jalisco  Nayarit  Tamaulipas and the center-south region). Finally  we provide new data on the haplotype diversity that prevails among domesticated turkeys from backyards in Mexican rural communities  with six haplotypes  which  to date  had not been reported in .

The aim of this study was to investigate how genome editing in combination with genomic selection can accelerate the introduction of a monogenic trait in a livestock population as compared to genomic selection alone.MethodsA breeding population was simulated under genomic selection for a polygenic trait. After reaching Bulmer equilibrium  the selection objective was to increase the allele frequency of a monogenic trait  with or without genome editing  in addition to improving the polygenic trait. Scenarios were compared for time to fixation of the desired allele  selection response for the polygenic trait  and level of inbreeding. The costs  in terms of number of editing procedures  were compared to the benefits of having more animals with the desired phenotype of the monogenic trait. Effects of reduced editing efficiency were investigated.ResultsIn a population of 20 000 selection candidates per generation  the total number of edited zygotes needed to reach fixation of the desired allele was 22 118  7072  or 3912 with  no  moderate  or high selection emphasis on the monogenic trait  respectively. Genome editing resulted in up to four-fold faster fixation of the desired allele when efficiency was 100%  while the loss in long-term selection response for the polygenic trait was up to seven-fold less compared to genomic selection alone. With moderate selection emphasis on the monogenic trait  introduction of genome editing led to a four-fold reduction in the total number of animals showing the undesired phenotype before fixation. However  with a currently realistic editing efficiency of 4%  the number of required editing procedures increased by 72% and loss in selection response increased eight-fold compared to 100% efficiency. With low efficiency  loss in selection response was 29% more compared to genomic selection alone.ConclusionsGenome editing strongly decreased the time to fixation for a desired allele compared to genomic selection alone. Reduced editing efficiency had a major impact on the number of editing procedures and on the loss in selection response. In addition to ethical and welfare considerations of genome editing  a careful assessment of its technical costs and benefits is required."

The aim of this study was to investigate how genome editing in combination with genomic selection can accelerate the introduction of a monogenic trait in a livestock population as compared to genomic selection alone. A breeding population was simulated under genomic selection for a polygenic trait. After reaching Bulmer equilibrium  the selection objective was to increase the allele frequency of a monogenic trait  with or without genome editing  in addition to improving the polygenic trait. Scenarios were compared for time to fixation of the desired allele  selection response for the polygenic trait  and level of inbreeding. The costs  in terms of number of editing procedures  were compared to the benefits of having more animals with the desired phenotype of the monogenic trait. Effects of reduced editing efficiency were investigated. In a population of 20 000 selection candidates per generation  the total number of edited zygotes needed to reach fixation of the desired allele was 22 118  7072  or 3912 with  no  moderate  or high selection emphasis on the monogenic trait  respectively. Genome editing resulted in up to four-fold faster fixation of the desired allele when efficiency was 100%  while the loss in long-term selection response for the polygenic trait was up to seven-fold less compared to genomic selection alone. With moderate selection emphasis on the monogenic trait  introduction of genome editing led to a four-fold reduction in the total number of animals showing the undesired phenotype before fixation. However  with a currently realistic editing efficiency of 4%  the number of required editing procedures increased by 72% and loss in selection response increased eight-fold compared to 100% efficiency. With low efficiency  loss in selection response was 29% more compared to genomic selection alone. Genome editing strongly decreased the time to fixation for a desired allele compared to genomic selection alone. Reduced editing efficiency had a major impact on the number of editing procedures and on the loss in selection response. In addition to ethical and welfare considerations of genome editing  a careful assessment of its technical costs and benefits is required. Animal breeders have a long history in changing the genetic makeup of livestock. Until recently  this has only been possible through traditional selective breeding  which is a relatively slow process that accumulates desired alleles over many generations. In the 1980s and 1990s  the possibility of developing transgenic livestock seemed to offer an alternative approach of achieving selection response. By applying transgenic methodologies  a gene could be inserted into the genome of an organism at random positions  but this approach was hampered by technical difficulties and limitations and raised public concerns. So far  no transgenic livestock have been approved for human consumption  except transgenic salmon in the USA [  ]. The advent of genome editing (GE) has added new possibilities for altering genomes. New technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 have considerably improved the level of efficiency and precision of modifying the genome compared to the transgenic methodology. Editing can be guided to any specific location in the genome and could be used to change genes so that they produce a different product or become non-functional genes. It has been suggested that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to repair genetic defects  as demonstrated in mice []  or to confer resistance to diseases  as reported in wheat and rice []. Progress in GE has also been made in cattle  sheep  pigs and goats [   ]  for instance to confer resistance to diseases [] or introduce polledness (absence of horns) []. GE techniques hold much promise for the genetic improvement of livestock and have the potential to become the next game changer in animal and plant breeding. Genome editing in livestock has primarily introduced alleles that affect monogenic traits [  ]. Improving a polygenic trait by promotion of alleles by genome editing (PAGE) in combination with genomic selection was simulated by Jenko et al. [] and shown to increase response to selection after 20 generations by 1.08- to 4.12-fold compared to using genomic selection alone. In their simulation  it was assumed that genes and their effects were known without error. However  one of the major technical obstacles for implementation of GE in commercial breeding programs is the limited knowledge regarding the causative mutations that underlie the observed genetic variation. Therefore  PAGE may not be of interest for quantitative and complex traits in the near future because editing targets are lacking. Alternative approaches have been suggested that apply editing to many loci to simultaneously prove and use the effect of variants []. Designs for these schemes need to be developed and tested. Introduction of alleles by GE may have several advantages compared to classical breeding strategies including genomic-assisted introgression. Classical introgression breeding strategies are difficult  costly and time-consuming  and also suffer from a lower genetic gain  linkage drag and increased inbreeding in the region surrounding the target gene [  ]. The use of genomic data can improve the efficiency of removing the donor genome [   ] and further increase genetic gain [  ]  but it has not led to the application of introgression in livestock. When a monogenic trait is already present in the population  increasing the frequency of the desired allele from low starting values with classical breeding strategies is still difficult and results in increased inbreeding and decreased genetic gain in the total breeding goal [  ]. An example is the polled allele that is desired to breed dairy cattle without horns. Currently  horns are removed to prevent cattle from hurting each other or humans. However  dehorning is an invasive and painful procedure  which is expected to become further regulated or banned in some countries. In cattle  a single gene is responsible for polledness  but the corresponding allele is very rare in dairy cattle. It may easily take 20 to 30 years to reach fixation  and therefore this gene is a possible target for GE  since it would not have the disadvantages observed with selection provided that enough animals are edited successfully []. To date  it is not known how genomic selection and GE could be combined to reduce the number of animals to be edited  increase the allele frequency of a desired allele  and minimize the loss in genetic gain for other traits. Furthermore  the current efficiency of GE is low and the mortality of genome-edited zygotes is high []. Although CRISPR-Cas9 is a much more precise technique for GE than previous genetic modification techniques  edited animals may show off-target effects []  which would result in culling selection candidates. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which GE  in combination with genomic selection  could contribute to the change in frequency of an allele with a monogenic effect compared to genomic selection alone. We investigated the effects of the weight on the desired allele in the breeding goal  the rate of success of GE  and the survival rate of edited zygotes on the change in allele frequency using Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore  the effects on genetic gain in the polygenic trait and on the rate of inbreeding were assessed. The benefits from having animals with the desired trait and the cost  in terms of number of animals to be edited  were compared. The aim of this study was to mimic a livestock breeding population that  historically  had been selected for a polygenic trait (or index of traits). Starting in generation 0  increasing the frequency of the desired allele of a monogenic trait  such as polledness in cattle [  ]  was added to the breeding goal. A breeding population was simulated with discrete generations consisting of 100 male parents and 2000 female parents per generation (Fig. ). To produce the next generation  one male parent was randomly assigned to each female parent. Each mating produced 10 offspring  resulting in 20 000 animals per generation with random sexes assigned with 0.5:0.5 probabilities. Animals in the founder generation received a true breeding value (TBV) for the polygenic trait by drawing random values from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of 1 (N(0 1)) using the function rnorm()in R software []. TBV of the offspring in later generations were half the TBV of the sire plus half the TBV of the dam plus a Mendelian sampling effect drawn from a normal distribution N(0  0.5(1 - 0.5(F<U+2009>+<U+2009>F))). A genotype for the monogenic trait was assigned to all founders based on Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium proportions and a frequency for the desired allele of 0.01. A low starting frequency was assumed to allow comparison to selection scenarios without GE. The monogenic trait was controlled by a single gene with no effect on the polygenic trait  such as the dominant trait polledness in cattle [  ] or the recessive trait resistance to  F18 in pigs []. For these examples  the starting frequency of the desired allele would be higher than the 0.01 value that was chosen as the starting point for simulations. Schematic representation of the simulated breeding program In addition to the main scenario with 100 males  2000 females and 10 offspring per mating  additional scenarios were simulated with population sizes that were similar to real breeding programs in dairy cattle  pigs  and fish. In dairy cattle  the numbers of males and females per generation and the number of offspring per female were 200  600  and 16  respectively. These numbers were 50  2000  and 20  and 120  240 and 40  for pigs and fish  respectively. A “small” breeding program was also included with 20 males  240 females  and 70 offspring per female. Other parameters for these species-specific designs were kept the same as in the main simulation scenario. Selection was simulated in two phases. The first five generations of selection were only on the estimated breeding value (EBV) of the polygenic trait. This first phase was used to reach equilibrium genetic gain  after reduction of the genetic variance due to the Bulmer effect []. Truncation selection was applied to choose 100 sires and 2000 dams with the highest EBV from the total population of 20 000 candidates. The default breeding program  without GE  was a scheme where selection was for a genomic EBV with a reliability of 0.5 (). The EBV was simulated by adding to the TBV a prediction error (PE) that was drawn from a normal distribution  N(0 )  i.e. EBV<U+2009>=<U+2009>TBV<U+2009>+<U+2009>PE. Subsequently  the EBV were scaled to the proper variance by multiplying them with . In the second phase  the same numbers of sires (100) and dams (2000) were selected from 20 000 candidates in each of the 20 generations by truncation selection on an index    where  and  were the index weights and  was the number of desired alleles for the monogenic trait. The EBV was calculated as in phase 1 and the genotypes for the monogenic trait were assumed known without error. Index weight  was fixed to 1 and  had a value of 0  0.5  or 1000 (Table ). With <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  selection was only on the EBV  i.e. genomic selection on the polygenic trait. With <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000  maximum emphasis was put on the monogenic genotype. The value of <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5 was chosen empirically so that the change in frequency of the desired allele followed an intermediate pattern. We assumed that GE of the gene that affects the monogenic trait was applied to zygotes during reproduction. After mate assignment  matings were selected for editing and the resulting zygotes were subjected to GE procedures and could lead to edited offspring. The genotype of the selected parents did not change. In the different scenarios  GE was applied to the zygotes of either none of the matings  10% of the matings  or all matings. When editing was limited to 10% of the matings  we selected those that (1) had the smallest number of desired alleles for the monogenic trait in the parents and (2) the best parent average for . Genome editing changed all undesired alleles in the offspring into the desired alleles. An editing success probability    was applied separately to each allele and was set to 1.00  0.80  0.60  0.40  0.20 or 0.10 in different scenarios (Table ). A probability of surviving the editing procedure    was applied to each zygote that was subjected to editing and was set to 1.00  0.80  0.60  0.40  0.20 or 0.05 in different scenarios (Table ). Editing success and editing survival were the result of a Bernoulli trial with  respectively  probabilities  or . Values of  lower than 1.00 resulted in edited families having fewer offspring than families that were not selected for GE. Currently  efficiency of GE is low  with one live edited offspring for 24 edited zygotes reported in the literature []. To mimic this low efficiency  an editing success probability  of 0.20 was combined with a survival probability  of 0.20 in order to have one live edited offspring for every 25 zygotes edited. These values were used in a GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenario with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5. All scenarios were replicated 50 times. The number of editing procedures was counted at each generation as the number of zygotes that were genome-edited. Genome editing was applied only to families in which the parents carried at least one copy of the undesired allele. The genetic level in each generation was calculated as the average TBV and selection response was calculated as the difference in average TBV between the current and previous generation. Inbreeding of all individuals was calculated with the function calcInbreeding() of the package pedigree [] in R []. The inbreeding level in each generation was calculated as the average inbreeding coefficient  and inbreeding rate was calculated as the difference in average inbreeding coefficient between the current and previous generation. Frequency of the monogenic allele and the variance of TBV were calculated per generation. Choosing GE to increase the frequency of a desired allele will depend on  among other considerations  the costs and benefits of alternative approaches. The cost–benefit comparison was performed at a breeding horizon of 5 generations and at 20 generations. Costs of using GE were assumed to be mainly due to the editing procedures. The cumulative number of edited zygotes was used as a measure of costs. Benefits of using GE were calculated as the extra offspring that had the desired phenotype due to application of GE. Between scenarios  we compared the percentage of animals with the desired phenotype for the monogenic trait  assuming either dominant or recessive gene action. Adding the monogenic trait to the index will increase the frequency of the desired allele but  at the same time  reduce selection response for the polygenic trait. The parameters assessed in generations 5 and 20 were the loss in selection response for the polygenic trait in genetic standard deviations and in months  assuming a generation interval of 2 years  the cumulative inbreeding  and the frequency of the desired allele. The loss in selection response was based on the difference in mean TBV of a specific scenario and the mean TBV in the same generation in the GS scenario with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. The loss in selection response is presented in months by dividing this difference in mean TBV by the equilibrium response in generation 0 and multiplying by the generation interval of 24 months. The loss in selection response is also presented in genetic standard deviations using equilibrium genetic variance in generation 0. After five generations of selection on only the EBV for the polygenic trait in phase 1  the equilibrium genetic variance () and equilibrium selection response were reached with a genetic variance of 0.73 and a selection response per generation of 1.13. The allele frequency of the monogenic trait in generation 0 remained at the starting frequency  on average 0.01<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01. The desired allele of the monogenic trait was lost due to drift in 14 out of the 950 replicates across all scenarios (1.5%). The time to fixation for the monogenic genotype was very short with the maximum weight on the monogenic genotype and very similar to that obtained with four generations by GS and three generations by GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE (Table ; Fig. ). With a moderate weight on the desired allele (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5)  the time to fixation became very different between scenarios with 17 generations for GS and only five generations for GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE (Table ). With a moderate weight on the desired allele  GE greatly reduced the time to fixation. Response to selection. Frequency of the desired allele  change in   and   in response to genomic selection (GS) and in response to genomic selection with genome editing (GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE)  applying different weights () on the desired allele of a monogenic trait In most scenarios  the desired allele became fixed (Fig. )  with a few exceptions. The allele frequency did not change in the GS scenario with zero weight on the desired allele (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0). In the GS scenario with <U+2009>><U+2009>0  the desired allele was fixed in all except three of the 100 replicates for which the desired allele was lost due to drift (Fig. ). The GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenarios always resulted in fixation of the desired allele because even if the desired allele was lost due to drift  it was re-introduced by GE. With a zero weight  fixation was reached after 13 generations. With <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  selection in phase 2 remained the same as in phase 1: genomic selection for the polygenic trait. Due to inbreeding  the selection response for the polygenic trait decreased from an equilibrium response of 1.13 in generation 0  to 1.09 in generation 20 (Fig. ). When maximum emphasis was given to the desired allele (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000)  a sharp decrease in the response for the polygenic trait was observed in generations 1  2 and 3 (Fig. ). In generation 2  the response was only 29% of the equilibrium selection response in generation 0. When combined with GE  a sharp decrease in selection response was still observed  but only in generations 1 and 2 (Fig. )  and the lowest response still reached 62% of the equilibrium response in generation 0. Thus  loss in polygenic response due to selection for the monogenic trait was more than halved by GE. With a moderate weight on the desired allele (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5)  the reduced response lasted much longer  until generation 9  for the GS scenario (Fig. ). In the GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenario  the response was reduced for three generations with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5  which is only one generation more than with the maximum <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000. With =<U+2009>0.5  the minimum responses were similar with GS and GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenarios. Inbreeding was calculated with the pedigree that traced back to the founders in generation -5. In generation 0  average inbreeding  was 0.9%. The increase in  was larger in generations in which the selection emphasis on the desired allele was strong. The biggest increase in  was seen in the same generation or one generation after the largest decrease in selection response for the polygenic trait (Fig. ). Genome editing reduced selection pressure on the desired allele and therefore resulted in lower rates of inbreeding in the GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenario in the generations in which the desired allele was not fixed. Without selection on the desired allele (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0)  the inbreeding level was 2.2% in generation 5 (Table ) and with moderate selection (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5)  the inbreeding level in generation 5 was only slightly higher at 2.3 or 2.4%. These inbreeding levels in generation 5  with no selection or moderate selection on the desired allele  were very similar  regardless of whether GE was used or not (Table ). With moderate or no selection pressure on the desired allele  inbreeding levels were the same after 20 generations of selection whether GS or GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE was applied. Only when all the selection emphasis was on the desired allele (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000)  did GE decrease the long-term additional inbreeding from 1.2% with GS to 0.6% with GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE (Table ). Inbreeding was also assessed in species-specific scenarios in which numbers of males and females per generation were chosen to be close to those of real breeding programs. Inbreeding levels without selection on the desired allele were 4.9  12.2  11.7  and 31.4% in generation 20 for the cattle  pig  fish  and “small” breeding scenarios  respectively. In scenarios with all the selection emphasis on the desired allele  the long-term additional inbreeding was 1.2  2.1  3.2  and 4.9% with GS and 0.6  1.1  1.4  and 2.6% with GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE  respectively for the cattle  pig  fish and “small” breeding scenarios. The addition of GE reduced the long-term additional inbreeding by approximately half in all scenarios compared to GS alone. The cumulative benefit of increasing the frequency of the desired allele was measured as the percentage of animals that showed the desired phenotype  across all generations after generation 0. For a dominant trait  this included animals with the heterozygous and with the desired homozygous genotype  and for a recessive trait  this only included animals with the desired homozygous genotype. Scenarios were compared at generation 5 (Table ) and generation 20 (Table ). In a situation where fixation of the desired allele is essential in the short term  all the weight can be put on the desired allele. With GS  fixation took four generations (Table ) and incurred a loss in selection response for the polygenic trait of 31.3 months (Table ). In this case  the number of animals that still showed the undesired phenotype before fixation was (100% - 95.9%)<U+2009>×<U+2009>20 generations<U+2009>×<U+2009>20 000 offspring<U+2009>=<U+2009>16 400 animals for a dominant allele (Table ). With GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE  the additional cost was due to the GE of 3912 zygotes while the loss in selection response was reduced by 59% from 31.3 to 12.9 months and the number of animals with undesired phenotypes was equal to 9600 (41% less than the 16 400 animals with GS). With a moderate weight (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5)  the desired allele was fixed with GS after 19 generations (Table )  the long-term genetic loss after 20 generations was 11.9 months (Table )  and 58 800 animals had the undesired phenotype (dominant desired allele). With GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE  the additional cost was due to GE of 7072 zygotes while the loss in selection response was reduced to 1.7 months (86% less than 11.9 months with GS). The number of animals with the undesired phenotype decreased to 15 600 (73% less than the 58 800 with GS) for a dominant effect. The number of animals with the undesired phenotype decreased by approximately fourfold with GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE compared to GS. Both editing success rate () and editing survival () were assumed to be equal to 1.00 for all scenarios presented so far. When  was reduced from 1.0 to 0.10 (scenario GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5)  the required number of editing procedures almost doubled (Table )  the selection response fell behind by 5 months (Table )  and the time to fixation doubled from four to eight generations (Fig. ). Response in frequency of the desired allele with reduced editing success. Allele frequency under genomic selection with genome editing (GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE) for different levels of editing success probability () When  was reduced from 1.0 to 0.05  the increase in number of editing procedures was smaller than with reduced   around 50% more instead of 100% (Table )  and the time to fixation also increased by 50% from four to six generations (Fig. ). When  was low  surviving zygotes were always edited and thus likely to be selected. When  was low  non-edited offspring could be selected over their edited full-sibs  when their EBV for the polygenic trait was sufficiently high. Response in frequency of the desired allele with reduced editing survival. Allele frequency under genomic selection with genome editing (GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE) for different levels of editing survival () While reduced  had more impact on the number of zygotes that needed to be edited  reduced  had more impact on the loss in selection response. For  or  of 20%  the loss in selection response was 5.3 months versus 7.4 months  respectively (Tables  and ). To mimic the current low efficiency of GE []  a  of 0.20 was combined with a  of 0.20 in order to reach one successfully edited zygote for 25 edited zygotes. When these values were used in the GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenario with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5  fixation of the desired allele was obtained after nine generations with 12 144 zygotes edited (Table ). In comparison to the GS scenario without GE  the number of animals with the undesired phenotype before fixation was 26% less  and the long-term loss in selection response was 28% larger. In comparison to complete editing efficiency  72% more zygotes needed to be edited and the loss in selection response was 8 times higher (Table ). The impact of reduced efficiency was relatively larger on the loss of selection response than on the increased number of edited zygotes. With an efficiency of 4%  GE may enhance the increase in frequency of the desired allele compared to genomic selection  but increased the reduction in selection response due to reduced selection intensity. The objective of this study was to investigate how GE in combination with genomic selection could accelerate the increase in frequency of the desired allele for a monogenic trait compared to genomic selection alone. Assuming 100% accuracy and survival allowed an assessment of the potential of the technology. We observed a strong favourable impact of GE on time to fixation  loss in polygenic response  and number of animals that had the undesired phenotype before the desired allele was fixed. The main results are summarized in Table . In this study  the opportunities of applying GE to increase the frequency of the desired allele of a monogenic trait were evaluated. Earlier results of simulations of breeding with GE showed that polygenic traits could be improved by using PAGE []. An important hurdle to overcome for applying PAGE to quantitative traits and for increasing allele frequencies of monogenic traits is the availability of target mutations to edit. Only a small number of causal mutations are known that affect quantitative traits  and also the number of known mutations for monogenic traits is still limited. Making the application of GE cost-effective with a small number of targets that have known effects is more likely for a monogenic trait than for a quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) that affects a polygenic trait. With PAGE  an increased selection response of 4 to 8% was reached by making a single edit in each sire  provided that all the QTN were known and different targets could be used in different sires []. Alternatively  GE could be applied to many loci to simultaneously prove and use the effect of variants []. With this approach  the benefits from GE can be much larger than those shown in simulation studies to date  in which a limited number of known QTN were assumed available. When multiple edits can be made to the same zygote at low cost  the integrated testing and use of edits may make GE on QTN of small or uncertain effects cost-effective. Designs for these schemes need to be developed and tested and could give better results as “unproven” variants may just be neutral. Having only one single target may still be beneficial if its value for the population is large  as for instance when a single gene can confer resistance to disease. A monogenic trait  such as polledness  can also be highly relevant in view of the costs and the required changes in animal welfare regulations for dehorning of cattle. A single gene-editing target that is responsible for a small percentage of the genetic variance of a quantitative trait may have limited value. The money needed to perform GE on such a target may result in a bigger return when it is spend on additional genotyping or phenotyping to increase selection response. In comparison to current breeding programs  the observed rate of inbreeding in these simulations was low  i.e. 0.25% per generation  mainly because of the large number of parents  in particular  the number of males per generation (100) was larger than that commonly used in livestock breeding programs. The level of inbreeding increased when emphasis of selection on the desired allele increased (higher )  but not when GE was added to the scenarios. With <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000  inbreeding rate was actually lower in GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE compared to GS scenarios (Tables  and ). An increase in inbreeding rate may be observed when adding PAGE to GS in scenarios in which a small number of sires is edited []. In our simulations  edits were made in zygotes from many matings  which requires more editing procedures  but in this way  it actually reduced inbreeding because the desired allele becomes available in many more families. To test the impact on inbreeding with smaller population sizes  four species-specific scenarios were evaluated. In all those scenarios  the average inbreeding rate after 20 generations was similar in GS and GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenarios  except with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000. Even with a realistic number of parents per generation  inbreeding rate was still relatively low for dairy cattle  pig and fish breeding scenarios  ranging from 4.7 to 12.2% in generation 20. This low inbreeding rate in our simulations is probably because contributions of all parents were assumed equal. Therefore  a scenario with a small breeding program was included that resulted in an average inbreeding level of 31.4% in generation 20. Additional inbreeding from selection on the desired allele increased with a smaller effective population size but the benefit of using GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE instead of GS also increased  such that the additional inbreeding was halved in all scenarios by adding GE. The polygenic breeding value and the frequency of the monogenic allele were selected for simultaneously by combining the polygenic EBV and monogenic genotype in an index with fixed index weights. This index was the same for scenarios with and without GE. In these simulations  the trade-off between changing the allele frequency of the monogenic trait and the genetic progress for the polygenic trait was not optimized against genetic progress or inbreeding. Instead  three very different scenarios were included depending on the relative emphasis that was given to the frequency of the desired allele. For the intermediate scenarios with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5  optimization of the allele frequency trajectory could reduce the loss in genetic progress  and also the rate of inbreeding [   ]. The weights for the polygenic trait and the desired allele can be optimized given the starting allele frequency and the time at which fixation is desired. Optimization of the change in frequency of the desired allele with selection can reduce the disadvantage of GS scenarios in comparison to GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE. Introducing new alleles or increasing the frequencies of desired alleles does not necessarily require GE. Alternatives are introgression and selection for the desired alleles. Disadvantages of introgression are potentially a lower genetic level of the donor breed and lower genetic gain  linkage drag and increased inbreeding in the region surrounding the target gene [  ]. In our simulations  we assumed that the desired allele was already present in the population at a starting frequency of 0.01. The carriers of the desired allele were chosen at random and therefore  on average  at the same genetic level as non-carriers. This was an advantage compared to introgression from another (inferior) breed. This advantage will also apply when the desired allele needs to be introduced by GE. Moreover  by choosing the animals with the highest EBV as targets for GE  as was done in the GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE scenarios  the desired allele can actually become favourably correlated with the polygenic trait. This is the opposite effect from linkage drag as observed with introgression and selection  for which a negative correlation between the polygenic and the monogenic traits may arise because of gametic phase disequilibrium []. Genome editing offers clear benefits compared to alternatives when introducing new alleles or increasing allele frequencies from low values. Genome editing technology is being developed and tested in animals [  ] but which procedures will be applied in breeding programs remains to be determined. Depending on the species  the use of reproductive technology is at different stages of implementation. In dairy cattle  in vitro production of embryos (IVP) and multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) are commonly used in breeding programs  and applying GE during IVP may be relatively easy to implement. In this case  the parents may be selected as candidates to produce edited offspring  as was simulated in this study. An alternative  as simulated by Jenko et al. []  is to select the best animals based on their breeding value and apply GE to these elite animals. Editing these elite animals requires a cloning procedure to produce an edited copy of the selected animals such as somatic cell nuclear transfer []  unless the same embryo can be genotyped and selected  and subsequently edited before developing into an offspring. This procedure could take place in vitro by selecting the best embryos based on their genomic EBV and subsequently using cells from the same embryo to make edited clones. The generation interval could increase if a cloning step is needed  but this can be kept to a minimum if the whole procedure of genotyping  genomic selection  and editing can be done in vitro. In all cases  in vitro reproduction is an essential step to apply GE. Although in vitro reproduction techniques are frequently used in cattle  these techniques are much less developed in other major agricultural species such as pigs and chickens. Moreover  if editing of individuals is desired after obtaining their EBV  instead of editing the offspring of selected parents  the use of cloning somewhere in the process may be necessary. Even when in vitro reproduction is an established technology  there are a number of technical issues to be solved with GE before large-scale application is feasible. Currently  the probability of obtaining a live edited animal from applying GE is not high. Survival of edited zygotes is one important factor  but also the technical accuracy of GE needs to be considered. Genome editing may result in mosaics in which  part of a tissue is edited and other parts are not. In addition  GE may lead to off-target effects  i.e. changes in the genome at other positions than those intended. The occurrence of mosaics and off-target effects can be considered as an increase in mortality  as simulated in this study  assuming that mosaicism and off-target effects are either lethal or that the animals are not used for breeding for ethical or safety reasons. However  while direct mortality is a clear outcome of a procedure  excluding mosaic embryos or embryos with off-target edits requires their identification  which will be challenging. Strategies to screen for these effects are needed to avoid them going undetected [   ]. A final challenge with GE is the uncertainty about future acceptance of application of the technique in animal breeding. The legal framework for its application is not clear everywhere  which may limit the efforts put into research and potential applications. Some methods of application require cloning of animals  which is not allowed in several countries. Clearly  an ethical debate is needed on when and why the application of GE in animal breeding is desirable. The potential costs and benefits presented in this paper can contribute to this debate. When frequency of a monogenic allele is increased by GE alone  and GE has no detrimental effects such as reduced survival  a breeding program would not suffer from a lower selection response for the polygenic trait. For breeding programs that supply different markets (with potentially different competitors)  this allows compliance with regulations that apply for specific markets  for instance where dehorning is not allowed  without reducing the competitiveness in other markets that do not impose these restrictions. Determining the benefits of a technology is not a simple calculation  since values cannot always be captured on the same scale. Here  we made an attempt to compare such values for polledness in cattle using the results in Table   for which the impact of different scenarios was evaluated after five generations of breeding. Over the course of five generations  our simulated population counted 100 000 new-born animals. The basic scenario was GS with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  where no effort was made to reduce polledness. In this scenario  97.9% of calves  or 97 900 animals  were born with horns and would have to be de-horned  which is a costly and painful procedure for the calves. Assuming that the cost of dehorning is €10 per animal  the total cost of dehorning in our simulated population amounts to almost one million € after five generations. When applying GE without selection in scenario GS<U+2009>+<U+2009>GE with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  an additional 58.5% (60.6–2.1%) of the 100 000 new-born animals would have the polled phenotype  resulting in €585 000 saved after five generations. The associated cost was the application of GE in 10 000 zygotes. In this scenario  there was no negative impact on selection response or on inbreeding  so the breakeven cost for applying GE would have been €58.50 per zygote. In many countries  the national population of dairy cattle is much larger and the 100 selected males would be used to serve a much larger cow population  in which case the breakeven cost of an edited zygote would become much higher. With a cow population of 1 million animals and when evaluating costs and benefits after five generations  the breakeven cost for editing one zygote would be €2925. Genome editing has the potential to create a major change in how we perceive and implement genetic improvement of livestock and other species. While animal genetics research has put a lot of effort in the discovery and investigation of the effects of genomic variation on phenotypes  its implementation in breeding programs has been minimal. When GE becomes a cost-effective and accepted technology  the use of individual variants in breeding programs may finally become important. Such promises were also made for marker-assisted selection  but reality proved more difficult. The advantages of GE are that it does not rely only on variants that segregate in the target population  and  in case of a low allele frequency  it does not depend on the small number of animals in which the variant is found. However  a drawback that GE shares with marker-assisted selection is that in order to make the best use of it  the targets to edit must be known. Among the targets described in the literature  are alleles of the  gene  which were shown to have a role in the resistance to African swine fever in warthog []. Introduction of these alleles by GE into domestic pigs was recently reported []. Another example is a deletion in the  gene that determines the slick coat and heat tolerance traits in Senepol cattle []. Introduction of this allele into other cattle breeds by GE has been suggested []. While there are some examples of variants that can be targets for GE  such as those above or the polled locus used here  the number of known targets of interest to breeding schemes is currently limited. Thus  there is a renewed need for identifying causal mutations in the genome and for predicting their effect on phenotypes. The number of GWAS studies in animals is very large []  but the resulting knowledge about causal mutations is so far limited. While it remains difficult to determine causal effects  variants that are present in rare breeds or locally-adapted populations will become more important. In the past  these variants were studied  but their introduction into commercial breeding populations was not considered due to the issues with introgression that were discussed earlier. With GE  all these variants become of interest for breeding populations  independent of their current genetic background. In our simulation  we showed that GE strongly decreased the time to fixation for the desired allele compared to genomic selection alone. The loss in selection response in the polygenic trait was much smaller  up to seven-fold  with the addition of GE. The same level of inbreeding was observed with or without GE  except when all the selection emphasis was placed on the monogenic trait; then GE reduced long-term inbreeding. Combining GE with moderate selection emphasis for the desired allele reduced by about four-fold the number of animals with the undesired phenotype over all generations. With a realistic editing efficiency of 4%  the number of required editing procedures increased by 72% and the loss in selection response increased by 800%. With low efficiency  loss in selection response was 29% more compared to genomic selection alone. In addition to ethical and welfare considerations  a careful assessment of the technical costs and benefits of GE in commercial livestock is required. Ledford H.

In this study  we examined the genome of commercial purebred chicken lines for deleterious and functional variations  combining genotype and whole-genome sequence data.ResultsWe analysed over 22 000 animals that were genotyped on a 60 K SNP chip from four purebred lines (two white egg and two brown egg layer lines) and two crossbred lines. We identified 79 haplotypes that showed a significant deficit in homozygous carriers. This deficit was assumed to stem from haplotypes that potentially harbour lethal recessive variations. To identify potentially deleterious mutations  a catalogue of over 10 million variants was derived from 250 whole-genome sequenced animals from three purebred white-egg layer lines. Out of 4219 putative deleterious variants  152 mutations were identified that likely induce embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.

Together  this study provides a unique molecular perspective on functional and deleterious variation in commercial egg-laying chickens  which can enhance current genomic breeding practices to lower the frequency of undesirable variants in the population. In animal breeding  the number of deleterious genetic variants that are segregating in a population is affected by several factors  e.g. genetic drift  mutation rate  and selection. As a result  small effective population size and artificial selection can impact population fitness in domesticated populations substantially [] and can lead to a high risk of inbreeding depression  which is the result of the accumulation of deleterious alleles that increase in frequency  mainly due to genetic drift []. Deleterious alleles are expected to be purged from the population by purifying selection  and thus  generally remain at low frequencies in a population []. However  many evolutionary forces shape the landscape of deleterious alleles in a population  including recombination and genetic hitchhiking  which is a change in allele frequency due to the allele being passed along together with a variant that is under selection []. Recent examples have shown a large impact of such deleterious alleles in several livestock populations [  ]. Therefore  effective purging of these deleterious variants is desired. However  most of these variants are rare  and selection on rare variants is usually inefficient  especially if the relationship between genotype and phenotype is poorly characterised [  ]. In this study  we examined chicken layer lines that have been primarily selected for production traits  including mortality  egg production  egg composition  shell quality []  and traits related to animal welfare []. In spite of the many positive consequences of this artificial selection  several health issues are associated with intense selection for production traits in laying hens  including excessive comb growth  brittle bones  feather pecking  and ovarian cancer [  ]. To date  the underlying genetic architecture of these deleterious effects has not been characterised. Therefore  it is essential to better understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype  which is  to a large extent  still a black box []. Purebred chickens are routinely genotyped by breeding companies using SNP genotyping panels to accelerate genetic progress by applying genomic selection []. Although genomic selection itself may not be very efficient in eliminating low-frequency deleterious variants  the large number of routinely genotyped and pedigreed individuals does allow for the identification of deleterious variation. A powerful method is to systematically assess missing homozygosity in the genome by identifying haplotypes that cause early lethality by statistical depletion  or even absence  of the homozygous state  suggesting that they carry a lethal recessive mutation []. This approach can detect even very rare (frequency<U+2009><<U+2009>2%) deleterious haplotypes if a large number  at least several thousands  of animals are genotyped in a population. One disadvantage of this method is that low-frequency deleterious variants that reside on common haplotypes will be missed []. An alternative method that does allow such rare deleterious alleles to be identified is to sequence the entire genome of tens to hundreds of animals from a population. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to identify potential phenotype-altering variants  which can range from embryonic lethal (EL) to only mildly deleterious mutations in coding regions  and to predict their effects using various tools []. The use of WGS data from a population can lead to the discovery of variants that are beneficial for breeding programs [  ]  e.g. by looking for regions in the genome that are under (recent) positive selection. A challenge for this approach is to differentiate true selected variants and variants that increased in frequency as a result of genetic drift. In addition  the incompleteness of current genome annotations in most livestock species hampers the identification of such variants. In this study  we combined two complementary approaches to identify deleterious and functional variation (positively selected variants in relation to traits under selection) in purebred commercial layer lines. First  we showed that missing homozygosity can result from early embryonic lethality. Second  we mined the genomes of 250 whole-genome-sequenced individuals for deleterious (including embryonic lethal) and functional variants. The result is a comprehensive catalogue of putative deleterious and functional variants  which will be an important resource for future functional studies in chicken and should facilitate the purging of deleterious variants in breeding populations. We genotyped six different commercial chicken breeds using the 60 K Illumina SNP BeadChip: one purebred white layer dam line (WA)  one purebred white layer sire line (W1)  two crossbred lines (CB: W1-WA  W1-WD) and two brown layer lines (B1  B2) (see Additional file : Table S1). All animals from multiple generations were genotyped as part of a routine data collection from Hendrix-Genetics breeding programs. Chromosomal positions were determined based on the  GalGal5 reference assembly []. SNPs with an unknown position on the Galgal5 reference assembly and SNPs on sex chromosomes were discarded. Pre-processing was performed using PLINK v1.90b3.30 [  ] based on the following criteria: each SNP had to have a minor allele frequency higher than 0.01 (1%) and a call rate higher than 0.85 and animals with a call rate lower than 0.7 were discarded from the analysis. We did not filter for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) because haplotypes that exhibit a deficit in homozygosity were expected to deviate from HWE. We used the BEAGLE version 4.0 genetic analysis software for phasing of the SNP genotypes []. We used a sliding-window approach using window sizes ranging from 0.25 to 1 Mb in steps of 0.5 times the window size. Haplotypes with a frequency higher than 0.5% were retained for identification of missing homozygotes. The expected number of homozygotes was estimated using the parental haplotype information with the formula described by Fritz et al. []. The number of heterozygous offspring from carrier matings was also calculated to verify whether there was a deviation from HWE. An exact binomial test was applied to compare the number of observed versus expected homozygotes. Haplotypes were considered significantly depleted of homozygotes if the  value for this test was less than 0.005. We used WGS data from three commercial white layer lines  two dam lines (WA: 71  WD: 78) and one sire line (W1: 101)  and sequenced a total of 3.502 Tbp (tera base pairs) from 35.94 billion paired-end 100 bp reads sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq machine. We used Sickle software to trim the sequences []  BWA-MEM (version 0.7.15  []) to map the WGS data to the chicken reference genome (Galgal5) []  the Samtools dedup function to discard duplicate reads []  and GATK IndelRealigner to perform local realignments of reads around indels []. We performed population-based variant calling using Freebayes software taking the aligned BAM files as input with the following settings: —min-base-quality 10—min-alternate-fraction 0.2—haplotype-length 0—pooled-continuous—ploidy 2—min-alternate-count 2 []. Post-processing was performed using bcftools [] and variants that were located within 3 bp of an indel  or with a phred quality score and call rate below 20 and 0.7  respectively  were discarded. Moreover  genotype calls were filtered for sample depth (min: 4  max: AvgDepth * 2.5). We imputed the 250 WGS animals to 60 K genotypes  to match 60 K-based haplotypes to the available sequence data. The software Confirm-gt [] was used to match chromosome  strand  and allele to the phased 60 K reference population. BEAGLE version 4.0 was used for imputation and phasing. Carriers of haplotypes that were significantly depleted of homozygotes were examined for causal variants by selecting protein-altering variants carried uniquely by the haplotype carriers. We used the variant effect predictor (VEP  Ensembl-release 86) to predict the impact of the candidate variants identified []. The impact of the missense variants were assessed using the SIFT and PROVEAN software tools [  ]. Principle component analysis was performed using PLINK on the filtered vcf files and plotted using the R package ggplot2. PLINK was used with the—het option to calculate the inbreeding coefficient of each individual to assess the level of genetic diversity within each line. Annotation of the freebayes-called variants was performed using Variant Effect Predictor []. Variant effect prediction for protein-altering variants was performed using SIFT [] and PROVEAN []. The following variant classes were considered as potentially causing loss of function: splice acceptor  splice donor  inframe indels  frameshift  stop loss  stop gain  and start lost variants. Moreover  only variants that were annotated in genes and which were (mostly) 1:1 orthologous in Ensembl (release 86) were retained to minimize the effect of off-site mapping of sequence reads  as this leads to miscalls  which can be particularly problematic for large gene families (e.g. olfactory receptors). In addition  compensation of function by (recent) paralogous genes will likely ameliorate the effects of damaging mutations in these genes. Also  since gene models might be incorrect  variants that did not have a combined RNA-seq expression coverage of at least 200 in the Ensembl (release 86) merged RNA-seq dataset were discarded. The number and load of deleterious variants for each line were inferred from the final set of deleterious variants. We determined the distribution of allele frequencies for different classes of variants (synonymous  missense tolerated  missense deleterious  stop-gained) to test whether predicted deleterious mutations have generally lower allele frequencies. We generated a histogram with 20 bins (with steps of 0.05 allele frequency) starting from a very low (0–0.05) to very high allele frequency (0.95–1) for the different classes of variants using the PyVCF and SciPy software packages. To identify putative embryonic lethal (EL) variants  we selected all LoF and deleterious missense variants  for which no individuals that were homozygous for the alternate allele were observed. For every EL candidate we examined whether the gene is known to cause early lethality in mice obtained from the MGI database release 6.10 (i.e. phenotypes from null-mutant mice) []. We manually examined all predicted EL variants in JBrowse [] to exclude false positives that derived from sequencing and mapping errors. Significant differences in hatchability between carrier by carrier versus carrier by non-carrier phenotypes were assessed using a two-sample t-test  assuming equal variances. We divided proteins from Ensembl release 86 in 10 bins (from N- to C-terminal end) and we determined the relative position of the indel and stop-gained variants by dividing the position of the affected amino acid by the total protein length. We considered all alleles with a frequency higher than 0.9 (within each line) as fixed or nearly fixed variation. To identify regions under selection  we used an approach similar to that described by Elferink et al. []  but we applied a window size of 20 kb with a minimum number of 20 variants in each window. We selected a threshold of zHp =<U+2009>-<U+2009>2.7 representing the extreme lower end of the zHp distribution (see Additional file : Figure S1). Windows below this threshold were assumed to be enriched for regions of selective sweeps. We selected line-specific high-frequency variants (i.e. absent in the other two populations) with an allele frequency higher than 0.7. We tested whether certain gene families are enriched for deleterious mutations. Therefore  gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID functional annotation and classification tools []. Enrichment clusters (as produced by DAVID) with a score higher or equal to 1.3 were considered to be enriched []. The recombination rate is the genetic length in centimorgans divided by the physical genomic distance in mega base pairs and was calculated for bins of approximately 750 kb on macrochromosomes 1 to 5 using the linkage map of Elferink et al. []. Microchromosomes were excluded because of their extreme high recombination rates []. The ratio of predicted deleterious to predicted tolerated mutations (prediction by SIFT) was calculated within each bin by dividing the number of deleterious missense mutations by the sum of the synonymous and tolerated missense mutations over all three breeding lines. Pearson correlation was used to infer the relationship between the ratio of predicted deleterious to predicted tolerated mutations and the recombination rate. In layer breeding programs  genetic improvement is primarily achieved on elite purebred lines. These purebred lines are then crossed to produce parent stock production animals that are again crossed to produce the final laying hen production animals  which benefit from the full exploitation of heterosis []. To successfully screen these purebred lines for missing homozygosity  we assumed that not all deleterious variation has been purged  and that some low-frequency deleterious variation remains in the population. Since we examined carrier by carrier (C × C) matings  25% of the offspring were expected to be homozygous for the carrier haplotype. In total  we examined six lines for missing homozygosity  one purebred white layer dam line (WA)  one purebred white layer sire line (W1)  two crossbred lines (CB: W1-WA  W1-WD) and two brown layer lines (B1  B2). In total  information was available for 22 323 (post-filtering) animals genotyped on the Illumina 60 K chicken SNP BeadChip (52 232 SNPs)  which provided the statistical power required to detect even very rare haplotypes (see Additional file : Table S1). We performed phasing of all data to determine the haplotypes and used an overlapping sliding-window approach to identify haplotypes with a significant deficit in homozygotes. We identified 9  13  7  and 50 haplotypes that exhibited a statistical deficit in homozygosity (DH) in the WA  W1  CB  and B1-B2 lines  respectively (Table ) and (see Additional file : Table S1  S2  S3  and S4). The length of these haplotypes ranged from 0.25 to 1 Mb and the frequency of putative deleterious haplotypes ranged from 0.5 to 18.3%. The percentage of heterozygous progeny from C<U+2009>×<U+2009>C matings for these haplotypes was generally higher than 50%  which supports the deviation from HWE due to missing homozygous offspring (Table ). The frequency of these haplotypes was generally low (<<U+2009>5%) but two haplotypes that showed a deficit in homozygosity had relatively high frequencies (><U+2009>10%) in the crossbred line (on  chromosome (GGA)1: 180.25–180.75 Mb and GGA5: 5.5–6.0 Mb). We examined the sequence of the carriers for haplotypes showing a deficit in homozygosity (from the WA and W1 lines) for protein altering variants that were shared by the carriers for each putative deleterious haplotype but for which no homozygous individuals were observed. We identified two candidate mutations (see Additional file : Table S2) that segregated in the purebred (WA and W1) and crossbred lines. These two haplotypes  which were initially identified in the crossbreds (GGA2: 56.0–56.5  GGA3: 94.125–94.875 Mb)  contain protein altering mutations in the  (C198S) and  (A261G) genes. Both these genes are considered to be essential for normal development and associated with early lethality in mice (inferred from null-mutants  [  ]). Only the alanine to glycine mutation in the  genes was predicted to be mildly deleterious by SIFT and PROVEAN (see Additional file : Table S2). We also explored the use of WGS data for direct inference of deleterious variation using sequence data from three commercial white layer lines  one sire line (W1)  and two dam lines (WA and WD). We sequenced 250 animals from these lines (WA: 71  WD: 78  and W1: 101)  for a total volume of 3.502 Tbp (tera base pairs) from 35.94 billion paired-end 100 bp reads. Mapping was performed with BWA-MEM (version 0.7.15  []) to the  build 5 reference genome [] with an average mappability and coverage of 99.76%  and 11.4 (range: 8.3X to 22.9X)  respectively (Pipeline overview [see Additional file : Figure S2]). We performed population-based variant calling using Freebayes [] to identify 10 260 277 (post-filtering) variants in the three lines (see Additional file : Table S3). From the total 10 260 277 (post-filtering) identified variants  9 469 408 (98.5% biallelic) were SNPs and 790 869 were indels. The average SNP density was 11.0 per kb (see Additional file : Table S3). We identified 2 143 367 novel variants (20.89%) that were not annotated in dbSNP (build 147)  of which the majority was breeding line specific (WA  WD  or W1) (see Additional file : Table S4). An average call rate of 0.95 and an average transition/transversion (TS/TV) ratio of 2.53 were found for the entire variant set (see Additional file : Figure S3 and Additional file : Table S5)  which are congruent with previous findings in other avian species [  ]. Sample origin was validated using principal component analysis (PCA) (see Additional file : Figure S4). We assessed the level of genetic diversity by calculating the F statistic within the three lines (WA  WD  and W1) and observed that it was lower in the WA line than in the other two lines (see Additional file : Figure S5). Accordingly  we found a smaller number of line-specific SNPs in the WA line compared to the other two lines (see Additional file : Table S4). Moreover  we observed that WA animals carried on average fewer deleterious variants than the other two lines. However  the mutation load  calculated as the ratio of deleterious (SIFT<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) to synonymous variants  was higher in the WA line than in the WD and W1 lines  which was in line with the lower genetic diversity within this line (Fig. ).  Distribution of the number of heterozygous (-Het) and homozygous (-Hom) individuals for putative deleterious variants.  Mutation load  calculated as the ratio of deleterious to synonymous variants for heterozygous and homozygous individuals for putative deleterious variants Variant effect prediction assigned a range of functional classes to the identified variants (see Additional file : Table S6). Of the 120 149 coding (35 963 protein-altering) variants that we identified  the large majority were synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. Furthermore  2.04% (2437) of the variants were classified as potentially introducing a loss-of-function (frameshift  inframe deletion  inframe insertion  splice acceptor  splice donor  start lost  stop gained  and stop lost variants). Of the 33 492 missense mutations  5546 and 3053 were predicted to be deleterious by the SIFT and PROVEAN software  respectively  of which 1847 were predicted by both methods (see Additional file : Figure S6). A final set of 4219 putative deleterious variants  distributed across nine classes of deleterious variants  was obtained after filtering (see “”) and (see Additional file : Table S7). We found that the spectrum of allele frequencies of deleterious variants differed from that of neutral variants  and was skewed towards a higher proportion of low-frequency alleles (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Figure S7). Their relative low frequency supports the hypothesis that the predicted deleterious variants are subject to purifying selection. Allele frequency distribution for different functional classes of putative deleterious variants. Deleterious variants (deleterious missense and stop-gained) show distinct allele frequency spectra compared to variants considered to be neutral (synonymous  missense tolerated). Missense variants are classified by SIFT (deleterious: SIFT score<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05  tolerated: SIFT score<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) The impact of LoF variants on the protein is potentially determined by the position of the variant in the amino acid sequence. We found that frameshift and stop-gained variants were enriched at the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein  a pattern that was not present for inframe indels  which rather showed a more or less uniform distribution of location across the protein (Fig. a). Frameshift or stop-gained variants at the N-terminus could be “rescued” by alternate start-codons  while variants at the C terminus are less likely to be disruptive because they may still result in a more-or-less functional protein. Moreover  deleterious missense mutations occurred more often at the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein  while synonymous mutations occurred less frequently at those positions (see Additional file : Figures S8 and S9). Overall  coding indels were enriched for in-frame indels (e.g. 3  6  9 bp)  because these are more likely to be evolutionary-tolerated (and therefore not purged from the population)  which usually does not apply to frameshift indels (Fig. b).  Relative position of frameshift  non-frameshift indels  and stop-gained variants. Frameshift variants are enriched in N- and C-terminal parts of the protein. Frameshift variants at the N-terminal sites are potentially “rescued” by alternate start-codons. Frameshift variants at the C terminal end are likely not disruptive since a functional protein might still be translated.  Distribution of lengths of coding and non-coding indels. In-frame indels (i.e. indels with lengths of 3  6  and 9 nucleotides) are enriched in coding regions Next  we examined whether the ratio of deleterious to tolerated mutations was affected by the recombination rate. A significant negative correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.26  =<U+2009>2.89×10e) was found between the recombination rate and the ratio of deleterious to tolerated alleles  providing evidence of more effective purging in regions with high recombination rates (Fig. ). Enrichment of deleterious over tolerated variants was especially evident in regions of very low recombination (recombination rate less than 2%  [see Additional file : Figure S10]). Pearson correlation between recombination rate and the ratio of putative deleterious to tolerated alleles for regions that harbour such alleles. Results indicate that regions of low recombination are generally enriched for deleterious variants (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.26  P<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.89e-09) To identify variants that likely result in early lethality during development (EL)  we selected all putative LoF and deleterious missense variants that met the following two criteria: (1) no homozygous individuals for the allele were observed; and (2) the affected gene caused early lethality in null-mutant mice []. Based on these criteria  we identified 11 frameshift  five inframe indels (predicted as deleterious by PROVEAN)  six stop-gained  five splice acceptor  eight splice donor  and 121 deleterious missense variants (see Additional file : Table S1). The majority of these 152 candidate EL variants (86.6%) were specific to one line and contained frameshift mutations in the  and  genes  which are both associated with embryonic lethality and malformations in cattle [  ]. Of the five in-frame indels  two exhibited relatively high carrier frequencies (><U+2009>5%) in the WD line and affected the genes  and . We also identified 13 candidate splice donor and acceptor variants that could potentially lead to mis-splicing  resulting in an incomplete or incorrect protein. Two splice variants exhibited relatively high allele frequencies (><U+2009>5%) and affected the  and  genes. Moreover  one high-frequency (22.3%) stop-gained variant affected the C-terminal end of the SCRIB protein and  thus  might not be disruptive as an almost complete functional protein should be translated (see Additional file : Table S1). The large majority (~<U+2009>84%) of the 122 candidate EL missense variants were specific to a line (WA: 19  WD: 46  and W1: 37). Twenty-five variants were predicted to be highly deleterious (PROVEAN score<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>5  Table   and [see Additional file : Figure S11]). One specific missense variant in the  gene  which causes a tyrosine to cysteine substitution (Y19G)  is a strong candidate for embryonic lethality in homozygous carriers  in spite of its relative high frequency (8.9%). The tyrosine at position 19 of OFD1 is highly conserved among vertebrates and  thus  this missense mutation is predicted to be highly deleterious (PROVEAN: -<U+2009>7.42  SIFT: 0.0). From the 18 carrier animals (15 sires and 3 dams)  we identified three C<U+2009>×<U+2009>C matings in the breeding data that showed a significant (=<U+2009>0.0165) increase in the percentage of embryos that died during development (see Additional file : Table S8). We identified 473 predicted deleterious alleles that were fixed (247) or nearly fixed (allele frequency<U+2009>><U+2009>90%) in the three white layer lines (WA  WD  and W1) (see Additional file : Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis showed that the corresponding genes are involved in energy metabolism (e.g. ATP-binding  calmodium-binding) and muscle and motor activity (see Additional file : Table S2). Several of these variants were strongly selected in domesticated chicken. For example  variant (G558R) in the  gene was completely fixed in all three lines and this mutant allele is associated with the absence of strict regulation of seasonal reproduction found in natural populations []. A deleterious inframe deletion (108delE) was also found in the  gene  which is an ATP receptor. In addition  12 fixed deleterious variants were identified in seven myosin-related genes (            and ) that are involved in skeletal muscle development []. Other gene families that contained fixed deleterious variants were the protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (          and )  the centrosome proteins (      and )  which are potentially involved in essential developmental processes  based on evidence of early lethality in knockout model organisms (notably  and  [])  and collagen-like genes (e.g.     ). Forty variants in 37 genes were predicted to have a severe impact on the protein produced by these genes (PROVEAN score <U+2009>-<U+2009>5)  including a variant in the  gene (see Additional file : Table S3). To distinguish between true selection candidates and effects of genetic drift  we examined the populations for regions under selection. Genome-wide Z-scores of heterozygosity (zHp) were calculated per 20-kb windows. We considered bins with a zHp less than -<U+2009>2.7 as potential regions of selective sweeps in the genome (representing the extreme end of the distribution) (see Additional file : Figure S1) and found 27 fixed evolutionary intolerant variants in these regions (see Additional file : Figure S12 and Additional file : Table S4)  which overlap with the  (see Additional file : Figure S13) and  genes  previously described as being under domestication selection [  ]. We focussed on predicted evolutionary-intolerant variants in smaller regions of selective sweeps to identify possible functional variation that has been under selection. We identified a splice donor variant in the  gene (see Additional file : Figure S14)  which is involved in the energy metabolism of cells and insulin processing. In addition  we identified a strong selection signal in two bins that overlapped with a missense variant in the  gene (T389 M) (see Additional file : Figure S15). This gene is involved in protein transport  but  although various quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to egg production and egg quality overlap with this gene []  its exact function remains unknown. A splice acceptor variant in the  gene  a start lost variant in the  gene  and an inframe insertion in the  gene were identified as potential additional functional target mutations (see Additional file : Figures S16  S17 and S18).  and  are both involved in energy metabolism  and overlap respectively with an egg shell thickness QTL and a QTL for haugh unit (a measure of egg protein quality based on the height of its egg white) and growth []. The  gene is a transcription factor involved in the generation of precursor metabolites (substances from which energy is derived). All these variants are likely functional  and while they are identified as being damaging in a natural or wild context  they may have been favourably selected for because they positively affect desired traits in egg-laying hens. We found 26 high-frequency (allele frequency<U+2009>><U+2009>0.7) deleterious missense variants  one frameshift and three splice variants specific to the WA breeding line. Interestingly  the  gene contains three deleterious missense variants (see Additional file : Table S1). This gene encodes a mitotic spindle protein and is expressed in proliferating tissues and is associated with a range of phenotypes  including decreased body weight  microcephaly  and reduced fertility in both sexes. Two variants were predicted to have a severe impact on CIB1 (R112C) and PCSK6 (R87 W) proteins (PROVEAN score<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>5)  which are both involved in mammalian fertility. CIB1 is related to abnormal spermatogenesis  decreased testis weight and male infertility  while PCSK6 showed a role in female fertility (ovary cysts  increased ovary tumour incidence) []. We annotated 77 high-frequency deleterious variants specific to the WD breeding line (see Additional file : Table S2)  which included 59 deleterious missense variants  one inframe deletion ()  14 splice acceptor/donor variants  one start-loss variant ()  and two stop-gained variants ( and ). Interestingly  the  gene  which is associated with cataract phenotypes in mammals []  harbours two highly deleterious missense variants. Moreover  six missense variants are predicted to be highly deleterious by PROVEAN (          ). Three of these genes were demonstrated to have severe effects in null-mutant mice (    and ) []. We identified 35 high-frequency variants specific to the W1 breeding line (see Additional file : Table S3)  which included 31 deleterious missense variants  three splice-donor variants  and one stop-gained variant (). Three missense variants in three different genes (: Y290 N  : P251S   P39L) were predicted to be highly deleterious.  a trace amine associated receptor gene  and  are both associated with various behavioural traits  including increased hyperactivity () and abnormal motor coordination/balance (). Null-mutants for the  gene are embryonic lethal in mammals  resulting in abnormal growth prior to termination of development []. Interestingly  the  gene harbours three deleterious missense variants in the W1 line  which are associated with abnormal muscle cell physiology and increased body weight []. Combining a systematic genomic survey for missing homozygosity and whole-genome sequence (WGS) data opens new opportunities to directly infer functional variants. We have presented a first full genomic catalogue of variants that provides a perspective on the deleterious and functional variation in fairly closed  and relatively inbred  purebred layer lines. We not only confirmed previous “domestic” or selective variants but also assessed the impact of deleterious variation in these lines. Taken together  this genomic framework can be used to further improve and understand the genomic elements that are selected or purged in current breeding programs. Finally  a better understanding of the variants with functional implications will provide a useful resource for further selection programs to help distinguish true deleterious variants from those with positive functional implications. Domesticated populations are expected to be under artificial selection against inbreeding depression. Indeed  in this paper  we show that putatively highly deleterious (i.e. lethal) variants are rare in the commercial chicken populations studied here  in spite of the small effective size of these populations. However  we found several examples of putative lethal variants with allele frequencies up to 10% (e.g. OFD1 and Y19C) and showed that  although under strong selection  the purging of these variants is not always very effective  even in modern poultry breeding programs. Artificial selection in these populations may be ‘strong’  but is based on an index of a large number of phenotypic traits. Balancing selection may also be acting on these populations (e.g. heterozygote advantage)  which causes deleterious variants to remain in the population. In order to capture deleterious variants using haplotypes of SNPs that exhibit missing homozygosity  the low-frequency haplotype has to be in complete LD with the causal variant. However  most deleterious variants (EL) reside on common haplotypes that cannot be detected with medium-density SNP chip data. However  absence of specific homozygous allele states can now be inferred directly because animals can be routinely genotyped for these variants  such that they can be added to the currently used genomic selection framework. A similar study in cattle showed that 15% of the LoF and 6% of the tested missense variants are likely true EL []. Although predicting EL variation from sequence can be sensitive to induce false positives  we tried to reduce the number of false positives by manually examining the predicted EL variants. Moreover  the distinct allele frequency spectrum for our predicted deleterious mutations compared to neutral mutations confirms that they are subject to purifying selection. One limitation of our study is that we focused on coding variation  however  a large proportion of the non-coding genome is also subject to purifying selection because of their biological function []. As a result  we may have missed a large proportion of potential deleterious or functional variants. In addition  livestock genomes still lack proper annotation of many functional elements but currently there are many efforts to improve this aspect []. We found no evidence of a higher load of deleterious variants in our studied chicken lines compared to other livestock species [  ]. However  although the impact of individual variants on the population may be limited  a recent study showed that negative selection involves synergistic epistasis  which means that the combined effect of mutations is greater than the sum of the individual effects. This supports the hypothesis that the overall effect of the deleterious mutations on population fitness might be substantial []. As a consequence  the number of deleterious variants found in the chicken populations studied here might represent a universal level for ‘healthy populations’  i.e. lower levels deleterious mutations are not attained because selection against low-frequency alleles is ineffective  but higher levels of deleterious mutations could occur  which then rapidly leads to disproportionately large inbreeding depression effects. This study also demonstrates the value of domesticated populations to provide insight in the genomic architecture of inbreeding depression and can be useful for future studies on inbreeding in both wild and domesticated populations. The observed spectrum of allele frequencies for predicted deleterious and tolerated variants corroborates the hypothesis that the predicted deleterious variants (especially deleterious missense and stop-gained variants) have been under purifying selection. Conversely  the predicted tolerated missense variants followed the same distribution of allele frequencies as synonymous variants (usually considered to be neutral)  which indicates that the large majority of these predicted missense variants are indeed evolutionary tolerated. Within coding regions  we also found an enrichment of indels that are multiples of three nucleotides  which was not the case for non-coding indels. Indels that alter the frame of translation in coding regions can be highly disruptive  for instance by introducing a premature stop codon and  therefore  such indels are often under purifying selection. Conversely  indels that are multiples of three nucleotides will result in losses or gains of one or multiple amino acid residues  which have a higher likelihood of being tolerated. We also observed an enrichment of frameshift and stop-gained variants at the N- and C terminal ends of the protein  which suggests that  in general  these types of variants have a stronger impact on the function of the protein when they are located in the middle part of the protein compared to the distal parts of the protein. Namely  if they are located at the N-terminal part of the protein  a functional protein product might still be generated by an alternate start codon that can “rescue” a large part of the protein (N-terminal part)  as described previously []. In contrast  a frameshift or stop-gained variant at the C-terminal end may be tolerated since an almost complete protein is often generated. Together these genomic signatures of purifying selection support our predictions on deleterious alleles within the populations. Evidence that the frequency of recombination in a genomic region is negatively correlated with the ratio of deleterious to tolerated mutations suggests more effective purging in regions with higher recombination rate  potentially because deleterious variants that hitchhike along with selected variants are more easily physically disconnected from variants that are under selection in regions with high recombination rates. Similar results have been reported in other species  although always with weaker correlations [    ]. We shed light on the role of recombination (i.e. more effective selection in regions of high recombination) in genomic purging within the avian clade  which is known for its highly diverse recombination rates between chromosomes  with notably extremely high recombination rates on microchromosomes []. In addition to predicted deleterious variants with low frequencies  several high-frequency predicted deleterious variants were identified that likely have high functional relevance. We focussed on predicted evolutionary-intolerant  but high-frequency  variants in selective sweep regions. This study confirmed several predicted deleterious variants that were previously identified as being positively selected in domesticated chicken populations  e.g. variants in the  and  genes [  ]. However  we find several novel predicted deleterious variants in strong selective sweep regions (e.g. variants in the    and  genes)  that should be further investigated for phenotypic effects. In spite of a paucity of functional annotation  there is evidence that the majority of these genes have a role in cellular energy metabolism and likely cause increased metabolic activity [  ]. The use of genomic selection has increased the rate of genetic improvement in breeding populations substantially over the past years []. However  genomic selection remains a “black-box” approach and the genomic architecture that underlies selection remains unknown. Without additional prior information on the functional effects of low-frequency variants  effective selection for or against desired or unwanted variation remains challenging. Leveraging low-frequency functional variants for selection requires functional annotation  which can then be translated into statistical priors in enhanced genomic selection programs [  ]. This study contributes to this by the identification of specific variants that can be incorporated in breeding programs to enhance genetic improvement. In this study  we applied several methods to infer deleterious variation in three commercial white-layer lines. We confirmed that missing homozygosity can result from lethal variants that reside on low-frequency SNP haplotypes. We were able to capture even very low-frequency deleterious variation  including 152 likely EL variants  by exploiting WGS data of dozens of sequenced individuals within single populations. Results provided clear evidence for purifying selection  based on a distinct spectrum of allele frequencies of deleterious variants compared to that of variants that have a higher likelihood of being neutral. In spite of their low-frequency nature  the identified putative deleterious alleles generally occurred more often in regions with low recombination  which suggests that purging of these alleles is less effective in such regions. Also  frameshift and stop-gained variants were more frequent at the protein N- and C-termini  which confirms that these are likely evolutionary-tolerated  which also applies to in-frame indels. In addition  multiple predicted evolutionary intolerant coding variants were discovered in selective sweep regions  which are likely under positive selection. A comprehensive genomic catalogue of putative deleterious variants was developed for white-egg layer breeding lines  which can enhance current genomic breeding practices to lower the frequency of undesirable variants in the population.

In particular  to improve convergence behavior of iterative approaches and to reduce inflation  two weights  and  have been introduced in the definition of   which blend the inverse of a part of  with the inverse of . Since the definition of this blending is based on the equation describing   its impact on the structure of  is not obvious. In a joint discussion  we considered the question of the shape of  for non-trivial  and . Here  we present the general matrix  as a function of these parameters and discuss its structure and properties. Moreover  we screen for optimal values of  and  with respect to predictive ability  inflation and iterations up to convergence on a well investigated  publicly available wheat data set. Our results may help the reader to develop a better understanding for the effects of changes of  and  on the covariance model. In particular  we give theoretical arguments that as a general tendency  inflation will be reduced by increasing  or by decreasing . A genomic relationship matrix  provides information on the realized relatedness of individuals but requires genotyping  which increases the costs of breeding programs. Thus  breeders are often confronted with the situation that not all individuals for which expected relatedness can be derived from the pedigree are genotyped. The single-step approach [  ] is a practical way to combine these two different sources of information—the pedigree relationship matrix  and the genomic relationship matrix —in one matrix . This relationship matrix  relates all individuals as does   but incorporates the more accurate information provided by . Here  the central concept is to substitute entries of  by the corresponding entries of  and to adapt the remaining relationships accordingly. In more detail  the matrix  is defined by Here  the individuals are divided into two groups: Group 1 contains the individuals whose genotype is not available and Group 2 consists of the genotyped individuals. Thus   denotes the entries of  that provide the relationships within Group 1   and  the relationships between the individuals of the two groups  and  the pedigree relationships within Group 2. Moreover   denotes the inverse of   which is not in general identical to the bottom-left block of   i.e. . With this definition  we have substituted the inner group pedigree relationship of Group 2 by the genomic relationship  which means . The terms  adapt the relationships within Group 1 and the relationships between individuals of the two groups according to the changed relationships within Group 2 to generate a positive semi-definite  valid covariance structure (this transfer of information can be also interpreted in terms of imputation [  ]). Since many applications use the inverse of a relationship matrix  Eq. () is usually written on the level of its inverse (see [] and equations 18  19 of []): Based on this setup  several previous papers have discussed the question of how to combine  and  optimally. In this context  approaches which have been followed adapt  to  [  ] or conversely  to  [  ]. Moreover  two scaling factors  and  have been introduced [  ]: The main purposes of the introduction of these parameters were to ensure convergence of iterative approaches that address the mixed models []  and to reduce inflation of predictions []. Compared to methods based on  or  alone  these issues have been assumed to be enhanced by inconsistencies between  and  []  and this blending is one possibility among several to approach the problem []. Equation () is defined on the level of   but the effect of the introduction of  and  on the shape of  is not obvious. In particular  breeders aiming at implementing the single-step method in breeding programs raised the question of how these parameters affect the relationship model . Here  we present  in a general form  as a matrix dependent on  and  and discuss some of its properties. Moreover  we provide arguments for a reduction in inflation of predicted breeding values being expected when  increases or when  decreases. Finally  to set a contrast to the widely used cattle data [      ]  we screened for optimal values of  and  with respect to predictive ability  inflation and iterations to convergence on a well investigated  publicly available wheat data set []. Our results may help to develop an understanding for the effects on the covariance model when these parameters are changed. In particular  this may be of interest for people who aim at implementing the single-step method with non-trivial parameters  and  in practical breeding programs. We will first describe  and discuss some special cases. Mathematical arguments for the presented statements are provided in the “Appendix”. If an inverse of a matrix is used  the implicit assumption on invertibility is made (also if not mentioned explicitly). In particular   is considered invertible on account of its construction from the pedigree (granted clones are absent) []. The inverse of  defined by Eq. () is with The structure of Eq. () is identical to that of Eq. ()  but with  substituted by Eq. (). Considering   we see that the parameterization of the weights  and  is “reverse” in the sense that  and  appear with opposite signs in front of them. In particular  this implies that  is not necessarily positive semi-definite when  since this leads to a negative factor for  and thus has to be compensated by  to give a positive semi-definite matrix. However  positive semi-definiteness of  is guaranteed  if  and  are positive definite and  and   but not both at their boundary  that is not  and  at the same time.           .   . Note that due to the “reverse parameterization” in form of weights  and  in Eq. ()  the sets of parameter values  which guarantee positive semi-definiteness of the single-step matrix   are distinct. If both  and  are positive  then positive semi-definiteness of  is guaranteed. In particular  this also means that a negative  gives a valid covariance model. Thus  a grid to test combinations would be rather within  than   which has often been the frame for the choice of parameters [    ]. In the following  we will discuss special choices of  and . If   we are dealing with the original single-step method of Eq. (). If   then  and thus . If   then  If   then . If   then  Case (i) is already obvious on the level of   but it can also be seen on the level of  that Eq. () coincides in this case with Eq. ()  since . If instead  as for case (ii) then  and the single-step BLUP becomes the traditional pedigree-BLUP. Also note that case (iii)  for which  and  are equal  has already been addressed in [] and results in a weighted harmonic mean of  and . In case (iv) in which  is equal to 1  . With increasing   the entries of      will shrink towards  and  to the  . In case (v)  we see that if we fix    is not significantly simplified. Moreover  since the weighted sum of  and  is inverted in   the factor  may also introduce a weight on the entries of . We see that this is indeed the case with the following example. Choosing   In this example  the non-diagonal elements of  are 0  but the non-diagonal elements of  deviate from the corresponding entries of  which are equal to 1. Thus   cannot be interpreted as being only a weight of the pedigree contribution  to the covariance . A main purpose of the introduction of these parameters is the reduction of inflation of the predicted breeding values [  ] which is manifested and diagnosed by a slope  in a regression of observed values (y-axis) on predictions (x-axis). Please recall here that the regression of observed values on predictions should be preferred to a regression of predictions on observed values for model evaluation []. We will argue why—as a general tendency—increasing  or decreasing  may lead to a reduced inflation. In many models used for animal and plant breeding  the genetic component  is modeled as a random variable with multivariate normal distribution  zero mean and structured variance  for instance given by  in single-step. The simplest version without a fixed effect can be written as: where  denotes the  vector of phenotypes   the genetic effect and  the independent and identically distributed errors. The best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP [  ]) for this  is given by We will apply some results on positive semi-definite matrices to this model and its BLUP to show when a change in the values of  and  (to  and ) reduces the variance of the estimate of the genetic component. In the following  we use the partial order on the positive semi-definite matrices (the so-called Löwner order [])  to speak about variance “increase” and “reduction” in a multivariate context. For two positive semi-definite matrices  and    if and only if  is positive semi-definite. With this notation   means that  is positive semi-definite. For a reference on the properties of the Löwner order see [].       .       .      . ()       Lemma (a) illustrates that if we keep  constant and decrease  to   the resulting matrix  will be “smaller” with respect to the Löwner order. The same is true if we keep  constant and increase  to . Part (b) transfers this observation to the level of . Finally  part (c) connects  with the BLUP of model (). We now illustrate how this reduction with respect to the Löwner order  transfers to the variance of breeding value estimates  in this simple model of .                Then Proposition  illustrates that an important effect of using an  smaller than 1  or a  larger than 1 may be the reduction of the variance of the predicted genetic values. To see this  recall that Lemma (a) and (b) stated that reducing  to  and keeping  fixed implies . The same is true for increasing  to  with fixed . Lemma (c) then implies that . Thus  provided that all preconditions are given  Proposition  states that the variance of the estimated breeding values is reduced. The critical assumption is   since this is not implied by  (for a counter example see []). Thus  this will not be totally satisfied in practice. Instead  because we are dealing with a partial order  often neither  nor  will hold  but the difference of the two products may result in an indefinite matrix (i.e. one with both positive and negative eigenvalues). However  if only a few eigenvalues of the difference  are smaller than zero  this assumption will be correct to a good approximation. Moreover  also the assumption of  will only approximately hold in practice. Finally  recall that the variance components are usually estimated and an adapted estimate can compensate the effects of changes of the parameters  and . We will give an example of how a reduced empirical variance may reduce inflation. Let  be a vector of measured data and  with . Moreover  let  which means . Then  and  and . Defining the inflation as  of an ordinary least squares regression of  on  gives . Note here that a value of  means that the estimates of the breeding values are deflated and  that they are inflated. Thus  means that the inflation is reduced when  is used instead of . Example  illustrates that the reduced variance of the predicted genetic values may reduce inflation. It is worth highlighting that the scaling factor used in this example was formulated on the level of  which does not simply translate to a scaled variance component for . In the next section  we give a small example with a well investigated wheat data set []. We assessed predictive ability  inflation and number of iterations up to convergence with varying parameters  and  on a publicly available wheat data set [  ]. The aim was to seek for the optimal combinations of both parameters  which maximize the predictive ability or minimize the inflation or the number of iterations to convergence  respectively. Moreover  we were interested in the general behavior of inflation when  and  are varied. The data set which we used consists of 599 CIMMYT wheat lines  genotyped with 1279 Diversity Array Technology markers indicating whether a certain allele is present (1) or not (0) in the respective line. The lines were grown in four different environments and grain yield was recorded for each line and each environment (for more details see []). We used only the phenotypic data of environment 1 for our comparisons. To see whether the choice of which lines are considered as (not) genotyped has a significant impact on properties of the single-step procedure  we split the lines into two parts according to the order in the data set and considered two scenarios: In scenario 1 (hereinafter referred to as SC1)  lines 1 to 300 were treated as not genotyped and the remaining lines 301 to 599 were used as genotyped group. Thus  the pedigree relationship of lines 301 to 599 represents  and their genomic relationship represents . The genomic relationship matrix was calculated according to VanRaden []:   with  denoting the  matrix giving the states of the  markers of the  individuals  and  denoting the matrix with identical rows giving the column averages of . The same procedure was repeated in scenario 2 (hereinafter referred to as SC2) but the genotyped group consisted of lines 1 to 300. Note again that the order was used as provided by the data set. To seek for the optimal values for both parameters  420 combinations of  and  were tested for each scenario. This number of combinations resulted from varying both parameters on a grid defined by 0.10 steps dividing the interval  for   or [0.1  2] for . To evaluate the performance of each parameter combination  we constructed  by Eq. () for each combination of the parameters. Consequently  420 different  matrices were calculated in  [] and transferred to the  software [] to estimate the breeding values using the single-step procedure. To evaluate the predictions obtained with the different matrices  a cross-validation was run by partitioning the 599 wheat lines into 10 disjoint groups of approximately 60 lines each (regardless of whether their genomic information had been used in the single-step covariance matrix). The partitions used were those provided with the data set  which had been generated randomly []. Iteratively  each group was used as a test set and models were fit with the remaining lines. Prediction quality was evaluated for these 60 lines in terms of predictive ability and inflation. The former was measured as Pearson’s correlation between the phenotype and the estimated breeding value (EBV) for the test set. Inflation was calculated as the coefficient of regression of the phenotype on the EBV (for the test set). The optimal combination of parameter values should have a regression coefficient close to 1 (neither inflation nor deflation). The number of iterations to convergence was also recorded. Figure  illustrates the average predictive ability obtained for different choices of  for the two different scenarios SC1 and SC2. The pedigree BLUP predictive ability is given by . The closest here is  with a predictive ability of 0.46 for the first scenario and 0.43 for the second one and which is in accordance with the value of 0.448 originally reported []. The maximum predictive ability for SC1 was obtained with  whereas in SC2 it was reached with . The location of the maximum differs  but in both scenarios we observe a broad optimum  that is a plateau on which the predictive ability hardly changes. An important observation is that the maximal predictive ability is very different between the two scenarios (0.53 vs. 0.45). Heat plots for predictive ability calculated as the Pearson’s correlation between phenotype and EBV for each combination of parameters  and  for  SC1 and  SC2. The lighter the colour  the higher the predictive ability of the corresponding  combination Figure  shows the mean inflation for each considered  combination for the two scenarios. The combinations with the lowest inflation  that is the highest regression coefficient  were  in both scenarios  as suggested by our theoretical results. We see the tendency that both  increasing  or decreasing  reduces inflation in the sense of increasing . However  note that in our example  we are already in a situation of deflation and reducing the variance of  increases the predictive bias. Heat plots for inflation calculated as the slope in the regression of observed phenotypes on predictions for  SC1 and  SC2. The lighter the colour  the higher the slope and lower the inflation Lastly  the optimal values of the parameters in terms of a minimal number of iterations to convergence were  for SC1 and  for SC2. However  for most combinations  the number of iterations was between 26 and 32 which indicates that the influence of  on the number of iterations required is limited for this data set (results not shown). Here we presented the general form of the single-step relationship matrix   when blending parameters  and  are defined on the level of its inverse [  ]. The matrix obtained (Eq. ) is similar to the original single-step relationship matrix (Eq. ) but with the role of  replaced by expression Eq. (). Moreover  we discussed some special choices of these parameters including the case for which  and  are equal  which was also the first adjustment of  discussed in the literature []. The reduction in inflation was one of the main motivations for using the blending parameters [  ]. We illustrated with theoretical considerations that increasing  or decreasing  tends to reduce the empirical variance of   which again may lead to a reduced inflation. Our theoretical arguments are limited by their assumptions  but should hold to a good approximation. To reinforce these results with an empirical exploration  we gave a small example with a well investigated wheat data set []. There  the pattern observed for inflation was largely in accordance with what we expected from our theoretical considerations. With regard to predictive ability  the parameters showed broad optimality and varied strongly across the two scenarios SC1 and SC2. Both observations may be data set specific and the latter a consequence of the small population size. Finally  note that similar effects on inflation can also be achieved with other methods as for instance by explicitly reducing the additive variance or by accounting for inbreeding [] (see in this context also Example ). It may be worth considering the single-step method in more detail from a theoretical perspective to address the causes of inflation. Recent studies reported results in this direction by for instance attributing inflation to inconsistencies between genomic and pedigree relationships and by suggesting that accounting for inbreeding and unknown parent groups in a proper way may reduce this problem []. Moreover  it has also been highlighted that selective genotyping and selective imputation may have an impact on the properties of ssBLUP []. We provided theoretical arguments that increasing  or decreasing  may mainly decrease inflation by decreasing the variance of the estimated breeding values . Alternative solutions that address the problems of single-step predictions from a more theoretical point of view may be found by investigating the consistency problems of  and  with respect to scaling and coding further.

These changes are expected to have influenced genetic diversity trends. Our aim was to evaluate genome-wide and region-specific diversity in HF artificial insemination (AI) bulls in the Dutch-Flemish breeding program from 1986 to 2015.MethodsPedigree and genotype data (~<U+2009>75.5 k) of 6280 AI-bulls were used to estimate rates of genome-wide inbreeding and kinship and corresponding effective population sizes. Region-specific inbreeding trends were evaluated using regions of homozygosity (ROH). Changes in observed allele frequencies were compared to those expected under pure drift to identify putative regions under selection. We also investigated the direction of changes in allele frequency over time.ResultsEffective population size estimates for the 1986–2015 period ranged from 69 to 102. Two major breakpoints were observed in genome-wide inbreeding and kinship trends. Around 2000  inbreeding and kinship levels temporarily dropped. From 2010 onwards  they steeply increased  with pedigree-based  ROH-based and marker-based inbreeding rates as high as 1.8  2.1 and 2.8% per generation  respectively. Accumulation of inbreeding varied substantially across the genome. A considerable fraction of markers showed changes in allele frequency that were greater than expected under pure drift. Putative selected regions harboured many quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated to a wide range of traits. In consecutive 5-year periods  allele frequencies changed more often in the same direction than in opposite directions  except when comparing the 1996–2000 and 2001–2005 periods.ConclusionsGenome-wide and region-specific diversity trends reflect major changes in the Dutch-Flemish HF breeding program. Introduction of OCS and the shift in breeding goal were followed by a drop in inbreeding and kinship and a shift in the direction of changes in allele frequency. After introduction of GS  rates of inbreeding and kinship increased substantially while allele frequencies continued to change in the same direction as before GS. These results provide insight in the effect of breeding practices on genomic diversity and emphasize the need for efficient management of genetic diversity in GS schemes."

These changes are expected to have influenced genetic diversity trends. Our aim was to evaluate genome-wide and region-specific diversity in HF artificial insemination (AI) bulls in the Dutch-Flemish breeding program from 1986 to 2015. Pedigree and genotype data (~<U+2009>75.5 k) of 6280 AI-bulls were used to estimate rates of genome-wide inbreeding and kinship and corresponding effective population sizes. Region-specific inbreeding trends were evaluated using regions of homozygosity (ROH). Changes in observed allele frequencies were compared to those expected under pure drift to identify putative regions under selection. We also investigated the direction of changes in allele frequency over time. Effective population size estimates for the 1986–2015 period ranged from 69 to 102.

Genome-wide and region-specific diversity trends reflect major changes in the Dutch-Flemish HF breeding program. Introduction of OCS and the shift in breeding goal were followed by a drop in inbreeding and kinship and a shift in the direction of changes in allele frequency. After introduction of GS  rates of inbreeding and kinship increased substantially while allele frequencies continued to change in the same direction as before GS. These results provide insight in the effect of breeding practices on genomic diversity and emphasize the need for efficient management of genetic diversity in GS schemes. Genetic variation in (closed) livestock populations is largely driven by the fundamental processes of selection and genetic drift. While selection acts directionally on alleles that have a selective (dis)advantage and on alleles that are ‘hitchhiking’ [  ]  genetic drift acts across the whole genome  causing random changes in allele frequency from generation to generation as a result of sampling gametes in a finite population []. In Holstein–Friesian dairy cattle (HF)  intense artificial selection has been practised over many years. The use of a limited number of elite sires has reduced the effective population to a size ranging from 49 to 115 [  ]. This implies that  in spite of its census size of millions of individuals  the breed is subjected to the same rate of genetic drift and accumulation of inbreeding as an idealized population of 49 to 115 individuals []. To ensure adaptive capacity and limit inbreeding depression in the long term  it is important to monitor and manage genetic diversity in the HF population [  ]. Traditionally  genetic diversity has been characterised and managed with pedigree-based coefficients of inbreeding and kinship  which refer to the proportion of the genome that is expected to be identical by descent (IBD) within and between individuals  respectively. However  this genealogical approach has several limitations: (1) it strongly depends on pedigree completeness and quality (e.g. []); (2) it does not account for Mendelian sampling variation (e.g. []); and (3) it only provides a genome-wide expectation for loci that are selection-free  i.e. loci that are in complete linkage equilibrium with all loci under selection (e.g. []). With the wide availability of dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data  it has become possible to obtain more accurate estimates of genome-wide inbreeding and kinship and to evaluate diversity for specific regions of the genome [  ]. Two approaches have been widely used to characterise and manage diversity from SNP data: the marker-by-marker approach [] and the segment-based approach [  ]. The former approach involves the calculation of the observed and expected fraction of SNPs for which alleles are identical by state (IBS). Thus  it captures relationships that are caused by common ancestors going back to a very distant theoretical base population in which all alleles were unique. The second approach considers IBS segments  rather than individual SNPs. Since the length of these segments follows an inverse exponential distribution with expectation 1/2 Morgan []  where  is the number of ancestral generations to the common ancestor from which the segment was derived  this approach may be used to distinguish recent from distant relatedness and move from IBS to ‘realised IBD’ []. Both IBS and IBD are relevant for management purposes. While IBS is the most direct diversity measure  (realised) IBD is more closely associated to inbreeding depression [    ]. In recent decades  HF selection schemes have undergone profound changes with respect to inbreeding management  breeding goal composition and breeding value estimation. Around the year 2000  optimal contribution selection (OCS) was introduced to maximise genetic gain at a restricted rate of inbreeding []. Around the same time  national selection indices moved from production- and conformation-based only to more comprehensive indices that included traits related to production  conformation  longevity  health and reproduction []. More recently  genomic selection (GS) was introduced  which enabled the prediction of high-accuracy breeding values at a young age []. Since all these changes cause rearrangements in the ranking of artificial insemination (AI) bulls  they are expected to have influenced trends in genome-wide and region-specific genetic diversity. With the current availability of SNP-data  it is now possible to investigate this influence. The aim of this study was to evaluate genome-wide and region-specific genetic diversity in HF AI bulls from 1986 to 2015  using genealogical  marker-by-marker and segment-based approaches. An important objective was to evaluate whether major changes in the Dutch-Flemish HF breeding program were accompanied by changes in inbreeding and kinship trends. A second objective was to investigate whether observed changes in allele frequency could be attributed to selection  and whether regions under selection could be linked to known quantitative trait loci (QTL). A last objective was to investigate how the direction of changes in allele frequency has evolved over time. A total of 6280 AI bulls with breed fraction<U+2009><U+2009>higher than 87.5% HF  born between 1986 and 2015 and genotyped by the Dutch-Flemish cattle improvement co-operative (CRV)  were included in this study. Thus  the vast majority of AI bulls in the Dutch-Flemish breeding program were included. Figure  shows the number of bulls by year of birth. Number of genotyped bulls by year of birth Pedigrees were extracted from the database of CRV and extended with publicly available data []. The total pedigree comprised 46 232 animals. Complete generation equivalents (CGE) were computed as the sum of (1/2) over all known ancestors  with  being the generation number of a given ancestor. The average CGE increased from 9.6 in 1986 to 17.0 in 2015 and was equal to 13.3 when calculated across all years. The average number of completely known generations increased from 4.1 in 1986 to 8.1 in 2015. The generation interval ()  i.e. the average age of parents at the birth of the bulls  was computed per year of birth for bull sires and bull dams separately  and for all parents combined (Fig. ). The  decreased during the first decade and then increased slightly until it dropped steeply from 2009 onwards. The initial drop in  can be explained by an increased use of young unproven bull sires  which  at the time  was expected to improve genetic gain. However  due to variable gains  the trend changed and  from 1998 onwards  almost exclusively proven bull sires were used. The drop in  from 2009 onwards was especially pronounced for bull sires and followed the implementation of GS. The average  across the whole 30-year period and for all parents combined was 5.0 years. Generation interval for bull sires  bull dams and bull parents by year of birth Genotype data were provided by CRV and the final dataset comprised 75 538 autosomal SNPs. Bulls were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (versions v1 and v2) or CRV custom-made 60 k Illumina panel (versions v1 and v2). Genotypes were imputed to<U+2009>~<U+2009>76 k from the different panels  following Druet et al. []  and haplotypes were constructed with a combination of Beagle [] and PHASEBOOK []  by exploiting both familial and population information. Prior to imputation  SNPs with a call rate lower than 0.85  a MAF lower than 0.025 or a difference larger than 0.15 between observed and expected heterozygosity were discarded. SNP positions were obtained from the Btau4.0 genome assembly and SNPs with unknown positions (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>893) were discarded. The mean physical distance between two consecutive SNPs was 33.7 kb  with density varying substantially across the genome (see Additional file : Fig. S1). Black and white (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>5021) and red and white (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1259) bulls were combined in all analyses  because a preliminary check on the mean SNP-based kinship within and between bulls of both groups indicated no major genetic differentiation across the 30-year period. Genome-wide diversity was quantified with genealogical  marker-by-marker and segment-based approaches. Pearson correlation coefficients between genealogical  marker-by-marker and segment-based measures were calculated to compare the different approaches. Genealogical coefficients of inbreeding () and kinship () were defined as the pedigree-based probabilities that two alleles at a (imaginary) selection-free locus  sampled respectively within individual  or between individuals  and   were IBD with reference to a base population []. Founders in the pedigree were considered as the base population. Both  and  were calculated with  []  according to the algorithms of Sargolzaei et al. [] and Colleau []. Marker-by-marker homozygosity () and similarity () were defined as the probabilities that two alleles at a random SNP  which were sampled respectively within individual  or between individuals  and   were IBS. The  was obtained as the proportion of SNPs for individual  that were homozygous. The  was determined according to Malécot []: where  is the total number of markers   is an indicator variable that was set to 1 when allele  of individual  and allele  of individual  at marker  were IBS  and to 0 otherwise. Note that the  is equivalent to VanRaden’s genomic relationship  [] when allele frequencies of 0.5 are used in the computation of  (except for the scale; see Additional file  of Eynard et al. [] for derivation). Since self-similarities  were included  the average similarity in a given cohort was also equivalent to the expected homozygosity in that cohort (i.e. the average sum of squared allele frequencies    across all SNPs). Segment-based inbreeding () was defined as the proportion of the genome of individual  that was covered by long uninterrupted homozygous segments. Such regions of homozygosity (ROH) were detected by moving SNP by SNP across chromosomes and testing potential ROH against predefined criteria. The following criteria were used to define a ROH: (1) a minimum physical length of 3.75 Mb  (2) a minimum of 38 consecutive homozygous SNPs (no heterozygous calls allowed)  and (3) a maximum gap of 500 kb between two consecutive SNPs. The minimum length of 3.75 Mb was chosen to match the pedigree depth. Given the genetic distance of approximately 1 cM per Mb [] and the average length of 1/2 M for ROH derived from a common ancestor  generations ago []  the  was expected to capture inbreeding over 13.3 ancestral generations (corresponding to the CGE of the pedigree). The latter two criteria were used to prevent calling of (potentially false positive) ROH in regions with low SNP density. The  was calculated as the fraction of the autosome in ROH []: where  is the total number of ROH in individual    is the length of the th ROH and  is the length of the autosome covered by SNPs (i.e. the autosome length minus the summed length of gaps longer than 500 kb). Segment-based kinship () was defined as the expected  for an offspring of individuals  and . Shared segments were identified by moving SNP by SNP across every possible pair of chromosomes  with one homolog of individual  and one of   and testing potential segments against predefined criteria. The same criteria were used as for calling ROH. The  was computed following de Cara et al. []: where  is the total number of shared segments between individuals  and    is the length of the th shared segment measured over homolog  of individual  and homolog  of individual  and  is the length of the autosome covered by SNPs. For each genome-wide parameter  the annual rate of change () for the 1986–2015 period was obtained as the opposite of the slope of the regression of  on year of birth  where  equalled the average of the parameter in a given year []. The annual rate was multiplied by  to obtain the rate per generation () and  subsequently  the effective population size (). To investigate trends over time   and  were also calculated for 5-year periods  taking changes in  into account. Accumulation of inbreeding across the genome over time was evaluated with ROH-based positional inbreeding coefficients. For every marker  in bull   a positional inbreeding coefficient () was set to 1 when  was encompassed by a ROH  and to 0 otherwise  following Kim et al. []. The  per 5-year period was then calculated as the fraction of bulls born in that period for which  was encompassed by a ROH. Changes in allele frequency were computed as   where  and  were the frequency in the last (2011–2015) and first (1986–1990) 5-year periods  respectively. Since the average  was 5.0 years  the -values were based on approximately five generations of drift and selection. To identify putative selected regions  the observed -values were compared to those expected under pure genetic drift. The -distribution under pure drift was obtained by gene dropping []. In each simulated gene drop  alleles for a single SNP were randomly assigned to founders and subsequently dropped through the pedigree following Mendelian principles (i.e. random sampling). To ensure a wide spectrum of -values  founder minor allele frequencies (MAF) ranging from 0.5 to 50% were simulated. Realised -values were classified into 100 MAF-classes  ranging from 0.0–0.5% to 49.5–50.0%  and the drift distribution per MAF-class was obtained based on 3000 replicates. Observed absolute -values above the 99.9% threshold (<<U+2009>0.001) of the empirical gene drop distribution were considered indicative of selection. To visualise systematic changes over the erratic pattern of individual SNPs  the moving average of 31 adjacent absolute -values was plotted against the physical position of the central SNP. Genomic regions with an excess of putative selected SNPs were considered as putative selected regions. For the key regions of interest  we investigated which QTL were known in these regions  using AnimalQTLdb []. The complete CattleQTLdb  which contains 99 675 QTL  was first filtered; QTL mapped to chromosome X (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>25 589)  reported for non-HF breeds (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>23 468) and/or with unknown start and end positions (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1737) were discarded. In addition  QTL associated to traits that were not clearly related to the Dutch-Flemish breeding bull-selection index  such as specific milk fatty acids or carcass traits  were removed (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>21 195). This resulted in a final list of 27 662 QTL  associated to 61 traits classified in five trait categories: production (INET)  conformation (CONF)  longevity (LONG)  reproduction (REPR) and udder health (UH). The final list of traits and number of QTL per trait and trait category is included in Table S1 (Additional file : Table S1). Changes in allele frequency were also computed within each 5-year period as   with  and  being the frequencies in the last and first year of the period  respectively (e.g. ). Correlation coefficients between the -values of the different 5-year periods were calculated to investigate the direction of changes in allele frequency over time. Descriptive statistics for all six genome-wide parameters are shown in Table . The average genealogical inbreeding and kinship were 5.2 and 6.5%  respectively. Segment-based coefficients were on average<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.5% higher than genealogical coefficients. As expected  IBS coefficients showed a higher mean (64.4% for  and 64.8% for )  lower SD and lower CV than IBD coefficients. For all kinship parameters  the mean was considerably higher than the median  which was indicative of the right-skewedness of the underlying distributions that was due to the inclusion of self-kinships. Pearson correlation coefficients between different genome-wide estimates of inbreeding and kinship per year of birth are shown in Fig. . Correlations between kinship parameters were considerably higher than those between inbreeding coefficients. Over all years  the highest correlations were found between the genomic parameters (on average 0.90 for  with  and 0.98 for  with ) and the lowest between the marker-by-marker and genealogical estimates (on average 0.60 for  with  and 0.92 for  with ). Correlations between genomic parameters remained relatively constant over years  whereas correlations between pedigree and genomic parameters decreased over time. For example  the correlation between  and  decreased from 0.97 in 1986 to 0.88 in 2015. This divergence could be explained by the accumulation of Mendelian sampling variation over time  which is captured by genomic information  but not by pedigree data. When more generations are included in the calculation of   more sampling events are unaccounted for and  is likely to deviate more from the realised genomic relationship. Correlations between pedigree and genomic inbreeding parameters seemed to increase slightly from 2009 onwards. However  this increase could also be due to random fluctuations  as the standard errors for inbreeding correlations were rather large (Fig. ). Correlations between different genome-wide estimates of inbreeding (left) and kinship (right) by year of birth. Note the different scales for the y-axes for inbreeding and kinship. Self-kinships were excluded from the computation to remove the influence of the number of bulls per year on the correlations.

Coefficients of IBD (      ) and IBS (  ) are shown on the primary and secondary y-axis  respectively.  and : genealogical inbreeding and kinship;  and : segment-based inbreeding and kinship; and : marker-by-marker homozygosity and similarity Genome-wide rates of change per year and per generation for the 1986–2015 period are shown in Table . Estimates of  computed from    and  were equal to 79  75 and 69  respectively. Rates of kinship were lower than rates of inbreeding  with a  estimated from    and  of 102  100 and 91  respectively. The difference between inbreeding and kinship rates was largely due to the relatively high kinship levels in early years (Fig. ). In fact  the average kinship at the beginning of the period was more than two generations ahead of the average inbreeding  while a difference of a single generation is expected for a randomly mating population. Rates of inbreeding and kinship were also computed for periods of 5 years  accounting for the change in  over time. Both rates per year and per generation decreased over the first four periods  were slightly negative between 2001 and 2005 and increased in the last two periods (Fig. ). In the 2011–2015 period  rates of    and  were as high as 1.8  2.1 and 2.8% per generation  respectively. Rates of change were very similar across the three approaches  except in the first  third and last periods. In the 1986–1990 period  the  and  were close to zero as a result of large fluctuations in IBS levels (Fig. ). In this period   was also relatively high (i.e. 1% higher per generation than ). In the 1996–2000 period  genealogical rates of inbreeding were slightly higher (0.1–0.2% higher per generation) than segment-based rates  which  in turn  were slightly higher (0.2–0.3%) than marker-based rates. In the last period  which showed almost no fluctuations  marker-based rates were considerably higher (0.7% per generation) than segment-based rates  which were in turn slightly higher (0.3% for  and 0.1% for ) than genealogical rates of inbreeding. Rate of change per year (top) and generation (bottom) for genome-wide parameters within 5-year periods.  and : genealogical inbreeding and kinship;  and : segment-based inbreeding and kinship; and : marker-by-marker homozygosity and similarity Accumulation of inbreeding across the genome was evaluated with ROH-based positional inbreeding coefficients (). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in the levels of  over time (Fig. ). There were  among others  regions with a continuous increase in inbreeding (e.g. the peaks on BTA10)  regions with an increase followed by a decrease (e.g. around 40 Mb on BTA26) and regions with a constant inbreeding level over time (e.g. BTA18). Particularly striking was the strong increase in  in the last period for various regions (e.g. around 55 Mb on BTA4  around 40 Mb on BTA14 and around 25 Mb on BTA22). Overall  BTA10 showed the most prominent increase in   from 5% in the 1986–1990 period to 20–30% in the 2011–2015 period at the peak regions. BTA20 also showed regions with a  of 20–30% in the 2011–2015 period  but these peaks had already a higher  at the start of the 30-year period (of 10–15%). Within the high peak on BTA10  there was a remarkable trough near 62.5 Mb  which could be due to incorrect SNP positions on the reference genome Btau4.0 (the 12 SNPs in this region were mapped near 71.5 Mb on UMD3.1). The trough within the peak on BTA4  near 55 Mb  might also be the result of incorrect SNP positions  although for this region there was no inconsistency between Btau4.0 and UMD3.1 positions.

Grey bars cover gaps between consecutive markers of<U+2009>><U+2009>500 kb (with an additional 3.75 Mb on both sides of the gap). BTA:  autosome. Note that the scale of the x-axis differs between chromosomes Absolute changes in allele frequencies from the 1986–1990 period to the 2011–2015 period    were compared with those expected from gene dropping (Fig. ). Many SNPs showed higher -values than would be expected under pure genetic drift. For example  there were 6835 SNPs (9.05% of the total number) and 490 SNPs (0.65% of the total number) with a  above the 95%- and 99.9%-thresholds of the gene drop distribution  respectively. The SNPs above the 99.9%-threshold were considered indicative of selection and  although they were spread across the whole genome  these SNPs were generally located in peaks of high  (Fig. ). In line with the pattern observed for  (Fig. )  BTA10 showed the highest  on average  with two wide peaks enriched with putative selected SNPs. However  on BTA20 no clear peak was observed and only three putative selected SNPs were detected. In contrast  BTA19 showed a narrow peak for  that was not present in Fig. . This could be explained by the extremely high SNP density in this region (see Additional file : Fig. S1)  which caused the moving average of 31 -values to be based on a region of only 50 kb (while for ROH only regions longer than 3.75 Mb were considered). For 11 regions that were enriched with putative selected SNPs  we investigated whether QTL were known in these regions (Table ). In general  the putative selected regions were large and overlapped with many QTL of different trait categories. Across all regions combined  there was a relatively large number of QTL for conformation traits and relatively few for production traits  when compared to QTL reported for the complete autosome. The relatively low fraction of QTL for production-traits could be explained by the fact that 39% of all production-QTL in the AnimalQTLdb are located on BTA14  whereas only a single short region on this chromosome was identified in this study as a putative selected region. Absolute allele frequency changes from 1986–1990 to 2011–2015 () observed in data and gene drop. Changes are shown for different minor allele frequencies (MAF) in the 1986–1990 period  using MAF-classes of 0.5% (e.g. 0.0–0.5%).

Moving average is based on 31 SNPs. The SNPs in red (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>490) have an allele frequency change above the 99.9%-threshold of the gene drop distribution (see Fig. ).  Bos taurus autosome To evaluate the direction of allele frequencies over time  correlation coefficients between the  within different 5-year periods were calculated (Table ). Except for the correlation between the 1996–2000 and 2011–2015 periods  all correlations were significantly different from 0 (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). Correlation coefficients for any two consecutive periods were positive (ranging from 0.08 to 0.26)  except for the transition from the 1996–2000 period to the 2001–2005 period (-<U+2009>0.09). In this study  we evaluated genetic diversity across the genome of HF AI bulls from 1986 to 2015. An important objective was to investigate whether major changes in the Dutch-Flemish HF breeding program were accompanied by changes in diversity trends. We used genealogical  marker-by-marker and segment-based approaches to compare trends in expected IBD  IBS and realised IBD. Genome-wide rates of inbreeding and kinship and corresponding estimates of  computed over the 1986–2015 period were similar to those previously reported for HF populations. Genealogical and genomic estimates of  for HF populations in Australia  Canada  Denmark  Spain  Ireland and the United States of America for (parts of) the 1975–2013 period range from 49 to 127 [      ]. A similar  across countries is expected  due to the extensive exchange of genetic material. In spite of the global connectedness of the breed  there is some degree of genetic differentiation across countries [  ]. Genome-wide diversity trends showed two breakpoints. The first occurred around 2000  after which levels and rates of inbreeding and kinship temporarily dropped (Figs.  and ). The second occurred around 2010  after which inbreeding and kinship steeply increased. Both breakpoints coincided with major changes in the Dutch-Flemish breeding program. The drop in inbreeding and kinship around 2000 followed a shift in breeding goal composition and the introduction of OCS. Although the Dutch-Flemish bull selection index has changed continuously over time  the major shift took place around 2000  when longevity  udder health and reproductive traits were added to the index within a few years’ time (Table ). The inclusion of a wide range of traits at that time resulted in a more diverse set of bulls with high estimated breeding values (EBV) and thereby contributed to the (temporary) drop in inbreeding and kinship. From 2000 onwards  pedigree-based OCS has been used to select bull-parents in the breeding program and restrict  and . However  the effect of OCS will have been limited due to practical difficulties. One such difficulty is that  in practice  not all candidates with allocated contributions are available for breeding. Another difficulty is that OCS considers all candidates at a single moment in time  while selection decisions in the breeding program are made on a daily basis. In spite of these difficulties  the use of OCS will have restricted  and  and its introduction will have contributed to the observed drop around 2000. A drop in  and  around 2000 was also observed in the Canadian and Danish HF populations [  ]  although less pronounced than the drop in the current study. In these other HF populations  OCS was not (yet) introduced at that time. Stachowicz et al. [] suggested that the drop in the Canadian population may be due to an increased awareness and the introduction of average relationship values (R-values) by the Canadian Dairy Network around 2000. The steep increase in inbreeding and kinship rates around 2010 coincided with the implementation of GS. From the 2006–2010 period to the 2011–2015 period  there was a two- to four-fold increase in the annual rate of inbreeding. Rates per generation were also considerably higher since the implementation of GS  although the difference was less pronounced due to the decrease in . Rates of    and  between 2011 and 2015 were as high as 1.8  2.1 and 2.8% per generation  respectively (Fig. ). These rates correspond to an  of 18  24 and 28  respectively. Rates of kinship were lower than rates of inbreeding  but were also well above the rates of 0.5–1% per generation recommended for livestock populations [  ]. The high rates per generation were rather unexpected  because  in theory  GS reduces  for a given genetic gain compared to traditional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) selection  by predicting Mendelian sampling terms and reducing the co-selection of sibs [  ]. Estimates of inbreeding and kinship rates in real life HF GS schemes are still scarce. Rodríguez-Ramilo et al. [] recently evaluated genealogical and genomic inbreeding and kinship trends in the Spanish HF population. They reported  estimates that increased from 74 to 79 in the 1980–1999 period to 95–101 in the 2000–2013 period as a consequence of a reduction in   but did not evaluate the years with GS separately []. For the global HF population  Miglior and Beavers [] indicated that  although the number of AI bull sires has increased since GS  the number of sires that father 50% of the AI bulls has remained relatively constant. In North-American AI bulls  they also reported an increase of 1% in  from 2011 to 2012 []  which is in line with the 0.94% increase in the current study (Fig. ). An important factor that contributes to the accumulation of kinship in GS schemes is the relationship of selection candidates with the reference population. In GS  genomic EBV (GEBV) are computed from the effects of SNPs  which are estimated in a reference population of individuals with known genotypes and phenotypes []. The accuracy of an individual’s GEBV is strongly affected by the genetic relationship between the individual and the reference population [  ]. Pszczola et al. [] indicated that the average squared relationship of a candidate with the reference population influences especially the accuracy of GEBV. This means  for example  that having a single full sib in the reference population contributes more to a candidate’s GEBV accuracy than having two half-sibs. In general  candidates with a high average squared relationship with the reference population have a more accurate GEBV and are  therefore  more likely to be selected at a young age. This implies that  in a way  genetic variation in the reference population drives variation in selected individuals  which in turn drives variation at the population level. Thus  the composition of the reference population is an essential parameter that requires careful consideration for the management of diversity in the population. Since the implementation of GS  rates of marker-by-marker homozygosity and similarity have been considerably higher (0.7%) than segment-based rates  which in turn have been slightly higher (0.1–0.3%) than genealogical rates. The higher rate for IBS suggests that relatedness due to distant common ancestors is increasing relatively fast compared to relatedness caused by common ancestors in more recent generations. This could be due to the discordance between the way breeding values are estimated and the way diversity is managed. In the current Dutch-Flemish breeding program  breeding values are predicted with genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and are  thus  based on marker-by-marker similarities weighted by allele frequencies []. However  diversity is managed on a genealogical basis by restricting  with OCS. Although the relatively high correlations between  and  and between  and  (Fig. ) suggest that genomic IBD and IBS can be quite efficiently managed using   it is important to revisit this idea in view of OCS. In fact  when OCS is performed with GBLUP and a restriction on   the algorithm will search for selection candidates with a high GEBV and low average   thereby putting emphasis on the Mendelian sampling terms that are not captured by the pedigree. As demonstrated by Sonesson et al. []  the genomic inbreeding rate in such a scenario will substantially exceed the genealogical restriction. In addition  it will result in a IBD profile that is extremely variable across the genome []. Thus  controlling diversity at the genomic level should be a priority in the breeding program. In this study  genomic diversity was characterised with marker-by-marker IBS and segment-based IBD. Both measures have clear advantages and drawbacks with regard to management. The main advantage of using marker-by-marker IBS in OCS is that it is the most effective in conserving diversity [  ]. However  a drawback is that it stimulates both alleles of biallelic loci to move to a frequency of 0.5  irrespective of their effects. Thereby  deleterious mutations continue to segregate in the population. To expose and eliminate recessive deleterious mutations  it was suggested to combine OCS with inbred matings []. Alternatively  a segment-based IBD matrix can be used in OCS to restrict the increase in recent inbreeding. The rationale behind this approach is that recent inbreeding is more harmful than distant inbreeding  because the latter may have already been purged [  ]. In other words  the  is more closely associated with inbreeding depression than  [    ]. Segment-based metrics can also be used to identify genomic regions that are prone to inbreeding depression []  although the power of detection is limited by the fact that a single segment can contain multiple shorter haplotypes (or single SNPs) with different effects on the phenotype [  ]. Another drawback of the use of ROH and IBD-segments is their arbitrary definition. In this study  we defined the minimum length of IBD segments based on the average CGE of the pedigree  so that both genealogical and segment-based coefficients were expected to capture relatedness over 13.3 ancestral generations. However  the observed segment-based coefficients were on average<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.5% higher than genealogical coefficients. Pedigree skewness  which is not completely accounted for by the CGE  will have contributed to this difference. For example  in an extreme scenario with 20 generations completely known on the sire’s side  but with the dam unknown  the CGE of the offspring equals 10 while the  equals 0 by definition. A second factor that strongly influenced the difference between genealogical and segment-based coefficients was the chosen maximum gap length between SNPs. For example  when the maximum gap size was set to 250 kb instead of 500 kb  the segment-based coefficients moved to the same scale as genealogical coefficients. Due to the large effect of such small changes  and the wide variety of criteria used in the literature [    ]  one should be extremely cautious when comparing segment-based coefficients across studies. A last drawback of the segment-based approach is that it is computationally rather intensive. In spite of these limitations  the use of segment-based metrics is considered a promising tool to determine the effect of inbreeding and  when applied in OCS  to maintain diversity and fitness simultaneously [    ]. Selection has played an important role in shaping genetic variation across the HF genome over time. Although the identification of selection footprints was not the primary objective of this study  the regions in Table   enriched with ‘significant’  values  can be considered as putative signatures of selection. The most prominent peaks in  were observed on BTA10 (Fig. )  which is in line with previously reported selection signatures for HF cattle [  ]. Using the extended haplotype homozygosity test (EHH) in German HF cattle  Qanbari et al. [] detected 161 significant ‘core regions’ under selection  of which 17  45  and 11 regions were located on BTA2  10 and 20  respectively. We observed no clear peaks on BTA2. For BTA20  a large region with high  (Fig. ) was observed  but it showed only small changes in allele frequency (Fig. ). This could be explained by the fact that  for this region was already high in 1986  which suggests that selection for this region occurred already before the Holsteinisation (the large-scale introduction of HF into national dairy industries in the 1970s and early 1980s). The latter could also explain why this region was identified as a selection signature in various countries [    ]. The important role of selection was also apparent from the fact that  in consecutive 5-year periods  allele frequencies changed more often in the same direction than in opposite directions (Table ). An exception was found when comparing allele frequency changes between the 1996–2000 and 2001–2005 periods  which suggests a change in the direction of selection around this time. Indeed  this change coincided with the implementation of OCS and the major shift in breeding goal composition. To further investigate the change in direction around 2000  a ‘moving correlation’ between  in the 1996–2000 period and  in the 2001–2005 period was computed for groups of 51 markers (see Additional file : Fig. S2). There were several regions that showed a relatively strong negative correlation (see Additional file : Table S2) and which were rather large and harboured many known QTL associated with a wide range of traits. Although some of the identified regions showed a relatively large fraction of QTL related to traits such as reproduction (e.g. the region on BTA1)  longevity (e.g. the region on BTA12) or udder health (e.g. the region on BTA13)  these findings could not be specifically tied to the changes in breeding goal composition. Substantial differences in  (Fig. ) and in the accumulation of  (Fig. ) were observed across the genome. The emergence of such heterogeneity as a result of selection has been previously investigated in simulation and experimental studies [    ]. These studies showed that GS acts more locally across the genome  with more pronounced hitchhiking effects compared to BLUP selection [    ]. The striking increase in  from the 2006–2010 period to the 2011–2015 period for various genomic regions (Fig. ) could be the result of this local selection pressure. The peak regions showing high  remained fairly similar from the 2006–2010 period to the 2011–2015 period  which suggests that GS has not per se changed the regions that are under selection  but has especially increased the intensity of selection at these regions. This hypothesis is supported by the relatively strong positive correlation between -values in the 2006–2010 period and those in the 2011–2015 period (Table ). An important question that should be raised is how heterogeneity in  relates to maximising genetic gain and maintaining genetic diversity. At some loci  it is desirable to increase the frequency of favourable alleles towards fixation. At other loci  a high level of genetic diversity is beneficial  for example to ensure a population’s capacity to combat a wide range of pathogens [] or to limit inbreeding depression []. Thus  it is important to minimise the size of selection footprints [  ]. This can be achieved by slowly increasing the frequency of many favourable alleles with small effects  instead of strongly selecting for a few alleles with large effects [  ]. Although such an approach will not result in the highest gains in the short term  it will increase the long-term response [  ]. To maximise long-term gain further  it is desirable to select for rare favourable alleles  because this will increase the genetic variance []. Thus  to optimise long-term response while maintaining diversity  it is recommended to give less weight to SNPs that explain more variance and use a relatively uniform distribution of weights for the computation of GEBV [  ]. In general  genomic information offers many opportunities to manage genetic diversity and inbreeding more efficiently in the future (see [] for a review). Among others  it can be used to control diversity at specific regions []  select against multiple recessive disorders at the same time []  estimate dominance effects for a better understanding of inbreeding depression []  exploit variation in recombination rate across the genome [] and characterise gene bank collections on the genomic level to optimise these collections and exploit stored material []. However  the practical benefit of such new insights and genomic tools in real-life selection schemes has yet to be explored. There is substantial heterogeneity in diversity across the genome of HF AI -bulls over time as a result of selection and genetic drift. Trends in genome-wide and region-specific diversity reflect major changes in the Dutch-Flemish breeding program. The introduction of OCS and the shift in breeding goal  which both occurred around 2000  were followed by a temporary drop in inbreeding and kinship and were accompanied by a shift in the direction of changes in allele frequency. The recent introduction of GS around 2010 was accompanied by a substantial increase in the rates of inbreeding and kinship  both per year and per generation and especially at the IBS level. Allele frequencies continued to change in the same direction as before GS. These results provide insight in the effect of breeding practices on diversity across the genome and emphasize the need for efficient management of genetic diversity in HF GS schemes.

We suggest that these differences between traits in the effect of marker density and method on accuracy of genomic prediction are mainly due to the underlying genetic architecture of the traits. Feed is of major economic importance in pig production  accounting for 60 to 70% of total costs. The grow-finish phase accounts for the largest proportion of total feed  at about 75% []. Thus  improving grow-finish feed efficiency will significantly reduce production cost and increase profitability. Although intense selection for lean growth has improved feed efficiency dramatically in the past decades  with feed conversion ratio (FCR) values of 2.0 or less currently achievable []  further improvements require direct measurement and selection on feed intake (FI) and other components of feed efficiency. This is especially the case for high-quality products with increased marbling  since fat deposition has a high genetic correlation with FI (0.37 []). However  the expense of recording FI on large numbers of selection candidates limits the opportunities of using this approach. Genomic selection (GS) or prediction is a promising approach to address this issue  since it allows for early selection among candidates without FI records  higher rates of genetic gain  and better management of inbreeding  compared with traditional selection based on pedigree and phenotype [  ]. GS has been widely applied in livestock breeding programs  using medium-to-high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels []. The most successful implementation of GS is in dairy cattle  which has made it possible to reduce generation intervals and costs by eliminating progeny testing [  ]. Unlike dairy cattle  where the biggest impact is on reducing generation interval []  the largest benefit for pigs is in increasing the accuracy of selection for traits such as feed intake. However  implementation of GS in pigs is still very limited [   ]  which might be due to the low monetary value of a boar compared to a dairy bull and the relatively low genomic prediction power for pigs in most breeding programs  due to not having access to large numbers of animals that have the necessary phenotype and genotype records compared to dairy cattle (primarily for Holsteins). It was anticipated that these limitations could be addressed by increasing the numbers of animals with quality phenotypes that are genotyped and the number of markers used (especially for markers that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the underlying causative mutations) or by using the causative mutations themselves []. Using whole-genome sequence data is also expected to increase the accuracy of genomic prediction  since all or most of the causal mutations that underlie quantitative traits loci (QTL) are expected to be included in the data. Inclusion of the causal mutations is expected to increase the accuracy of genomic prediction across generations and even across breeds []. This was confirmed using simulated data [   ] but  in practice  the use of imputed sequence data in cattle and chicken has shown little increase (0–3%) in the accuracy of genomic prediction [    ]. Many factors can influence the accuracy of genomic prediction  including the genetic architecture of the traits  the statistical method applied [  ]  marker density  LD between QTL and SNPs []  effective population size [    ]  size of the reference population  relatedness of selection candidates with individuals in the training data [    ]  and imputation accuracy of marker genotypes []. The availability of higher density SNP panels and sequence information for pigs provided the opportunity to examine this for feed efficiency in a commercial Duroc breeding population. Therefore  this study aimed at evaluating the accuracy of genomic prediction of feed efficiency component traits of average daily feed intake  average daily gain  ultrasound backfat depth  and loin muscle depth  using 80K and imputed 650K SNPs  as well as imputed whole-genome sequence variants. Three methods  GBLUP []  BayesB [  ] and BayesRC []  were compared to determine the best method and marker density for each trait. Possible factors that influence the accuracy of genotype imputation and genomic prediction were also discussed. The ultimate aim was to investigate the feasibility and optimal approach for using genomic information to increase genetic gain for feed efficiency in pigs. Data were collected at the Prairie Sun Research and Development Facility (Genesus Inc.  Oakville  MB). All animals used in this study were raised under commercial production-like conditions and fed standard diets designed to exceed the pig’s requirements  as described previously []. The proposed work was reviewed by the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee. No other specific permissions were required for the work  since the animals were cared for according to the Canadian Quality Assurance Program  which includes attention to animal health and well-being and is in line with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. A total of 1363 Duroc boars (from 63 sires and 439 dams) tested in 2014 were used for this study. At weaning  on average  two boars per litter were selected to create a group of 24 or 48 boars  depending on the number of litters weaned in a given week. The average genetic relationship among these 1363 individuals was about 0.12 based on pedigree information. The boars were placed in nursery pens at a stocking density of 24 per pen  with littermates split between the two pens when groups of 48 were stocked. At completion of the nursery phase (approximately 9 weeks of age)  each group of boars was put into a single test pen (22 to 24 boars per pen) that was fitted with two electronic feeders per pen (IVOG  Insentec BV  Marknesse  the Netherlands). Boars from a nursery pen were kept together in the test pen. Following a 7-d acclimation period  feed intake was recorded in a test period of 14 weeks. Body weights were recorded at the beginning (~<U+2009>45 kg) and end (~<U+2009>110 kg) of the test  with an intermediate weight of ~<U+2009>80 kg. In addition  when average weight in the pen was near 110 kg (actual weight 112<U+2009>±<U+2009>11.05 kg  actual age 155<U+2009>±<U+2009>7.27 d)  boars were individually weighed and depths of backfat (FAT) and  muscle (LMD) were measured approximately 7 cm off the midline over the last three ribs using ultrasound (Aloka 500  Imagomedical Inc.  QC) and Biotronics Toolbox Software (Biotronics Inc.  Ames  IA). Individual meal events were edited to remove outliers and obvious errors using adapted procedures recommended by Casey et al. []  as described in []. All boars had to have a minimum of 63 valid feed intake days to pass the edits  along with a minimum of two valid feed intake days per week while on test. Following these edits  daily feed intake was calculated as the sum of individual feed intake events per day. Average daily feed intake (ADFI) was calculated as the predicted feed intake at the midpoint age on test for each boar based on intra-pig linear regression of daily feed intake on age. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated using linear regression of weight on age using the weights recorded at the start and end of test  along with one or two intermediate weights  with a minimum of two weeks between any two weight records. All phenotypic records (ADFI  ADG  FAT  and LMD) were further edited by removing observations that were more than three standard deviations from their respective means. After editing  all traits followed a normal distribution and were used for further analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from tail tissue samples following the DNA Extraction instruction manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd.  Ottawa  ON  Canada). Samples from all animals (1363) with phenotypic records were genotyped using the Geneseek-Neogen GPPHD 80K SNP chip. A deep pedigree for these animals was traced back ~<U+2009>8 generations. The common ancestors and their genetic contribution to the studied population (1363) were calculated using the PEDIG program []. On the basis of “the proportion of genetic diversity” strategy  as suggested by Druet et al. []  the top 29 ancestors (22 boars and 7 sows) based on their genetic contributions to the 1363 evaluated animals that had available tissue samples  were selected for next-generation sequencing (with an average 12-fold coverage). These ancestors cumulatively contributed about 70% of the genetics of the studied population. To improve imputation accuracy  171 animals were genotyped with the Affymetrix Axiom 650K SNP Array  including: (1) the 94 sires  maternal grand-sires/great-grandsires of the 1363 animals  (2) the 29 sequenced animals  (3) 19 sons of the sequenced animals  and (4) the next 29 ancestors (19 boars and 10 dams)  which cumulatively contributed about 20% of the genetics of the studied population. In order to test the accuracy of imputed genotypes across three different genotyping platforms  the 29 sequenced animals and 67 of the animals with 650K genotypes were also genotyped with the 80K SNP chip. All genotyping and sequencing analyses were conducted by Delta Genomics (Edmonton  AB  Canada). Library construction for next-generation sequencing was performed with 1 µg of genomic DNA according to library preparation protocols (Bio-O Scientific NEXTflex™ DNA Sequencing Kit). The Illumina 100 paired-end sequencing kit was used for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 PE100. Variant calling was performed according to GATK Best Practices work flow [  ]. More specifically  Illumina reads were aligned to the reference genome () using BWA []. Then  duplicates were marked and GATK INDEL realignment [] and base quality score recalibration were applied. After that  we performed variant calling with HaplotypeCaller and joint genotyping on all samples. Finally  SNPs and Indels were filtered using parameters recommended by GATK Best Practices [  ]. A total of 16 560 854 autosomal variants were detected in the 29 sequenced animals  including 2 576 543 Indels and 13 984 543 SNPs. Before imputation  alleles for all SNPs on the 80K and 650K panels were converted to the standard reference ()  with the reference-based allele denoted 0 and the alternate allele denoted 1. SNPs or variants for each genotyping platform were filtered for analysis according to the following criteria: SNP or variant call rate higher than 95%  SNP or variant with map information on autosomes ()  Chi square of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test less than 600  and minor allele frequency (MAF) in the genotyped animals higher than 5%. Stepwise imputation from 80K to 650K and then to the whole-genome sequence was performed by Fimpute v2.2 [] with inclusion of pedigree information. Leave-one-out cross-validation using the 96 animals that had both 80K and 650K genotypes and the 29 animals that had both 650K and whole-genome sequence genotypes was used to evaluate the imputation accuracy in each step. Only SNPs or variants with an imputation accuracy higher than 95% were used for further analysis. Genotype imputation accuracy was defined as the percentage of correctly imputed genotypes among the animals. Finally  38 440 SNPs remained from the 80K panel  429 130 SNPs remained from the 650K panel  and 4 844 535 variants were contained in the imputed whole-genome sequence. Significance of all possible systematic effects on phenotype  including the fixed effects of contemporary group (78 levels) consisting of ultrasonic test date and grow-finish pen  ultrasonic test machine (two levels  for FAT and LMD only)  and the covariate of animal age at the end of the test (140 to 170 days)  were tested using the following univariate animal model in ASREML []: where  is the vector of observations for the trait   is a vector of fixed effects (contemporary group and machine) and covariate (age)   is a vector of random additive genetic effects []  where  is the additive genetic relationship matrix constructed using pedigree and  is the additive genetic variance   is a vector of random residuals [  where  is the identity matrix and  is the residual variance  and  and  are incidence matrices associating  and  with . Only significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) fixed effects were included in the final model to estimate the variance components and residuals of the traits. The effects of contemporary group and animal age were significant for all traits  and ultrasonic test machine was significant for FAT and LMD. The interaction between contemporary group and ultrasonic test machine was not significant. Corrected phenotypes were calculated as the sum of the estimated breeding value and the estimated residuals from the above univariate pedigree-based animal model. Then  the 1363 Duroc boars were split into training (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1167) and prediction datasets (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>196) based on birthdate  before and after June 10  2014  respectively. The 196 youngest animals for prediction were from 19 sires and 88 dams  and almost all had half-sibs in the training dataset. The genetic relationship between individuals in the training and prediction datasets averaged 0.11 based on pedigree data. First  a full animal model (all available phenotypes) was used to obtain estimated breeding values (EBV)  i.e. EBV1  and corrected phenotypes () for the validation animals. These  were used to measure the accuracy and bias of all prediction models. Second  a reduced animal model (masking the phenotypes of validation animals) was used to calculate the EBV (EBV2) of the validation animals and corrected phenotypes () of training animals. These  of training animals were used as pseudo-phenotypes in the BayesRC method (see below) to estimate the effect of SNPs. The resulting EBV2 of validation animals were then used to evaluate the pedigree-based prediction ability (BLUP method below). The top variants (SNPs and Indels) were selected from the imputed whole-genome sequence data based on their effects on phenotype  as estimated in the training dataset (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1167) using method BayesB in GenSel [  ]. The following model was used: where  is the vector of observations for the traits   is a vector of the significant fixed effects and covariate  as described in Eq. ()   is the vector of genotype covariates (-<U+2009>10/0/10) across animals for SNP  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to )  a is the allele substitution effect for SNP   and d is an indicator for whether SNP  was included (d<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) or excluded (d<U+2009>=<U+2009>0) in the model for a given Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration. A total of 50 000 iterations were run for each analysis  with the first 5000 iterations used as burn-in. The prior probability of a SNP to have no effect was set equal to p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9995 based on the posterior value obtained from BayesCp. Due to the computational demands associated with testing the very large number of sequence variants (~<U+2009>4.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) simultaneously  an alternative split-and-merge method was used  similar to Calus et al. []. Briefly  on each chromosome  the sequence-based variants were extracted and merged with the SNPs from the 80K SNP panel on the other chromosomes to generate sub-datasets (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>18). The association analysis was then conducted separately on each sub-dataset using BayesB. Subsequently  results from all sequence variants across all chromosomes were combined and ordered according to the absolute value of the estimated marker effect from highest to lowest for each trait. The top 0.05% (equal to 1<U+2009>-<U+2009>p) of variants were considered to have an important effect on the trait and selected as markers that were given a different prior for sequence variant classification (see below). Finally  7855 markers were selected for the four traits (2025 for each trait  with 245 shared between at least two traits). The imputed whole-genome variants were annotated based on the  assembly of the swine genome using NGS-SNP []. All variants were then defined as belonging to one of three broad categories  as suggested by MacLeod et al. []. The first category  which will be referred to as “NSC”  comprised variants that were statistically associated with the traits (preselected from genome-wide association analyses (GWAS)  as described above) and variants predicted to cause a non-synonymous coding change  including missense variants  splice site variants  in-frame Indels  frame shift variants  and stop gained/lost mutations. The second category  referred to as “REG”  included variants in regions that were predicted to have potential regulatory roles  mainly those within 5000 bp upstream and downstream of genes  variants in the 3' or 5' untranslated genic regions  and non-coding exon variants. All other variants were allocated to the third category  referred to as “CHIP”. These were mainly intergenic but included some intronic and synonymous coding variants. Then  the imputed whole-genome sequence variants were further filtered based on LD using PLINK [] by excluding a random variant of a pair of variants that were in complete LD (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.99) in a 5000-kb sliding-window with 50 variants. LD pruning was carried out first independently within each category (NSC  REG and CHIP) and then any REG or CHIP variant that was in complete LD with an NSC variant was removed. Finally  all CHIP variants that were in complete LD with a REG variant were removed. The remaining 2 154 844 variants  henceforth referred to as “SEQ”  were used for genomic prediction. They included 13 642 NSC  157 809 REG and 1 983 393 CHIP variants. Genomic predictions for the validation animals were estimated based on their genotypes (38 440 from 80K  429 130 from imputed 650K and 2 154 844 from SEQ) and the marker effects estimated in the training dataset using three methods: GBLUP []  BayesB [  ] and BayesRC [] (the latter was only used for “SEQ”). Accuracy of prediction was evaluated by correlating the genomic breeding value of the validation animals with their corrected phenotype and dividing by the square root of the heritability of the trait. Bias of genomic predictions was estimated as the linear regression of predictions on corrected phenotypes for the validation animals  with a regression coefficient equal to 1 indicating no bias. Corrected phenotypes used for validation were obtained from analysis of the full dataset using the model of Eq. ()  as the sum of the pedigree-based EBV1 and residuals. The accuracy of genomic predictions was compared to the accuracy of pedigree-based predictions of the validation animals  which were obtained by fitting the model of Eq. () to the dataset with phenotypes for validation animals masked. The genomic relationship matrix ( based on each of the three sets of genotypes was calculated using PLINK. The GBLUP approach was applied to the model of Eq. ()  but using the genomic relationship matrix   instead of the pedigree-based relationship matrix  and with the phenotypes of validation animals masked. In the Bayesian approach  first the fraction of loci with no effect    was estimated using method BayesC  in GenSel  using the full dataset. The posterior mean of  was similar for all traits  at approximately 0.99  0.999  0.9995 for the 80K  650K and SEQ genotypes  respectively. Then  the BayesB method using the model of Eq. () was applied to genotypes and phenotypes of the training dataset with the corresponding estimates of  to simultaneously estimate effects of SNPs across the entire genome for the 80K  650K and SEQ genotypes. The total number of iterations was 80 000  with 10 000 discarded as burn-in. Then the genomic prediction for the animals in the validation dataset were computed as in Eq. (): where  is the genomic EBV for validation animal   <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to  is the number of SNPs in the respective genotype datasets   is the SNP genotype code (-<U+2009>10/0/10) for validation animal  for SNP   and  is the effect estimate for SNP  obtained from BayesB according to Eq. (). BayesRC was applied to the SEQ variants only  following MacLeod et al. []. Briefly  BayesRC uses an MCMC approach to estimate variant effects that are modelled as a mixture of four normal distributions  including a null distribution    and three others:       where  is the additive genetic variance for the trait based on whole-sequence genotypes. The first distribution accommodates the likelihood that many variants have no effect on the trait  thus reducing the complexity of the model. The model fitted to the datasets was: where  is the corrected phenotype for the trait   is the design matrix allocating phenotypes to polygenic breeding values   is the vector of polygenic breeding values []  with  as the genetic relationships calculated from pedigree and  as the additive genetic variance not explained by the variants   is the design matrix of variant genotypes (0/1/2)  centred and standardized to have unit variance   is the vector of estimated variant effects based on a mixture of the four distributions as listed above  and  is the vector of random residuals. Prior independent biological information was used to allocate each variant to a “class”  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>3)  as described above  where the purpose is to provide one or more classes that are expected to be enriched for QTL or for variants linked to the QTL. As described by Macleod et al. []  within each class   a uniform  prior was used for the proportion of effects in each of the four normal distributions of SNP effects. For all traits  we implemented five replicate chains of 80 000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler  with 10 000 iterations discarded as burn-in. Very good agreement was found in the final results across the five replicate chains (correlation of posterior estimates of marker effects equal to 0.999). Final estimates were derived from the means of the five replicate chains. Using the resulting posterior means of marker effects  the genomic breeding value for the validation animals were calculated using Eq. (). The average genotype imputation accuracy for individual SNPs was 92.1% from 80K to 650K and 85.6% from 650K to whole-genome sequence  with the complete range from 0 to 100% across SNPs. Most SNPs had an imputation accuracy higher than 90%  77% of SNPs for imputation from 80K to 650K and 57% for imputation from 650K to sequence. About 12.6 and 25.9% of SNPs had an imputation accuracy lower than 80% for imputation of 80K–650K and of 650K to sequence imputation  respectively (Table ). Only variants with an imputation accuracy higher than 95% were kept for final genomic prediction. The accuracy and bias of (G)EBV for the studied traits are in Table . Generally  the average accuracy of GEBV was moderate to high for ADFI (0.40) and FAT (0.65)  and relatively low for LMD (0.30) and ADG (0.15). Compared with the pedigree-based evaluation  the use of genomics was beneficial for ADFI and FAT  with smaller bias and an accuracy that was improved by on average 42.9 and 32.7%  respectively. However  for ADG and LMD  pedigree-based prediction gave better accuracy and smaller bias  and no improvement was observed from using genomic data. Improvement in the accuracy of genomic predictions based on BayesB compared with GBLUP is shown in Fig. . Generally  BayesB performed better than GBLUP for ADFI and FAT for all three sets of genotypes (positive in Fig. ). For ADG and LMD  GBLUP gave higher accuracy using 80K and 650K SNPs (negative in Fig. )  but little difference in accuracy was observed between the two methods when using SEQ data. When applied to the SEQ data  BayesRC resulted in higher accuracy than BayesB and GBLUP for both ADG and LMD. For ADFI and FAT  the accuracy from BayesRC was between those from GBLUP and BayesB (Table ). Improvement (%) of GEBV accuracy using BayesB compared with using GBLUP. The improvement was defined as 100<U+2009>×<U+2009>(<U+2009>-<U+2009>)/  indicating how much improvement of accuracy using BayesB compared with using GBLUP The change in the accuracy of genomic predictions with increasing SNP density is in Fig. . Increasing the SNP density slightly decreased the prediction accuracy for FAT  for which use of 80K SNPs gave the best accuracy regardless of the statistical method used. For ADFI  use of SEQ data decreased the accuracy compared with the SNP panels  and little difference in accuracy was observed between 80K and 650K. For LMD  increasing the number of SNPs resulted in similar or greater accuracy for both GBLUP and BayesB. For ADG  almost no improvement in accuracy was observed with increasing marker density. In conclusion  SEQ data with the BayesRC method gave the best accuracy for ADG (0.25) and LMD (0.35)  while use of 80K SNPs with the BayesB method gave the best accuracy for ADFI (0.44) and FAT (0.68). Improvement (%) of GEBV accuracy with increasing marker density. Improvement was defined as 100<U+2009>×<U+2009>-<U+2009>-<U+2009>--  indicating how much improvement of accuracy from low to high marker density.  Using GBLUP method   using BayesB method In the current study  we obtained high imputation accuracies  which reached 0.92 for imputation from 80K to 650K SNPs. In pigs  there are several reports on the accuracy of genotype imputation from lower densities to 60K SNPs  with correlations between observed and imputed genotypes ranging from 0.952 to 0.995 for imputation from 6K to 60K []  from 0.879 to 0.991 for imputation from 3K or 6K to 60K [  ]  and from 0.88 to 0.95 for imputation from 9K to 60K in different scenarios []. However  imputation using high-density and whole-genome sequence using pig data has not been reported to date. In beef cattle  the percentage of correctly imputed genotypes was on average 95% for imputation from 3K to 50K [] and ranged from 84 to 99% for imputation from 50K to 777K [  ]. The squared correlation () between imputed and observed genotypes ranged from 0.80 to 0.96 for imputation from different low densities to 50K [] and from 0.90 to 0.96 for imputation from 50K to 777K []. For sequence imputation  research in Holstein–Friesian bulls has shown that stepwise imputation (50K–777K to sequence) yields higher accuracy (correlation between observed and imputed genotypes) (0.77 to 0.83) than using a one-step method  which had accuracies ranging from 0.37 to 0.46 for imputation from 50K to sequence and from 0.77 to 0.83 for imputation from 777K to sequence []. Imputation accuracy measured as the percentage of variants correctly imputed was on average 85.6% to whole-genome sequence data in the current study  which was lower than that obtained in Holstein cattle (97%) with a large multi-breed reference population (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>444) []. Many factors can influence the accuracy of genotype imputation. MAF is one important factor  especially when imputing to sequence data  since the number of SNPs with a very low MAF is usually limited in SNP panels but large in sequence data (see Additional file : Fig. S1). The effect of MAF on accuracy was even greater when the accuracy was measured as the percentage of correctly imputed variants (the measurement applied here) than measured by other statistics. In cattle  SNPs with a very low MAF had very poor imputation accuracy  which heavily influenced the overall imputation accuracy []  especially when the reference population (founders) was small [  ]  as is the case in this study  where only 29 common ancestors were sequenced as the reference population. Relationships between individuals is another factor that affects imputation accuracy. In general  imputation accuracy increases with lower relatedness within the reference population and larger relationships between reference and imputed individuals. As reported previously  a multi-breed reference population generated higher imputation accuracy for a given breed than using the same breed as a reference [  ]. In the present study  in order to maximize relationships between reference and imputed animals  29 common ancestors that contributed about 70% of the alleles present in the imputed animals were selected for sequencing. However  as we were restricted to one breed and in availability of tissue samples  the selected animals (29) in the reference population were related to each other  with genetic relationships ranging from 0.03 to 0.49 and averaging 0.06. The average accuracies of genomic predictions for ADFI  FAT  ADG and LMD obtained in this study were 0.40  0.65  0.15 and 0.30  respectively. Limited literature is available on genomic prediction for feed efficiency and component traits in pigs (Table ). Studies for Duroc pigs using 60K SNPs showed accuracies of genomic predictions for ADFI  FAT  ADG and LMD of about 0.15  0.37–0.56  0.24–0.58 and 0.30  respectively [  ]. A study using imputed 60K SNPs in Yorkshire pigs [] reported accuracies of 0.69–0.86 for FAT and of 0.66–0.88 for growth rate. Accuracies of genomic predictions obtained in this study were much higher for ADFI than accuracies obtained in these previous reports but much lower for ADG  while accuracies obtained for FAT and LMD were in the range of previous reports (Table ). These differences can be explained by the many factors that influence the accuracy of genomic prediction  which will be discussed later. The advantage of using genomic information for breeding value prediction over using pedigree information (BLUP method) was not uniform across traits. Compared to pedigree-BLUP  using genomic data increased prediction accuracy and decreased prediction bias for ADFI and FAT but not for ADG and LMD. Similar results were reported in cattle [] and sheep []  where the use of genomic data for genomic prediction was not beneficial for all traits. Use of genomic information is generally expected to increase prediction accuracy  such as the reports in chicken [  ] and pigs []  since genomic data can consider the Mendelian sampling terms better compared with pedigree information  and can produce more accurate genetic relationships among animals. However  this is not always true  as discussed above. The other two main factors that affect genomic prediction accuracy are the ability of markers to capture the total genetic variance of the traits (so-called “genomic heritability”) and the accuracy of the estimates of marker effects []. In most cases  heritability estimates obtained from dense markers were lower than estimates obtained from pedigree-based animal models (see Additional file : Table S1)  which indicates that “missing heritability” exists  and this has been reported to be an issue in human genetics [  ]. Missing heritability mainly results from incomplete LD between causal variants and genotyped SNPs  which can be exacerbated by causal variants having lower MAF than the genotyped SNPs [  ]. Missing heritability can also be related to the genetic architecture of the traits  epistatic effects  genotype-by-environment interactions  and others []. For example  if the SNPs used are causal variants or are closely-linked to causal variants for the traits  they can capture a large proportion of the genetic variance and give high genomic prediction accuracies  such as for ADFI and FAT in this study  for which QTL with relatively large effects have been detected (data not shown). If the SNPs used do not capture all the genetic variation for the trait  prediction accuracy is limited  such as the low prediction accuracy found for ADG and LMD  for which the SNP panels only captured 53 to 83% of the genetic variance based on pedigree- and genotype-based estimates of heritability (see Additional file : Table S1). A similar trend was also reported in sheep []  where no significant regions or markers were detected for the two traits for which prediction accuracy was not increased by using genomic data compared with using pedigree information. Genetic architecture and the statistical method used for genomic prediction are two interrelated factors that have a large influence on the accuracy of genomic prediction. Usually  higher accuracy can be achieved when the model assumptions more closely represent the underlying genetic architecture of the traits. We found that BayesB outperformed GBLUP in the accuracy of genomic prediction for ADFI and FAT. BayesB assumes that only a small proportion of SNPs have a large effect on the trait  which is in agreement with our GWAS results  where relatively large QTL were detected on  chromosomes (SSC) SSC1 and SSC18 for ADFI and FAT  using BayesB in the full dataset (data not shown). With this method  the effects of SNPs surrounding large QTL  such as those on SSC1 and SSC18 for ADFI and FAT  are easier to detect and more accurately estimated. This could be the main reason why BayesB gave higher accuracy for ADFI and FAT than GBLUP. The advantage of BayesB for genomic prediction for traits that are  at least in part  determined by QTL of large effect was also recognized by Meuwissen et al. [] and demonstrated by other empirical studies [        ]. For ADG and LMD  GBLUP performed better and increased the accuracy by 3 to 11% compared to BayesB. GBLUP assumes an infinitesimal model and  thereby  that all markers have the same contribution to the trait (e.g. no major QTL control the trait). Compared with FAT  few QTL were detected for ADG (data not shown)  indicating that ADG may be determined by many loci with very small individual effects. We also implemented the BayesRC method for the imputed whole-genome sequence data. Compared to BayesB and GBLUP  BayesRC gave higher accuracy for ADG and LMD  improving accuracy from 0.12 to 0.25 for ADG and from 0.32 to 0.35 for LMD. For ADFI and FAT  the accuracy from BayesRC was between those obtained with GBLUP and BayesB. The advantage of BayesRC compared with GBLUP and BayesB is that it can incorporate prior biological information by defining classes of variants that are likely enriched for causal mutations and by fitting a mixture distribution for the effects of variants in each class [    ]  which is more precise and sensitive to the genetic architecture of the traits. BayesRC resulted in the most accurate genomic predictions for ADG and LMD but also introduced greater bias for ADFI and LMD (Table ). Both simulation and empirical studies have also shown that BayesRC can increase the power of detection of causal variants and improve the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to GBLUP [  ]  in agreement with this study. BayesRC is also able to detect a larger proportion of variance when there is a large number of QTL with small individual effects []  as was the case for ADG in this study. The posterior p values for class NSC that was obtained for ADG (0.413) was much smaller than the posterior p for FAT (0.641)  which indicates that a larger proportion of variants were in class NSC for ADG and these variants may have small individual effects on the trait. Therefore  for traits with such a genetic architecture (e.g. ADG)  the advantage of BayesRC for genomic prediction is greater. For traits with known large QTL  such as ADFI and FAT  accuracies obtained with BayesB and BayesRC were similar or higher than those obtained using GBLUP. However  the advantage of BayesRC for sequence data depends on the completeness and accuracy of the prior biological information. With a better understanding of the functional annotation of genes and variants in the future []  the benefit of using whole-sequence data for genomic prediction is anticipated to be further improved. Increasing marker density has the potential to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction and the use of whole-genome sequence data is expected to give the best accuracy  as the causative mutations are expected to be included in the genotype data [  ]. However  this was not found to be always the case in our study. An increase in marker density did not improve prediction accuracy for some traits  such as FAT  for which 80K SNPs gave the highest accuracy  regardless of the statistical method used. This result was also reported for backfat thickness in pigs by Pérez-Enciso et al. []. Similar results were also obtained in cattle  for which imputed 777K SNPs resulted in no or very little increase in the accuracy of genomic prediction for some traits [    ] compared with using 50K SNPs. SNPs on commercially available low-density SNP chips (e.g. pig 60K and 80K  bovine 50K) were selected to have a high MAF and can  thus  capture a relatively large amount of the variance for traits that are determined by a relatively small number of QTL (e.g. backfat in pigs). Increasing marker density has little effect on capturing the remaining proportion of genetic variance for such traits. Furthermore  with GBLUP and BayesB  the QTL effects and opportunities for their detection become smaller with increasing density []  thus resulting in less accurate genomic predictions. Therefore  we suggest that the 80K SNP panel is sufficient for within-breed genomic prediction for FAT and yields acceptable accuracy (0.68). In contrast  when some of the QTL mutations or the linked SNPs are not in the SNP panel  a higher density may include more SNPs that are in high LD with the QTL for the traits  resulting in an increase in the genetic variance captured and more accurate genomic predictions. This appeared to be the case for ADG in this study. As discussed above  when considering the best method for each trait  the imputed 650K SNPs increased the accuracy of genomic prediction by 3.4% for ADFI (BayesB) and 15.2% for ADG (GBLUP). Results from using sequence data to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction have been inconsistent. Simulation studies suggested that including whole-sequence data could improve the accuracy of genomic prediction by as much as 40%  depending on the trait  statistical method  and MAF of the causal mutations affecting the trait [      ]. However  empirical studies in cattle and chickens have reported either no or a very small increase in accuracy when using imputed whole-genome sequence data compared to using the available low- or high-density SNP chips [        ]. In pigs  simulation based on whole-genome sequence showed an increase in accuracy of ~<U+2009>3.8% over 60K and ~<U+2009>2.8% over 650K SNPs []. We found that using SEQ data and BayesRC gave the highest prediction accuracies for LMD and ADG. For LMD  using SEQ data increased the accuracy from 8 (GBLUP) to ~<U+2009>20% (BayesB). Using SEQ data  however  resulted in a decrease in accuracy for FAT and ADFI compared to using 80K and 650K SNP chips. Druet et al. [] explained that the advantage of using imputed sequence data for genomic prediction is affected by the accuracy of imputation and  more importantly  by the allele frequency distribution of the QTL. When the MAF of QTL is very low  genomic predictions from imputed sequence data can result in up to 30% improvement in accuracy. However  for rare variants  imputation accuracy is usually poorer than for variants with a high MAF [    ]. Thus  a large reference population must be sequenced to improve the results. In this study  the small number of sequenced animals may have influenced the accuracy of imputed sequence variants and  thus  may have limited the potential of whole-genome sequence data to improve prediction accuracy. A significant challenge for genomic prediction using whole-genome sequence data is the computational requirement due to the large number of markers. Preselecting the most important markers and/or filtering out the uninformative ones can address this problem. The split-and-merge approach  which splits one large computational task into many smaller ones  was first proposed by Calus et al. [] to pre-select the most important markers from whole-genome sequence data. Some studies [    ] showed that using preselected markers from sequence data through GWAS and adding them to the 50K SNP panel can increase the accuracy of genomic prediction by up to 5 percentage points. However  Veerkamp et al. [] and Calus et al. [] found no improvement in accuracy using a similar approach. In our study  first a modified split-and-merge approach was used by integrating the 80K SNPs into the split association analyses for each chromosome  in order to better account for polygenic effects and to improve the accuracy of estimates of marker effects. Second  all SEQ markers  not only the pre-selected ones  were considered simultaneously in the genomic prediction model (BayesRC)  which may avoid the loss of the marginal genetic variance contributed by the non-selected sequence variants and the possible bias derived from strict pre-selection  as discussed by Calus et al. [] and Veerkamp et al. []. Pruning SNPs that are in complete and high LD with other SNPs is also an efficient way to reduce the number of uninformative markers  which was shown to be important for the application of Bayesian models that explicitly estimate a SNP variance component using sequence data  since performance of these models may be poorer without pruning []. According to Goddard []  prediction accuracy depends on both the proportion of genetic variance that can be captured by markers (so-called “genomic heritability”) [] and the accuracy of estimates of marker effects. However  there are important trade-offs between these two factors. Usually the estimate of genomic heritability increases when more markers are used  especially when the added markers are in high LD with the QTL [  ]. A similar trend was found in our study  where the use of SEQ variants increased the genomic heritability for all traits compared with using the commonly available SNP panels (see Additional file : Table S1). However  the accuracy of estimates of marker effects was impaired as the number of effects to be estimated increased  which is mainly due to the relatively small size of the training population (n<U+2009><U+2009>p  where n is the number of animals in training and p is the number of markers). Additional issues can also arise as a result of the small sample size  including (1) causal mutations (usually with a small MAF) may be missed  are more easily filtered out during quality control  or are more poorly imputed to the whole population [  ]  which decreases the value of such causal variants in the prediction process  thus negatively influencing prediction accuracy; and (2) a small amount of phenotypic data is not sufficient to detect causative mutations and to distinguish their effects from random noise. Therefore  as Meuwissen et al. [] highlighted  a large training dataset is needed to take full advantage of high-density markers (especially for whole-genome sequence data) for accurate genomic prediction. Relatedness between individuals is also very important for both genotype imputation and genomic prediction. Ideally  having less related animals in a large reference population is helpful to break down high levels of LD  thus making it easier to identify the causal mutations and to capture all the genetic variance. For example  use of multiple breeds in the training population to reduce their average relatedness gave more accurate genomic predictions than using the same single breed for training  especially in simulated datasets [        ]. In contrast  greater relationships between training and prediction animals can improve the prediction accuracy. Macleod et al. [] demonstrated that the accuracy of genomic prediction increased for all traits with increasing relatedness between training and prediction sets. Other studies also reported that a closer relationship between training and prediction increases the accuracy of genomic prediction [      ]. A small effective population size  which contributes to high LD []  is another factor that influences the prediction accuracy. The effective size of pig breeding populations has been estimated to be relatively small (55 to 113 [  ])  so a small number of SNPs (80K) may capture most genetic variance  especially for ADFI and FAT  which may be determined by a small number of QTL with relatively large effects (at least in this population). Therefore  the potential increase in the accuracy of genomic prediction from using whole-genome sequence data is expected to be limited. A similar situation was also observed in dairy cattle [  ] and sheep [] populations with small effective sizes. In conclusion  although the reference population used was small  the genotype imputation accuracies were as high as 92.1% from 80K to 650K  and 85.6% from 650K to whole sequence. Increasing marker density  however  had no or little advantage for genomic prediction for FAT and ADFI  such that the available 80K SNP panel is sufficient for these traits. BayesB resulted in higher prediction accuracy than the other methods tested for these two traits. For LMD and ADG  GBLUP gave higher genomic prediction accuracies than BayesB  and BayesRC in SEQ data gave the best prediction accuracies. However  pedigree-based BLUP outperformed all genomic methods and produced the highest prediction accuracies for ADG and LMD  likely because the SNPs captured less genetic variance for these traits than pedigree data. In the future  with decreasing costs for whole-genome sequencing  a better understanding of the functional annotation of the genome and variants []  and larger reference population sizes  BayesRC is anticipated to be a superior method for genomic prediction and application in genetic improvement.

"Epigenetics and early domestication: differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between red junglefowl divergently selected for high or low fear of humans"	"Authors: Johan Bélteky  Beatrix Agnvall  Lejla Bektic  Andrey Höglund  Per Jensen and Carlos Guerrero-Bosagna"	"AVIAN Behavioural Physiology and Genomics Group  IFM Biology  Linköping University  581 83  Linköping  SwedenJohan Bélteky  Beatrix Agnvall  Lejla Bektic  Andrey Höglund  Per Jensen & Carlos Guerrero-Bosagna"	"No Co-Author"	"2 April 2018"	"BackgroundDomestication of animals leads to large phenotypic alterations within a short evolutionary time-period. Such alterations are caused by genomic variations  yet the prevalence of modified traits is higher than expected if they were caused only by classical genetics and mutations. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be important in driving domesticated phenotypes such as behavior traits. Gene expression can be modulated epigenetically by mechanisms such as DNA methylation  resulting in modifications that are not only variable and susceptible to environmental stimuli  but also sometimes transgenerationally stable.

Such alterations are caused by genomic variations  yet the prevalence of modified traits is higher than expected if they were caused only by classical genetics and mutations. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be important in driving domesticated phenotypes such as behavior traits. Gene expression can be modulated epigenetically by mechanisms such as DNA methylation  resulting in modifications that are not only variable and susceptible to environmental stimuli  but also sometimes transgenerationally stable. To study such mechanisms in early domestication  we used as model two selected lines of red junglefowl (ancestors of modern chickens) that were bred for either high or low fear of humans over five generations  and investigated differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between the two populations. Twenty-two 1-kb windows were differentially methylated between the two selected lines at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 after false discovery rate correction. The annotated functions of the genes within these windows indicated epigenetic regulation of metabolic and signaling pathways  which agrees with the changes in gene expression that were previously reported for the same tissue and animals. Our results show that selection for an important domestication-related behavioral trait such as tameness can cause divergent epigenetic patterns within only five generations  and that these changes could have an important role in chicken domestication. Animal domestication is a process that occurred in an evolutionary short timespan—less than 10 000 years []—and substantially altered several traits such as size  behavior  coat color  and physiological and morphological features in all domesticated species. Similar phenotypic variations tend to reoccur even in widely unrelated species  which are referred to as the ‘domestication phenotype’ [  ]. This domestication process has altered the genetic structure that underlies these traits and has created distinct patterns that differentiate domestic animals from their wild counterparts [   ]. Similar phenotypic changes are also seen in recent experimental domestication processes such as in the silver fox []. Selection for tameness  or decreased fear of humans  was undoubtedly strong during the early period of domestication and has been proposed to be the major factor that drove the domesticated phenotype  which may  accordingly  have developed partly as correlated selection responses [   ]. Accumulating evidence shows that phenotypic variation in behavior and other traits within a species or breed can be influenced by epigenetic factors []  in addition to genetic factors. For example  variation in personality of the great tit is statistically associated with DNA methylation levels at a dopamine receptor gene []. Similarly  in rat pups  the DNA methylation status of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor gene is affected by maternal behavior []. In domestic chickens  differences in DNA methylation are related to susceptibility to disease []  immune responses []  growth  and metabolism []. Moreover  epigenetic differences (e.g. in red blood cells) can emerge simply after individuals are subjected to different rearing conditions []. DNA methylation  i.e. the addition of a methyl group to cytosine in CpG dinucleotides  has the potential to affect gene expression. Although DNA methylation patterns are generally maintained after cell division  they can sometimes be modified by the action of external stimuli [  ]. Environmentally-altered DNA methylation patterns can be transmitted through the germ line [] and be stable in somatic tissues over generations [    ]. Somatic epigenetic differences  whether shaped by the environment or intentionally or unintentionally selected  can in turn affect phenotypic traits. Thus  epigenetic mechanisms could be an important factor in the rapid phenotypic changes that occur during domestication. This is supported  for example  by evidence of significant hypermethylation in purebred dogs compared to wolves []  in domestic compared to wild worms []  and in domesticated White Leghorn chickens compared to the ancestral red junglefowl (RJF) []. Interestingly  in the example of Darwin’s finches  DNA methylation in blood was shown to be a better indicator of evolutionary phenotypic diversification than overall genetic changes (copy number variations) []. The chicken  the world’s most produced species for food  was domesticated from the RJF () approximately 8000 years ago and is today one of the most phenotypically diverse species of vertebrates [  ]. With both wild and domestic chickens being available  they have been used in many comparative studies that evaluated domestication effects [  ]. These studies have  for example  shown that domesticated chickens have variable coloration patterns  grow faster  reproduce more efficiently  and differ in their social behavior and general activity compared to RJF. In the current experiment  we attempted to experimentally recreate the early domestication process of chickens by selecting RJF bi-directionally for low or high levels of fear of humans []. Five generations of repeated selection generated significant phenotypic variation that affected size  behavior  and metabolism [    ]  as well as transcriptomic differences in both hypothalamic and frontal cortex tissues [  ]. Hence  domesticated phenotypes developed in a few generations (five) as side effects of continuous selection for high or low fear of humans. In this study  DNA samples from the hypothalamus of the fifth generation of a lineage of RJF selected for high or low fear of humans were used to perform methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) sequencing  in order to identify differentially-methylated (DM) regions. Previous studies on the same populations found significant differences in brain gene expression as a consequence of selection []. Hence  our hypothesis was that epigenetic differences  measured as differential DNA methylation  would be observed between individuals selected for high or low fear of humans over five generations. We analyzed whether these differences mainly targeted genes and genomic regions that are relevant for tameness and stress. Two unrelated populations of RJF were used to generate a parental population (P0)  from which two selection lines were bred for high or low fear of humans for five generations (S5). For a detailed description of the breeding scheme  selection  and housing conditions of animals  see [  ]. Briefly  after an outbreeding scheme that lasted for two generations  the P0 generation consisted of approximately 70 birds. The P0 generation was divided into two groups composed of animals with high or low levels of fearfulness towards humans based on scores recorded from a standardized test of fear of humans  described in detail in []. Individuals were then bi-directionally selected based on scores of fear of humans  resulting in two lines  i.e. one with a high fear of humans (HFH) and one with a low fear of humans (LFH). Approximately 50 animals per selection line were hatched in each generation from 5 to 10 families  and animals from the two lines were housed and reared together upon hatching in order to standardize rearing conditions. All animals received food and water ad libitum. Animals from generation S5 were sacrificed at the age of 48 weeks by rapid decapitation. Brains were dissected from the skull and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 min  as reported in []. To access the hypothalamus  which is located in the inferior region of the brain  the whole brain was dissected into smaller parts. The region between the two optic lobes was rotated upside down to reveal a white butterfly-like pattern  with the thalamus/hypothalamus centered as a small  red protruding structure. In total  12 S5 individuals were used for this study: six HFH and six LFH birds. Each group consisted of three males and three females  which were chosen randomly from each experimental group. These same 12 individuals had previously been used in studies that examined brain transcriptomic changes [  ]. DNA was extracted from hypothalamus tissue using an AllPrep RNA/DNA kit (Qiagen)  following the manufacturer’s instructions. In short  approximately 20 to 30 mg of tissue were homogenized with 600 µL of Buffer RTL Plus using FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals). DNA was separated from RNA using AllPrep DNA spin columns  which were kept on ice while RNA was purified for gene expression analysis []. 350 µL of Buffer AW1 were added to each spin column  which was then centrifuged for 15 s at 17 000 g. The supernatant was discarded and a mixture of 20 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 60 µL of Buffer AW1 was added to each sample. The samples were then incubated for 5 min at room temperature  cleaned with 350 µL of Buffer AW1  centrifuged for 15 s at full speed (17 000 g)  and centrifuged again with 500 µL of Buffer AW2 for 2 min at full speed. Columns were dried by an additional centrifugation at 17 000 g for 1 min and then placed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. For elution of DNA  50 µL of Buffer EB were added to the spin column  followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature and centrifugation for 1 min at 8000 g. DNA concentration and purity were measured using a NanoDrop ND-2000c (ThermoFisher Scientific). DNA methylation analysis was performed through enrichment of the methylated fraction of the genome by immunoprecipitation with an anti-methyl-cytosine antibody (MeDIP) []  followed by next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) []. MeDIP-seq is a validated method for determining DNA methylation that is widely used in epigenetic research  and shows excellent performance for genome coverage compared to equivalent methods []. The MeDIP procedure was carried out according to a protocol that was previously optimized in our laboratory using chicken DNA []. From each sample  4 µg DNA were used for the MeDIP capture. DNA was diluted in HO to a total volume of 8.0 µL  and sonicated at “high” setting for six 30-s intervals using a Bioruptor Standard sonicator (Diagenode). Samples were then run on a 2% agarose gel for confirmation of fragment lengths. Samples were cleaned from excessively long fragments using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen)  following the manufacturer’s instructions  and sample concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop ND-2000c (ThermoFisher Scientific). The sonicated DNA was diluted with 450 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl  pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA) and heat-denatured at 95 °C for 10 min  followed by cooling on ice for 5 min. To each sample  51 µL of 10× IP buffer (100 mM NaPhosphate  pH 7; 5 M NaCl  250 µL Triton-X 100) were added  followed by the addition of 10 µg of antibody (monoclonal mouse anti 5-methylcytosine (2 µg/µL)  5-mC  Diagenode). Then  samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating platform. Agarose beads (Protein A/G Plus-Agarose  Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were washed before use by centrifuging 50 µL of bead suspension in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for 2 min at 6000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and 1 mL of PBS-BSA 0.1% solution (1 mL 1× PBS<U+2009>+<U+2009>2 µL 50 mg/ml BSA) was added. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform and then centrifuged for 2 min at 6000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was subsequently removed  and the cleaning steps were repeated three more times. After cleaning  50 µL of 1× IP buffer were added to the washed beads  and the DNA-antibody mixture was transferred to the bead mixture. The solution was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The beads and captured DNA-antibodies were washed by centrifugation of the mixture for 2 min at 6000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and 1 mL of 1× IP buffer was added. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform  followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 6000 rpm and 4 °C  and removal of the supernatant. This procedure was repeated three times. To digest the beads  210 µL of digestion buffer and 20 µL of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL) were added  followed by incubation for 2 h at 55 °C on a rotating platform. The DNA was cleaned from the bead fragments by filtering through Pierce™ Spin Cups—Paper Filter (ThermoFisher Scientific) while centrifuging at max speed for 30 s. The flow-through was collected and 3 µL of glycogen (5 mg/mL) were added. DNA was precipitated by adding 20 µL of 5 M NaCl and 750 µL ethanol  both ice cold. The solution was mixed and incubated for 30 min on ice before centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed and samples dried in a heating block at 50 °C for 5 min. Samples were resuspended in 30 µL of HO and heated on a heating block at 50 °C for 5 min before measuring DNA concentrations on a Nanodrop. The DNA samples were then used for whole-genome amplification using a WGA2 kit (Sigma-Aldrich)  following the manufacturer’s instructions. WGA samples were cleaned using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions  and used for next-generation sequencing. The 12 samples of DNA that were extracted from hypothalamus tissue from six HRH and six LFH individuals and enriched for the methylated fraction were sequenced. Sequencing was performed on IonProton chips (Ion Torrent Systems  Inc) at the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI)  using the Ion Fragment Library kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data generated from the sequencing was processed using the Torrent Suite (version 5.0.2) software (ThermoFisher Scientific)  which is a complete analysis solution for Ion Torrent data that includes signal processing  base calling  trimming of low-quality reads  as well as alignment to a reference genome. After quality checks  the data were aligned to the Galgal4 chicken reference genome (International Chicken Genome Consortium). Two samples of DNA enriched for the methylated fraction were loaded per Ion PI chip. Thus  we used six chips for 12 samples. The raw sequencing data were uploaded to Array Express () under accession number E-MTAB-6407. Pairwise sample comparisons of methylated regions between selection groups  sexes or the interaction between sex and selection were performed in R (version 3.3.1) using edgeR  integrated in the Bioconductor (release 3.3) package MEDIPS []  by dividing the genome into 1-kb windows  starting at the first position on chromosome 1  and trimming away duplicated sequences. Benjamini–Hochberg correction via R’s p.adjust function was used to adjust for false discovery rate (FDR) in the multiple testing  with a cut-off of <U+2009><<U+2009>0.1 used for significance. The cut-off was used to detect changes in a larger number of windows  allowing for a better overview of the effects of selection. In order to validate the results  random resampling was performed by randomizing samples into two random groups of six samples each  regardless of HFH or LFH selection  and running the entire MEDIPS analysis as above. The randomized groups were balanced regarding sex  to avoid sex differences in the results. Twenty replicated runs were carried out. DM regions that covered an annotated gene region or its promoter  defined as starting 7.25 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site []  were included in the set of regions for functional analyses. The software WebGestalt2017 (updated 1/27/2017) was used for gene ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis on gene symbols obtained via Ensembl []. WebGestalt uses a hypergeometric distribution for significance estimation and combines it with Bonferroni–Hochberg adjustment of  values. All known chicken genes in the chicken genome from Ensembl were used as a base for enrichment analysis. In order to identify gene network modules that were over-represented in the DM regions  the web-based ConsensusPathDB tool was used [] with standard settings and allowing for intermediate nodes. A total of 430 million sequencing reads were generated  of which more than 99% were aligned to the chicken reference genome  resulting in a 9× genome coverage per sample. Each sample generated approximately 8.5 Gb of sequence data  with an average read length of 160 bp. A total of 990 000 windows were analyzed by edgeR  which covered 10.6 million CpGs in the chicken autosomal genome. By sorting windows by the estimated log-transformed fold change between the HFH and LFH lines  approximately 50% of all windows were found to have a negative fold change (i.e. more methylation in the LFH than HFH samples). Moreover  the distribution of CpGs in windows with positive or negative fold changes occurred in equal proportions  which indicated that there was no bias for CpG enrichment in either of the two selection groups (Table ). Using MEDIPS on sequence counts  51 048 significantly differentially methylated windows were detected at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.05  with only 22 that remained significant at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.1 adjusted by FDR (Fig.  and Table ). Nine of the 22 windows that displayed significant differential methylation were hypermethylated in the LFH group. The number of CpGs within the 1-kb windows ranged from 3 to 23  yielding a CpG density of less than 3 CpG/100 bp  which is in line with previous results obtained on somatic cells when analyzing transgenerational DM regions in response to environmental challenges in rats by MeDIP []. Manhattan plot of differentially-methylated (DM) windows between selection lines. All 990 000 windows were plotted with genomic location on the X-axis and negative log10  values on the Y-axis. The red horizontal line indicates the threshold for significantly DM windows at <U+2009><<U+2009>0.1 after FDR correction. Microchromosome labels were filtered out for readability The random resampling did not result in significantly differentially-methylated windows in any of the 20 replicates [see Additional file : Table S1]. Sex-specific effects on DNA methylation  estimated when comparing combined HFH/LFH females against HFH/LFH males  were much larger than the effects of selection. Comparison of DNA methylation patterns between sexes  with line excluded as a factor  revealed many differences  with over 2500 DM windows on the autosomes and almost 2000 on the sex chromosomes W and Z [see Additional file : Figure S1]. A more detailed analysis of the DM regions indicated that 79% of the windows were hypermethylated in males. Successive selection of HFH and LFH birds seemed to result in large sex-specific effects in DNA methylation differences  with 66 windows being DM between HFH and LFH females (FDR adjusted <U+2009><<U+2009>0.1) [see Additional file : Table S2]. Moreover  51 DM windows were identified between HFH and LFH males (FDR adjusted <U+2009><<U+2009>0.1). Comparison of DM windows identified within males and within females showed overlaps at only four windows  three of which were located on chromosome 7 and covered the expressed sequence tag (EST) Gga.15462  which was previously detected in testis mRNA in RJF and White Leghorn []. The methylation patterns for this EST region differed between selection lines and between sexes  i.e. it was highly methylated in HFH males and in LFH females. The fourth window was located on chromosome 1 in an intron of the  gene and was hypermethylated in HFH animals of both sexes. Genes from the 22 windows that showed significant DM between HFH and LFH animals were extracted via Ensembl and used for gene ontology (GO) and pathway (WebGestalt) analyses. Comparison of genes associated with the DM windows between the two lines showed enrichment for a number of terms  but not after FDR correction (Table ). The enriched terms were related to mitochondria  ion channel activity  ribosomes  and regulation of membrane potential. Due to the small size of the dataset  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis yielded no results. GO analysis of sex-specific line effects showed little overlap of enrichment in males compared to females but yielded terms related to DNA replication  the GABA receptor complex and chloride channel activity in males and terms related to transmembrane transporter activity  the synapse part  and neurotransmitter complex in females. We examined the overlap between the DM windows identified here and the genomic regions that included genes that were previously reported as differentially expressed (DE) in the hypothalamus between the same selection groups and generation []. Genomic regions located 7.25 kb upstream from DE transcripts were evaluated in order to include promoter regions []. No direct overlaps were detected between DM and DE regions  even when including DM regions with a fold change higher than 1.5 and <U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 before FDR correction. ConsensusPathDB analysis of these regions revealed that the DM genes  and  (Table ) were significantly connected with the DE genes  and  that were detected by Bélteky et al. [] through one intermediate node. DM windows within males and within females were also compared to previously reported DE genes  but neither sex showed any overlap between expression and methylation changes []. In this experiment  we studied the effects of bidirectional selection for tameness on the DNA methylome of the hypothalamus in RJF. After five generations of selection for high and low fear of humans  22 genomic regions with differential DNA methylation in the hypothalamus were detected. The DM regions targeted several genes with functions that may be related to previously reported phenotypic selection responses [  ]  such as metabolism and signaling. However  the number of significant windows before correcting for multiple-testing was much larger than 22 windows  with over 51 000 differently methylated windows observed at <U+2009>><U+2009>0.05. This large reduction in significant windows after correcting for FDR may indicate that extensive variation exists within the groups for methylation patterns in regions that are not strongly affected by the selection process. Such naturally occurring inter-individual variation has already been reported in humans []. Among the 22 DM windows  none overlapped with DE genes reported for the same tissue of birds from the same populations  which agrees with other studies on RJF and domesticated White Leghorn in which no overlap between DM promoters and gene expression of the same genes was observed. This suggests that other epigenetic mechanisms are involved in regulating gene expression []  or that DNA methylation changes in regions outside of promoter and gene regions  i.e. in intergenic regions  could affect transcription in a trans-acting fashion [  ]  or that the DM regions affect genes that are not activated by any pathways at the life stage studied here. Furthermore  gene expression may be affected primarily by methylation changes of single CpG sites within a CpG-dense region  which may not be detected by MeDIP-seq []. Although we observed no direct overlap between DM and DE genes  GO analysis of genes included in DM windows revealed functions similar to those of the DE genes in the same group of animals. Interestingly  some DM regions were related to behavioral and metabolic pathways. Further research should confirm whether and how these pathways are affected by selection for tameness. However  based on the genes targeted by the DM regions between HFH and LFH animals  we can derive some hints. For example   ()  which encodes a cytosolic cysteine protease that acts on signaling-related molecules and is involved in cell differentiation and proliferation []  was reported to interact with nuclear receptors and thus to impact metabolism []. Mutations in the gene - ()  which is involved in the control of neuronal excitability  can lead to speech impairment and intellectual disability in humans [  ]. The gene   which encodes a scaffold protein belonging to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and is active at postsynaptic sites  is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders  schizophrenia and cognition in humans [  ]. Downregulation of the mitochondrial gene  is reported to enhance degradation of damage mitochondria in human neurons  which is beneficial during neurological disorders []. The fact that several of the genes related to DM regions are associated with neuronal functions suggests that molecular mechanisms involved in the behavioral changes have emerged between HFH and LFH birds []. We compared the DM regions detected here with DM probes that were previously detected in the hypothalamus by Nätt et al. [] between RJF and the domesticated White Leghorn  in order to test whether the same genes with a modified methylation status were found in the current experiment and during the domestication of White Leghorn. We did not identify any common genes between these two selection processes  which could be explained by the fact that the driver of domestication of White Leghorn was mainly selection for egg size  while in our selection lines the main driver was tameness. This suggests that different selection pressures generate distinctive sets of epigenetic changes  which in turn are related to specific phenotypic traits. This concept can also apply to the transcriptome  since we observed no concordance between previously published DE genes from the same birds as those used in this study and DE genes observed in the hypothalamus of RJF and White Leghorn [  ]. A possible explanation for the lack of overlap between DM regions in the current and previous studies of the chicken hypothalamus is that the observed differences may be related to differential genetic drift in HFH and LFH populations []. However  previous studies on gene expression differences in the same populations  along with an unselected line of RJF  indicated that the expression changes that occurred between the parental generation and the fifth selected generations resulted from the imposed selection and not from genetic drift [  ]. These results  together with the random resampling performed in the current experiment  strengthen the argument that the epigenetic changes observed are a consequence of the artificial selection imposed within a rather short period of time (5 generations)  and not of genetic drift. In addition to the DM regions detected between the HFH and LFH lines in this experiment  we found numerous sex-specific changes  which are consistent with previously reported results []. However  in our study  differences were larger than observed previously  because it covered the entire genome  in contrast to only the promoter regions in a previous study that analyzed DNA methylation using promoter arrays []. The largest sex-specific DM regions were associated to the genes  on chromosome 1 and  on chromosome Z  which were both highly methylated in males. This large number of sex-specific differences in DNA-methylation suggests that the two sexes respond differently to selection pressures related to behavioral traits  in agreement with previous findings []  but raising some interesting questions about underlying mechanisms. An interesting finding was that many of these sex-specific DNA methylation changes are on autosomes  which suggests that DNA methylation of autosomes plays a more important role than expected in gender-specific characteristics in the brain of vertebrates. We detected 22 DM regions by comparing hypothalamic DNA from RJF selected during five generations for high versus low fear of humans. Functional annotation of the genes associated with these DM regions showed that they are related to  for example  cellular metabolism and neural signaling  similar to what was previously reported in terms of gene expression differences for the same animals. Our results suggest that bidirectional selection for tameness involves epigenetic factors that can even differ in a sex-specific manner. Observation of divergent DNA methylation patterns in the hypothalamus after only five generations of artificial selection highlights the importance of epigenetic mechanisms  in addition to genetic composition  in evolutionary phenotypic variation that emerges in response to selection pressures. Future research should delve into the molecular mechanism involved in the emergence of somatic epigenetic differences during selection. Two options could explain this. One is that epigenetic differences are linked to genetic differences emerging during selection  as suggested by Verhulst et al. []. Another possibility is that selection on phenotypes would concomitantly select specific germ line epigenomes. Different germ line epigenomes in divergent selection lines would then influence somatic epigenomes later on in the ontogeny of each individual. Interestingly  we detected several sex-specific epigenetic changes on the autosomes  which raises the question about whether epigenetic differences have a role in gender-specific behavioral responses that are unrelated to sex chromosomes.

Computational inefficiency challenges the direct use of test-day records for longitudinal GWAS with large datasets. We propose a rapid longitudinal GWAS method that is based on a random regression model. Our method uses Eigen decomposition of the phenotypic covariance matrix to rotate the data  thereby transforming the complex mixed linear model into weighted least squares analysis. We performed a simulation study that showed that our method can control type I errors well and has higher power than a longitudinal GWAS method that does not include time-varied additive genetic effects.

Our rapid method can control type I errors in the analysis of longitudinal data and can be applied to other longitudinal traits. We detected QTL that were for the most part similar to those reported in a previous study in Chinese Holstein. Moreover  six additional SNPs for fat percentage and 13 SNPs for protein percentage were identified by our method. These additional 19 SNPs could be new candidate quantitative trait nucleotides for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. Complex traits that require observations over multiple time points for the same individual are called longitudinal traits. A typical example are milk production traits in dairy cattle  which are usually measured once every month during the lactation period. Analysis of such data provides the opportunity to investigate the genetic control of dynamic processes []. In genome-wide associate studies (GWAS) of milk production traits in dairy cattle  multiple phenotypic measurements for each individual are transformed into a single measure  such as  305-day yield  an estimated breeding value (EBV) or a deregressed proof (DRP). Then  these pseudo-phenotypes are used as response variables in the GWAS statistical model [  ]. GWAS using raw phenotypes are considered as the “gold standard” []  and pseudo-phenotypes can result in reduced power or even inflate false positive rates (FPR) for the detection of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) []. Furthermore  longitudinal GWAS that directly uses multiple phenotypic measurements can model time-dependent QTN effects. Nevertheless  longitudinal GWAS has seldom received much attention. In our previous study []  we applied random regression models to longitudinal GWAS. Simulation and real data studies showed that the proposed methods based on longitudinal phenotypes outperformed GWAS methods that are based on pseudo-phenotypes  both regarding control of FPR and power of QTN detection. However  this method was computationally inefficient as the dimension of the mixed model equation increased and as the number of variance components to be estimated increased compared with the non-longitudinal GWAS model. It took about 10 days for the analysis of about 6000 individuals (about 50 000 phenotypic records) genotyped with 70 K SNPs even when a sparse pedigree-derived relationship matrix was used. The analysis could not be performed when a dense marker-based kinship matrix was used to reflect individual genetic relationships. Eigen decomposition of the kinship matrix is a useful tool that can be used to speed up GWAS analysis. It was first proposed by Kang et al. []  and later extended by Lippert et al. []  Zhou and Stephens [] and Xu []. Here  we applied the algorithm to longitudinal GWAS. The relationships between individuals and between continuous measures were removed through a transformation procedure  which involved rotation of the data and then the complex random regression model was transformed into a weighted least squares model for each SNP test. A series of simulation studies was carried out to evaluate the performance of our method. GWAS for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein were previously performed by Jiang et al. [] using EBV estimated from the first three parities. In this paper  our aim was to further validate the results from the new method through the analysis of actual observed test-day phenotypes for milk yield (MY)  fat percentage (FP) and protein percentage (PP) in the first three parities in a larger Chinese Holstein population. In addition  we validated the results of the new method by comparing the detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) for MY  FP and PP with the tens of thousands QTL from previous publications as stored in the QTLdb database []. The proposed method is based on a random regression model []  and an additional fixed regression term was incorporated to explain the time-dependent SNP effect: where  is the phenotypic value of individual  at time point ;  is the overall mean for the -th group at time  and cows calving in the same season and of similar age are in the same group;  is herd-test-date (HTD) effect;  is a genotype indicator for the -th SNP which is assigned 0  1 and 2 for genotype    and   respectively;  represents the time-dependent additive SNP effect;  and  are the time-dependent additive genetic effect and permanent environmental effect  respectively for individual ;  is the time-independent random residual for each measurement of individual  at time . Here       and  can be denoted as a set of Legendre polynomials or any other curve parameter (such as Wilmink polynomials []). where      and  are the orders of the corresponding polynomials;  is the value of the -th polynomial at time ;  and  is the -th fixed regression coefficient for time-dependent mean and additive SNP effect  respectively;  and  are the -th random regression coefficients for additive genetic effect and permanent environmental effect of individual . The model in matrix notation is: where  is the vector of test-day records;  is the vector of solutions for HTD and fixed regressions;  and  are the vectors of random regression coefficients for additive genetic effects and permanent environmental effects  respectively;    and  are the corresponding design matrices;  is the vector of random residuals. It is assumed that: where   is the marker-derived relationship matrix;  is the identity matrix;  is the Kronecker product;  is the variance–covariance matrix for random regression coefficients of additive polygenic effects;  is the variance–covariance matrix of random regression coefficients for permanent environmental effects;  is the residual variance.  was built with the method of VanRaden [] as follows: where  is the second allele at locus   and the -th column of matrix  is: Similar to the study of Kang et al. [] and Zhang et al. []  we initially estimated the variance components without including the SNP effect in the model  and then these estimates were applied in the model that examines whole-genome association effects of SNPs. With known variance components  the time-dependent additive genetic  permanent and phenotypic variances can be expressed as: The phenotypic variance–covariance matrix is: where   reflects the covariance relationship between individuals  while  reflects the covariance relationship between successive records of each individual. Now  we show how to transform these covariance matrices to diagonal matrices using Eigen decomposition. We define  and the Eigen decomposition for  is   where  is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues and  is the matrix of eigenvectors in the order of the corresponding eigenvalues. We rotate Eq. () with   and the mixed model can be rewritten as: where    and . The covariance matrix of rotated phenotypic values is: It should be noted that  and   then Let  with  being a diagonal matrix. Then  Eq. () can be solved by weighted least squares: From Eqs. () and ()   is the estimated value of fixed regression coefficients for additive SNP effects  and  the corresponding variance. Therefore  the Wald Chi squared test for time-dependent SNP effect is: The Bonferroni correction is used to control the rate of false-positive rates. Therefore  the threshold for genome-wide significance is 0.05/   where  is the effective number of SNPs which is calculated by PLINK software with the command “–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5”. This PLINK command produces a pruned subset of SNPs that are in approximate linkage equilibrium (LD) with each other through the application of the following steps: (1) it calculates LD between each pair of SNPs within a window of 50 SNPs; (2) it removes one SNP of a pair that has a LD greater than 0.2 until no such pairs remain; and (3) it shifts the window five SNPs forward and then repeats the procedure across the whole genome. The original study on the population of Chinese Holsteins consisted of 9615 genotyped animals and the detailed genotypic information is described in Ning et al. []. Three quantitative traits consisting of MY  FP and PP in the first three parities were analyzed in this study. The number of cows with more than five test day records in the three parities is in Fig. . The SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.03 and those that failed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test ( value<U+2009><<U+2009>10–6) were removed for each parity  resulting in 71 527 common SNPs for the subsequent longitudinal GWAS analyses. Number of dairy cows for the first three parities used in longitudinal GWAS We performed extensive simulations to compare systematically the performance of the models using two different curve parameters (Legendre polynomials and Wilmink polynomials). In order to evaluate our method  another model  developed by Das et al. [] that deals with human functional traits  was also included in our study. The latter model did not include time-varied additive polygenic effects  which was expected to inflate type I errors for the cow group with population structure and cryptic relatedness. Our simulation was similar to that described in the study of Yu et al. []. In order to assess the null distribution of different models  1000 random SNPs were tested for MY  FP and PP in the first parities. Under the expectation that random SNPs are unlinked to polymorphisms controlling these traits  the cumulative -value distribution follows a uniform distribution. We tested a simulation of statistical power by adding an additional time-varied genetic effect to observed phenotypes. The genetic effect for the first day (Day 5) was set to 10.0  and the genetic effect for the day after was simulated by adding a value sampled from a uniform distribution of . The simulated time-varied genetic effect is illustrated in Fig. . The cumulative effect was scaled to <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04  0.08  0.12  0.16 and 0.20 times the phenotypic standard deviation. The percentage () of the total phenotypic variation explained by this genetic effect can be estimated as: Time-varied simulated additive genetic effect for random SNPs where  is the allele frequency of each SNP. The genetic effect was assigned to 1000 random SNPs  one at a time  and each model was run to determine whether the effect could be detected with the empirical threshold (the 5th percentile of a null distribution). The variance components were estimated using the DMU package () and the longitudinal GWAS analyses were performed by a custom written Python script available at . The cumulative -value distribution of random SNPs are in Fig. a–c. Overall  the Legendre model showed good control of type I errors. The Legendre-NP model (Legendre model that does not include time-varied polygenic effects) should result in large type I errors. For PP  the Wilmink model had a convergence problem in the estimation of variance components  which resulted in a type I error with non-convergent variance component. The empirical power in Fig. d–f showed that Legendre and Wilmink models had similar adjusted power  but it greatly exceeded that of the Legendre-NP model. Cumulative -value distributions and empirical power of different models. – Cumulative -value distributions using random SNPs for MY  FP and PP. Under the assumption that random SNPs are unlinked to these traits  models that appropriately control for type I errors should show a uniform distribution of  values. – Empirical power of different models for MY  FP and PP. The empirical threshold was determined as the 5th percentile of a null distribution The additive genetic  permanent environmental and phenotypic variances across the lactation period for the first three parities are in Fig. . Additive genetic variances were higher at the beginning  then dropped sharply to the lowest point before day 50  and increased during the remaining lactation. Permanent environment and phenotypic variances share very similar pattern changes  since the former is the major component of the latter. These variances were higher at the beginning and decreased thereafter  and then a relatively long plateau occurred with the exception of a slight increase at the end of lactation for FP and PP. Furthermore  the variances increased from parity to parity. Time-dependent additive genetic (left)  permanent environmental (middle) and phenotypic (right) variances for MY (top)  FP (middle) and PP (bottom) across the lactation period We analyzed the MY  FP and PP for three parities with the Legendre model since it is able to control type I errors and showed good convergence in the estimation of variances for all traits. After running the PLINK software with the command “–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5”  45 573 pruned SNPs in approximate linkage equilibrium with each other were retained. Therefore  the significant threshold was 0.05/45 573<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.097E<U+2009>-<U+2009>6 after Bonferroni correction. In total  we detected 84 genome-wide significant SNPs by our method. The Manhattan plots of  in Fig.  reveals four peaks on respectively chromosomes 5  6  14 and 20  which influence milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. The peak on chromosome 14 influences all three traits  and the well-known  (-) gene  reported to be a major gene affecting milk production traits []  is located within this region. The detailed information of all significant SNPs for milk yield (MY)  fat percentage (FP) and protein percentage (PP) is provided in Table S1 [see Additional file : Table S1]  including their positions on the genome   values for the three parities  known genes within a 100-kb region around the SNP  and QTL ID for nearest QTL. We obtained QTL information from the animal QTLdb [] and only focused on the QTL that were identified by the association analysis method and had relatively narrow and accurate estimated intervals. The key findings are summarized as follows. Manhattan plots of –log() for MY (    )  FP (    ) and PP (    ) of the first (    )  second (    ) and third (    ) parities For milk yield (MY)  we found three significant SNPs for the first parity and none for the second and third parities. One of these SNPs is located within the  gene and all significant SNPs are within the reported QTL for MY. For fat percentage (FP)  65 significant SNPs were identified  of which  64 showed association in the first parity  while an additional SNP was identified for both the second and third parities. Furthermore  five of the 65 SNPs are located between 93.48 and 94.27 Mb on chromosome 5 and the others are within a 4.68-Mb segment (1.40–6.10 Mb) on chromosome 14. We mapped these significant SNPs to the animal QTLdb [] and discovered that 59 were located in the reported QTL for FP. The remaining SNPs were 16 to 107 kb away from the nearest reported QTL. For protein percentage (PP)  we identified 28 SNPs  of which 27 were identified for the second parity and an additional SNP identified for the first parity. Furthermore  nine SNPs are located between 1.65 and 2.06 Mb on chromosome 14 and 15 SNPs are clustered within a region between 31.93 and 34.82 Mb on chromosome 20. We found that 15 of the significant SNPs were within the regions that were previously reported to harbor QTL for PP  while the 13 remaining SNPs are 4 to 1.724 kb away from the nearest QTL. In total  65 of the 84 significant SNPs were within reported QTL regions. In order to evaluate whether the significant SNPs were located in a QTL region by chance  we conducted an enrichment study similar to the odds ratio method that is commonly used in case–control studies. According to the reported QTL for MY  FP and PP  the bovine whole genome was divided into QTL regions and non-QTL regions. The QTL regions occupied 6.25% of the genome (168 709 938 bp). Thus  among the 84 random SNPs  about five (84*6.25%) were located in QTL regions by chance. The enrichment coefficient was calculated as the number of significant SNPs per bp in a QTL region versus the number of significant SNPs per bp in a non-QTL region. The enrichment coefficient is 1 if the significant SNPs were randomly located across the whole genome. In our study  the enrichment coefficient was equal to 54.7 (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>2.2e-16). The time-varied effects of SNP ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939 (within the  gene region) for three traits in the first three parities are in Fig. . Alleles of this SNP are  and   with frequencies of 0.209 and 0.791  respectively. In our study  genotypes    and  were coded 0  1 and 2  respectively. In general  the time-varied effects for SNP ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939 shared very similar changing patterns in the three different parities. The genotype  with the highest frequency had a greater genotypic value compared to genotypes  and  for the MY trait  whereas the opposite was observed for the FP and PP traits. The time-varied effects of SNP ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939 (within the  region) for MY (left)  FP (middle)  and PP (right) in the first three parities Eigen decomposition could expedite longitudinal GWAS in theory and practice. From Eqs. () and ()  we can see that matrix multiplication between the inverse of the phenotypic covariance matrix () and the design matrix for fixed effects () has the largest impact on computational efficiency. Eigen decomposition can rotate the dense phenotypic covariance matrix into a diagonal matrix  and theoretical computational time can be improved approximately  times  where  is the total number of observed records. In practice  our method could complete the analysis in 1 day with known variance components on a Linux computer of 24 cores. However  only 50 SNP tests could be completed under these conditions. In this study  we performed longitudinal GWAS for three milk production traits in the first three parities of Chinese Holstein. To our knowledge  this is the first GWAS for milk production traits using test-day records as response variable. In addition  a marker-derived genomic relationship matrix was included to reflect the relationship between individuals. Compared with the pedigree-based relationship matrix  which was used in previous studies [  ]  the marker-derived genomic relationship matrix is more precise for specifying the actual relationships between individuals. For example  differences among full siblings cannot be distinguished with the pedigree-based compared to the marker-derived genomic relationship matrix. However  a dense marker-derived matrix usually results in a strong increase in computational burden. Several effective methods [    ] have been proposed to overcome this problem for non-longitudinal traits    one record per individual. Here  we expanded the Eigen decomposition technique to longitudinal GWAS  and the analysis could be completed within 1 day for each trait with known variances. Several studies have reported that additive genetic  permanent environmental and phenotypic variances for milk production traits in dairy cattle vary with days in milk. Strabel et al. [] reported the general patterns for the three variances in Polish Black and White cattle and showed that they were higher at the two extremes of lactation and lower in the middle part. Zavadilova et al. [] reported a similar dynamic pattern in Czech Holstein cattle. However  El Faro et al. [] showed that the estimated variances decreased continuously during the first lactation for Brazilian Caracu heifers  while Gebreyohannes et al. [] observed a continuous increase in an Ethiopian dairy cattle population. In spite of these different results for various dairy cattle populations  the overall dynamic pattern reveals that the expression of genes and the influence of environment on phenotype are time-dependent. Acknowledging this fact and analyzing the data with dynamic models will help to better understand the genetic control of longitudinal traits. Here  we presented the advantage of the Eigen decomposition approach for dealing with longitudinal GWAS for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. The longitudinal GWAS method can be also applied to other kinds of longitudinal data  such as daily gain in pig and egg weight in chicken. Furthermore  Eigen decomposition can be generalized to different linear mixed models. For a GWAS model with only one variance component other than the error variance  we can expedite the speed of the estimation of variance components to enhance the computational efficiency as in EMMA (efficient mixed-model association) []. If we include additional variance components  such as non-additive genetic variances and permanent environmental variance  into the GWAS model  a two-step strategy as described in our study can be used. First  the variance components are estimated only once in the model not including the SNP effect  and second Eigen decomposition of merged variances other than independent error variances is applied to improve the performance of GWAS in a more general way. Biological curve parameters of Wilmink polynomials can also be used in the longitudinal analysis of milk production traits []. However  the Wilmink model can result in a convergence problem in the estimation of variance components due to higher correlations between the estimated regression coefficients. Legendre polynomials can reduce the correlations and make no assumption about the shape of the curve; therefore  they are popular in dairy cattle breeding [  ]. The orders of Legendre polynomials will influence the performance of our longitudinal GWAS model. Akaike information criterion (AIC) or cross-validation are usually used to determine the orders of these functions in other longitudinal studies [  ]. However  it is computationally expensive to estimate the variances of a random regression model with a dense marker-derived genomic relationship matrix. In this study  we applied fourth-order Legendre polynomials to all time-dependent effects  which is preferred in genetic evaluation methods for dairy cattle [  ]. The simulation study based on the real dairy cattle dataset indicated that our longitudinal GWAS model with fourth-order Legendre polynomials could control the type I error in our study population. However  this is not a universal principle  and the optimal orders of the Legendre polynomials should be estimated for other longitudinal data. Jiang et al. [] performed GWAS for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein using EBV for 2093 cows that were estimated based on a multiple trait random regression test-day model. In general  our method identified fewer significant SNPs for the corresponding traits. In addition to different statistical methods  the main reason is that the marker-derived genomic relationship matrix was used to further control the type I error. Furthermore  the fact that similar and narrower peak regions were obtained in our study compared to the previous one [] validates this method and indicates that it could be a more accurate approach for future studies. We identified 84 significant SNPs for three traits  of which 65 were located within known QTL regions. Among the remaining SNPs  six significant associations for FP were located within 110 kb of QTL reported by Lehnert et al. []  and this region can represent a new potential QTL for FP. Thirteen additional SNPs for PP were 4 to 1724 kb away from the nearest QTL  and we extended the QTL region for PP. In summary  we propose a rapid GWAS method for longitudinal data. In a situation where variances are known  the GWA analysis could be completed within one day for thousands of individuals with tens of thousands of records genotyped with the 70 K chip. We applied our method to the analysis of milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. The performance with simulation and real data showed that our method could control the type I error. We located 84 significant SNPs by our methods of which 65 were within reported QTL regions. Nineteen new SNPs were identified  which could be new candidate QTN for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. Wu R  Lin M.

Genetic differences exist for changes in feeding behaviour induced by elevated ambient temperatures in grow-finish pigs. Selection for heat-tolerant grow-finish pigs should improve production efficiency during warm months in commercial production. Genetic variation in heat shock  stress response and immune function genes may be responsible for the observed differences in performance during heat stress events. Heat stress is a major economic concern in the swine industry. In the USA  economic losses due to heat stress are estimated at $300 million per year  of which a majority occur during the grow-finish phase []. Production losses due to heat stress result from decreased growth of market hogs  reduced feed intake  and mortality [  ]. Swine feeding behavioural patterns change as temperature increases. Pigs spend less time eating and more time lying down during high temperatures [  ] and change eating behaviour  mealtime  and meal size [  ]. Nienaber et al. [] showed that reducing meal size and the number of meals per day can reduce the effects of high temperatures on heat production by decreasing physical and metabolic activity. Although there have been several advances in production management and barn cooling systems  production efficiency continues to suffer during warm months. Pigs have a thermal comfort zone in which they are most productive  which depends on several factors  including sex  genetics  relative humidity  and velocity of ambient air [  ]. Genetic selection for increased growth is associated with a decrease in a pig’s ability to handle heat stress []. Thus  genetic markers that are associated with heat stress could be used to select for and breed more heat-resilient pigs. The objective of this study was to identify genetic markers associated with changes in feeding behaviour due to heat stress in grow-finish pigs. All animal protocols conformed to procedures outlined in the  [] and were approved by the USMARC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Phenotypic data were collected on grow-finish pigs (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1648)  which were reared at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center from July 2011 to March 2016. Pigs were placed in a barn in grow-finish groups (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>7) of approximately 240 pigs at 8 to 10 weeks of age. Barrows and gilts were mixed and distributed into six pens  with 39 to 40 pigs per pen. Three sire lines  Duroc  Landrace  and Yorkshire  were represented and all dams were from a Landrace–Yorkshire composite population. On average  within a grow-finish group there were 6.2 full-sibs and 25.9 paternal half-sibs represented. Animals were tagged with a low-frequency electronic identification tag upon entry into the grow-finish barn. Pens were fitted with an electronic feeding system that monitored feeding behaviour  as described by Brown-Brandl et al. []. Briefly  each pen had one feeder with five slots  allowing up to five animals to eat at any given time. Pigs were provided ad libitum access to a corn-soybean meal diet that was designed to meet or exceed an animal’s nutrient requirements. Each feeder slot was fitted with an antenna and a multiplexer. Every 20 s  the device determined which pigs are located at the feeder and then recorded animal number  feeder position and time  which will be referred to as ‘RFID pings’ hereafter. Data were collected over a 4-month period for each group of pigs. Each hour  the temperature humidity index (THI) was calculated [] using outside temperature (°C) and relative humidity (RH) as: Days were classified into THI categories based on the maximum THI  as outlined by Brown-Brandl et al. []. THI categories included “Normal” (<<U+2009>23.33 °C)  “Alert” (23.33 °C<U+2009>=<U+2009>×<U+2009><<U+2009>26.11 °C)  “Danger” (26.11 °C<U+2009>=<U+2009>×<U+2009><<U+2009>28.88 °C)  and “Emergency” (=<U+2009>28.88 °C). It should be noted that not all animals experienced every THI category. Only 949 animals experienced a THI greater than Normal. For each animal  the total number of RFID pings was computed for each day  and the average number of RFID pings per day was computed for each THI category. Similarly  the average number of RFID pings per day was computed for each breed by sex combination for each THI category. The difference between an animal’s average number of RFID pings in a specific THI category and the corresponding breed-sex mean was computed and standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each THI category. Differences in feeding behaviour between two THI categories (e.g. Alert-Normal) were quantified by calculating the difference in standardized RFID pings between the two categories. Therefore  if an animal experienced all four THI categories during the finishing phase  four standardized THI feeding behaviour values were computed  which reflected how this animal’s behaviour deviated from that of a typical animal of this breed type and sex  and six values were computed that indicated how it responded to different temperatures relative to its breed type-sex contemporaries. Not all animals experienced all four THI categories during grow-finish and loss of electronic tags resulted in varying numbers of animals with data for each comparison. It was assumed that animals that reduced their feeding activity more than their breed type-sex contemporaries as the THI category increased  were more affected by heat stress. Phenotypic correlations among the six traits analysed are in Table . Tail samples were collected on all pigs and stored at -<U+2009>20 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted using the WIZARD genomic DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega Corp.  Madison  WI  USA). Genotyping was conducted using three platforms: the NeoGen Porcine GGPHD chip (GeneSeek  Lansing  USA)  the Illumina Porcine SNP60 V2 chip (Illumina  Inc.  San Diego  USA)  and the NeoGen GGP-Porcine chip (GeneSeek  Lansing  USA). Quality control involved filtering out genotypes that had a minor allele frequency lower than 5% and that did not have a unique map position in the Sscrofa10.2 genome assembly []. After quality control  58 096 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the GGPHD chip  38 598 SNPs from the Porcine SNP60 V2 chip  and 6882 SNPs from the GGP-Porcine chip were retained for use in subsequent analyses. In total  1118 pigs were genotyped using the GGPHD chip  two pigs were genotyped using the SNP60 V2 chip  and 34 pigs were genotyped using the GGP-Porcine chip. Genotypes for animals genotyped on the Porcine SNP60 V2 chip and GGP-Porcine chip were imputed to the NeoGen Porcine GGPHD chip (number of SNPs<U+2009>=<U+2009>58 096) by pedigree imputation using FImpute v2.2 []. Each of the six traits (difference between the standardized feeding behaviour of two THI categories) was analysed using a mixed linear model with sex  sire breed  and contemporary group as fixed effects. Contemporary group was the combined effect of farrowing group and pen. Two farrowing groups (year–week of birth) were represented in each grow-finish group and the barn contained six pens. Although phenotypes were deviations from the animal’s sex and breed of sire means  breed of sire and sex were included as fixed effects to account for population stratification that may be present in the genotypic data. Genomic regions associated with each trait were identified and quantified using a Bayes-C variable selection method and GenSel software [] based on the following modified statistical model []: where  is a vector of trait phenotypes (differences in feeding behavior between two THI categories)   is an incidence matrix of fixed effects ()   is a matrix of SNP genotypes with non-zero effects (proportion determined as 1<U+2009>-<U+2009>p) that were fitted as random effects () distributed N (0  )  and  is a vector of random residual effects assumed to be normally distributed N (0  ). Priors for genetic and residual variances and the prior proportion of SNPs that are assumed to have no effect on the trait within an iteration of the Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) (p) for each trait were obtained by running Bayes-Cp using GenSel [] with the same model as described above. Priors used for Bayes-Cp analyses were the same for all THI category comparisons and were 0.98  0.10 and 0.10 for p  genetic variance and residual variance  respectively. These analyses were run for a minimum of 8100 iterations  with the first 100 discarded as burn-in. Plots of p over iterations were evaluated to determine if additional iterations were necessary to obtain a converged estimate. Resulting values for p used in Bayes-C analyses are in Table . For the Bayes-C analyses  a chain of 41 000 iterations was used  with the first 1000 cycles discarded as burn-in. Effects were sampled every 40 iterations to obtain a posterior distribution for the genetic variance. Genomic regions associated with each trait were identified using 1-Mb genome windows following Wolc et al. []. The standard deviation of marker-based estimates of heritability was calculated as the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the last 100 samples. Genes located in 1-Mb windows explaining more than 1.0% of the genomic variance were obtained using the NCBI annotation of Sscrofa10.2 (Release 104). Two gene lists were analysed. The first contained genes located in all 1-Mb windows that were detected in the six traits. The second list only included genes located in 1-Mb windows that explained more than 3.0% of the genomic variance for at least one trait. For the latter list  if two adjacent windows exceeded 3.0% of the genomic variance  then only the 1-Mb region with the greatest estimated effect was included in the analysis. The PANTHER classification system (version 12.0; ) [] was used to determine the functions of genes in these lists. Enrichment analysis of gene function was performed using PANTHER’s implementation of the binomial test of overrepresentation []  which determines whether the list of genes contains more genes involved in a particular pathway or function than would be expected at random at a Bonferroni corrected  value less than 0.05. Significance of gene ontology (GO) terms was assessed using the default Ensembl  GO annotation as background for the enrichment analysis. Of the 1648 grow-finish pigs (727 barrows and 921 gilts) analyzed in this study  309 were Duroc sired  786 were Landrace sired  and 553 were Yorkshire sired. In all three sire breeds  feeding activity of barrows  as determined by the average number of RFID pings per day  exceeded that of gilts for all THI categories (Table ). Yorkshire and Duroc sired pigs had greater feeding activity than Landrace sired pigs across all THI categories (Table ). For Yorkshire and Duroc sired pigs  feeding activity increased as THI increased  while the opposite trend was observed for Landrace sired pigs. Estimates of heritability from the Bayes-C analyses of GenSel for each THI category comparison are in Table  and details for each 1-Mb window that explained more than 1% of the genomic variance are in Table . Changes in behaviour between Normal and Alert THI categories showed a modest heritability of 0.14 (±<U+2009>0.04)  with more than 58% of the genomic variance explained by 17 regions on nine chromosomes. Five regions on  (SSC) chromosome 5 accounted for 24.9% of genomic variance and SSC13 had four regions that accounted for 8.9% of the genomic variance. SSC7 and 17 each had two regions that jointly accounted for 6.0 and 7.4% of the genomic variance  respectively. Feeding behaviour changes between Normal and Danger THI had the highest estimate of heritability (0.21<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04). Over 40% of the genomic variance was explained by 13 regions on six chromosomes. Four regions on SSC7 jointly accounted for 16.5% of the genomic variance  while SSC1 had three regions that jointly accounted for 7.1% of the genomic variance. The estimate of heritability for the Normal-Emergency comparison was considerably lower (0.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04)  with approximately 30% of genomic variance explained by 13 regions on nine chromosomes. Regions on SSC14 and 12 accounted for the highest percentage of genomic variance (10.1 and 7.3%  respectively). The estimate of heritability for changes in feeding behaviour between the Alert and Danger categories was similar to that for the Normal-Emergency categories (0.07<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03) and 72% of the genomic variance was explained by regions on five chromosomes. SSC1 had six regions that jointly explained 43.8% of the genomic variance and SSC7 had three regions that jointly explained 21.5% of the genomic variance. The estimate of heritability for the Alert-Emergency THI comparison was 0.04<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 and 23% of the genomic variance was explained by six regions on four chromosomes. SSC14 had three regions that jointly accounted for 18.7% of the genomic variance. Almost 8% of the genomic variance was explained by four regions on separate chromosomes for the Danger-Emergency THI comparison. SSC14 explained the largest proportion of genomic variance (4.2%). The estimate of heritability for this comparison (0.02<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03) was the lowest of the six THI comparisons. The PANTHER classification system was used to analyse over-representation of GO terms for the list of genes that were located in significant genomic regions for all six traits  as well as for a shorter list of genes from regions that explained more than 3.0% of the genomic variance. Several significant biological process and molecular function GO terms were over-represented in the full list of genes (Table ). The most significant molecular functions were “Type I interferon receptor binding” and “Cytokine activity”. Most of the 39 over-represented biological process terms were related to immune function  both innate and acquired. The most significant biological process identified was “Positive regulation of peptidyl-serine phosphorylation of STAT protein”. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family regulates both type I and type II interferon receptors  immune function and cell proliferation. PANTHER analysis of genes located in regions associated with more than 3.0% of the genomic variance identified only two significantly over-represented molecular function terms (Table )  “Glutathione transferase activity” and “Transferase activity  transferring alkyl or aryl (other than methyl) groups”. Environmental temperature affects feeding behaviour of pigs. In this study  THI was computed using outdoor temperature  but ideally  barn temperatures should be used. Although barn temperatures were collected using thermometers located at each end of the barn  for some groups of pigs there were numerous missing data points due to thermometer failure and other technical issues. Thus  THI from an on-site weather station was found to be a good predictor of barn temperature (adjusted R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.85; Fig. ). Temperature-humidity index (THI; °C) versus average barn temperature (°C) using a 3rd degree polynomial regression across all time periods when both measures were available In this study  barrows from all three sire breeds had higher average daily RFID pings than gilts for each THI category. This is consistent with Brown-Brandl et al. []  who reported that barrows spent more time at feeders than gilts. However  in a different study  Hyun et al. [] reported no difference in time spent at feeders between sexes. In the study of Hyun et al. []  the electronic feeding system allowed only one pig to eat at a time  while Brown-Brandl et al. [] used an electronic feeding system like the one used here  consisting of one feeder with five feeding spaces. Current production systems use multi-space feeders since they are cost-effective and reduce negative social interactions during feeding. An interesting observation in the current study was that the difference in feeding activity between barrows and gilts increased with increasing temperatures for all sire breed by THI categories except Landrace sired pigs in the Emergency category. Thus  the observed difference in feeding activity between barrows and gilts may be due to competition for space or differences in how each sex handles heat stress. We found that the impact of heat stress on feeding behaviour differs between breeds. Feeding activity of Duroc and Yorkshire sired pigs increased as THI increased  while that of Landrace sired pigs decreased as THI increased. Several approaches have been used to determine a pig’s ability to handle stressful situations. To test how a pig copes with a perceived stressful situation  the back test has been used  in which piglets are placed on their backs and time until first struggle or time spent struggling is recorded [   ]. Time until first struggle is greater for animals that are calmer and that are capable of handling stressful situations better. Rohrer et al. [] showed that time until first struggle during the back test is positively genetically correlated with number of meals per day and negatively genetically correlated with average meal length. As THI increased  Landrace sired pigs spent less time at the feeder  which suggests that the Landrace sired pigs were less able to handle stressful situations  heat stress in particular  or have a lower thermal comfort zone than Duroc and Yorkshire sired pigs. Hence  differences in heat tolerance can be observed through changes in feeding activity in grow-finish pigs when exposed to increased temperatures. Several regions were identified in multiple THI category comparisons. One interesting comparison is how animals cope with the most extreme heat  i.e. Emergency THI. These comparisons had low estimates of heritability and typically detected few 1-Mb regions  which could reflect that all animals were considerably stressed during Emergency THI regardless of their genetic background. It should be noted that fewer animals experienced Emergency THI  so these analyses had fewer observations and a reduced power to detect associations. There were three regions (defined as chromosome_position in Mb) that were the same (SSC1_15  SSC12_12  and SSC14_11) for the traits including Emergency THI. Similar results should be expected as phenotypic correlations among these traits were relatively high  ranging from 0.80 to 0.94 (Table ). The SSC14_11 region explained a large portion of the genomic variance in each of the analyses: 8.3  9.8  and 4.2% for the comparison of the Emergency THI category to the Normal  Alert  and Danger THI categories  respectively. This region contains the  gene  which is involved in the release of neural peptides from sensory neurons when stimulated []. A second possible candidate is the  gene  which encodes an adrenergic receptor associated with response to stress hormones such as adrenaline and epinephrine []. The SSC12_12 region contains two genes that are associated with blood flow ( and )  which may be interesting candidates for study. Once nerves detect an increase in heat  a signal is sent to the hypothalamus that causes warmth-sensitive neurons to trigger a heat-loss reflex by either vasoconstriction or behavioural mechanisms []. Moran et al. [] postulated that one critical component to thermal tolerance is an individual’s ability to direct greater blood flow to the skin for heat dissipation. Unlike most other mammals  pigs have a limited capacity to use water evaporation to lose heat []  so dissipation of heat through skin is critical to their thermal regulation. A second interesting comparison is how animals change their behaviour when temperatures exceed Normal values. In these comparisons  estimates of heritability were moderate and more regions of interest were detected than in analyses comparing the three levels of heat stress (Alert  Danger and Emergency). Phenotypic correlations among these three traits were also high (range 0.68–0.88; Table ) but not as high as the correlations with traits associated with Emergency THI. Six similar regions were identified in comparisons to the Normal category (SSC5_109  SSC6_15  SSC7_53  SSC10_44  SSC13_17 and SSCX_3). The SSC 7_53 region was detected in two of the three comparisons to Normal (Normal-Alert  and Normal-Danger) as well as the comparison of Alert-Danger and each association explained a relatively large amount of the genomic variance (4.8  13.2 and 10.3%  respectively). Evaluation of this region identified a heat shock protein gene ()  which is located at 53.2 Mb. Heat shock proteins protect cells from stressors []. The  gene was shown to be expressed at higher levels after heat stress in chicken testes [] and in several tissues in heat stressed rats [] than in unstressed control animals. This region also contains members of the acetylcholine receptor subunit family. Two of these genes   and   form a complex that activates POMC neurons  which stimulate  and regulate eating behaviour []. Thus  these three genes (    and ) warrant further investigation. A potential candidate gene for the SSCX_3 region is   which is expressed in the brain. A mouse model in which this gene is knocked out showed that null mice had deficits in social interactions and communication with other mice []. An expanded region on SSC7 between 44 and 45 Mb  which was identified in the comparisons of Normal THI with the Alert and Danger categories  contains two heat shock protein genes   and   located at 45.1 Mb. The  gene encodes an inducible protein expressed during cellular stress that is more highly expressed in the testes of heat-stressed chickens [] than in control birds. Polymorphisms in the  gene have been associated with adaptation to thermal conditions in sheep []  while polymorphisms in the  gene have been associated with heat tolerance in cattle []. In order to gain a better biological insight into the genetic mechanisms that control heat tolerance in pigs  an enrichment analysis of gene function was performed using PANTHER. The most over-represented biological processes were related to the immune system. Several reports have also associated immune function genes with an animal’s response to heat stress. Moran et al. [] summarized that an animal’s heat response cascade included three components beginning with heat shock proteins  followed by expression of interferon-inducible genes and concluding with small non-specific stress responses of specific cell lines. Islam et al. [] found greater expression of inflammatory cytokines after exposure to heat stress in mice that were intolerant to heat relative to mice that were determined to be heat tolerant. Altered white blood cell counts and antibody production due to heat stress have also been documented [] in poultry. Therefore  selection of immune function genes residing in the regions identified in this study warrant further investigation. At the cellular level  heat stress disrupts normal folding of newly synthesized proteins []  which then are not recognized as a native protein and will be targeted for degradation. The glutathione transferase pathway breaks down molecules  which are recognized as potential toxins or foreign material  and Stallings et al. [] showed that genes in this pathway are upregulated during heat stress. We observed that the glutathione transferase molecular function was significantly over-represented in regions detected in both PANTHER analyses (Tables  and ) confirming the importance of the glutathione transferase pathway as one of an animal’s biological mechanisms to cope with elevated temperatures. Changes in feeding activity are indicative of response to heat stress in grow-finish pigs. Individual differences in tolerance to heat have been identified in mice []  man []  and in pigs (current study) and our results show that thermal tolerance in pigs is heritable. Genes involved in immune response and function were among those over-represented in the regions associated with changes in feeding activity between different THI categories. Candidate genes identified in this work  including heat shock proteins and stress response  merit further investigation and may facilitate genetic selection for improved grow-finish performance during heat stress events. Selection for heat-tolerant grow-finish pigs would increase production efficiency. St-Pierre NR  Cobanov B  Schnitkey G. Economic losses from heat stress by US livestock industries.

The aim of this study was to develop a multivariate Bayesian approach that could be used for simultaneously elucidating genetic architecture  QTL mapping  and genomic prediction. Our approach uses information from multiple traits to divide markers into ‘unassociated’ (no association with any trait) and ‘associated’ (associated with one or more traits). The effect of associated markers is estimated independently for each trait to avoid the assumption that QTL effects follow a multi-variate normal distribution.ResultsUsing simulated data  our multivariate method (BayesMV) detected a larger number of true QTL (with a posterior probability > 0.9) and increased the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to an equivalent univariate method (BayesR). With real data  accuracies of genomic prediction in validation sets for milk yield traits with high-density genotypes were approximately equal to those from equivalent single-trait methods. BayesMV tended to select a similar number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per trait for genomic prediction compared to BayesR (i.e. those with non-zero effects)  but BayesR selected different sets of SNPs for each trait  whereas BayesMV selected a common set of SNPs across traits. Despite these two dramatically different estimates of genetic architecture (i.e. different SNPs affecting each trait vs. pleiotropic SNPs)  both models indicated that 3000 to 4000 SNPs are associated with a trait. The BayesMV approach may be advantageous when the aim is to develop a low-density SNP chip that works well for a number of traits. SNPs for milk yield traits identified by BayesMV and BayesR were also found to be associated with detailed milk composition.ConclusionsThe BayesMV method simultaneously estimates the proportion of SNPs that are associated with a combination of traits.

The aim of this study was to develop a multivariate Bayesian approach that could be used for simultaneously elucidating genetic architecture  QTL mapping  and genomic prediction. Our approach uses information from multiple traits to divide markers into ‘unassociated’ (no association with any trait) and ‘associated’ (associated with one or more traits). The effect of associated markers is estimated independently for each trait to avoid the assumption that QTL effects follow a multi-variate normal distribution. Using simulated data  our multivariate method (BayesMV) detected a larger number of true QTL (with a posterior probability > 0.9) and increased the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to an equivalent univariate method (BayesR). With real data  accuracies of genomic prediction in validation sets for milk yield traits with high-density genotypes were approximately equal to those from equivalent single-trait methods. BayesMV tended to select a similar number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per trait for genomic prediction compared to BayesR (i.e. those with non-zero effects)  but BayesR selected different sets of SNPs for each trait  whereas BayesMV selected a common set of SNPs across traits. Despite these two dramatically different estimates of genetic architecture (i.e. different SNPs affecting each trait vs. pleiotropic SNPs)  both models indicated that 3000 to 4000 SNPs are associated with a trait. The BayesMV approach may be advantageous when the aim is to develop a low-density SNP chip that works well for a number of traits. SNPs for milk yield traits identified by BayesMV and BayesR were also found to be associated with detailed milk composition. The BayesMV method simultaneously estimates the proportion of SNPs that are associated with a combination of traits. When applied to milk production traits  most of the identified SNPs were associated with all three traits (milk  fat and protein yield). BayesMV aims at exploiting pleiotropic QTL and selects a small number of SNPs that could be used to predict multiple traits. Understanding the genetics of quantitative or complex traits has been revolutionized by the availability of dense panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cover the genome. Data on SNP genotypes combined with phenotypic measurements have been used for three purposes: to study the genetic architecture of quantitative traits  to map regions of the genome that cause variation in these traits (quantitative trait loci or QTL) and to predict the genetic or breeding values of individuals for quantitative traits. Although different statistical methods are commonly used for these three purposes  we have argued that a non-linear Bayesian method that fits all SNPs simultaneously can be used for all three aims [  ]. For example  BayesR makes across-breed predictions of breeding values and maps QTL more accurately than genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) []. QTL often affect more than one trait [  ] but most methods that are applied to analyze SNP data use only one trait at a time. Multivariate analyses have been found to increase power to detect and map QTL [] and increase the accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV) []. For instance  QTL mapping is frequently performed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by single-SNP regression  in which the effect of one SNP at a time on the trait is tested. Multiple-trait versions of single-SNP regression have been implemented in various studies e.g. [  ]. Multi-trait EBV are frequently calculated from pedigree data or from SNP genotypes using BLUP  and sometimes have a higher accuracy compared to single-trait EBV [  ]. In dairy cattle  multi-trait genomic prediction models using multi-breed populations (i.e. where a trait measured in different breeds is treated as multiple traits) have been attempted in several studies to account for between-breed differences in QTL effects but with limited success [    ]. The focus of our paper is the development of a Bayesian multi-trait genomic prediction method for multiple different traits. Jia and Jannink [] and Calus and Veerkamp [] have described non-linear Bayesian methods for the analysis of high-density SNP data on multiple traits. However  these methods assume that the effects of a QTL on different traits are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with the same correlation for all QTL  which may be incorrect. For instance  an allele of the gene  (-) increases milk yield but decreases milk fat yield in spite of a positive overall genetic correlation between milk and fat yields []. Kemper et al. [] reported numerous similar cases where the pattern of effects of QTL on traits varied  while the overall genetic correlation between milk traits was positive. Some QTL may also affect two traits although there is a weak genetic correlation between the traits. Thus  the assumption of multivariate normality may be too strong. The aim of our study was to develop a multivariate version of BayesR that uses multiple trait data to decide which SNPs should be included in the model but allows flexibility in the estimation of the effect of the selected SNPs on each of the traits analyzed by estimating the effect of selected SNPs independently for each trait. The hypothesis under investigation is that multi-trait information will improve accuracies of genomic prediction. We illustrate the method by applying it to simulated data for QTL mapping and genomic prediction  and to real data on milk  fat and protein yields from dairy cattle. The available dairy cattle dataset had over 16 000 records on Holstein and Jersey cattle from a previous study []. The reference population consisted of up to 11 527 Holstein and 4687 Jersey animals  while the validation dataset (used to evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions) consisted of phenotype records for up to 262 Holstein bulls  105 Jersey bulls  and 361 Australian Red (bull and cow) cattle (Table ). Australian red cattle were never included in the reference population  so validation for these animals represents across-breed prediction. Australian red cattle are more closely related to Holstein than to Jersey cattle  as detailed in “”. Phenotypes are three yield traits (fat  milk and protein yield  i.e. FY  MY and PY  respectively) supplied as either daughter-trait deviations (for males) or trait-deviations (for females) from the Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme []. Heterogeneous error variances in the phenotypes were accounted for by using a weighted analysis  using the weighting procedure outlined by Garrick et al. [] and described in detail for this dataset by Kemper et al. []. Trait heritabilities and phenotypic and genetic correlations between traits were estimated using the relationship matrix constructed from pedigree data using ASReml []. All animals had real or imputed genotypes for 632 002 SNPs from the bovine HD array [  ]. Full details of the imputation and quality control procedures for genotypes are described in [] but they include removal of SNPs with very poor imputation accuracy and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (less than 10 copies in the dataset). GWAS summary statistics (i.e. allele name  allele effect and standard deviation) were available from a previous study [] which used a subset of Holstein cows (N = 444) from this dataset. These statistics were for detailed milk phenotypes and we used them to verify QTL that were identified using the Bayesian approaches. Additive QTL were simulated on real dairy cattle genotypes for a single chromosome to illustrate the impact of the multi-trait method on (1) the accuracy of genomic predictions  (2) the ability to elucidate genetic architecture and (3) the power of QTL mapping. In the simulation  genotypes consisted of 12 745 SNPs from  autosome 29 (BTA29) for 3049 Holstein animals from the larger reference dataset described above. Simulations involved two traits with 10 QTL per trait  two scenarios with a different number of pleiotropic QTL and 20 replicates for each scenario. In scenario 1  there were no pleiotropic QTL (pQTL = 0) and 20 SNPs were randomly selected as QTL with effects on either trait 1 or trait 2  separately for each replicate. In scenario 2  all QTL had pleiotropic effects (pQTL = 1) and thus  10 SNPs were randomly selected for each replicate to have effects on both traits. All SNPs chosen as QTL had a minor allele frequency higher than 0.01. Additive QTL effects explained 0.01 of the phenotypic variance () and were calculated for each chosen SNP as   where  is the allele frequency of the SNP  and were randomly allocated to have either positive or negative effects on the trait. Thus  the heritability of the traits was 0.10. The error co-variance between traits was zero. Method BayesMV (described later) requires uncorrelated residual errors. Thus  we used a principal component analysis to form linear combinations of the three milk yield traits to create new traits with zero error covariance. A principal component decomposition was conducted on the error correlation matrix (  a  ×  matrix where  = number of traits) from the pedigree-based multivariate analysis in ASReml [] [see Additional file : Table S1]. Then   where  is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and  is a  ×  matrix of eigenvectors. The linear combinations () of traits were constructed by   where  is a diagonal matrix of error standard deviations and  is the vector of phenotypes. The genetic variance of the linear combinations is   where  is the genetic variance–covariance matrix. Estimated breeding values for the original traits were constructed for an individual as   where  is the vector of EBV for the linear combination traits. The model fitted to the data for both BayesR and BayesMV had the general form   where  is the vector of phenotypes (i.e. for the linear combination of traits)   is a vector of fixed effects   is a vector of polygenic breeding values not explained by the SNPs [distributed as   where  is the numerator relationship matrix (from pedigree) and  is the additive genetic variance not explained by the SNP]   is a vector of SNP effects assumed normally distributed [  with :      and   where  is the additive genetic variance estimated from pedigree]   is a matrix of standardized SNP genotypes (as defined in “”)  and  is a vector of residual errors [distributed as   where  is the error covariance matrix   and  is a diagonal matrix of error weights]. We fitted both the univariate (BayesR) and multivariate (BayesMV) models to the linear combinations. A full description of the univariate BayesR used is in []  while method BayesMV is described in the next section. BayesMV differs from BayesR in that a proportion of the SNPs () are defined as ‘unassociated’ and are assumed to have no effect on any trait. BayesR is equivalent to assuming that   so all SNPs are associated and effects are estimated separately for each trait. In the BayesMV method  the traits are analyzed simultaneously. It is assumed that the residuals () and polygenic effects () are independent between traits and the only connection between traits is the model for the SNP effects (). SNPs are either ‘associated’ with prior probability  or ‘unassociated’ with prior probability . If a SNP is unassociated  it has no effect on any trait. If a SNP is associated  the effects on each trait are assumed to be independent and drawn from a mixture of normal distributions    with :      and   where  is the additive genetic variance estimated from pedigree []. Thus  the probability that the effects of a SNP are drawn from each distribution depends on  (the probability that the SNP is unassociated) and  (the mixing proportion of distribution  for trait  conditional on the SNP being associated). For example  consider two traits and distribution 1 for trait 1 and distribution 2 for trait 2. The probability that the effect of the SNP belongs to distributions  and  is equal to  when  and equal to  otherwise. Full details of the model and the Gibbs sampler used to implement the model are in “”. Reported effects are posterior means of samples from the Gibbs sampler with at least 30 000 iterations  with 20 000 iterations discarded as burn-in. Final results are the mean of five replicate chains. The accuracy of the genomic predictions was assessed in the validation population of young Holstein (N = 262)  Jersey (N = 105) bulls  and Australian Red animals (N = 361) (Table ). In simulations  accuracies were calculated as r(TBV  GEBV)  where TBV is the true breeding value and GEBV is the breeding value predicted using SNP genotypes. In the real data  the accuracy of genomic predictions was the correlation of predicted breeding values with daughter-deviations (for bulls) or phenotypes (for cows) in the validation dataset  i.e.  where  is a vector of phenotypes for the validation population and  is a vector of GEBV for the corresponding animals in . The bias of the predictions was assessed as the regression slope   where an unbiased (ideal) prediction has a regression slope of 1. Accuracy and bias for Australian Reds were computed as the average results for bulls and cows. A multi-trait single-SNP regression association analysis method [] was used in the simulated data for QTL mapping for comparison to the Bayesian approaches. GWAS association summary statistics from a previous study [] were used to verify QTL regions identified by using BayesMV and BayesR. This data consisted of the allele effect and standard deviation for concentration of lactose  minerals (calcium  potassium  magnesium  sodium  phosphorus  sulfate and zinc; mg/kg)  and proteins (lactoperoxidase  lactoferrin  immunoglobulinG  alpha-lactalbumin  beta-lactoglobulin  kappa-casein  alpha-S1-casein and beta-casein; mg/g) in milk. Briefly  the analysis was for up to 444 cows for which trait records had been corrected for non-genetic effects  such as herd-year-season and stage of lactation  and a mixed linear model was used to detect associations between these traits and 609 563 autosomal SNPs with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.01. The –mlma-loco option using GCTA [] was used which fits a genomic relationship matrix to account for population structure  where SNPs from the chromosome under test are excluded from the relationship matrix and the tested SNPs are fitted one-at-a-time as fixed effects. In the simulated dataset  there were 20 and 10 QTL with non-zero effects on one or both traits for scenarios 1 and 2  respectively  and all QTL had a variance of 0.01 . Table  shows the posterior number of SNPs from joint distributions for traits 1 and 2  for BayesR and BayesMV (where the joint distribution for BayesR was calculated as the product of the posterior probabilities for each trait). For example  when pQTL = 0  BayesMV estimated that 25 SNPs were only associated with trait 1  23 were only associated with trait 2 and 41 SNPs were associated with both traits. Considering only trait 1  the number of SNPs estimated to have no effect (i.e. to have an effect sampled from distribution 1) was equal to 12 569 (12 396 + 173) for BayesR and 12 680 (12 643 + 14 + 23) for BayesMV. BayesR estimated similar distributions for both scenarios; i.e. hundreds of SNPs were associated with either trait 1 or trait 2  and two to three SNPs were associated with both traits. BayesMV estimated the true mixing proportions more accurately especially when the same SNPs affected both traits in the simulated data (pQTL = 1). When the same SNPs affected both traits (pQTL = 1)  BayesMV estimated that most of the 17 SNPs classified as associated with both traits (i.e. they were sampled from non-zero distributions) and the remaining two SNPs were associated with either trait 1 or trait 2. However  when different SNPs were simulated to affect the two traits  BayesMV estimated an inflated number of SNPs to be associated with both traits (i.e. 41 when no SNPs were simulated to affect both traits). Both BayesR and BayesMV fitted more SNPs in the model than the number of QTL simulated  probably because they fit multiple SNPs for a given QTL  each with a small variance  instead of only 10 SNPs with a large variance. Figure  illustrates the results from the BayesMV  BayesR  and (the multi-trait) single-SNP regression analyses for a single replicate dataset where all QTL were pleiotropic (pQTL = 1). The mean posterior probability (PP) that a SNP had a non-zero effect on any trait was the criterion for mapping QTL. This quantity is estimated directly in BayesMV and was calculated as 1 – (probability of being in the zero distribution for all traits) in BayesR. In the simulated data  the QTL were among the SNPs analyzed  so the ideal outcome is that these SNPs have a high PP and all others have a low PP. As shown in Fig.   the QTL were mapped quite accurately by BayesMV  since all the high PP SNPs were either a causative SNP or very close to one. BayesMV tended to have zero or close to zero PP for the remaining SNPs. Compared to BayesMV  BayesR showed more SNPs with a low PP. It is very difficult from the single-SNP regression GWAS to determine the location and possible number of QTL in the simulated dataset. All methods sometimes assigned the highest PP or - log10(P) to non-causal SNPs  demonstrating the influence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and other nearby QTL on the association statistics in the cattle genotypes. QTL mapping in simulated data where all QTL are pleiotropic. The mean posterior probabilities (PP) of SNPs having a non-zero effect for any trait for multivariate (BayesMV  top) and univariate (BayesR  middle) methods with the –log10( value) for the multi-trait single-SNP genome-wide association study (GWAS  bottom) are shown. Results for simulated QTL are highlighted in orange and their position marked with dashed vertical lines Results over the 20 replicate datasets are summarized in Figure S1 [see Additional file : Figure S1]. In scenarios where all QTL were pleiotropic (pQTL = 1.0)  BayesMV had greater power to detect QTL (i.e. where power = number of detected causative SNPs/total number of causative SNPs) when the PP was high (PP > 0.9). This was achieved with approximately the same false-discovery rate (FDR)  (i.e. number of detected unassociated SNPs/total number of detected SNPs) as BayesR. In simulations with no pleiotropy  BayesMV had similar power but a higher FDR than BayesR. This was likely caused by SNPs that influenced trait 2 being sampled more frequently from the non-zero distributions for trait 1 (i.e. joint probabilities from BayesMV indicated that there were 41 SNPs that had non-zero effects for both traits but no QTL were simulated to affect both traits). The accuracy of predictions from the simulated data were high (~ 0.90) when validated in a population similar to the reference dataset (Holstein) but lower when used for across-breed prediction (validated in Jersey  Table ). Accuracies were much higher than what is typically observed in real data but this is as expected when causative QTL are included in the analyzed set of SNPs  and when the sizes of QTL effects are relatively large (0.01 ). In simulations without pleiotropic QTL (pQTL = 0)  BayesR and BayesMV achieved very similar accuracies of prediction  both for the Holstein and the Jersey validation datasets (Table ). However  when all QTL were pleiotropic (pQTL = 1.0)  BayesMV had significantly higher prediction accuracy than BayesR by on average 0.08 for Holstein validation and 0.14 for Jersey validation. Milk yield traits had moderate heritabilities (h ~ 0.5) and moderate-high genetic correlations between them (0.5 to 0.8) [see Additional file : Table S1]. The eigenvector coefficients for the milk production traits showed that the first linear combination (LC1) was positively correlated to all three yield traits  the second linear combination (LC2) was primarily fat yield corrected for milk and protein yield  and the third linear combination (LC3) was protein yield corrected for milk yield (Table ). Heritability estimates for the linear combination of traits were moderate to high (0.45 to 0.88  Table ). The distribution of SNPs across the four distributions was relatively consistent between BayesR and BayesMV (Table )  i.e.  both methods found that 3000 to 4000 SNPs had non-zero effects for each trait. These findings were also consistent with the analysis of the original milk yield traits [see Additional file : Table S2]. The difference between the methods was that BayesMV explained all three traits by the same SNPs. For example  only 4092 associated SNPs were identified in the combined Holstein/Jersey reference set  most of which had effects for all three traits. For instance  joint probabilities identified only one SNP in the associated class that had a zero effect for all three traits  79 SNPs with effects for only one trait  949 SNPs with effects for two traits  and 3062 SNPs with effects for all three traits. In contrast  for BayesR  although the number of SNPs with non-zero effects per trait was similar to that observed for BayesMV  almost 11 500 SNPs had effects for at least one trait and only one SNP had effects for all three traits. Both models estimated that the Holstein or Jersey reference populations each had fewer associated SNPs (i.e. with non-zero effects) than the combined breed reference population. This is as expected if some QTL segregate in one breed only. QTL mapping by BayesMV was assessed in the real data by investigating the top 100 SNPs with the highest PP for inclusion in the model [see Additional file : Table S3]. These 100 SNPs were grouped into four types of QTL based on their pattern of effects on milk  fat and protein yield  where the effect of a SNP for a trait was transformed from the LC as   with  being the vector of SNP effects for the linear combinations and  the matrix of eigenvectors from Table . The largest group of SNPs corresponded to those that had opposite effects on fat yield versus milk volume and protein yield. This group included several previously mapped loci such as  []   (--) [] and  (-) []. The second largest group of SNPs corresponded to those where an allele increased milk volume and milk solids (fat and protein yields). In some cases  two SNPs that were less than 100 Mbp apart showed a high PP but different patterns of effects  potentially indicating two or more QTL (i.e. BTA3 at about 15.5 Mbp). We chose two regions on chromosomes 11 and 19 for further investigation  where SNPs with a high PP from the BayesMV analysis also overlapped with SNPs associated with either lactoglobulin or potassium concentration [see Additional file : Table S4]. The mean PP from BayesMV and BayesR on chromosome 11 is shown in Fig. . The SNP identified by BayesMV is located downstream of  (; formally known as  or )  while the SNP identified by BayesR is within the coding region of . The figure also shows the GWAS results for beta-lactoglobulin concentration  for which the SNPs identified by both BayesMV (BovineHD1100030073) and BayesR (BovineHD1100030066) were among those that were most highly associated with beta-lactoglobulin concentration (P < 1 × 10; effect ˜ 0.68 mg/g). Although a QTL near  is known to affect milk volume  fat and protein yields []  identification of the causal mutation for this QTL has been difficult due to strong LD in the region. The effect of the SNP that was identified by BayesMV had opposite effects on fat yield versus milk and protein yield. Mean posterior probability and associations with beta-lactoglobulin concentration on bovine chromosome 11. The posterior probability (PP) for a SNP being associated with any trait from BayesMV and BayesR and the single-SNP association analysis results are shown. The  coding region (formally   ) is highlighted in grey The second QTL investigated was a novel region on chromosome 19  near the  (-) gene [see Additional file : Figure S2]. The BovineHD1900017548 SNP was the most significant variant in the region for potassium concentration (P = 1.21 × 10; effect = - 62.87 mg/kg) and had a high PP with both BayesR and BayesMV. This SNP had opposite effects on protein yield versus milk and fat yield. KCNJ2 is potassium transporter that tends to transport potassium into (rather than out of) the cell (NCBI GeneID: 3759 []). Genomic prediction accuracies for milk yield traits were moderate to high for breeds that were included in the reference population (~ 0.65 for FY  0.62 for MY  and 0.58 for PY in Holstein; 0.57 for FY  0.69 for MY  and 0.71 for PY in Jersey) but relatively low for Australian Reds  which were not included in the reference population (~ 0.27 for FY  0.18 for MY and 0.09 for PY; Table ). Results from linear combinations were consistent with previous BayesR analyses of traits in their original form  which were higher than obtained in a previous univariate analysis using GBLUP [see Additional file : Table S5]. The BayesMV analysis tended to have similar or slightly higher prediction accuracies than the BayesR analyses when validated in the Holstein set (Table ) but similar or slightly lower accuracies for the Jersey and the Australian Reds validation sets. This could be due to fewer SNPs having non-zero effects in the BayesMV compared to the BayesR analysis and SNP effects being estimated in a reference population composed mostly of Holstein animals. Estimates of bias were similar to those from a previous analysis of the traits [] and biases failed to show consistent differences  either when comparing bias of results for the original traits to those for the linear combinations of traits  or when comparing univariate and multivariate analyses of the linear combinations. Many genomic prediction and QTL mapping methods consider only one trait at a time. In this paper  we present a multivariate method for simultaneous QTL mapping  analysis of genetic architecture  and genomic prediction  i.e. BayesMV (a multivariate form of BayesR). BayesMV uses information on multiple traits for the selection of SNPs to be included in the model and within-trait information for estimation of the effects of the selected SNPs. It assumes that SNPs fall into one of two classes: either they have no effect for any trait or they have an effect for one or more traits. The results using simulated data showed that BayesMV can have three advantages over BayesR: BayesMV correctly identifies QTL that affect multiple traits  it maps the QTL more precisely  and it predicts breeding values with greater accuracy. However  when no pleiotropic SNPs were simulated  BayesMV still identified some SNPs with effects for both simulated traits. High false-discovery rates when no pleiotropic QTL are present seems a common problem for multi-trait methods that assume pleiotropic effects []. The size and number of QTL that affect traits also influences the performance of multi-trait methods. For example  Jia and Jannink [] used simulation to show that non-linear multivariate methods can outperform multivariate GBLUP in terms of genomic prediction accuracy when QTL of large effect segregate for traits. Furthermore  Chen et al. [] showed that improvements in the accuracy of genomic predictions using a multivariate non-linear Bayesian approach were modest (compared to univariate methods) when the traits were affected by many segregating QTL compared to traits with few QTL of large effect. Experimental power to detect QTL (i.e. sample size) also influences the conclusions drawn  with non-linear methods tending to have higher accuracy for genomic predictions compared to GBLUP as sample size increases []. Thus  our simulation results should be interpreted with caution since they depend on how the simulations are constructed. However  they do demonstrate that BayesMV can outperform single-trait methods when the genetic architecture of the analyzed traits matches the assumptions that underlie the BayesMV model. For the real milk yield data from dairy cattle  the advantage of BayesMV over BayesR was not as clear. For example  BayesMV showed limited advantage over BayesR in accuracy of genomic prediction  which is not entirely unexpected. With pedigree-based BLUP  multi-trait EBV are only slightly more accurate than single-trait EBV when all traits are measured on all animals and the traits have similar heritability []. Using genomic prediction for psychiatric disorders  Maier et al. [] observed a 2 to 3% increase in predictive ability for schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  and major depressive disorder when using multivariate GBLUP compared to the univariate models. These data included a large number of missing records (i.e. each individual was recorded for only one trait)  traits with moderate and similar heritabilities (~ 0.25)  and moderate genetic correlations between traits (~ 0.4 to 0.6). These results agree with several simulations that used GBLUP multivariate genomic predictions [  ]. Thus  for genomic prediction  the advantage of multivariate over univariate GBLUP depends on the genetic correlation between traits and the number of (new) records contributed by the trait(s) added to the analysis. Similar conclusions have been drawn for multi-trait versus univariate GWAS models [] and for prediction accuracies of non-linear multivariate versus univariate models []. That is  multivariate models increase the accuracy of genomic predictions for low heritability traits that have a strong genetic correlation with a trait that has moderate to high heritability and when additional records measured on a trait with high heritability are added to the analysis. Studies that implement multi-trait genomic prediction methods are often motivated by multi-breed prediction problems and use the flexibility that is inherent in these models to share information across breeds [    ]. For example  BayesRS uses location-specific priors to share information across breeds about the location of QTL regions []  while other implementations accumulate evidence for QTL across multiple breeds and estimate SNP effects within breed [  ]. Thus  information that is shared in both the multi-breed approach and our approach impacts the SNP selection step  rather than the estimation step  of the analysis. Our method could easily be applied to multi-breed genomic prediction problems (with the simplification that there is no error in the covariance between traits). Single-trait methods  such as BayesR  often identify SNPs that are close to each other but where each SNP appears to be associated with a different trait. The question then arises whether there is one QTL that affects both traits (pleiotropy) or two linked QTL that each affect one trait. The BayesMV method attempts to solve this question but its ability to do so is limited by the information contained in the data. BayesMV makes no assumptions about presence of pleiotropic (one QTL affecting more than one trait) versus linked QTL (multiple QTL each affecting one trait). Any particular SNP can have effects for none  some  or all traits. In the simulated data  BayesMV estimates the traits that each SNP was associated with moderately well but not perfectly  as shown by the results. The high degree of LD in dairy cattle populations may make it difficult to distinguish between pleiotropic QTL and multiple non-pleitropic QTL that are in high LD and each associated with one trait. Fitting all SNPs simultaneously partly accounts for LD but it is impossible to distinguish between pleiotropy and linkage if the linked QTL are in perfect LD. Thus  although our method is motivated by pleiotropic QTL  we cannot distinguish pleiotropy from tightly linked loci. The distinction  between pleiotropy and linkage  is important for QTL discovery but is inconsequential for genomic prediction. In the real data  the five independent chains for the BayesMV implementation all showed that most SNPs either have no effect or have effects for all three traits. These results are markedly different from the single-trait BayesR results  where less than 100 SNPs had effects for more than one trait (Table ). In spite of these apparent differences in estimated architectures  the accuracy of prediction was similar between the multi-trait and single-trait methods (Table ). We speculate that the high LD in cattle  coupled with the traits being highly polygenic and having many more predictors than records () results in many possible solutions for prediction that yield similar accuracies. However  our results do show that one of these possible solutions includes a situation where most selected SNPs have effects for both milk volume and composition. Further information on pleiotropy versus linkage can be gained from the pattern of effects of each SNP across the three traits. For instance  the region identified on chromosome 3 appeared to harbor two close QTL  one at 15.4 Mbp affecting protein yield and one at 15.6 Mbp affecting milk yield (see Additional file : Table S3). In contrast  the SNPs on chromosome 14 at 1 to 2 Mbp  all had the same pattern of effects for the three traits and may all be tracking . In this case  BayesMV may fit multiple SNPs for one QTL because the causal mutation is not in the data and because of the uncertainty caused by limited sample size. We analyzed uncorrelated linear combinations of the three traits to reduce computing time and to minimize pleiotropy. Since milk  fat and protein yields are highly genetically correlated  the presence of pleiotropic QTL is highly plausible. Therefore  an analysis based on the three original traits was certain to find extensive pleiotropy. The transformation that was applied (based on the residual covariance matrix) does not guarantee zero genetic correlations but in the case of milk  fat and protein yields  the genetic correlations of the transformed traits were assumed low. However  a general procedure would be a canonical transformation  e.g. []  where variables are both environmentally and genetically uncorrelated. A consistent finding for both the BayesMV and the univariate BayesR analyses was that 3000 to 4000 SNPs have non-zero effects for milk yield traits. The BayesMV analysis may imply that most of the QTL tracked by these SNPs affect all three traits. The GWAS of detailed milk composition supported this conclusion by showing that  in some cases at least  the same SNPs were associated with additional milk composition traits  such as the concentration in milk of beta-lactoglobulin and potassium. The major difference that we observed between the BayesMV and BayesR methods was that BayesMV identifies SNPs with effects for all traits in the analysis. Using the linear combinations of traits  BayesMV identified a subset of SNPs that adequately explained variation in multiple traits. This has potential practical value because it means that we could identify a limited number of SNPs that could be genotyped rather than imputed and these SNPs could be used for multiple-trait EBV calculation. However  LD between the causal mutations and SNPs may differ between breeds  which may limit the realized advantage of BayesMV in multi-breed data (compared to univariate methods)  particularly when relying on high-density SNPs. The application of BayesMV to sequence data could overcome this limitation and should increase power to identify the causal variants over univariate methods. If many unrelated traits are combined in an analysis  it is possible that a very large number of sequence variants (~ 100 K []) will have estimated effects for at least one trait  but the number of associated SNPs should still be much smaller than the total number of polymorphisms in the genome. This would especially be the case if the hypothesis of universal pleiotropy holds  i.e. a mutation at any locus has the potential to affect many (or most) traits [  ]. Simultaneously analyzing traits within a physiological domain  as we have done here  is a practical first-step to assessing and using pleiotropy. We have implemented a multivariate version of the BayesR methodology that is designed to exploit pleiotropic effects of causal loci to improve mapping ability and  in turn  improve accuracy of genomic predictions. A key feature of our method is that across-trait information is used in the selection of SNPs but effects of SNPs are estimated independently for each trait. Our model performed well in simulated datasets where causal mutations were included in the analyzed SNPs and the QTL had relatively large effects (1% of phenotypic variance). In real data  the multivariate model identified most selected SNPs to be associated with all three milk yield traits (fat  milk and protein yield) but we found little evidence to support our hypothesis that multi-trait information would improve genomic prediction accuracies in milk yield traits for dairy cattle. An advantage of the new method is that it selects a small subset of SNPs that could be used for genomic prediction for multiple traits.

Wright’s fixation index () and a per-breed measure of inbreeding [2/(1 + )] were calculated [] for all pair-wise combinations of the three dairy breeds (Holstein  Jersey  Australian Reds) and six additional beef breeds (Angus  Charolais  Hereford  Limousin  Murray Grey and Shorthorn  from []) using 610 123 autosomal SNPs. Beef breeds were included to provide additional context for the genetic relationships between the dairy breeds. The ‘ape’ package in R [  ] was used to construct an unrooted tree of the relationships between the breeds using the neighbor-joining method. The resultant tree [see Additional file : Figure S3] indicates that Jerseys are highly differentiated from all other breeds (e.g. : Holstein-Jersey = 0.08; : AustRed-Jersey = 0.072)  including the beef breeds  and that Australian Reds are closely related to Holsteins (: AustRed-Holstein = 0.033).

It is assumed that the residuals () and polygenic effects () are independent between traits. The only connection between traits is the model for the SNP effects () as explained below. The mean  breed and sex effects ()  and polygenic effects () were assigned an uninformative normal prior distribution. The prior for the variance parameters ( and ) were scaled inverse Chi squared distribution with  degrees of freedom. BayesMV introduces (compared to the univariate equivalent BayesR) a parameter   which is the proportion of unassociated SNPs (i.e. SNPs with zero effect on all traits). For SNPs in the associated class ()  the prior distribution for the SNP effects () follows Erbe et al. [] and assumes SNP effects are from a mixture of four zero mean normal distributions with 0  0.0001   0.001  or 0.01  variance (where  is the genetic variance  as estimated from pedigree analysis) and mixing proportions  for distribution  from trait . The genetic variance was assumed known and determined prior to the analysis  i.e. see Table  for heritability estimates. The mixing proportions ( and ) follow Dirichlet distributions with one pseudo count in each category. Note that the distribution from which the effect of an associated SNP is drawn for one trait is independent of that for other traits. Note that in the following  the current estimates of the parameters in the Gibbs sampler (e.g. ) are distinguished from the final estimates (e.g. ) using superscripts.

The highly selected Latxa sheep for dairy production showed clear signatures of selection in genomic regions related to milk production. Furthermore  our data indicate that the selection criteria applied in the modern genetic improvement program affect immunity and reproduction traits. Sheep is one of the first species that was domesticated approximately 11 000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent [] due in part to its small size  docile behavior and high adaptability to very different environments. During the following 3000 to 4000 years  sheep spread across Europe  Africa and Asia together with the expansion of the Neolithic culture and the development of agriculture []. From the beginning  humans selected sheep for desirable production traits such as wool  milk and meat []. This selection process  combined with natural adaptation to new environments  has led to a large spectrum of phenotypic diversity with more than one thousand different sheep breeds currently described []. In the Western Pyrenees  two sheep breeds are described: Latxa sheep  also known as Manexa or Manech  and Sasi Ardi. Although these breeds show morphological and genetic similarities []  there are marked differences in their habitat and breeding systems that make them good candidates for the study of the genetic response to artificial selection and local adaptation. Most of the Western Pyrenees sheep belong to the Latxa breed  which has good dairy aptitude and is well adapted to the prevailing climatological and orographic conditions in its area of production. Two main varieties of Latxa sheep are distinguished according to facial and extremity pigmentation []: Latxa Blonde Face and Latxa Black Face. Latxa sheep have been traditionally selected for increased milk production; with the introduction of modern quantitative genetics methodologies  a genetic improvement program for this breed was established in 1981. Initially  the selection goal was to increase milk production in order to improve the profitability of the flocks. Later  milk composition and udder morphology traits were also included among the major selection criteria of the program  together with resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In contrast to Latxa sheep  Sasi Ardi is a scarcely known semi-feral breed  which is highly adapted to wooded mountainous areas that are poorly accessible to humans or to other sheep breeds []. Because of this specificity  Sasi Ardi sheep represent an environmentally and socially important breed by contributing largely to the clearing and cleaning of the understory  thus preserving the environment from fires and maintaining the landscape. Sasi Ardi sheep have a smaller body size than Latxa  with slightly elongated extremities  a uniform blonde or reddish color  and a straight wool-less neck. Although there is no specific breeding scheme for production traits in Sasi Ardi sheep  currently it is mainly bred for meat production. These sheep are raised in an extensive production system with grazing as the only food source []  and thus  natural selection is the main evolutionary factor that has driven the genetic pool of the breed. Since 1997  Sasi Ardi is considered as an autochthonous breed under special protection  and since 2007 as a breed in danger of extinction (Official Catalog of Spanish Livestock Breeds; ) []. This situation has slightly improved during the last years thanks to the implementation in 2007 of the Conservation Program for Sasi Ardi breed. This program aims at preserving the breed while maintaining its genetic variability by avoiding consanguineous mating. Based on the above considerations  the main objective of our study was to assess the impact of artificial and natural selection on the genetic pool of the two Western Pyrenees sheep breeds  through genome-wide selection scans (GWSS) to: (1) understand the genetic basis of the local adaptation of Sasi Ardi semi-feral sheep  (2) decipher the genomic response in Latxa sheep caused by a long traditional selection pressure  and (3) explore the specific genomic effect of the genetic improvement program implemented in the Latxa breed. Seventy-five female DNA samples from three populations were sequenced following the Pool-Seq approach []: 25 Sasi Ardi (SAS)  25 Latxa individuals included in the genetic improvement program (LAS)  and 25 Latxa individuals not included in the genetic improvement program (LAN). All analyzed Latxa individuals belonged to the Latxa Blonde Face ecotype. DNA was extracted with the NucleoSpin 96 Blood Core Kit (Macherey–Nagel) commercial kit and pooled in equimolar quantities (4 µl at 20 ng/µl). Three DNA libraries were generated  one for each pooled population  using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit of Illumina (fragment size average 350 bp) and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 instrument (paired-end  2 × 100 nt) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina adaptors and low-quality bases were removed by applying the Trimmomatic v0.32 program [] with the following parameters: AVGQUAL:3 ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq 3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10 MINLEN:31 LEADING:19 TRAILING:19 MINLEN:31. High-quality sequences were mapped against the domestic sheep reference assembly  (OAR) v3.1 [] with Bowtie2 v2.2.3 []  using the –no-unal option. SAMtools v0.1.19 [] and Picard-tools v1.124 () were used to convert between SAM and BAM formats (samtools view)  remove duplicate reads (picard-tools MarkDuplicates)  sort the BAM file (picard-tools SortSam)  remove reads with low-quality mapping (MAPQ quality score < 20 and retain only pairs that are properly mapped: samtools view - q 20 - f 2 - F 4 - F 8)  and to perform proper variant calling (samtools mpileup -B -Q 0). Finally  indels were also removed using the filter-pileup-by-gtf.pl Perl script from the PoPoolation package []. Each step in this data processing was carried out separately for each population. For the identification of selective sweep regions  i.e. genomic regions with patterns that are consistent with positive selection  both within- and between-population analyses were performed for the three sequenced populations. A sliding window approach was carried out  in which a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was called if at least two reads were present for the non-reference allele. An appropriate window size of 200 kb (with sliding steps of 50 kb) was previously determined in an in silico simulation study [see Additional file ] in order to avoid a maximum number of windows with less than 10 SNPs that may lead to a possible bias in the estimation of parameters used for the detection of selection signatures [  ]. Two statistical parameters were calculated for each population: pooled heterozygosity (H) and pooled Tajima’s D (D). This approach has already been applied in selection mapping studies for various domestic species including sheep [   ]. Pooled heterozygosity (H) was calculated by running a Python3 script and using the formula H = 2Sn Sn/(Sn + Sn) []  where Sn is the sum of the major allele reads  and Sn the sum of the minor allele reads for all SNPs in each window. In addition  the pooled Tajima’s D (D) statistics [] was calculated for the three sequenced populations (SAS  LAS  and LAN) to explore the possible distortions in the distribution of allele frequencies using the ‘corrected’ method implemented in the PoPoolation software []. Tajima’s D parameter compares the difference between the mean pairwise difference and the number of segregating sites to detect selection signatures []. In order to detect strong recent selection signatures  we compared the genome of the three populations searching for regions with increased genetic distance between them  by estimating Wright’s fixation index F []. Thus  pooled F values i.e. F were estimated for SAS versus LAS  SAS versus LAN  and LAS versus LAN comparisons using the Perl scripts from PoPoolation []. Autosomal H  D  and F distributions were Z-transformed  resulting in Z(H)  Z(D)  Z(F). Windows were defined as significant if they were at least six standard deviations away from the mean Z scores: i.e. Z(H) and Z(D) lower than - 6 for the within-population analysis  and/or Z(F) higher than 6 for the between-population analysis  since these values represent the extreme lower and upper tails of the distributions. Then  consecutive significant windows were considered as representative of putative selective sweeps and named selected candidate regions (SCR). In order to avoid excess fragmentation of predicted selective sweeps  regions that were separated by one or two windows that did not meet the above extension criteria were collapsed into a single putative sweep region. SCR were classified into three groups: (A) SCR specific to Sasi Ardi (within-population analysis of SAS)  (B) SCR common to the two analyzed Latxa populations (within-population analysis of LAS and LAN)  and (C) SCR assumed to result from the intensive artificial selection applied during the Latxa sheep improvement program (between-population analysis LAS . LAN). SCR were extended 100 kb up- and downstream in order to include potential effects of regulatory changes on loci and to reduce the risk of excluding the outermost portions of the selected haplotypes by using sliding windows of fixed size []. The  3.1 genome assembly from the Ensembl’s Biomart website () [] was used for the identification of annotated genes in SCR. The sheep QTL database [] available online at  was searched to identify SCR that overlapped with previously published sheep QTL. GO terms  including biological process  cellular component  and molecular function  and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the three SCR groups  using the function annotation clustering tool from the Database for Annotation  Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID v6.8  ) [  ]. Because the annotation of the ovine genome is still incomplete  orthologous human gene ID for each gene within the detected SCR were analyzed and enrichment analysis of these genes was performed using the human genome background supplied by the DAVID database. Corrections for multiple testing were performed by applying the Benjamini–Hochberg method []  and GO terms and the KEGG pathways were considered significant at a  value lower than 0.05. In the case of functional clusters  an enrichment score of 1.3 (equivalent to Fisher exact test  value of 0.05) was used as a threshold  as recommended by the authors of the database. A total of 46 Gbp  42.6 Gbp  and 43.4 Gbp were sequenced for SAS  LAS  and LAN populations  respectively  which resulted in an average read depth of  16× per pool after trimming. On average  95.8% of the sequence reads aligned to the Oar_v3.1 reference genome. For the GWSS analysis and the within-population analysis  11 135 221  10 384 557  and 10 505 944 SNPs along the 26 ovine autosomes for the SAS  LAS and LAN populations  respectively  were considered to calculate parameters H and D. In the case of the between-population analysis  12 366 133 common SNPs in the three populations were included for the estimation of F. Figures  and  show plots of the Z(H)  Z(D)  and Z(F) test results. Based on the calculation of Z(H) and Z(D) parameters  82  108  and 85 significant windows were identified for SAS  LAS  and LAN populations  respectively  which corresponded to 0.16  0.22  and 0.17% of the test results [see Additional file ]. The genetic differentiation analysis (SAS versus LAS  SAS versus LAN  and LAS versus LAN) revealed 99  106  and 12 significant windows (Z(F) > 6) corresponding to 0.31  0.33  and 0.037% of the test results  respectively [see Additional file ]. Distribution of Z-transformed average pooled heterozygosity (Z(H)) and pooled Tajima’s D (Z(D)) plotted along sheep autosomes 1 to 26 (alternately colored) for Sasi Ardi (SAS) and both Latxa populations either included in the genetic improvement program (LAS) or not (LAN).

A dashed horizontal line indicates the cut-off (Z = 6) used for extracting outliers Thirty-two SCR were identified within the identified significant windows. The average length of the detected SCR was 385 kb (ranging from 50 kb to 1.95 Mb). The detected SCR were classified into three groups: (A) 16 SCR that were specific to Sasi Ardi sheep (SCR 1 to 16) and located on  (OAR) chromosomes OAR2  3  4  6  7  8  11  19  20  22  and 24; (B) eight SCR that were common to the two Latxa populations (LAS and LAN) (SCR 17 to 24) and located on OAR1  2  3  6  7  18  19  and 24; and (C) eight SCR (SCR 25 to 32) on OAR2  8  11  13  15  16  and 22  which corresponded to the genomic differences between LAS and LAN and are thought to be genomic regions that are affected by the intensive artificial selection applied in the Latxa sheep genetic improvement program (Table ). The detected SCR included 147 annotated genes (on average six genes per SCR) (Table ). The DAVID functional analysis did not yield any significantly enriched gene ontology or KEGG pathway term for the 16 SCR that were specific to Sasi Ardi sheep. Nevertheless  the genes within the SCR that were common to the two analyzed Latxa populations showed two significantly enriched GO terms (Benjamini–Hochberg  < 0.05  Table ): GO00045028 (G-protein coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor activity) and GO0035589 (G-protein coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor signaling pathway). Both categories included five genes within SCR17 located on OAR1:         and . These terms  together with GO0005887 and GO0007186  form a significantly enriched functional cluster (enrichment score = 4.61) related to signal transduction. For the SCR of group C  which may result from the improvement program applied in Latxa sheep  we identified two significantly enriched categories: hsa04740 KEGG pathway (olfactory transduction) and GO0004984 (olfactory receptor activity). All genes involved in these two terms were within SCR30 located on OAR15:               and . The two categories were included in a significantly enriched functional cluster (enrichment score = 2.72) in which other terms related to the detection of chemical stimulus and sensory perception  signal transduction  and receptor activity are found. With the advance of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies  the analysis of large datasets offers great opportunities to study genome evolution in response to selection forces in both wild and domesticated species. In recent years  selection mapping studies have become increasingly popular because they offer a complementary strategy to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for mapping variants that impact traits of interest  and thus help to link phenotypes to gene function  which could be of biotechnological relevance. Our study constitutes the first genome-wide comparison of Sasi Ardi and Latxa local sheep from the Western Pyrenees. First  we resequenced the genomes of these two breeds by using Illumina’s technology following a Pool-Seq approach []. Then  we calculated different within- and between-population parameters with the aim of detecting selective sweeps in the genome and 32 SCR were identified. Understanding the molecular basis of local adaptation is one of the major challenges facing population genetics. With this in mind  our first objective was to explore the genome of Sasi Ardi sheep (SAS) to search for selection signatures that underlie natural adaptation of this breed to the specific environment in which it lives in the Western Pyrenees. We detected 16 SCR specific to this breed  among which the strongest signals were detected on OAR4 (SCR3 and 4)  OAR6 (SCR5)  and OAR22 (SCR15). The functions of some candidate genes identified within these regions indicate that natural selection may have affected energy metabolism and morphology  immunity  and reproduction traits of Sasi Ardi semi-feral sheep. A recent worldwide study suggested that climate exerts a selective pressure on genes related to energy metabolism in sheep []. Sasi Ardi and Latxa sheep are both autochthonous breeds of the Western Pyrenees  but the semi-feral nature of the Sasi Ardi breed and its harsh habitat  suggest that these conditions are more demanding than those of the Latxa  as might be reflected in its smaller body and thin elongated limbs. We found several candidate genes ( and ) that support this hypothesis. The  (-) gene located within SCR4 constitutes one of the 15 loci that are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)  which in humans is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by marked obesity among other clinical features []. Mutations in several  genes affect fat cell differentiation  and recently this gene has been specifically associated to abdominal visceral fat depots in humans []. The  () gene within SCR15 belongs to a family of genes that play a role in the regulation of energy metabolism []. Specifically   is expressed in brown adipose tissue and skin  and in mouse  mutations in this gene lead to several abnormalities in sebaceous lipid composition  impaired skin defects and metabolic irregularities in adipose tissue []. Finally  the protein encoded by the  gene (-)  also located within SCR15 binds to ELOVL3 and participates in energy homeostasis in mice []. It is well known that immunity and host response genes and functions are recurrent targets of natural selection  both in humans [] and free-living animal species []. In our study  the results from the Sasi Ardi genome analysis reveal several interesting genes related to the immune system. The putatively selected SCR15 contains the gene that encodes the transcription factor NFKB2 (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 2)  which is involved primarily in immunity  among other processes []. In previous studies  several quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been detected within SCR15 and are related to animal health  among which some are associated with response to parasitic infections  although no candidate gene has yet been suggested [  ]. In addition  selection signatures within SCR1 and SCR14  although not as significant as that within SCR15  also harbor candidate genes relevant to immunity. These include genes that are involved in triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)   and  in the present study  which interact with microbial products that activate innate immunity responses of organisms []; and the  gene ()  which encodes an iron transporter and also plays a key role in innate immunity against infection by intracellular pathogens [].  has been extensively associated with natural resistance to several infections in ruminants  including the  subsp.  infection in both cattle and sheep [  ]. Interestingly  a recent study in  identified several codons in the  gene under positive selection []. Another candidate gene under putative selection is  ()  located within SCR5.  is required for early mammalian development []  and in pig  it is related to litter size [  ]. Sasi Ardi ewes are characterized by low fertility and small litter size  due  in part  to the harsh environment in which the breed is raised []. Thus  the idea of natural selection affecting the  gene and shaping reproduction traits of Sasi Ardi sheep seems plausible. The presence of the  () gene within SCR8 further supports this hypothesis  since modulation of  in the endometrium has been suggested to have a role in establishing uterine receptivity to implantation in cattle []. After the early stages of domestication of livestock species  methodical selection of specific traits was undertaken []. Unlike the Sasi Ardi breed  traditionally  Latxa sheep are exploited for milk production  and selection for this trait was much intensified during the last three decades through a genetic improvement program. The consequences of this selection were clearly reflected in the Z(H) and Z(D) values obtained from the within-population analysis of both LAS and LAN (Fig. ) in which OAR6  a well-known milk related chromosome  showed highly significant values. In fact  selection signatures on OAR6 constituted the main genetic difference when comparing SAS with both LAS and LAN (Fig. ).  (BTA) chromosome BTA6 is well known for its association with milk production in dairy cattle []. In sheep  several QTL for milk production traits have also been described on the orthologous chromosome OAR6  which overlap with the SCR20 detected in the current study []. Several studies have identified this genomic region as being under selection in dairy breeds [        ]. SCR20 includes several genes that are considered to be putatively selected for milk production traits in sheep.  (--) is a well-known gene that has a role in milk yield and composition and is under selection in both dairy cattle [  ] and sheep [    ]. The  ( or ) gene is assumed to regulate lactation in cattle [] and is suggested to be putatively under selection in sheep [  ]. Furthermore  within this region   () is associated with milk production traits in cattle [  ]   (-) is reported to influence milk fat yield []  and  () is suggested to be a candidate gene for fat and protein percentage []. Interestingly  the genes associated with SCR20 point to another hypothesis regarding the putative selection of this genomic region. At the beginning of the domestication process  the body size of animals decreased substantially  but as artificial selection for production was applied it increased again considerably []. Related to this  the previously mentioned  gene and the  () gene encode transcriptional regulators that affect body size traits in Merino sheep []. Both genes  and   have also been described as putatively under selection when comparing dairy  including Latxa  and non-dairy Spanish sheep breeds []  although the authors could not explain this finding due to the lack of differences in body size traits between the breeds analyzed. However  in our study  the hypothesis of selection acting on body size is supported by the presence of the  () gene within SCR24. Although there is little evidence in the literature  Yang et al. [] reported an association between the bovine ortholog  and growth performance in Nanyang cattle  which suggests a possible role through the regulation of glucose uptake. The identification of SCR19 in Latxa sheep is also of interest. The  ()  located 40 kb upstream from this SCR  encodes a key controlling receptor for a number of cell types  including hematopoietic stem cells  mast cells  melanocytes and germ cells []. This functional complexity offers different hypotheses in the present context. On the one hand  the  gene has been associated with coat color in domestic animals [  ]  including sheep in which two candidate regions around the  and  genes were identified [  ]. In our study  the putative selection of  in Latxa sheep could be responsible for the differences in facial and extremity pigmentation between its two main ecotypes  i.e. the Latxa Black Face and the Latxa Blonde Face []. On the other hand  the putative selection signature observed near  could be related to its fundamental impact on reproduction traits. In fact  pleiotropic effects of  and  on the reproductive tract have been described in different species []. The antagonistic genetic correlation between female fertility and milk production is well documented in cattle and sheep [  ] and is supported by a study in Latxa sheep [] that reported that  in this breed strongly selected for dairy production  young ewes had low average fertility. The SCR17  which was detected in both Latxa sheep populations  contains several genes that are related to signal transduction and belong to the two significantly enriched GO categories detected in this study. These genes (     and ) belong to the family of -. This type of receptor is activated by a wide spectrum of extracellular stimuli  including photons  ions  neurotransmitters  lipids  chemokines and hormones  and binds to G proteins to initiate downstream signaling networks  resulting in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes []. In particular  the neuropeptide receptor GPR171 plays an important role in responses associated with feeding and metabolism in mice []. This finding might also be relevant in the case of Latxa sheep for which a correlation of feeding and metabolism traits with milk composition was reported []. Thus far  SCR common to both Latxa populations in our study have been interpreted as being the result of traditional selection for milk production. Hereafter  we consider the specific effect of the intensive artificial selection that has been applied since 1981 through the established genetic improvement program. By comparing both Latxa populations  we identified several genomic regions under putative selection (LAS vs. LAN  SCR 25 to 32). Among these  SCR30 showed the most significant signal. This genomic region contains several genes related to the olfactory system including a number of olfactory receptor genes (       and )  and the  () gene which encodes a subunit of the olfactory CNG channels that are involved in the signal transduction of olfactory sensory neurons in vertebrates []. These genes within SCR30 constitute the most significantly enriched category. Interestingly  Vitezica et al. [] showed that genes involved in the olfactory system are associated with scrapie in sheep  and Ugarte [] reported that  since 2003  specific genotypes for the  () gene are under selection in the program to increase resistance to scrapie. Our findings suggest selection for genetic resistance to scrapie has an indirect effect on the allelic frequencies of other putative scrapie-related genes such as olfactory receptor genes. Our results also suggest that reproduction traits may be affected by the genetic improvement program in Latxa sheep. On the one hand  the detrimental consequences on reproduction traits of the long traditional selection for milk production discussed above may have been intensified with the implementation of this program. On the other hand  the reproductive activity of the animals under selection has been altered by the production system  which tends to stimulate reproduction outside of the natural breeding season due to hormonal treatments []. Naturally  selection signatures within regions that contain reproduction-related genes could also be explained by the objective of any breeding scheme to produce healthy and fertile individuals that are capable of nurturing their offspring []. In our study  we found several reproduction candidate genes in various SCR  including two estrogen receptors genes:  () and  (). In addition  the transcriptional regulator  () gene located within SCR25 has been linked to bovine endometriosis []. In this study  we found little overlap between within-population (H and D) and between-population (F) parameters. Only OAR6 harbored a large selected candidate region in both Latxa sheep populations  which constituted the major genomic difference with Sasi Ardi sheep. The absence of overlapping results between the different tests may be explained by their sensitivity to the different selection pressures [  ]. Furthermore  a recent study that compared the performance of 11 different procedures for detecting selection signatures including Tajima’s D and F reported low correlations []. This is not surprising if we consider that selection signatures based on a reduction of genetic diversity are known to persist for long periods and  therefore  methods such as Tajima’s D or heterozygosity (H) can inform us about old selection events  while the F statistic  focused on the differentiation between populations  identifies more recent selection processes []. Indeed  artificial selection for milk production implemented in the Latxa sheep  both historically and more recently  has led to a selection signal on OAR6 that was detected by both within- and between-population analyses. Moreover  estimated H and D parameters identified several genomic signals suggestive of ancient selection events  such as those putatively associated to the local adaptation of Sasi Ardi sheep. The genetic differences observed between both Latxa sheep populations based on F presumably highlight the effects of the current intensive artificial selection program. With the aim to understand the genotype–phenotype relationship better  this study evaluates the impact of selective processes on the sheep genome. A genome-wide comparison of two local sheep breeds from the Western Pyrenees: the semi-feral breed Sasi Ardi  and its highly selected relative Latxa breed  is presented. Genome-wide selection scans highlighted multiple candidate regions in both breeds that contain genes that are relevant to the traits under selection. These findings demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach to achieve our objectives. In Sasi Ardi sheep  natural selection appears to have favored various specific traits related to energy metabolism  morphology  reproduction  and the immune system  making this semi-feral breed suitable for the harsh environment in which it lives. The traditional artificial selection exerted on the Latxa sheep for milk production was clearly detected around well-known genomic regions. In addition  immunity and reproduction traits  might also be affected by the current genetic improvement program. Our findings provide insight into genes under putative selection in sheep that are subject to different management regimen. Nevertheless  further investigation is required to validate these findings  which should apply complementary methods  such as gene expression analyses  to understand the selection pressures better.

The average performance of crossbreds can be considered as the summation of two components  i.e. the breed average (BA) of the parental breeds and heterosis (H) present in crossbreds. Selection of pure breeds for CP based on genomic estimated breeding values for crossbred performance (GEBV-C) or for purebred performance (GEBV-P) may differ in their ability to exploit BA and H and can affect the merit of crossbreds in both the short and long term. Selection based on GEBV-C is beneficial for CP  because H in crossbreds is efficiently exploited  whereas selection on GEBV-P results in more genetic progress in pure breeds  which increases the BA component of CP. To investigate the outcome of selection on GEBV-C and GEBV-P in both the short and long term  a two-way crossbreeding program was simulated to test the following hypotheses: (1) does selection on GEBV-P result in higher long-term CP compared to selection on GEBV-C and (2) does selection on a combination of GEBV-P and GEBV-C lead to more long-term gain in CP than selection on either separately. We investigated the performance of crossbreds in a two-way crossbreeding program across 40 generations and considered different criteria to select purebred parents that ranged from selection on purebred performance to selection for CP with different weights on genomic evaluations based on purebred and CP. These criteria were compared under three genetic models to investigate the effects of the amount of dominance variance  absence of over-dominance  and the structure of the reference population on CP  both in the short and long term. Although beneficial in the short to medium term  genomic selection in pure breeds on a criterion that specifically targets CP was inferior to selection for purebred performance in the long term. A selection criterion that maximizes a combination of short- and long-term responses in CP  should improve the components that define crossbred merit (i.e.  BA and H) simultaneously. Genomic selection can be applied to select purebreds for crossbred performance (CP) [  ]  by estimating effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on phenotypes and genotypes from either purebreds or crossbreds  and applying the resulting estimates to selection of purebreds []. Several genomic models have been suggested for the prediction of breeding values for CP of individuals in the pure breeds in genomic crossbreeding programs. These models are the standard additive genomic prediction model  models with across-breed effects of SNP genotypes (ASGM) or with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles (BSAM) []  the dominance model []  and the breed-specific dominance model (BSDM) []. Additive and dominance models can be applied to either crossbred or purebred performance  while ASGM  BSAM and BSDM can only be used for training on crossbred performance. It has been suggested that  to improve CP  selection of purebred animals should be based on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) that have been calibrated based on allele frequencies of the opposite breed rather than based on allele frequencies observed within the breed [  ]. The logic behind this originates from the fact that in crossbreeding  alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTL) from the sire (dam) breed combine with alleles from the dam (sire) breed. When dominance is present  allele substitution effects and breeding values depend on the allele frequency among the mates []. Since dominance is a likely genetic basis of heterosis  selecting purebred animals for CP based on GEBV for CP (GEBV-C) that are calculated using both additive and dominance effects and appropriate allele frequencies  is expected to increase heterosis. Although GEBV-C is beneficial for CP  it is expected to reduce genetic improvement within the pure breeds []  which is more pronounced if QTL with over-dominance affect the trait. In such a case  CP is maximized if alternate alleles are fixed in the two parental breeds. In fact  with over-dominance  allele substitution effects may have opposite signs in the parental breeds  depending on their allele frequencies. Since GEBV-C are based on the allele frequencies in the gametes that are produced by the opposite breed  the two parental breeds are expected to be fixed for alternate alleles of over-dominant QTL  which maximizes the frequency of favorable heterozygotes in crossbred progeny. However  fixation of alleles that are not favorable for purebred performance will reduce genetic improvement in the pure breeds. The average performance of crossbreds can be written as the summation of two components i.e. breed average (BA) of pure breeds and amount of heterosis (H) present in crossbreds (CP = BA + H) []. Criteria to select pure breeds for CP such as GEBV-C or GEBV for purebred performance (GEBV-P) can differ in their ability to exploit these two components. Selection on GEBV-C is beneficial for CP  because it exploits H in crossbreds efficiently  while selection on GEBV-P can result in more genetic progress in pure breeds  which increases the BA component of CP. In a two-way crossbreeding system  Esfandyari et al. [] showed that selection of pure breeds on GEBV-C can increase response in CP compared to selection on GEBV-P. In their study  the comparison between the two selection criteria was limited to five generations. However  in practice the goal is to maximize gains in current and future generations. Several studies have shown that maximization of short-term response may result in smaller cumulative responses in the longer term in the context of pure breeding [  ]. In crossbreeding programs  it is also unclear how GEBV-P and GEBV-C affect the two components of CP (i.e. BA and H) in the long term. In fact  the main reason for the superiority of GEBV-C for CP in the short term is its ability to drive the QTL with over-dominance effects towards fixation of alternate alleles in the two parental breeds []. Once those QTL are fixed  subsequent improvement in CP can be obtained only by genetic gain in BA  for which selection on GEBV-C is inferior to selection on GEBV-P. Therefore  to investigate long-term effects of selection for CP  we simulated a two-way crossbreeding program to test the following two hypotheses: (1) does selection of purebred on GEBV-P result in greater CP in the long term compared to selection on GEBV-C  and (2) does a criterion that combines GEBV-P and GEBV-C result in greater long-term gain (CP) than selection on either separately. We analyzed 40 generations of selection in a two-way crossbreeding program to improve performance of crossbred progeny. We compared five genomic selection criteria in the context of three genetic models to investigate the effects of the amount of dominance variance  absence of over-dominance  and structure of the reference population (purebred or crossbred) on short- and long-term response in CP. Simulations were performed using the  package and scripts were developed in R []. Each scenario was replicated 50 times. Improvement in CP was examined by using five genomic selection criteria that differed in the approach used for the selection of purebred animals as the parents of both crossbreds and of the next generation of purebred animals. The general selection criterion for animal  within each parental breed was: where   is the GEBV of animal  for purebred performance   is the GEBV of animal  for crossbred performance and  () is the weight that is assigned to GEBV for purebred and crossbred performance. With  = 0  both parental breeds were selected for purebred performance and with  = 1 selection within parental breeds was for crossbred performance. Three genetic models  which differed in the amount of dominance variance () and in the proportion of QTL that showed over-dominance  were simulated to compare the performance of the above-mentioned selection criteria (Table ). In Model 1   of the trait of interest was equal to 0.1 and 25% of the QTL showed over-dominance. In Model 2   was reduced to 0.05  and as a result  10% of QTL showed over-dominance. Finally  in Model 3   was equal to 0.1 as in Model 1  but no QTL showed over-dominance. For these three genetic models  training was on performance of purebred animals. However  to evaluate whether the ranking of selection criteria depends on the type of training population  we also simulated Model 1 with training on crossbred performance. Phenotypic variance () was equal to 1 and narrow-sense heritability () was equal to 0.3 in all cases. A historical population of 2000 unrelated individuals was stochastically simulated and used as the ancestral population of two pure breeds (referred to as breeds A and B hereafter) that were used to create crossbreds. The historical population was randomly mated for 2000 generations. To simulate the two purebred populations  at generation 2000  two independent random samples of 100 animals were drawn from the last generation of the historical population  and each was randomly mated for another 100 generations. In subsequent generations  a two-way crossbreeding program with 40 generations of selection was simulated. From generation 1 to 40  300 animals (the top 100 males and top 200 females) were selected from the 1000 available candidates in each parental breed  based on the selection criteria described above. The selected animals were randomly mated within each breed to produce 1000 purebred replacement animals for the next generation. Meanwhile  the 100 selected males of breed A were randomly mated to the 200 selected females of breed B to produce 1000 crossbred progeny. For all selection criteria and each model  breed A acted as the sire breed and breed B as the dam breed. The goal was to improve CP through selection in both parental breeds. The phenotypic mean of crossbreds was computed for each generation of selection (AB to AB) to evaluate the realized cumulative response to selection. In models with training on purebred performance  A and B purebred datasets of 1000 animals each were used separately as training populations to estimate marker effects that were specific to that breed. In Model 1 with crossbred training  2000 randomly selected AB crossbreds were used to estimate marker effects  which were then used to calculate genomic breeding values of animals in the parental breeds. In both types of training datasets (purebred and crossbred)  training was repeated in each generation of selection  using the animals of the last generation only (more details about the population structure are in []). We considered a genome that comprised four chromosomes of 1 M each. This small genome size was chosen to limit computing time. In total  400 segregating QTL and 4000 SNPs were simulated. Within a chromosome  the positions of 1000 SNPs and 100 QTL were randomly set. To obtain the required number of segregating loci after 2000 generations  twice as many bi-allelic loci were simulated by sampling initial allele frequencies from a uniform distribution and applying a recurrent mutation rate of 2.5 × 10. Mutation rates of loci were determined in preliminary analyses based on the number of polymorphic loci in generation 2000 necessary to obtain 4000 polymorphic SNPs and 400 QTL. SNPs and QTL were distinct loci and were randomly drawn from segregating loci  with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.05 in generation 2000. The additive effect () of a QTL  defined as half the difference in genotypic value between alternate homozygotes  was sampled from a gamma distribution (0.4  1.66). Dominance effects () were defined as the deviation of the genotypic value of the heterozygote from the mean of the genotypic values of the two homozygotes. Similar to Wellmann and Bennewitz [  ]  first  the degree of dominance at the th QTL () was sampled from a normal distribution    and then dominance effects were calculated as   where  is the absolute value of the additive effect for each QTL. Thus  the absolute magnitudes of additive and dominance effects were not independent  i.e. loci with large additive effects were also more likely to have large dominance effects. To avoid QTL with over-dominance effects in Model 3  dominance effects for QTL that were sampled to have over-dominance effects were set equal to the absolute additive effect of the QTL. Following simulation of additive and dominance QTL effects  additive and dominance variances were calculated and effects were scaled using an iterative procedure to reach the desired variances. In all models  additive and dominance effects of QTL alleles were assumed to be the same in the two breeds. Thus  G × E interactions and epistasis were not simulated. The phenotypes of the trait were simulated by adding a standard normal residual effect to the genotypic value of each animal. Two types of true breeding values (TBV) were calculated  i.e. TBV for purebred performance (TBV-P) and TBV for crossbred performance (TBV-C). The TBV were calculated as the expected genotypic value of the offspring of a parent that carries a certain QTL-genotype  when this parent is mated at random to its own breed (TBV-P) or to the other pure breed (TBV-C). Thus  for animal  from breed   the TBV for purebred performance was calculated as: where  is the proportion of alleles  that the individual carries (1 for   0.5 for  and 0 for ). Moreover   and  are the allele frequencies (for  and ) for the th QTL in breed   and  and  are the true additive and dominance effects of the th QTL. For example  for an  parent at locus   a fraction  of its offspring will have genotype   while a fraction  of its offspring will have genotype . Hence  for locus   the breeding value of this parent equals ( + )  which is the first term in Eq. . The expected genotype frequencies of crossbred offspring of a parent depend on the allele frequencies in the other pure breed (denoted  here). Thus  for animal  from breed   the TBV for CP was calculated using Eq.  but with  and  replaced by  and   where  and  are the allele frequencies ( and ) for the th QTL in breed . Genomic estimated breeding values were calculated in the same way  but SNP genotypes were used rather than QTL genotypes  and estimated rather than true effects were used. Thus  from the estimates of additive () and dominance effects ()  the GEBV-P (for purebred performance) for animal  from breed  was calculated as: For the calculation of GEBV-C (for crossbred performance)  SNP frequencies in the other breed were used  i.e.  and  in Eq.  were replaced by  and  where  and  are the allele frequencies ( and ) for the th SNP in breed . SNP frequencies in the other breed were calculated based on SNP genotypes of all selection candidates in that breed. Bayesian ridge regression implemented in the BGLR “Bayesian general linear regression” R package was used to predict effects of SNPs []. The following model was used to predict the genetic effects associated with each SNP: where  is the phenotypic value of individual  in the training data   is the overall mean   is the copy number of a given allele of marker  coded 0  1 and 2 for    and   respectively   is the random unknown additive effect for marker    is the indicator variable for heterozygosity of individual  at marker   with  =  when individual  is homozygous at SNP  ( or ) and  = 1 if individual  is heterozygous at SNP  ()  d is the random unknown dominance effect for SNP    is the residual effect for animal   and S denotes summation over all SNPs . For each analysis  the Gibbs sampler was run for 20 000 iterations  with the first 3000 discarded as burn in. Convergence of the resulting posterior distributions was assessed by the Heidelberger and Welch and the Geweke diagnostics using the Coda package []. Correlation of LD phase between pure breeds A and B and their crossbred descendants was estimated to evaluate the degree of relatedness between the populations. To estimate this correlation  only segregating SNPs with a MAF higher than 0.01 in each population were included in the analysis. The correlation was estimated following Badke et al. [] as: where  is the correlation between  in population  and  in population    is the correlation coefficient as a measure of LD between SNPs  and  in population   () and () are the standard deviations of  and   respectively  and  and  are the average  across all pairs of SNPs  and  within an interval of  for populations  and   respectively. Positive  are expected when SNPs are in LD and show equal linkage phase in the two studied populations. Pairs of SNPs were binned according to distances between SNPs (intervals of 0.1 cM from 0 up to 10 cM) and average values of  were calculated for each bin. The phenotypic mean of crossbred animals was measured across 40 generations of selection for each of the five selection criteria and for each genetic model (Fig. ). The mean phenotype of crossbreds for each selection criterion was expressed relative to the mean for the reference selection criterion ( = 0). For genetic Model 1 with training on purebred performance  all selection criteria with a non-zero  resulted in a greater response in CP in the short term than the reference selection criterion ( = 0). This superiority in CP was observed for at least 10 generations. However  the long-term response in CP differed between the selection criteria applied. Although the reference selection criterion ( = 0) resulted in the smallest CP in the short term  it realized a greater long-term response in CP than selection criteria with a weight on CP ( > 0.25). Setting  = 1  which means that animals were selected explicitly for CP  resulted in the smallest response in CP in the long term  whereas  = 0.25 resulted in the greatest response in the long term. Mean phenotype of crossbred animals for different selection criteria relative to the reference selection criteria ( = 0). Mean phenotype of crossbreds for each selection criterion was plotted relative to the reference selection criterion ( = 0). The general criterion for selection of purebred parents was . Training in Models 2 and 3 was on purebred animals. OD = % QTL with over-dominance For genetic Model 1  with training on crossbred animals  shifting the selection criterion from purebred to crossbred performance led to a substantial improvement in CP  both in the short and long term. Compared to the reference selection criterion ( = 0)  selection criteria with  = 0.25 had a 6 to 13% greater response in CP in the short term  but this superiority decreased over generations. In the long term  the selection criterion with  = 1 resulted in a smaller response in CP than the reference selection criterion ( = 0). For genetic Model 2  which had lower dominance variance and  therefore  less over-dominance  selection criteria with a weight on CP resulted in a greater short-term response in CP than the reference selection criterion ( = 0) but only for a few initial generations. For example   = 1 led to a response in CP that dropped below that of the reference selection criterion after five generations of selection. In the long term  selection criteria with high weights on CP ( = 0.75) realized much less response in CP than the reference selection criterion. Selection criteria with  = 0.25 and 0.5 led to responses in CP that were comparable to response of the reference selection criterion in the long term. Without over-dominance (genetic Model 3)  in the short term  selection on CP ( = 1) led to a slightly greater response in CP than selection on the reference selection criterion (i.e. 2% more. In the short term  responses in CP were similar for  = 0.5 and 1. In the long term  similar to Model 1  the selection criterion with  = 1 on CP led to the smallest response in CP. Selection criteria with equal weights on purebred and crossbred performance ( = 0.5) resulted in a similar response in CP in the long term as the reference selection criterion  but greater CP in the short term. Figure  shows realized cumulative responses to selection in crossbred animals over 40 generations for the five selection criteria and each genetic model. For all models  selection criteria with a zero or small weight on CP realized higher response in CP in the long term  whereas explicit selection on crossbred performance  realized the smallest long-term response in CP. Cumulative response to selection. The general criterion for selection of purebred parents was . Training under genetic Models 2 and 3 was on purebred animals. OD =  % QTL with over-dominance. Inset plots show the mean performance of crossbred animals under each model for generations 30 to 40 In summary  for all genetic models  selection for purebred performance (reference selection criterion) resulted in a smaller response in CP in the short term but in the long term  this selection criterion was beneficial. In contrast  explicit selection of the pure breeds for CP ( = 1)  although beneficial for CP in the short term  could not sustain this superiority in the long term. Genetic Model 1 was used to compare the effect of the type of training population  i.e. using purebred and crossbred performance  on response in CP. Figure  shows the mean phenotype of crossbred animals over 40 generations for two extreme values of  for the selection criterion ( = 0 and 1). For both these selection criteria  training on crossbreds resulted in greater response to selection in CP than training on each purebred separately. Also  for both types of training  while selection for CP ( = 1) was beneficial in the short term  long-term response was greater with selection for purebred performance ( = 0). Mean phenotype of crossbred animals over generations under genetic Model 1. Two extreme values of  in the selection criteria ( = 0 and 1) were compared for purebred and crossbred training Response to selection averaged across breeds A and B for 40 generations of selection under genetic Model 1 is presented in Fig. . The mean phenotype of purebred animals for different selection criteria is plotted relative to mean phenotype for the reference selection criterion ( = 0). Since results with Models 2 and 3 were similar to those with Model 1 with purebred training  they are not shown. For all genetic models  the reference selection criterion with  = 0 for CP resulted in the greatest response  both in the short and long term  whereas  = 1 resulted in the smallest response. In Model 1 with purebred training  putting a relatively small weight on CP ( = 0.25) did not affect response in purebreds and the mean performance of purebreds for this selection criterion was comparable with that for the reference selection criterion. Training on crossbreds under Model 1 resulted in lower performance of purebreds compared to the reference selection criterion when  > 0. In general  for all genetic models  shifting from selection on purebred performance to crossbred performance  i.e. increasing  from 0 to 1  reduced response in purebred performance. Mean phenotypic average of pure breeds. Mean phenotype of pure breeds are expressed relative to the means obtained with the reference selection criterion ( = 0). The general criterion for selection of purebred parents was . Training under genetic Models 2 and 3 was on purebred data. OD = % QTL with over-dominance Heterosis refers to the superior performance of crossbred animals compared to the average performance of their purebred parents. The amount of heterosis achieved for each selection criterion was calculated as the difference between CP and BA over generations (H = CP–BA) (Fig. ). Heterosis in crossbreds. The amount of heterosis obtained with each selection criterion was calculated as the difference between crossbred performance (CP) and breed average (BA) over generations. The general criterion for selection of purebred parents was . Training under genetic Models 2 and 3 was on purebred data. OD = % QTL with over-dominance For all genetic models  the selection criterion with  = 1 exploited more heterosis in crossbreds than other selection criteria and the amount of heterosis increased over generations with this selection criterion. In contrast  the reference selection criterion with selection for purebred performance ( = 0) resulted in the smallest amount of heterosis over generations for all genetic models. Compared to genetic Model 1 with purebred training  reducing dominance variance (Model 2) and absence of over-dominance (Model 3) did not affect the ranking of selection criteria in terms of heterosis. For all genetic models  shifting from selecting on purebred to crossbred performance (i.e. from  = 0 to 1) increased the amount of heterosis observed in crossbreds. For genetic Model 1  with crossbred training  heterosis increased over generations for all selection criteria. The difference between selection criteria with  > 0 was negligible and the reference selection criterion  i.e. selecting on purebred performance also increased heterosis in crossbreds. Table  summarizes the percentages of QTL alleles that became fixed for the five selection criteria and all genetic models. Total fixation was calculated as the percentage of QTL that was fixed for either allele in the last generation  averaged over the two breeds. Increasing the weight () in the selection criterion increased the percentage of allele fixation. In all models  the selection criterion with  = 1 had the highest percentage of QTL allele fixation  while the reference selection criterion with selection on purebred performance had the lowest allele fixation. The percentage of common (alternate) allele fixation represents the number of QTL that were fixed for the same (alternate) allele in the two breeds in the last generation. Across all genetic models  selection on purebred performance in each pure line ( = 0) resulted in more frequent fixation of the same allele in both pure breeds  while shifting the selection criteria from purebred to crossbred selection (i.e. increasing ) reduced the probability of fixation of the same allele in the two pure breeds. In contrast  with full weight on crossbred performance ( = 1)  the two breeds were more often fixed for alternate alleles. The selection criteria also differed in the percentage of QTL that were fixed for the favorable allele  which was defined based on the sign of the additive effect of the allele. Increasing the weight on CP resulted in slightly less fixation of favorable alleles in the pure breeds. However  fixation of unfavorable alleles (i.e. loss of favorable alleles) in pure breeds increased by shifting selection from purebred to crossbred performance. In addition  training on CP increased fixation of unfavorable alleles compared to training on purebred performance. Percentages of fixation of over-dominant QTL in the two pure breeds in the last generation are in Fig. . For both types of training  selection on CP ( = 1) resulted in a greater percentage of fixation of over-dominant QTL (68.5 and 85.7% for purebred and crossbred training  respectively)  while selection for purebred performance ( = 0) resulted in less fixation of over-dominant QTL (55.1 and 71.3% for purebred and crossbred training  respectively). Total fixation for both types of training increased by shifting selection from purebred to crossbred performance. In addition  compared to purebred training  crossbred training generally led to more fixation of over-dominant QTL. Fixation of over-dominant QTL in the parental breeds. The percentages (inside bars) indicate the proportion of fixed over-dominant QTL that are fixed for the same or alternate alleles in the parental breeds. Bolded blue values above bars indicate the total fixation of over-dominant QTL in generation 40 for each selection criteria. The general criterions for selection of purebred parents was  The percentages of over-dominant QTL that were fixed for either the same or alternate alleles in the two pure breeds are also presented in Fig. . For genetic Model 1 with purebred training  changing the selection criteria from purebred to crossbred performance decreased the percentage of fixation of common alleles for over-dominant QTL and increased the percentage of fixation of alternate alleles in the pure breeds  with selection for CP ( = 1) resulting in the highest percentage of fixation of alternate alleles. Fixation of common and alternate alleles of over-dominant QTL under genetic Model 1 was also associated with the type of training; with crossbred training  the percentage of fixation was higher for alternate alleles than for common alleles for all selection criteria. In addition  changing from selection on purebred to crossbred performance resulted in a higher (lower) percentage of fixation of alternate (common) alleles in the pure breeds. Prediction accuracy  i.e. correlation between the breeding values predicted by genomic selection and the true breeding value obtained from simulation  ranged from 0.52 to 0.66 in the first generation across the genetic models (Fig. ). Note that accuracies in Fig.  refer to the correlation between the selection criterion and TBV-C. In other words  when in the selection criterion  is set to 0  selection is on purebred performance but the accuracy is the correlation of GEBV-P with TBV-C  while accuracy is the correlation between GEBV-C and TBV-C when selection is on CP ( = 1). Generally  accuracies with purebred training were not affected by the value of  in the selection criterion. For genetic Model 1 with crossbred training  selection criteria with  = 0 and 1 had the lowest and highest accuracy  respectively. Thus  predicting GEBV-P based on crossbred performance is more difficult than predicting GEBV-P on purebred performance. Similarly  predicting GEBV-C is more effective when based on crossbred performance than based on purebred performance. Accuracy of selection for five selection criteria for each genetic model. Accuracies are presented for breed A only. : genetic Model 1 with purebred training  : genetic Model 1 with crossbred training The correlation of LD phase between breeds A and B was low and decreased rapidly with increasing distance between SNPs (Fig. ). For SNPs less than 0.5 cM apart  the mean correlation was 0.15 and decreased towards 0 at distances of 10 cM. In contrast  the correlation of LD phase between purebred populations and their crossbred descendants was high; the correlation was equal to 0.46 between breed A and the crossbred population for SNPs less than 0.5 cM and decreased to 0.25 for SNPs 10 cM apart. Corresponding correlations for breed B were 0.43 and 0.23 for SNPs 0.5 and 10 cM apart  respectively. Correlation of LD phase () between populations for SNP pairs for different distances between SNPs We investigated the performance of crossbred progeny in a two-way crossbreeding program over 40 generations. Purebred parents in each generation were selected based on criteria that ranged from a selection for purebred performance to selection for crossbred performance  using different weights on each. We showed that selection in pure breeds using a selection criterion that specifically targets CP  in spite of being beneficial in the short term  results in smaller performance of crossbred animals in the long term. These results indicate that a selection criterion that properly weights purebred and crossbred performance can be used to maximize response over a given time horizon. We investigated five selection criteria that differed in the weights on and ability to exploit the two components that determine the merit of crossbreds  i.e.  parental breed average and heterosis. When selecting on purebred performance (reference selection criterion)  selection was on breed average and  led to the highest mean performance of purebred breeds over generations. However  since this selection criterion ( = 0) resulted in less progress in heterosis  the overall performance of crossbreds was lower in the short to medium term. The inability of the reference selection criterion to increase heterosis significantly can be explained as follows. In our study  we assumed that the additive and dominance effects of QTL were the same in both breeds. With selection for purebred performance  the same alleles were often fixed in the two parental breeds. For all genetic models considered  the highest proportion of QTL fixed for the same allele in the two breeds relative to the total number of fixed QTL in the last generation was obtained with the reference selection criterion (Table ). Fixation of the same alleles in the two breeds reduces the heterozygosity in crossbreds and heterosis. However  in the long term  this selection criterion realized the largest response in crossbreds because a higher percentage of favorable alleles was fixed within the pure breeds  resulting in more genetic gain in pure breeds and higher performance of crossbred progeny. When  increased from 0 to 1 in the selection criterion  selection changed from purebred to crossbred selection by putting more weight on . As a result  heterosis was exploited more effectively by selection criteria  which increased performance of crossbreds in the short to medium term compared to the reference selection criterion. Since heterosis depends on differences in allele frequencies between the parental breeds  these results suggest that selection based on  drives allele frequencies in opposite directions in the two parental breeds or at least causes divergence in allele frequencies between the parental breeds. As a result  selection based on  led to more fixation of alternate QTL alleles in the two parental breeds  which is beneficial for heterosis in crossbreds in the presence of dominance. In addition  compared to the reference selection criterion  for over-dominant QTL the parental breeds were more often fixed for alternate alleles when  was included in the selection criterion (Fig. )  which explains the greater heterosis obtained with these selection criteria. However  in the long term  selection criteria with non-zero  resulted in smaller CP. Although changing the selection criteria from selection on purebred performance to crossbred performance allowed the non-additive genetic effects (heterosis) to be exploited in crossbred merit more effectively  it also resulted in lower genetic gain in the pure breeds. In fact  regardless of whether selection is on  or   both components of crossbred merit ( are involved in determining the merit of crossbreds. However  the potential of  and   to exploit breed average versus heterosis differs. While  is more capable of improving the additive component (BA)   exploits the non-additive component (H) more effectively. Comparing short and long-term responses shows that  although heterosis is beneficial for crossbred performance in the short term  the main component that determines long-term performance of crossbreds is BA rather than H. Including CP in the selection criteria resulted in greater short- to medium-term response in crossbred animals compared to selection on purebred performance only. Consideration of cumulated discounted response favors schemes that lead to a greater response in early generations  in particular if the discount rates is high. Thus  for commercial competitive breeding  our results indicate an advantage of including CP in the selection criterion. In practice  a breeder is interested in genetic improvement of both purebred and crossbred performance and  thus  in a breeding objective that focuses both on purebred and crossbred performance. One approach to address that objective would be to use a selection criterion with  = 0.25 or 0.5  as in this study  which puts weight on both purebred and crossbred breeding values of the purebred parents and  thus  in simultaneous improvement of purebred and crossbred performance. Compared to the reference selection criterion  these selection criteria result in greater short-term performance in CP and nearly identical or comparable long-term performance. In addition  purebred performance was only slightly (2 to 3%) smaller than obtained with the reference selection across generations. Thus  by putting appropriate weights on  and  in the selection criterion  simultaneous progress in purebreds and crossbreds may be guaranteed  with additional short-term gain being achieved with no loss in long-term gain. In Model 1  dominance variance was one-third as large as the additive genetic variance  which is within the range reported for many traits in livestock [   ] and plant breeding populations [  ]. However  because of the wide range of reported proportions of dominance variance across traits and populations  dominance variance was reduced to 5% in Model 2 to investigate if the amount of dominance variance affects the performance of different selection criteria. As for Model 1  for Model 2  selection criteria with a weight on  ( = 0.25) improved short-term performance in CP more than the reference selection criterion but to a lesser degree than Model 1 and performance fell below that of the reference selection criterion in fewer generations. For example  the selection criterion with  = 1 with purebred training resulted in greater response in CP than the reference selection criterion for 13 generations for Model 1 but only for five generations for Model 2. Since the lower dominance variance for Model 2 compared to Model 1 also results in a lower percentage of over-dominant QTL  we hypothesized that over-dominance may contribute to the effect of including CP in the selection criterion on response in CP. Over-dominant QTL have been identified in livestock and plants for economically important traits [    ]. Although the percentage of QTL showing over-dominance has not been clearly determined for complex traits in livestock  they have been shown to be frequent in plants  especially for reproductive traits. For example  Lu et al. [] studied four traits in two back-cross populations of maize and  based on the absolute value of /  24 of the 28 QTL (86%) identified for grain yield showed over-dominance. For three non-reproductive traits  fewer QTL with over-dominance were identified  i.e. two out of 16 (12.5%) for grain moisture  one out of 8 (12.5%) for stalk lodging  and four out of 11 (36%) for plant height. The association of over-dominance with reproductive traits has also been reported for laboratory animals. A QTL-mapping study in an F2 cross between two mouse strains measured 17 body composition and growth traits and identified 139 QTL []  of which 9% showed over-dominance ( or ). Another study on five reproductive traits found that seven of the 15 QTL detected showed over-dominance []. Regardless of their frequency of occurrence  QTL that exhibit over-dominance have a relatively large effect on the amount of heterosis exhibited by a trait. Thus  in Model 3  in order to investigate the potential effect of over-dominance on performance of the selection criteria  we excluded over-dominant QTL in the genetic architecture of the trait but without changing the dominance variance. However  even without over-dominance  selection criteria that included CP realized greater response in CP  although their relative superiority was lower than for Model 1. In addition  a selection criterion with a relatively small weight on CP ( = 0.25)  did not improve response in CP compared to the reference selection criterion. In conclusion  our results of the comparison between Models 3 and 1  with absence of over-dominance being the only difference  suggest that over-dominance contributes to the greater response in CP observed for selection criteria that include CP. Comparison of Model 1 with training on purebred versus crossbred data showed that selection criteria with  = 0.25 resulted in greater response in CP than the reference selection criterion. With purebred training  these selection criteria were about 5% superior to the reference selection criterion in the short term  but this superiority increased to 14% and remained for more generations with training on crossbreds. This higher superiority appears to be due to the larger amount of heterosis obtained with crossbred training. For Model 1  regardless of the selection criterion  the percentage of QTL that were fixed for the alternate allele in the two parental breeds was higher with crossbred training than with purebred training  which explains the larger amount of heterosis that was observed in crossbreds. In addition  in contrast to purebred training  with crossbred training  more over-dominant QTL were fixed for alternate alleles than for the same allele in the parental breeds (Fig. )  which explains the greater heterosis observed in crossbreds with crossbred training. In addition  in order to investigate the potential effect of over-dominant QTL on the observed superiority of selection criteria that included CP  over-dominance was not allowed in the genetic structure of the trait  as in Model 3 (see Additional file : Figure S1). Results showed that absence of over-dominance did not affect the performance of selection criteria with  = 0.25 and these selection criteria were superior to the reference selection criterion not only in the short and medium term but also in the long term (except for  = 1). It should be noted that  although over-dominance was absent in this model  QTL with complete and partial dominance were present and may contribute to the larger amount of heterosis observed in crossbreds in these cases. Training on crossbred data for genomic selection of purebreds for CP has been suggested [  ]. It is expected that training on crossbred data accounts for the factors that cause the genetic correlation between purebreds and crossbreds () to be less than 1  which include non-additive effects (mainly dominance)  genotype by environment interactions (G × E)  breed of origin effects  and differences in allele frequencies between breeds. In this study  G × E interaction was not included in the simulations and  thus  the deviation of  from 1 (0.82 ± 0.05 on average across Models) was purely the result of dominance effects and differences in allele frequencies between the two pure breeds. Our results showed that training on crossbreds resulted in a greater response to selection in CP than training on each purebred separately (Fig. ). Previous simulation studies have shown that training on crossbred data by either ignoring [  ] or accounting [  ] for the breed origin of the alleles in crossbreds can be beneficial in crossbreeding programs. In fact  training on crossbreds by using an appropriate model  can account for most of the factors that cause  to be lower than 1. Using real data  Xiang et al. [] applied single-step best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) to data on total number of piglets born in Danish Landrace  Yorkshire and two-way crossbred pigs. Their results confirmed that including crossbred genomic information improved reliabilities of genomic predictions of CP for purebred boars. Similarly  Iversen et al. [] found that including the genotypes of crossbred animals in the genomic relationship matrix increased prediction accuracy of total number born and live born for both purebreds and crossbreds. Lopes et al. [] showed that predicting performance of crossbred sows for litter size and gestation length was more accurate when training was performed on crossbred than on purebred data. In addition  they found evidence of breed-specific SNP effects by training on crossbred data  although prediction accuracies did not improve for the analyzed traits when this was accounted for. In summary  the results from both simulation studies and real data analyses indicate that compared to training on purebred data  training on crossbred data is beneficial in crossbreeding programs. Genomic selection of pure breeds with a selection criterion that specifically targets CP  although it is beneficial in the short to medium term  is inferior to purebred selection in the long term. A selection criterion that maximizes a combination of short- and longer-term responses for CP  must improve the components that define crossbred merit simultaneously  i.e.  breed average and heterosis. To increase response to selection for CP  training on crossbred data is more effective than training on purebred data. Dekkers JCM. Marker-assisted selection for commercial crossbred performance.

Allele  is dominant and a partial duplication of the prolactin receptor gene has been identified as the causal mutation. Interestingly  some domesticated turkey lines exhibit similar slow- and fast-feathering phenotypes  but the underlying genetic components and causal mutation have never been investigated. In this study  our aim was to investigate the molecular basis of feathering rate at hatch in domestic turkey. We performed a sequence-based case–control association study and detected a genomic region on chromosome Z  which is statistically associated with rate of feathering at hatch in turkey. We identified a 5-bp frameshift deletion in the  () gene that is responsible for slow feathering at hatch. All female cases (SF turkeys) were hemizygous for this deletion  while 188 controls (FF turkeys) were hemizygous or homozygous for the reference allele. This frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon and six novel amino acids (AA)  which results in a truncated PRLR protein that lacks 98 C-terminal AA. We present the causal mutation for feathering rate in turkey that causes a partial C-terminal loss of the prolactin receptor  and this truncated PRLR protein is strikingly similar to the protein encoded by the slow feathering  allele in chicken. Sex identification is an important management factor within many commercial livestock operations. In poultry  sexing can be performed by examining feathering rate  a non-intrusive approach to separate males and females at hatch. In turkey and chicken layer breeds  sexing at hatch is crucial for production. However  for broiler breeds this method is mainly applied at the parent stock level. In chicken  the sex-linked dominant  locus  which is located on the Z-chromosome  is responsible for feather development and is associated with delayed emergence of primary and secondary flight feathers (SF)  while the  + allele is associated with fast emergence (FF) of flight feathers []. The status at this locus is widely used for autosexing at hatch []. Elferink et al. [] studied the molecular basis of the  allele and identified a 176-kb tandem duplication  which includes part of the genes  () and  () that are associated with the  allele. Moreover  a molecular test was developed to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous late feathering males []. The 176-kb duplication causes a 149-amino-acid (AA) C-terminal loss of the PRLR protein and is most likely the causal mutation for the SF phenotype []. PRLR is a receptor of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin that belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family [] and is involved in various physiological processes including many reproductive and developmental processes  such as hair/coat morphology []. The  gene is widely expressed in all embryonic and somatic tissues and its expression is higher in SF than in FF chicks []. The domesticated turkey ()  an important agricultural species and the second largest contributor to world poultry production []  shows similar SF and FF phenotypes in some commercial lines []  which are used for the same selection goal as in chicken  i.e. reliable and easy determination of sex at hatch. The SF phenotype differs between turkey and chicken with SF turkeys generally showing poor feathering even at a later age []. Zakrzewska et al. [] suggested that the dominant sex-linked inhibited feathering (IF) allele  is responsible for the genetic feathering defect in turkey. Interestingly  expression of this defect ranges from almost complete absence of feathers to full feather covering at a later age (> 4 weeks of age)  although until 4 weeks of age no apparent differences between SF birds were observed. Moreover  SF turkeys show inferior reproductive efficiency compared with FF turkeys [] and differences in body weight and carcass characteristics []. The SF phenotype that is under study here differs from a late feathering phenotype that was described in turkey by Asmundson and Abbott []  which consists in poor feathering at physical maturity (> 20 weeks of age). In chicken  the SF phenotype has been associated with the sex-linked allele   whereas in turkey  the underlying genetic components and causal mutation have never been investigated. In this study  we used whole-genome sequence data that were obtained from either slow- or fast-feathering turkeys to perform a case–control genome-wide association study (GWAS) for feathering rate at hatch and to investigate its relation to the chicken allele . We collected blood from 202 animals representing nine commercial turkey lines and that included 12 SF cases and 12 FF cases selected from the same line. For each sample  DNA was extracted and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer  which generated paired-end 101 bp reads. We used the Sickle software to trim sequences []  BWA-MEM (version 0.7.15) to map the whole-genome sequencing data to the turkey reference genome (Melgal5) []  the Samtools dedup function to remove duplicate reads []  the GATK IndelRealigner to perform local realignments of reads around indels [] and Qualimap to obtain mapping statistics []. We performed population-based variant calling using the Freebayes software with the following settings: (1) min-base-quality 10 (to exclude alleles with support base quality < 10)  (2) min-alternate-fraction 0.2 (at least 20% of the reads should support the alternate allele in order to evaluate the position)  (3) haplotype-length 0 (to avoid generating haplotypes in VCF)  (4) ploidy 2 (assuming diploid organism)  and (5) min-alternate-count 2 (to have at least two reads that support the alternate allele in order to evaluate position) []. Post-processing was performed using bcftools []  and variants that were located within 3 bp of an indel  or with a phred quality score and call rate lower than 20 and 0.7  respectively  were removed. The average call rate was about 0.985  and the average transition/transversion (TS/TV) ratio was 2.62  in line with previous findings in turkey []. PCA analysis was performed using PLINK [] on the filtered vcf files and plotted using the default R plotting utilities. SnpEffect [] was used for variant annotation and the PROVEAN software for variant effect prediction in missense variants. The following variant classes were considered as potential candidate variants: missense  splice acceptor  splice donor  inframe indels  frameshift  stop lost  stop gained  and start lost variants. Single locus associations on the genotypes called by freebayes were tested for SNPs and indels in PLINK using permutations to generate uncorrected and corrected p values []. p values were generated by applying the Fisher’s exact test and an adaptive Monte Carlo permutation test was performed with 5000 replications. Variants with a P lower than 1e-5 were considered significant. Manhattan plots were generated using qqman R package []. We selected all significant protein-altering variants and evaluated their putative effect on the protein based on PROVEAN scores and SnpEffect annotations. Moreover  gene ontology (GO) annotations were obtained from the Uniprot database []. Phenotype information on  null-mutant mice was from Craven et al. []. The ClustalO alignment software [] was used to align chicken and turkey  sequences. CNV-seq was used to perform CNV analysis using a log2-threshold of 0.6 and a  value threshold of 0.001 []. The optimum window size was automatically computed and ranged from 2.5 to 7.1 kb. The FF sample MG-WUR-121 and the SF sample MG-WUR-136 were used as control samples in CNV-seq analysis for analyses of SF and FF data  both exhibiting average to high coverage (see Additional file : Table S1). CNV-seq R utilities were used to plot the CNV events. To study the molecular mechanisms that underlie feathering rate at hatch in turkey  we selected 12 animals within each group (SF and FF) from one commercial line for whole-genome re-sequencing (WGS) (All female  [see Additional file : Table S1]). Moreover  DNA from 178 FF turkeys from various commercial turkey lines was sequenced for additional control samples. The SF turkeys in the population analysed here have phenotypes that are similar to those described for the dominant sex-linked IF allele  by Zakrzewska et al. []. Whole-genome DNA was sequenced and resulted in a total amount of 2.17 Tbp (tera base pairs) from 22.48 × 10 paired-end 101 bp reads. Mapping was performed with BWA—mem (version 0.7.15) to the  build 5 (Melgal5: []) reference genome with an average mappability and coverage of 98.38%  and 10.5×  respectively. We performed population-based variant calling using Freebayes []. Next  we filtered out variants with a low-quality (phred quality score < 20) or a call rate lower than 0.7  which resulted in 8 136 213 (post-filtering) variants including 6 595 059 SNPs  and 1 197 170 indels  with an average variant density of 8.4 variants per kb (see Additional file : Table S2). We performed PCA analysis on the 24 cases and control animals to assess population stratification; no distinct clustering was observed between the two groups (see Additional file : Figure S1). We used SnpEff to assign a range of functional classes to the identified variants []. The majority of the variants were located in intronic  ncRNA  or intergenic regions (see Additional file : Table S3). We identified 231 073 coding (90 370 protein-altering) variants with an overall missense/silent ratio of 0.545  which means that for every two silent mutations (synonymous) one missense mutation is found (see Additional file : Table S4). The GWAS revealed a significant signal for 134 SNPs on the Z chromosome. None of the detected variants is in perfect LD with the phenotype (see Additional file : Table S5). SNPs associated with the SF phenotype are all located on the short arm of the Z chromosome between 7.95 and 9.79 Mb (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Figure S2). This region contains 55 protein-coding genes including the  and  genes associated with the SF phenotype in chicken. Manhattan plot for feathering rate association analysis. The - log10 () for each SNP is shown on the y-axis. A clear signal is observed on chromosome Z (8.1–9.5 Mb) We examined the putative effects of all significant variants associated with slow feathering. In total  we identified eight protein-altering variants (seven SNPs and one indel). The seven identified SNPs cause missense mutations in protein coding genes (Table ). None of the missense variants were predicted to have a high impact on the corresponding protein (reaching a PROVEAN score < - 2.5). Moreover  none of the missense mutations were fixed within the group of SF turkeys (Table )  and thus were unlikely to be the causal variant. The identified indel represents a hemizygous 5-bp deletion that is statistically associated with feathering rate and predicted to have a high impact on the  gene by causing a frameshift (Fig. ). This deletion  which is located within the terminal exon of the  gene  produces a truncated PRLR protein by introducing a premature stop codon and adding six novel C-terminal amino acids (DSITET*  Fig. ). All SF turkeys were hemizygous for the alternate allele  while ten FF turkey controls and all additional 178 FF turkeys were hemizygous or homozygous for the reference allele (Table ). In addition  we performed a copy-number variation (CNV) analysis to test whether  as in chicken  a CNV event is associated with feathering rate at hatch. Although one region on chromosome Z between 7.9 and 8.1 Mb harboured copy number variants in various samples  none of them were associated with feathering rate at hatch (see Additional file ).   gene model showing the location of the 5-bp deletion in the C-terminal exon.  C-terminal end of the PRLR protein sequence in SF and FF turkey. The deletion associated with SF phenotype introduces a frameshift and six novel AA before a premature stop-codon  which results in the deletion of 98 C-terminal AA Turkey and chicken PRLR proteins are very similar (90.24% sequence identity  (see Additional file : Figure S3) and both are 831 AA long. However  carriers of the 5-bp frameshift deletion in turkey lack the final 98 AA of the PRLR C-end tail (Fig. )  whereas carriers of the  allele in chicken lack the terminal 149 AA of the PLRP C-end tail []. The prolactin receptor forms a dimer to bind prolactin in the extracellular space on the N-terminal end of the protein []. Moreover  PRLR contains two fibronectin type 3 domains (FN3)  a WSXWS motif that is important for proper protein folding  and a Box 1 motif that is necessary for Janus kinase (JAK) interaction and activation []. However  the function of the affected C-end tail  which is located in the cytoplasm  is mostly unknown  but likely shares similar functional relevance in chicken and turkey. This study reveals the molecular mechanisms that underlie the rate of feathering at hatch in turkey. The use of NGS data provided a sufficient number of variants to describe the potential causal polymorphism  i.e. a 5-bp deletion within the last exon of the  gene. This mutation is different from that of allele  in chicken  but impacts the same gene [] and moreover  in a similar manner  i.e. by loss of a substantial part of the C-end tail (98 AA in turkey; 149 AA in chicken). Unlike SF chickens  SF turkeys are poorly feathered  even at physical maturity []. Moreover  feathering of females can be so poor that carriers of this allele are not used commercially. Although strongly associated with SF  the  5-bp frameshift mutation is not in perfect LD with the phenotype since we observed two FF females that were hemizygous for this deletion. One possibility is that these two animals were mislabelled as FF turkeys  although they are SF turkeys; this is supported by the observation that none of the variants (including non-coding ones) is in complete LD with the phenotype. The membrane-protein PRLR is a member of the cytokine receptor family that binds the prolactin hormone (PRL) within the extracellular space []. This hormone is involved in a diverse range of biological activities including various reproductive and developmental processes  such as hair replacement and follicle development []. Null mutant mice show different hair/coat morphologies and advanced hair replacement []. Moreover  a frameshift variant  which introduces a premature stop codon in the bovine PRLR receptor and causes the loss of 120 C-terminal AA  is associated with abnormally short and sleek hair coat []. Moreover  hair development and feather development are considered to have an evolutionary homologous origin. Thus  these findings support the  gene as a likely candidate for feathering development within both commercial poultry species  chicken and turkey. Other studies have suggested that feathering rate in chicken is caused by a higher expression of  due to its partial duplication. Carriers of allele  show a 1.78-fold higher expression of  in chicken []. In contrast  Zhao et al. [] found no difference in  expression between SF and FF chicks  but that the expression of the other gene involved in the duplication    was significantly higher in SF than in FF chicks  which suggested that a mutation in this gene was responsible for the SF phenotype. We believe that the higher expression of  in chicken is due to the large duplication that underlies the  allele. The duplication results in two partial  genes (that lack both tails)  while the  gene remains complete []. Incomplete  mRNA could be subject to the nonsense-mediated decay mechanism resulting in a lower abundance of  mRNA compared to  mRNA. Thus  based on our findings  we believe that  rather than a higher expression of   it is the lack of the C-terminal end of the protein that is responsible for the slow feathering rate at hatch in both chicken and turkey. Interestingly  Nakamura et al. [] reported that  in a late feathering chicken line  reversion to the fast feathering phenotype occurred in rare instances  but this was not observed in our population. The  mutations in chicken and turkey are clearly independent  but lead to similar phenotypes  which strongly suggests that they have been favoured by identical breeding goals being applied in these two species. Thus  the SF/FF phenotype shows a pattern that is similar to that observed for a small number of monogenic or oligogenic traits under domestication selection  which show independent mutations in the same genes in specific pathways []. Coat colour is one of the most common domestication features  which is regulated by a small number of genes (e.g.     and ) in many domestic animals []. Another example in poultry is comb morphology  which is a monogenic trait regulated by the same set of genes but with independent mutations in different breeds (e.g.     and ) []. Thus  we hypothesize that the same independent selection applied for domestic feathering rate within and across species has resulted in independent mutations in . We describe a case–control GWAS that detected a genomic region on the Z chromosome  which is statistically associated with rate of feathering at hatch in turkey. Within this genomic region  we identified a hemizygous 5-bp frameshift deletion in   which causes the loss of 98 C-terminal AA and is the causal polymorphism for low feathering phenotype in turkey. This is a clear example of similar selection pressures for the same trait (sexing at hatch) in two domestic poultry species that result in two distinct mutations but each affecting the C-terminal end of the same protein  i.e. PRLR. The function of the C-terminal end of this protein  located in the cytoplasm  remains mostly unknown  and further functional studies are necessary to gain more insight in the downstream molecular pathways affected by this mutation.

In the latter case  the inverse genomic relationship matrix (GRM) is typically needed  which is computationally demanding to compute for large datasets. Thus  there is a great need for dimensionality-reduction methods that can analyze massive genomic data. For this purpose  we developed reduced-dimension singular value decomposition (SVD) based models for genomic prediction. Fast SVD is performed by analyzing different chromosomes/genome segments in parallel and/or by restricting SVD to a limited core of genotyped individuals  producing chromosome- or segment-specific principal components (PC). Given a limited effective population size  nearly all the genetic variation can be effectively captured by a limited number of PC. Genomic prediction can then be performed either by PC ridge regression (PCRR) or by genomic animal models using an inverse GRM computed from the chosen PC (PCIG). In the latter case  computation of the inverse GRM will be feasible for any number of genotyped individuals and can be readily produced row- or element-wise. Using simulated data  we show that PCRR and PCIG models  using chromosome-wise SVD of a core sample of individuals  are appropriate for genomic prediction in a larger population  and results in virtually identical predicted breeding values as the original full-dimension genomic model (r = 1.000). Compared with other algorithms (e.g. algorithm for proven and young animals  APY)  the (chromosome-wise SVD-based) PCRR and PCIG models were more robust to size of the core sample  giving nearly identical results even down to 500 core individuals. The method was also successfully tested on a large multi-breed dataset. SVD can be used for dimensionality reduction of large genomic datasets. After SVD  genomic prediction using dense genomic data and many genotyped individuals can be done in a computationally efficient manner. Using this method  the resulting genomic estimated breeding values were virtually identical to those computed from a full-dimension genomic model. In recent years  genomic prediction [] has revolutionized animal and plant breeding methods. With decreasing genotyping costs  the number of genotyped individuals has increased exponentially over years  with up to full sequence of genomic information available for prediction. Genomic prediction can be performed using two families of genomic models: marker effects models (MEM) (e.g. SNP-best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)  BayesA  BayesB  BayesC  etc.)  and animal models that use a genomic relationship matrix (GRM). The latter can be further divided into genomic models that include genotyped animals only (genomic BLUP  i.e. GBLUP) and single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) models [  ] that combine genotyped and ungenotyped animals. The advantage of genomic animal models is that they fit nicely within the traditional linear models’ framework  and can essentially be adapted to any kind of linear or generalized linear animal model (single-trait  multi-trait  random regression  etc.). However  with the increasing number of genotyped individuals and increasing density of genotypes  the computational requirements of genomic prediction models increase accordingly. Hence  MEM analysis of full sequence data  e.g. using Bayesian variable selection models  will be very demanding in terms of computing time. For ssGBLUP [  ]  the inverse of the GRM is computed prior to analysis  which may be practically impossible when the number of genotyped animals becomes very large (e.g. > 100 000). To address the latter  Misztal et al. [] proposed the “algorithm for proven and young animals” (APY)  which uses a core sample of individuals to compute an approximate inverse of the GRM for all animals. However  in some cases  the total GRM does not have full rank  and thus no inverse. Therefore  Fernando et al. [] suggested exact methods to obtain ssGBLUP solutions. One of the options that they proposed was to model animal genetic effects as linear combinations of independent factors. In the following section  we propose a related strategy that applies singular value decomposition (SVD) to perform large-scale genomic evaluation  both for MEM and animal genomic models. Thus  our study aims at: (1) using SVD and principal component (PC) ridge regression (PCRR) for genomic prediction as an alternative to MEM  using up to full sequence genomic data  and (2) applying SVD techniques for computation of exact inverses of PC-based GRM  using dimensionality reduction. Assume that dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes for  loci are available for  animals. Omitting fixed effects for simplicity  the simplest MEM (called SNP-BLUP) can be specified as []: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is an  (centered) matrix of genotype dosage for all SNPs and all animals   is a vector of SNP allele substitution effects   is the variance of SNP effects   is a vector of random residuals  and  is the residual variance. The SNP-BLUP equations [] are: where  is the ratio of residual variance to SNP effects variance. Here  we assume that the SNP effects variance is:   where  is the total additive genetic variance and  is the allele frequency at locus . The dimension of the equation system is equal to the number of loci (). Hence  if  is large (e.g. full sequence)  solving this system of equations may be difficult. A GBLUP (animal) model  equivalent to the above SNP-BLUP model (i.e. assuming all animals have data) is []: where  is as defined above and  is a vector of additive genetic effects. Now  the equation system becomes []: where   i.e. the ratio of residual to total additive genetic variance. The GRM  is a function of the observed genotypes  e.g. based on VanRaden’s Method 1 []    where   with  being a vector of SNP allele frequencies in the population. In populations of limited effective size ()  the genomic relationships are a result of the segregation of a limited number of haplotype segments  and thus   may not be positive definite  implying that its inverse does not exist. In such cases   is still positive semidefinite  i.e.  for any non-zero vector  of  real numbers:  . We defined an approximated GRM:   where  is a small number (e.g. 10). The matrix  is positive definite  and thus invertible  as: . Adding  to the GRM diagonal elements has a negligible effect on the solutions and may be viewed as fitting a (tiny) fraction of the residual as a part of the additive genetic effects  and thus is essentially equivalent to the original GBLUP model. Although  exists  computing it by direct “brute-force” inversion will be increasingly challenging  and eventually impossible  as the number of genotyped individuals increases (e.g. for  > 100 000). Another option is to specify the equation system as []: which do not require an invertible . However  for typical single-step evaluations  the inverse of the GRM is still needed [  ]. The dimension of the GRM is equal to number of genotyped animals   which may be smaller than number of loci  (at least for dense genomic data). In the opposite case  when the number of genotyped animals exceeds the number of loci   does not exist  but the exact inverse of  can be calculated by the Woodbury formula []: where  and  are identity matrices of rank  (animals)  and  (number of loci)  respectively. This implies that the () matrix  has to be inverted rather than the () GRM. Still  for large   computing a direct inverse may be computationally difficult. We will show later how dimensionality reduction of genomic data can be used for the efficient computation of the inverse of large GRM. Related animals typically share large segments of DNA  and for dense genomic data  substantial linkage disequilibrium (LD) is expected between closely linked loci. Hence  the genomic variation  even with up to full sequence data  is likely largely explained by a smaller number of underlying components  i.e.  using principal component analysis  majority of the genomic variation can be described by a limited number of principal components (PC). For a genotype matrix  of size ()  assuming that  (more markers than individuals)  an economy-sized (i.e. only keeping PC with eigenvalues > 0) SVD e.g. [] would be: where  is    is   and  is a diagonal matrix of dimension   with singular values on the diagonal (square root of eigenvalues). Furthermore    and   while  (for ). The SVD (rectangular matrices) and eigenvalue decomposition (symmetric matrices) have previously been used in genomic models [  ]. The SNP-BLUP model can be re-parametrized into a PCRR model [] by defining  (PC regression coefficients). The model can be specified as: where  is as defined above  the score matrix   and . There is an exact relationship between solutions to Henderson’s mixed model equations (HMME) that correspond to the PCRR and MEM models  given as  []. As   this implies that   even when  (for example when the number of loci exceeds the number of animals)  a proof of which is in the Appendix. We illustrate this with the following small numerical example. Consider centered genotypes of four individuals with five loci as: which has more loci than animals. In addition  the genotypes of the four animals are not linearly independent  yielding a genotype matrix of rank 3. Assume that the four individuals have the following phenotypes: . Then  using  gives the following SNP effect solutions:  As  has rank 3  it can be decomposed as   keeping the first three components. The SVD matrices of  are: Hence    although . The SNP-BLUP equations can then be re-arranged into an equivalent PCRR equation system (see Appendix): Note that . Predictions of individual genetic effects can then be obtained as: In this system of equations  there are (at most)  independent effects to be estimated  rather than  effects (number of loci)  and both  and  are diagonal matrices. Hence  the entire left-hand side of the BLUP equation system is diagonal  with diagonal elements . This equation system is extremely easy to solve  even for very large  and many genotypes and animals. The main challenge thus lies in performing SVD of matrix . Although both population size and the number of loci can be substantial  the effective number of loci is limited by   which may be rather small in farmed animal populations. According to Meuwissen et al. []  the effective number of loci in a population is:   where  is the genome length in Morgans. For example  for a population of  and     i.e. about 67 effective loci per Morgan. This can be explained by genomic data coming from larger haplotype blocks with restricted recombination  and a reduced number of PC can thus explain all or nearly all genetic variation  even for very large populations  when  is limited (the smallest PC may actually capture genotyping errors or extremely rare alleles). Still  computing a low-rank approximation of  through SVD of the entire genotype dataset can be computationally very demanding for large  and . One possibility is to perform SVD on a subset of the individuals  which will be referred to as the core sample  equivalent to the core sample of the APY algorithm []  and use the results for reduced-rank approximation of the entire genomic dataset. The core sample should be representative of the population and sufficiently large such that all or nearly all genetic variation is captured  but at the same time be restricted to a computationally manageable size. More specifically  a reduced matrix  e.g.  rows (individuals) of the genotype matrix  are extracted  resulting in the matrix: For a population with limited   it is expected that a representative and moderately sized core sample would span nearly all genetic variation in the population. Hence  for increasing   the most important eigenvectors of  will approach the most important eigenvectors of the entire   i.e. the first few columns in  likely approach the first few columns in . Hence   can be used to approximate the scores for the non-core animals. In the case where SVD is performed on the entire dataset  the score matrix is: . For a reduced-dimension model  the score matrix is:   where  includes the first  eigenvectors of . As now SVD is performed on a smaller core sample  the reduced-dimension score matrix can be estimated by replacing  with  (i.e. the first  eigenvectors of ): The model can now be written as: and the PCRR equation system becomes: Now   (i.e.  has replaced  from the entire population). Note that  is not a diagonal matrix. The dimension of this equation system (genomic effects) is the number of chosen components (based on the core sample)   . Hence  given that an SVD can be performed on the  genomic dataset of the core sample  a direct solution to the (maximum)  PCRR equation system would be straightforward. Alternatively  dimensionality reduction and SVD of the entire genomic data set can be performed in three steps: (1) SVD on genomic data of the core sub-sample; (2) dimensionality reduction of the entire genomic data  set using Eq. ()  resulting in the reduced-dimension matrix ; and (3) SVD of  (without further dimensionality reduction)  resulting in a score matrix  of the entire genomic data set . Hence: Now: . The model is now: Here  . Note that  has the same dimension as   but  (diagonal) and . The PCRR equation system is thus: for which the coefficient matrix is diagonal  making the equation system easy to solve. A small numerical example illustrates the method. Consider the genotypes of five individuals (the four given in the earlier example and an additional animal): . This centered genotype matrix still has rank 3 and  thus  there is room for dimension reduction. The genotype of the last individual is identical to the first individual  and thus we consider the first four individuals as core sample and use this in SVD (keeping the first three components): Matrix  can be used directly in PCRR. Assume that the five individuals have the following phenotypes (assuming no fixed effects):  and . Then  solving the equation system:   yields  and . Note that  is not a diagonal matrix. Alternatively  a second-stage SVD can be performed  giving . Now: . Here   (diagonal) and solving the equation system  yields   and   i.e. exactly the same animal solutions as above. The SVD can be performed independently (in parallel) on different genome segments (in this case  chromosomes). This implies that different (but not necessarily fully independent) sets of PC are chosen for each segment. For the core sample  the economy-sized SVD of chromosome  is thus: As above  the approximated score matrix  of  can be computed in three steps: (1) perform chromosome-wise SVD on a core sample of genomic data for each chromosome (same core individuals for all chromosomes); (2) compute chromosome-specific reduced rank  for all individuals (core and non-core) and concatenate these into ; and (3) perform SVD of  and compute the reduced dimension score matrix  (without further rank reduction). The entire genotype matrix across all chromosomes can then be approximated as: The model and equation system are then as described above (Eqs.  and ). As above  matrix  can also be used directly in PCRR  although the mixed model coefficient matrix may be dense (but of reduced dimensionality). For each chromosome  the effective number of segregating loci is much smaller than for the whole genome  implying that fewer PC () will be needed per chromosome than for the whole genome. The total number of chosen PC (at most   where  is the number of chromosomes) is   where  is the number of chosen PC for chromosome . Still  since SVD of the core sample genomic data is performed chromosome-wise  the final number of chosen PC may potentially exceed the number of animals in the core subpopulation. This implies that genetic variation of the core and non-core subpopulations is assumed to be explained by a limited number of common components (i.e. haplotype blocks)  and that the number of components that segregate in the core may be larger than the number of core individuals. In contrast  the APY algorithm assumes that all genetic variation is explained by the additive genetic effects of the core individuals  rather than by the haplotype blocks that segregate among those individuals. Single-step genomic analyses are widely used in the analysis of real data. As mentioned earlier  the (original) single-step equation system requires the inverse of the GRM  to be computed prior to analysis. If inversion is done by “brute force”  large-scale analyses that potentially include millions of genotyped animals will be virtually impossible to perform. However  in the following section we describe how the GRM for such data can be effectively approximated through SVD techniques and how the exact inverse of an approximated GRM can be obtained. If SVD of  can be performed as described above: . A PC-based GRM then is: where   with  being a vector of SNP allele frequencies in the population. An actual inverse of  may not exist  as  may not have full rank (even with very dense SNP data)  while a reduced-rank  (rank ) is never invertible. As above  this problem can be circumvented by replacing  with   where  is a small value (e.g. 10) to ensure that  is positive definite and thus can be inverted. Using the Woodbury formula []  the exact inverse of  is: where  is an identity matrix of dimension  (number of chosen PC summed over all chromosomes). The only matrix that needs to be inverted explicitly is   which is diagonal. Hence  given that  and  are available  computing  is not very demanding. Furthermore  the inverse relationships can be computed row by row as: The above inverse of GRM requires an SVD of the  matrix (as described in the stepwise procedures above). However  since   the above inverse of the GRM can also be computed as: Thus  the only explicit inverse needed here is   which is of full rank and has dimension . For example   10 000 components may be sufficient to describe essentially all genetic variation  even for a large genotyped population if it has limited . Under these assumptions  an inverse of GRM can be computed for any number of genotyped individuals. Fernando et al. [] suggested a QR decomposition of the  matrix  which is generally faster than SVD. A QR decomposition of matrix   of dimension   with   is: where  is a  matrix with orthogonal columns (i.e. )  while  is a  upper triangular matrix. Furthermore  . The genomic relationship matrix for the core sample is: As in the APY algorithm  this method assumes that (nearly) all genetic variation is captured by the additive genetic effects of individuals in the core sample. For the entire dataset  (sorted such that the core sample comes first)  this implies that: where     and  is the genotype matrix of all non-core individuals. The GRM can thus be approximated as: where  is a  matrix  which is considerably smaller than the original  (). This approach is equivalent to strategy IV of Fernando et al. [] (except that core animals are assumed to explain nearly all genomic variation rather than all genomic variation exactly). Here  genotypes of all animals are expressed as linear functions of genotypes of a reduced set of animals (rows in the genotype matrix). In their case  this result was used to compute a reduced set of components. Here  instead we use  to compute a QR-based inverse of GRM (QRIG) as: Thus  the only part that needs to be inverted explicitly is the  matrix . The QR factorization can  as for SVD  be parallelized through chromosome-wise factorizations. Then  an overall QR is performed on the combined  matrix: where  is an  matrix that is obtained from QR factorization of the genomic data on chromosome  and  is a genome-wide matrix. The QRIG algorithm is well suited for reduced-rank approximations down to the size of the core sample. However  reducing rank below the size of the core sample would not be optimal (e.g. in chromosome-wise analysis)  as this implies a reduction in the size of the core sample. For such situations  the PCIG approach is more appropriate because this method uses all available information in the core sample to estimate a reduced number of contributing components. As in MEM  different loci can be given different relative weights in the genomic animal model by weighting SNPs differently in the calculation of the GRM  as: where  is a diagonal matrix of locus weights (proportional to the variance of the effect of each locus) and   with  being a vector of allele frequencies in the population  and . In the simplest case  i.e. using VanRaden Method 2 []  elements of  are: . The GRM can then be approximated as: where   i.e. a symmetric matrix with dimension equal to the number of chosen components. The exact inverse of the approximated genomic relationship matrix is: Using this method  a weighted genomic relationship matrix can be used even for single-step animal models. A simulation study was performed to verify the reduced-rank approximation of genomic data. The simulated species had 20 chromosomes of 1 Morgan each. Simulation of sequence data followed the approach of Meuwissen and Goddard []  except that their scaling argument was not applied here  in order not to scale down the computations. The historical effective population size was 1000  which also reflects its actual size  since simulation of new generations followed Wright’s idealized population structure. To create LD and mutation-drift equilibria  the historical population was simulated for 10 000 generations. The per meiosis and per base pair mutation rate was 10 and mutations followed the infinite sites model []. After the initial 10 000 generations   was reduced to 100 over 10 generations to mimic a livestock population. In the last generation  10 000 animals were generated and their genotypes and phenotypes were used in genetic analysis. The total number of segregating loci in generation 10 000 was 531 836  of which about half (279 504) were still segregating in the last generation (generation 10 010). Per chromosome  200 SNPs with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.01 were randomly sampled as causative SNPs  i.e. 4000 causative SNPs in total. Genotypes were standardized to    and  for the genotypes ‘0 0’  ‘0 1’ and ‘1 1’  respectively  where  is the frequency of the ‘1’ allele  and collected in the genotype matrix . True genetic values of the animals were obtained as: where  is a (531 836 × 1) vector  including 4000 quantitative trait loci (QTL) (SNPs that were declared as QTL) effects  which were sampled from a normal distribution  and effects of non-causative SNPs set to 0. All QTL effects were scaled by  such that total additive genetic variance in generation 10 001 was . Residual environmental effects were sampled from   with  set such that heritability was 0.25  0.50 or 0.90. No fixed effects were simulated. The resulting dataset was analyzed with several statistical models: Ordinary GBLUP Reduced-rank PCRR (chromosome-wise SVD) GBLUP using reduced-dimension approximations of GRM Chromosome-wise SVD (PCIG-C) Genome-wide SVD (PCIG-G) QR-based (genome-wide) APY (genome-wide) where  is an approximation of   using the PCIG-G  PCIG-C  QRIG  or APY algorithms. The chromosome-wise SVD (PCRR or PCIG-C) was performed independently for each chromosome based on a core sample of 500  1000 or 2000 individuals. For each chromosome  the number of components was set such that > 99% of the chromosome-specific genomic variation (in the core) was explained by the chosen PC. These PC were then used to compute . For the PCIG-G  an economy-sized SVD was performed across all chromosomes for the core sample (500 to 2000 individuals) and  thus  the final number of components was equal to the core sample size. The QR-based algorithm was based on all genotypes of the core sample  while the APY algorithm was based on genomic relationships of core sample individuals. All models and algorithms were compared based on their accuracy of predicting the true breeding values of validation animals that had masked phenotypes. Validation animals were randomly sampled among non-core animals (with a probability of 10%). Data preparation and statistical analyses were performed using Julia software scripts (). All solutions were obtained by solving the mixed model equations directly. The PCIG-C and APY algorithms were also used in a single-step multi-trait genomic evaluation of a real dataset  which was comprised of data from the Irish beef cattle carcass evaluation and included 8.33 million animals with records on nine traits. The model used was identical (excluding genetic groups) to the standard Irish beef cattle evaluation model []. There were 13.35 million animals in the pedigree  of which 163 277 were genotyped. Genotyping was done by using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 Bead Chip (Illumina  San Diego  USA)  of which 54 620 SNPs on 29 autosomes were included in the analysis (after quality edits). The population was heterogeneous and included genotypes of animals from 41 breeds. Hence  the dataset was challenging in the sense that a large core sample was needed to capture genetic variation in all breeds. For PCIG-C  the number of components per chromosome was set such that it explained a given percentage (from 90 to 95%) of the chromosome-specific genomic variation and core sample sizes were 30 000 to 50 000. The resulting estimated breeding values (EBV) using the PCIG-C and APY inverse GRM were compared with the original EBV based on direct inversion of . The analysis was conducted using an iterative solver in the MIX99 software ()  using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method and iteration on data. A value of  = 10 was added to the diagonal elements of the GRM to ensure that the matrix was positive definite. Two simple Julia scripts are attached  demonstrating 1) how to use SVD methods to compute reduced-dimension approximations of a larger genomic data using a core sample (Additional file )  and 2) how to combine reduced-dimension genomic data from multiple chromosomes in computation of an inverse approximated genomic relationship matrix (Additional file ). When based on the same PC  the PCIG and PCRR models are equivalent  except that for PCIG a small number is added to the diagonal elements of the GRM prior to inversion. Thus  for the simulation study  the results of PCIG and PCRR were nearly identical and only results for PCIG are shown. The correlations of the EBV from each model with the EBV of the full-dimensional GBLUP are in Fig. . Correlations of genomic estimated breeding values for validation animals obtained using chromosome-wise PCIG (PCIG-C)  genome-wise PCIG (PCIG-G)  QR-based inversion (QRIG) and the APY GBLUP (APY) with those obtained using ordinary GBLUP. Based on simulated data with heritability equal to 0.25 ()  0.50 ()  and 0.90 () In general  across core sample sizes (500 to 2000) and heritabilities (0.25 to 0.90)  the PCIG-C model resulted in very similar EBV as GBLUP  with EBV correlations ranging from 0.997 to 1.000. The results were less favorable for models PCIG-G  APY and QRIG (EBV correlations ranging from 0.847 to 0.984). Differences of the PCIG-C from the other models were largest for the lowest core sample sizes (500) and highest heritability (0.90). With respect to accuracy of selection (correlation between EBV and true breeding value)  GBLUP and PCIG-C had very similar and generally higher accuracies than the other models (Fig. )  0.82  0.88 and 0.95 for heritability equal to 0.25  0.50 and 0.90  respectively. Accuracies of genomic estimated breeding values (correlation with true breeding values) for validation animals  using chromosome-wise PCIG (PCIG-C)  genome-wise PCIG (PCIG-G)  QR-based inversion (QRIG) and the APY GBLUP (APY). Based on simulated data with heritability equal to 0.25 ()  0.50 ()  and 0.90 (). Accuracies of the original GBLUP method were essentially identical to those from PCIG-C and are not shown Differences in accuracy of GBLUP/PCIG-C from the other models were largest at the lowest core samples and highest heritabilities (e.g. for a core sample of 500 and heritability 0.90  accuracy was 0.95 for GBLUP/PCIG-C vs. 0.81 for the other methods). At the lowest core sample size (500)  genomic relationships were so crudely described by PCIG-G  APY and QRIG that very little information was obtained by changing the heritability from 0.25 to 0.90. At higher core sample sizes  the differences between GBLUP/PCIG-C and the other methods were smaller  but not negligible  even at core sample sizes up to 2000. As a result  PCIG-C was much more robust to core sample size and achieved comparable results to the full-dimension GBLUP  even at the smallest core sizes tested. Using PCIG-C  the average number of PC needed to capture at least 99% of the genomic variation per chromosome was 239  298 and 340 for  respectively  500  1000 and 2000 animals in the core (4770  5959 and 6795 components across all chromosomes). Hence  for this data structure  the genomic relationships could be effectively approximated with a limited number of chromosome-specific PC  even when estimated from core sample sizes down to 500 individuals. With respect to computing time  QR decomposition (QRIG) required down to 18% less computing time than SVD (PCIG models) when applied to genomic data on single chromosomes (~ 25 k loci). The relative difference in computation time between QR and SVD was largest at smaller core samples. However  at small core samples  both methods were fast  making the relative difference in computing time less important. For the real data analysis of the multiple-breed beef cattle population using PCIG-C  the results were essentially identical for core sample sizes of 30 000 and 50 000  hence only results of the latter are presented. Correlations of EBV from the PCIG-C single step models with EBV from the original GBLUP (direct inversion) model were high for all traits (0.995 to 0.999  0.998 to 0.999  and 1.000 when the chosen components explained = 85  = 90 and = 95% of chromosomal genomic variance  respectively). The corresponding numbers of chosen components were 30 208 (= 85%)  34 655 (= 90%)  and 40 140 (= 95%). APY based on a core sample size of 50 000 individuals resulted in almost identical ranking of animals based on EBV as the original model (rank correlations ranging from 0.999 to 1.000)  while the rank of animals based on an APY of a core sample of 30 000 individuals (corresponding in rank (i.e. no of PC) with PCIG-C = 85%) had a slightly lower correlation with the rank from the original model (0.952 to 0.996). For a similar rank (~ 30 000) of the GRM (number of chosen PC in PCIG and number of core animals in APY)  PCIG-C needed a smaller number of iterations to converge (1351 to 1385 vs. 1619 to 1756  for PCIG-C and APY  respectively). Computing times could not be compared directly  as these may have been influenced by other jobs running simultaneously on the computer cluster. When based on the same PC  the PCRR and PCIG algorithms gave identical EBV. However  the PCIG algorithm is more flexible in that it can easily be incorporated into existing single-step genomic animal models. The results of the current study show that all reduced-dimension algorithms (PCRR  PCIG-C  PCIG-G  APY and QRIG) approach the GBLUP solutions when core sample size becomes large. However  the PCRR and PCIG-C algorithms were  by far  the most robust to reductions in core sample size. For the simulated data  the EBV were virtually identical to the EBV obtained with full-dimension GBLUP for all core sample sizes (even down to 500 individuals) and heritabilities  with correlations between EBV ranging from 0.997 to 1.000. For the other methods  accuracy of selection dropped considerably at smaller core sample sizes (500 and 1000)  especially with high heritability. In the real data analysis of a multi-breed beef cattle population  core sample size was generally large and differences between methods were thus smaller  but still in the favor of PCIG-C compared with APY. The PCIG algorithm can be used to calculate the exact inverse of an approximated GRM  even for extremely large genomic datasets that potentially contain millions of individuals and loci  using a limited number of PC per chromosome. The SVD-based PCIG-C uses all genetic data from the core sample to identify the more important PC for each chromosome  and the GRM is based on these. The method can be heavily parallelized  since SVD is performed separately for each chromosome. The number of PC needed to describe the relationship structure of a population depends on the effective number of segregating genomic segments in the population  which for large populations of limited  is typically much smaller than the actual population size (). After SVD  the inverse of GRM (using PCIG) can be computed easily  and potentially row- or element-wise  which gives room for further parallelization. Hence  computing time can be reduced substantially. Using iteration on data  rows of the inverse of GRM can be computed directly during iteration and  thus  the entire inverse GRM does not need to be stored explicitly. In contrast  when performing “brute force” inversion of the entire GRM  memory requirements increase quadratically and numbers of computations increase cubically with the number of animals in the population []. Compared with PCIG  QRIG algorithm based on QR-decomposition was slightly faster and has potential for parallelization (by chromosome). However  this model is less well suited for dimensionality reduction below core sample size (e.g. per chromosome) and is more sensitive to size of the core sample. Thus  we prefer the PCIG-C over the QRIG algorithm. The PCIG algorithm proposed in this study is related to the APY algorithm []  since both methods use genomic data in a core sample to approximate the (inverse) GRM of all animals. In APY  the core sample must be sufficiently small such that the inverse of the core GRM can be computed directly  and the remaining elements of the entire inverse of GRM are computed based on the inverse relationships of the core individuals and the relationships between core and non-core individuals. Furthermore  APY assumes that the non-core part of the inverse GRM is diagonal  while PCIG makes no such assumptions. Using PCIG  the GRM is approximated by a limited number of PC and by adding a small number to the diagonal elements  while the inverse of this matrix is computed by exact methods. Hence  given that the GRM can be appropriately approximated using PC estimated from the core sample  the computed inverse of GRM from PCIG will necessarily also be appropriate  which explains why solutions from reduced-rank PCIG-C were nearly identical to those obtained from full-dimension GBLUP in this study  even at the smallest core sample sizes. The genome-wide PCIG-G gave similar solutions as APY and (genome-wide) QRIG  which can be explained by the fact that the maximum number of components in genome-wide analysis is limited by the size of the core sample  while the maximum number of components in chromosome-wise PCIG-C is larger (size of core sample x number of chromosomes). For PCIG-G  APY and QRIG this is an especially limiting factor in smaller core samples  as observed with the simulated dataset  e.g. for these genome-wide methods a core size of 500 imply that the GRM is approximated by  at most  500 “components” (PC or animal effects) while up to 10 000 PC may be used in the PCRR/PCIG-C models. Genetic analyses based on chromosome-wise SVD of a core sample assumes that genetic variation associated with each chromosome can be explained by the chosen chromosome-specific components (i.e. haplotype blocks)  and that the same components are present and responsible for genetic variation in the entire population. In contrast  the APY algorithm assumes that all genetic variation in the population is explained by the additive genetic effects of individuals in the core sample  i.e. that breeding values of non-core individuals are merely functions of breeding values of the core individuals. This implies that  if accuracies of core individuals approach unity (e.g. bulls with large daughter groups)  accuracy of the entire genotyped population is also assumed to approach unity  even for newly born genotyped individuals  which is not likely to be true. Even if thousands of historical bulls with progeny are included in the core sample  the EBV of a genotyped calf is not expected to be perfect. In PCIG-C  a more realistic approach is taken  since the accuracy of non-core animals depends on the precision of the estimated effects of the underlying PC  rather than on the accuracy of the EBV of core animals. The number of underlying components may exceed the number of core individuals and  thus  a high accuracy of the EBV of core animals does not imply high accuracies for all underlying components. Thus  as the EBV of non-core animals are functions of these components  genotyped newborn animals are not necessarily assumed to be predicted accurately  even if the core animals are accurate. In real data  population structures may be more complex and stratified. Hence  real data analyses of complex populations may require larger core samples  e.g. as in the real multi-population dataset analyzed here. The methods used herein  only consider simple SNP-BLUP or genomic animal models  where  a priori  genetic variance is evenly distributed across the genome. However  such simplistic models likely do not use the full potential of high-density or sequence data  which may include genotypes of the causative mutations themselves. One alternative is to combine SVD techniques with methods that allow for different weighting of the SNPs in the model (i.e. approximating Bayesian variable selection models). This approach is described and evaluated in a separate study []. We propose SVD-based methods for genomic prediction. Although SVD may be computationally demanding  the analysis can be performed on a reduced core sample of individuals and/or in parallel on different genome segments  making fast computation possible. After SVD  large-scale genomic analysis can be performed either by PC ridge regression (PCRR) or by a genomic animal model (GBLUP)  with the GRM and its inverse defined by the chosen PC (PCIG). The principal component-based GRM is not of full rank but can be made invertible by adding a small number to the diagonal of the entire matrix  and its exact inverse can be easily obtained using the Woodbury formula. The inverse of the SVD-based GRM can be computed row- or element-wise  and the entire matrix does not need to be stored explicitly  e.g. when applying iteration on data. Based on simulated data  PCRR/PCIG models based on chromosome-wise SVD of genomic data from a limited core sample resulted in essentially identical solutions for the entire population as the full-dimension GBLUP model (correlations between EBV = 1.000)  while other methods (genome-wide SVD  QRIG and APY) were less accurate  especially at smaller core sample sizes.

We confirm the occurrence of a native  population in southern Argentina on the coast of Patagonia. Correct recognition and identification of species are important to understand the phylogeography of living resources and to ensure the conservation of their biodiversity  their management  sustainable exploitation and traceability. The world production of mussels   spp.  including exploitation of natural populations and aquaculture  is approximately 1.2 million tons per year [  ]. Aquaculture activities include the transfer of spat and live adult mussels between geographic locations  which may result in large-scale changes in the world distribution of  taxa [  ].  taxa are morphologically similar and difficult to distinguish. Replacement of native species by an invasive taxon can go unnoticed []. Individuals from different  taxa can hybridize in areas where their populations merge and coexist. Hybridization zones have been described in the Danish Straits at the entrance to the Baltic Sea [   ]  on the Atlantic coasts of France []  Great Britain [  ]  Greenland []  and the Atlantic coast of Canada []. In addition  the occurrence of doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)  of recombination and introgression can hinder the use of mtDNA analyses for the identification of  taxa [   ]. Nuclear DNA markers including genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can indicate geographic origin of interbreeding taxa when hybridization occurs either naturally or results from the introduction of mussels to non-native regions [  ]. Introduction of   one of the most invasive mussel species  threatens native populations of  on a global scale [  ]. Irrespective of the ecological consequences  including reduction of abundance  introductions of this species have usually been followed by hybridization of  with native  taxa  i.e.  on the eastern and western North Pacific coasts [   ] and native Southern Hemisphere  in Australia and New Zealand [  ]. Michalek et al. [] reviewed the negative consequences of such hybridization events for the culture of  in Europe. The introduced  interbreeds with native  are cultivated in Scotland. Northern Hemisphere  is also a threat for local farms that are located south of the Gulf of Arauco in Chile and use native populations of  from South America []. The longest Pacific and Atlantic coastlines that are continuously inhabited by native populations of  are in South America. South American smooth shelled blue mussels of the genus  are present on the Atlantic coast of the south of Brazil []  through Uruguay and Argentina down to Tierra del Fuego [  ] and around Cape Horn  and then north into the Pacific to Golfo de Arauco  Chile []  where they inhabit both intertidal levels and deep banks. The nomenclature for these mussels has been controversial; they were classified based on fossil records and morphological data as  []   [  –] or .  []. The native species of  on the Atlantic coast of South America  i.e.  was described by d’Orbigny in 1846 [] using specimens that were collected from the area of Maldonado in Uruguay. The native species on the Pacific coast of South America  i.e.  was described by Hupé in 1856 [] based on specimens found near Concepcion in Chile. Argentine mussels  which were first identified as   were later synonymised to  or assigned a subspecies rank [  ]. Ecological studies also created confusion by assigning specific names  i.e. mussels from the south of Brazil  Uruguay and Buenos Aires province were designated  [  ] and later as  []  while those found in Atlantic Patagonian waters and gulfs were variably named  i.e.  []   [] and even   [  ]. Based on morphological characters such as color  hinge teeth  valve thickness and inferior margin  Castellanos [] named the Argentine mussel  to differentiate it from the Chilean mussel  . Later  these mussels were considered as subspecies ( and  ) since the number of diagnostic characters to assign them to species rank was not sufficient [  ]. For fishery management purposes  the names  and  have been used in Argentina and Chile  respectively. Aquaculture of Atlantic  was developed in Argentina []. Currently  suspended commercial cultures operate in Nuevo Gulf (Puerto Madryn)  San Jose Gulf (Isla de los Pájaros) and San Matías Gulf (San Antonio Oeste–Puerto Lobos) []. Production of cultured mussels ( and ) in Argentina fell from over 250 tons in 2011 to 11.20 tons in 2016 [  ]. Due to economic reasons   is cultivated only in the San Matías Gulf [] and  in the Canal Beagle  Ushuaia []. The natural distribution of Chilean mussels ranges from Bahia Concepcion (36°45'S) to Punta Arenas (53°S)  on the edge of the Strait of Magellan [  ]. There have been many studies to clarify their taxonomic status in connection with intensive aquaculture. Various studies using allozymes  nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers have led to contradictory results  depending on the type of marker used. The presence of  [  ] and  [        ] was reported in Chile  although it is not clear if these are native or introduced populations []  or even different species that may have been included in a single taxon as  []. Based on morphological and molecular analyses  Toro [] suggested that  was a subspecies     whereas Ouagajjou et al. [] in a study with microsatellites considered  to be a valid species. Analysis of mtDNA and nuclear DNA Me15/16 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) revealed the occurrence of native  and the alleged presence of the native Atlantic blue mussel  Northern Hemisphere    genes (not individuals) and hybrids ( × ) in the region of the Strait of Magellan []. Recent studies also consider that  should be named   [  ] or  []. A genetic analysis of  populations from Argentina and Uruguay using 30 enzyme loci and five DNA markers (-  -     and -) showed that native Atlantic South American populations are closely related to North Atlantic  []. Because these populations showed characteristic allele frequencies that differed from those of the Northern Hemisphere  at 10 loci  a taxon name   was proposed for native mussels from the Atlantic coasts of South America. Consequently  these names have been used in ecology and aquaculture-related publications e.g. [  ]. Based on a comparison of single sequences of their mitogenomes   and  were placed in the same clade  representing conspecific variants rather than distinct species []. In addition  the name  or  was proposed for all native  populations in South America []. To clarify the taxonomic status of native populations of smooth shelled mussels from the Pacific coast of South America  Larrain et al. [] used SNP analyses to characterize  taxa  including a set of reference samples from North America  Europe and New Zealand. According to their results  the Pacific coast South American native mussel is genetically distinct from the reference species    and   and should be recognised as  Hupé 1854 []. In our work  we used a similar set of SNPs to characterize  for the first time  populations of smooth shelled mussels  from the coast of South-Western Atlantic and adjacent waters. The aim of our research was to extend the knowledge of the taxonomic status and distribution along the Atlantic coast of South America and Patagonia of native  taxa and to identify areas where they are potentially endangered by hybridization with the invasive .  spp. samples that consisted of 359 individuals of mixed ages and sizes (5 to 50 mm) were collected from ten localities in Argentina and one from Chiloe in Chile between 2012 and 2014 (Fig. ; Table ). Specimens or tissue samples were stored in 96% ethanol or at - 70 °C. DNA was isolated from the mantle tissue  using a modified CTAB method according to Hoarau et al. []. Eight previously described reference samples were used:  from the Atlantic coast of USA [] and Northern Ireland [  ];  from the Northern Hemisphere  i.e. the Atlantic coast of Spain [  ] and Mediterranean Sea [    ] and from the Southern Hemisphere  i.e. New Zealand [];  from Canada  Halifax (based on hybrid index  [] and  from Punta Arenas  Chile []. Seventy-nine previously identified SNPs were used [        ]. Samples were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX genotyping platform []. Location of the 12 populations of  from Argentina and Chile  South America (Google Earth Pro). Sampling site names and coordinates are in Table  Arlequin v.3.5.1.2 [] was used to estimate allele frequencies  the proportion of polymorphic SNPs ()  minor allele frequency (MAF)  genetic diversity  observed () and expected () heterozygosity values for each locus and population. In addition  the statistical significance of the inbreeding coefficient  (> 0) was tested by 10 000 permutations of alleles between individuals. Departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested by exact test  and significance was determined by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The most informative loci were detected by identifying  outlier loci. The upper limits of the 95% confidence interval were identified with 20 000 iterations and characterized by estimating the 0.05 and the 0.95 and 0.99 quantiles of the distribution. The false discovery rate (FDR-BY) was applied to correct significance (P) values after multiple testing [  ]. Genetic differentiation between populations was determined based on allele frequencies of SNPs using pairwise  values in Arlequin. The  distance measures in the Newick format  which were obtained from SNP allele frequencies data in POPTREEW [] were used to construct a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree with the MEGA software version 6 []. Robustness of relationships was assessed using 10 000 bootstrap replicates. We used two methods for the population structure analyses. First  clustering analysis was carried out with the STRUCTURE v. 2.3.4 software [  ]. STRUCTURE was used under a model that assumes admixture  ignores population affiliation and allows for the correlation of allele frequencies between clusters. The admixture model used in this analysis allows individuals to have mixed ancestry  i.e. fractions of the genome can originate from different ancestors. The number of genetic clusters () was estimated by computing likelihood over 10 runs for values of  ranging from 1 to the number of populations studied plus 1. At the plateau of the graph curve  the value of  captures the main structure of the populations. The best-fit number of genetic clusters was determined by calculating the logarithmic probability LnP(K) using the <U+0394>K method []. Threshold q-values of 0.2 were used as a criterion to separate hybrids and pure mussels []. Individuals were considered residents if their q values were higher than 0.8 in the area where they were sampled. Individuals with q-values from 0.2 to 0.8 were considered to be potentially admixed  since they could not be readily assigned as residents or migrants []. A Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation was run for 100 000 iterations following a burn-in period of 50 000 iterations. Correspondence analysis (CA) [] implemented in GENETIX []  was used to visualize the genetic substructure at the population and individual levels. The results are presented as a scatter plot  with the axes representing the contribution of inertia of the data matrix in a way that is analogous to the total variance in allelic frequency. Genetic assignment was obtained by using two methods. Following the STRUCTURE analysis  each individual was assigned with high confidence when q was higher or equal to 0.8 for a single cluster. In the second method  assignment of individuals to population of origin was obtained by using the frequency criteria on the basis of multilocus genotype data [] in a self-assignment test with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure implemented in GeneClass2.0 []. Individuals were considered to be correctly assigned to their location of origin if the assignment probability to that group was higher than any other assignment probability to any other group. Following preliminary analyses that indicated that the Argentinian population of Puerto Madryn (PMD) contained possible hybrids  the software NewHybrids v1 [] was used to estimate the posterior probability that individuals from PMD fell into each of the six genotypic categories (or classes corresponding to hybrid categories): native     F1 hybrids  F2 hybrids and two types of backcrosses. Of the 79 SNPs assayed  55 were successfully genotyped with an acceptable quality score  and among these  51 were polymorphic for 562 mussels from 19 samples [see Additional file : Table S1]. Of these 51 SNPs  46 (90.2%) were located in coding regions  among which only three were non-synonymous and five (9.8%) were located in non-coding regions. Six loci were polymorphic in mussels from all samples [see Additional file : Table S2]. MAF per locus ranged from 0 to 0.362 (BM32A) with a mean (± SD) of 0.078 ± 0.091 across all loci. Only five loci in single populations were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) after correction for multiple testing.  values at individual SNPs ranged from 0.014 to 1 [see Additional file : Table S1]. Twenty-three SNPs had  values significantly different from zero. Several groups of samples were tested to detect highly informative SNPs that are effective for differentiation between groups. Populations and individuals (hybrids) with an admixture of different groups (taxa) were excluded from the analysis. An outlier test was carried out for the group of eight populations from Argentina (without PMD and UBC) and the group of reference samples from Chile  USA  Canada  Northern Ireland  Spain  Italy and New Zealand. The test indicated 14 outlier loci  of which seven were characteristic only for  and seven (BM101A  BM106B  BM12A  BM151A  BM17B  BM21B and BM6C) that differentiated the Argentinian samples. These latter same seven SNPs were identified as outliers in a test between  and  samples. Four SNPs were effective at differentiating between the Argentinian and Chilean populations  and among these  two were significant also in the outlier analysis (BM151A and BM21B) while BM203C and BM57A were new. Subsequently  an outlier test was carried out to detect SNPs that could differentiate populations from Argentina and  samples from America and Europe. This test highlighted six outlier SNPs (BM106B  BM12A  BM12C  BM21B  BM21C and BM5D)  of which three had not been previously reported. These findings show that 19 SNPs are sufficient to differentiate Argentinian populations from those of all other regions and highlighted their distinct taxon status. Five SNPs were identified as highly informative (P < 0.01): BM106B  BM12A  BM151A  BM21B  and BM6C. The proportion of polymorphic SNPs () ranged from 29.4 to 60.8% between populations  the lowest proportions being observed in most of the Argentinian populations. The values of     gene diversity within populations were highest for the Argentinian PMD population  in which individuals of mixed origin were observed (Table ). Based on the  measures (averaged across all polymorphic loci in each population)  an excess of homozygotes was found only in one population from Argentina (COM) and two reference samples (IRD  KKAT). We constructed a neighbour-joining tree based on  distance measures to detect the genetic relationships within 19 samples [see Additional file : Figure S1]. This identified five groups of populations i.e.     Northern and Southern Hemisphere    and   and one sample (PMD) that exhibited admixture in the  taxa. The population from Ushuaia (UBC) clustered with . Internal branches were short between  and  populations  whereas they were long between  and  populations. Pairwise  values were significantly different from zero after FDR-BY correction between most pairs of samples (Fig. ) and [see Additional file : Table S3]. The largest differences were observed between  and southern  from Akaroa  New Zealand (reaching values as high as 0.84). Pairwise  estimates between the seven populations from Argentina () were not significantly different from zero (0 to 0.025)  which indicated that these seven populations are mostly homogenous. Matrix of pairwise  for 19  spp. samples based on 51 SNPs To characterize the population structure of   correspondence analyses (CA) were carried out on 18 samples of      and   by excluding  for higher resolution (Fig. ). Figure  shows a clear separation between  and the other samples along axis 1.  and  individuals formed very tight groups  in contrast to the    and most PMD individuals  which displayed more dispersion. The PMD sample occupied a central position between all other samples and overlapped only with  from the Atlantic coast of Europe (CAM). The first two axes of the correspondence analysis (CA) computed from the SNP data on ten populations from Argentina and reference populations of    and  from America  Europe and New Zealand. Each dot (point) is an individual STRUCTURE analysis showed that the LnP(D) increase was largest (i.e. <U+0394>K was highest) for  = 3  and then  = 5. This result indicated that the best-fit number of genetic clusters was found for  = 3  for which differentiation between clusters corresponding to    and all other  taxa occurred. The high value of <U+0394>K for  = 5 suggested further subdivision  with five clusters corresponding to five taxa:        and  (Fig. ). These results confirmed the close relationship between    and  taxa. Structure plots for the 19 studied populations (K = 5). Each individual is represented by a single vertical line broken into five coloured segments  with lengths proportional to each of the K inferred clusters. Abbreviation of the samples is provided in Table . Vertical black lines separate the populations Using the panel of 51 SNPs  two methods of analysis were used to test the assignment of individuals from Argentina to the most likely population and regions  based on reference taxa. In the STRUCTURE analysis at  = 5  most of the 562 individuals were properly assigned to their original samples with a genome admixture value q higher than 0.8 [see Additional file : Table S4]. Eight populations from Argentina clustered together ()  whereas the sample from Ushuaia (UBC) clustered with the two  samples from Chile. A few exceptions were observed: one individual from UBC was assigned to   single individuals from ARG73 and IRD were considered potentially admixed ( ×  and  ×   respectively). Furthermore  the entire PMD population from Argentina showed very high levels of admixture: one individual was assigned to  with q higher than 0.8  whereas all other individuals were ambiguously assigned to two clusters  mainly to  and   with q ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. In addition  two individuals were assigned to two other clusters  and   and  and . In general  most individuals had the highest q for the  cluster followed by the  cluster. Individuals were assigned to baseline populations based on region of origin with a success rate of 97.8% using GeneClass2 [see Additional file : Table S4]. We performed a new (second) assignment analysis of the PMD population after removing the PMD sample from the baseline populations to identify the region of origin and found that 45% of the individuals from Puerto Madryn were assigned to  from the Mediterranean and Atlantic populations and more than 30% to the Argentinian population from Isla de los Pajáros (IPL). Four individuals were placed in the  population from North America and  for one individual the highest probability occurred for  populations from Chile (PZC). Because most of the individuals from PMD were assigned mainly to two clusters using STRUCTURE analysis   and Northern Hemisphere   we carried out additional analyses to identify the type of hybrid (F1 or F2). Using the program NewHybrids  19 SNPs that are effective at differentiating between populations from Argentina were used to analyze all the Argentinian populations and three groups of reference samples:   Northern Hemisphere   and . All PMD individuals were identified as hybrids except one that was classified as  and F2 hybrids that carry  and  alleles were detected in 88.89% of the PMD individuals with a probability higher than 90%. We did not identify any F1 hybrids and detected only one backcross (probability of ~ 60%) to . In addition  using  as a reference sample  two F2 hybrids that carry  and  (PMD) alleles and  and  (ARG73) alleles were identified. To determine the degree of similarity between taxa  we compared the different groups of populations without hybrids (admixture individuals). We constructed a NJ tree by using only non-admixed individuals as identified by STRUCTURE and GeneClass2 analysis  which revealed five well-supported clades that coincide with five separate taxa:        and  (Fig. ). Based on pairwise  values   samples differed from  samples ( = 0.421) and  samples ( ranging from 0.395 for American to 0.552 for European individuals) [see Additional file : Table S5].  samples differed from Mediterranean  ( = 0.65). The level of differentiation observed between  and  was comparable to that between  and Atlantic  ( = 0.427  on average) and was highest between  and  and Southern Hemisphere  taxa ( values as high as 0.797). Neighbour-joining tree of  spp. samples from Argentina and reference populations of      and  from America  Europe and New Zealand based on the  distance measures obtained with POPTREEW and visualised with MEGA version 6. NJ tree constructed using individuals without admixture (q > 0.8 or q < 0.2) identified by STRUCTURE analysis (K = 5) Overall  these results indicate that the samples of  in Argentina were composed of three groups: (1) eight samples of native   (2) a southern group represented by the UBC population of native Chilean blue mussel ()  and (3) the population from Puerto Madryn (PMD) composed of hybrid individuals (mostly between  and ). Argentinian populations showed a low level of hybridization  with the exception of the PMD population  which is composed mainly of hybrid individuals. In most previous studies of South American smoothed-shelled blue mussel  populations e.g. [  ]  only a small number of nuclear DNA markers  allozymes or mtDNA markers with limited resolution power was used. Recently  the efficiency of SNP analyses to study the genetic characteristics of hatchery and wild populations has been reported []. In our study  we carried out a thorough population genetic analysis and  for the first time  we show that  populations from the Atlantic coast of South America and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego are strongly differentiated and belong to at least three taxa. Native  is a separate taxon from other  species  including native .  predominates on the Argentinian coast south of Rio de La Plata  whereas  inhabits the southernmost part of the South American coasts including the area of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Invasive European  and introgressed specimens were found in one location (PMD). These findings shed new light on the genetic relationships between South American  taxa.  was first described by d’Orbigny in 1846 [] based on contemporary and paleontological samples that were collected from the area of Maldonaldo  Uruguay (Rio de la Plata) on the Atlantic coast. Based on ecological studies of coastal ecosystems and on toxicology analyses in fisheries and aquaculture of smooth shelled mussels  the presence of  () was reported on the Atlantic coast  from Uruguay including Maldonaldo in the north [    ] and at Mar del Plata on artificial reefs [] to Golfo San Matias  Bahía San Julián  Santa Cruz Province and the Rio Gallegos Estuary  Patagonia  in the south [      ]. Furthermore  occurrence of  () on the Argentinian coast of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego including the Ushuaia Bay was tentatively assumed from studies on similar topics [  ]. In our study  we detected only one native individual  ×  hybrid and one  ×  hybrid in more northern sampling sites. Oyarzún et al. [] reported the occurrence of large numbers of hybrids between  and native Atlantic  in the Magellan Region (southern Chile). However  since they used molecular markers with lower diagnostic power for Southern Hemisphere  taxa  their results cannot be directly compared with those reported here. We observed no hybridization in populations of  from neighbouring sampling sites (Punta Arenas and Ushuaia) and detected only pure individuals of  and one  individual in the area of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Based on the use of single molecular markers  hybridization of invasive Northern Hemisphere  with Southern Hemisphere native mussels in Chile  New Zealand and Australia was reported [    ] and recently confirmed using SNP genotyping for populations from New Zealand and Chile [  ]. We used almost the same set of SNPs to investigate ten populations from Argentina. Our findings point to a local invasion and colonization event. No deficiency of heterozygotes was found within the PMD population  which suggests the absence of reproductive barriers. This contrasts with analyses on hybrid populations from Scotland  Barents Sea  Norway and Greenland for which there is a deficiency of heterozygotes [  ]. The introduction of  from the Northern Hemisphere might be related to past aquaculture activities in the Nuevo Gulf  although Dellatorre et al. [] clearly stated that the cultivated mussels in a long-line system in Argentina originate from a natural settlement of . In addition  the National authorities in Argentina did not issue any permission for any experiment related to the introduction of  (Marcela Alvarez  Subsecretaría de Pesca de la Nación  personal communication). It was further confirmed that no related aquaculture experiments were performed in Argentina (Mario Lasta  Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero  Mar Del Plata  personal communication). Another more likely scenario is the accidental introduction of  by means of ship transportation. Fishing vessels as well as big cruise ships enter Puerto Madryn from Europe  North America and Chile [] with the problems of biofouling (accumulation of aquatic microorganisms  plants and animals on hull submerged surfaces) and the discharge of ballast waters []  which releases these organisms in the environment. A previous study reported a high percentage of exotic and invasive species including unidentified  sp. in the Puerto Madryn local ecosystem []. For example  the Mytilid  was transported to Puerto Madryn (Nuevo Gulf) by a fishing vessel and released during in-water hull cleaning []  which constitutes an example of introduction of a species similar to . The presence of Southern Hemisphere  was detected in Punta Arenas and named M.  Lmk 1819 []. However  Lamarck [] originally described  from Port du Roi George  Nouvelle-Hollande (present day Albany  Australia) in 1819. To confirm or not its occurrence in South America  new genetic markers such as SNPs could be used. However  our results did not confirm its presence in the studied area and a study of  populations from Chile  including Punta Arenas did not detect it []. Therefore  there is no evidence supporting the potential existence of  in South America []. We have demonstrated that  (or ) and  are differentiated and native taxa in South America  which indicates a distinct evolutionary history of  taxa from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Our analysis identified 19 SNPs (five of which are highly informative) that are effective in differentiating populations from Argentina.  is endangered by hybridization with the introduced European  in one area in Argentina (Puerto Madryn)  presumably due to accidental introduction from ship traffic. We also confirmed the occurrence of  on the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego  southern coast of Argentina. Knowledge of the origin of the mussels is very important for the conservation of native populations in the context of aquaculture activities in this area. The occurrence of the  ×  hybrid population in Puerto Madryn that demonstrates one of the most invasive species  Northern Hemisphere   is a threat to native populations. Continued monitoring is needed to check for the spread between these two taxa on the Atlantic coast of South America. Kamermans P  Galley T  Boudry P  Fuentes J  McCombie H  Batista FM  et al.

However  SGE may differ between sexes because boars grow faster than gilts and their social behaviours differ. We hypothesized that direct genetic effects (DGE) and SGE for ADG in pigs differ between boars and gilts and that accounting for these differences will improve the predictive ability of a social genetic effects model (SGM). Our data consisted of ADG from 30 to 94 kg for 32 212 uncastrated males (boars) and 48 252 gilts that were raised in sex-specific pens. Data were analyzed using a univariate model with sex as a fixed effect and a bivariate model with ADG in boars and gilts as separate traits using both a classical animal model (CM) and a SGM.ResultsWith the univariate model  the heritability for ADG was 0.22 ± 0.01 for the CM  while the estimate of the total heritable variance (T) was 0.23 ± 0.01 with the SGM. With the bivariate model  the genetic variance for SGE was higher for boars (13.8 ± 5.8) than for gilts (9.3 ± 3.9). For the bivariate model  T was 0.32 ± 0.02 for boars and 0.27 ± 0.01 for gilts. Estimates of the genetic correlations between DGE (0.88 ± 0.02) and SGE (0.30 ± 0.30) for boars versus gilts indicated that ADG in boars and gilts are different traits. Moreover  the estimate of the genetic correlation between DGE and SGE indicated presence of genetic effects of competition among gilts but not among boars. Compared to a CM  the univariate SGM improved predictive ability significantly only for gilts and the bivariate SGM improved predictive ability significantly for both boars and gilts.ConclusionsWe found significant genetic variances of SGE for ADG. The covariance between DGE and SGE was much more negative for gilts than for boars when applying the bivariate model. Because the estimate of the genetic correlation for ADG between gilts and boars differed significantly from 1 and the predictive ability for boars and gilts was improved significantly with the bivariate model  we recommend the use of a bivariate model to estimate both SGE and DGE for ADG in pigs."

Daily gain is a key trait in pig breeding goals because it contributes to economic efficiency. Its estimated heritability is moderate but several studies have shown that the total heritable variation is higher that the heritability estimated from a classical model because this trait is affected by so-called social (or indirect) genetic effects (SGE) [  ]. Thus  the daily gain of a pig depends both on the genes of the pig itself (direct genetic effects  DGE) and on the genes of the other pigs in the same group [    ]. By including SGE in the model for prediction of breeding values  it should be possible to capture the total heritable variation in daily gain  which should lead to a greater rate of genetic response in daily gain. However  to date the social genetic model has not been shown to consistently improve predictive ability compared to the classical animal model []. There may be several explanations for this. First  it is more difficult to obtain accurate estimates of social breeding values compared to breeding values from a classical animal model because the accuracy of social breeding values depends on the number of phenotyped offspring per sire  the number of groups in which the sires have offspring  and the group size [  ]. Second  a large number of groups is needed to estimate genetic variance components accurately  especially to estimate the genetic correlation between SGE and DGE []. Finally  the fixed effects that are fitted in the model may themselves have a social genetic background  which to date has not been properly accounted for when estimating variance components for social genetic effects models. For example  when analyzing growth traits  sex is usually fitted as a fixed effect. However  social genetic variances may differ between sexes because boars grow faster than gilts []. Difference in variance components between sexes could reduce predictive ability of the social genetic model if these are not accounted for. Social genetic effects may also differ between sexes due to differences in social behaviour. For example  on the one hand  there are indications that female pigs are more likely to tail bite than male pigs [] and that female pigs have less tail damage than castrated pigs []. On the other hand  aggressive behavior and mounting behavior are more frequent in boars than in gilts [  ]. Because of these possible differences in social behavior between male and female pigs  it is likely that SGE also differ between sexes but this has not been investigated to date. If SGE differ between males and females  this must be accounted for in the estimation of breeding values. Therefore  we hypothesize that DGE and SGE for daily gain in pigs differ between boars and gilts and that accounting for these differences will improve the predictive ability of a social genetic effects model. The data used in the current study were part of routine recordings of pigs in performance tests in the nucleus herds of the Danish pig breeding program  DanAvl. Only weight records were used and these require no ethical approval. Data used in this study were routinely collected records from pigs that enter the performance test in the nucleus herds of the Danish pig breeding program  DanAvl. The pigs were purebred Danish Landrace pigs raised in 13 herds in Denmark. After weaning  the pigs were housed in weaner pig units. Before reaching 28 kg  the pigs were moved to slaughter pig pens. The strategy on how pigs were mixed in the slaughter pig pens differed between farms  and on some farms  pigs were less likely to be mixed with other pigs from the same litter than on other farms. Females (gilts) and males were kept in separate pens but in the same barn except for two farms  where males and females were in different barns. All male pigs were uncastrated (boars). Boars were on average 82.5 ± 8.4 days old and weighed 30.3 ± 1.9 kg when they entered the performance test in the slaughter pig pens (Table ). The average age and average weight of gilts when entering the performance test were 81.6 ± 8.2 days and 30.4 ± 1.9 kg  respectively. Pigs were performance-tested for growth until their average weight reached 94 kg. Pigs were fed  with a dry feed during the test. Group sizes at the start of the performance test varied from 8 to 15 pigs per pen and the space allowance per pig was 0.75 to 1.0 m at the start of the performance test. At the end of the test  all pigs in a given pen were weighed to the nearest kg. If a pig left the pen because of death or illness  the date and reason for leaving the pen were recorded. No pigs were allowed to re-enter their pen after having been removed  and no pigs were allowed to change between pens once the performance test had started. Data consisted of 80 464 pigs but only 76 389 pigs had a weight record at the end of the test. Thus  4075 pigs were dead or sold or removed due to illness before the end of the performance test. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated as  where  and  are the weights of the pig at the end and the start of the performance test  and DAYS is the duration of the performance test in days. Complete pedigrees were traced six generations back and included a total of 1142 sires and 11 369 dams. Data were edited by excluding compartments that had less than five pens. The compartment was a part of the barn in which pigs finished the performance test within the same time period. Overall  there were 32 212 boars in 2864 groups and 48 252 gilts in 4445 groups (Table ). The number of boars was smaller than that of gilts because smaller numbers of boars were tested on the breeding farms. In addition  around 6% of all tested boars were moved from the herds to a test station for performance testing. In total  there were 789 compartments and the number of groups per compartment ranged from 5 to 25. For boars  5.5% of the pigs did not finish the performance test because of sales  death  or illness  whereas 4.8% of the gilts did not complete the performance test. This resulted in 61.2% incomplete groups of boars and 52% incomplete groups of gilts. The ADG was higher for boars (1031.1 g) than for gilts (977.3 g). Group sizes at the start of the performance test ranged from 8 to 15 for both boars and gilts and were on average 11.3 for boars and 11.7 for gilts. The average additive genetic relationship among pigs within a group was 0.18 for both boars and gilts. Variance components were estimated by using both a univariate model  in which sex was treated as a fixed effect  and a bivariate model  in which ADG was treated as a separate trait in boars and gilts. A classical animal model and a social genetic effects model were fitted for both the univariate and the bivariate model. The classical univariate model was: where  = ADG during the performance test   is a vector of covariates of age and age squared at the start of the performance test nested within sex  as well as the fixed effects of sex (boar or gilt) and compartment. Furthermore   is a vector of random direct additive genetic effects   is a vector of random litter effects   is a vector of random group effects  and  is a vector of residuals.      and  are incidence matrices. Assumptions for random effects were: where  is the additive relationship matrix   is the direct additive genetic variance   is the variance of the litters in which the pigs were born   is the variance of the groups in which the pigs were penned during the performance test   is the residual variance      and  are identity matrices of dimensions equal to the number of groups  number of litters  and number of observations  respectively. The univariate social genetic effects model was []: where  is a vector of random social additive genetic effects and all other variables are as described for Model 1. Assumptions for the genetic effects  and  were: where  is the social additive genetic variance and  is the direct-social additive genetic covariance. Assumptions for the other random effects were the same as for Model (1). The group effect accounted for correlated residuals between group mates []. Except for the fixed effect of sex  the bivariate classical model included the same fixed and random effects as the univariate model (Model 1). Subscripts  and  refer to boars and gilts such that  is ADG for boars and  is ADG for gilts. Because records were nested within group and sex  there were no co-variances between group effects for boars and gilts or co-variances between residuals for boars and gilts  and assumptions for the random effects were: where  and  are DGE   and  are the litter effects   and  are group effects  and  and  are residuals for boars and gilts  respectively. The bivariate social genetic effects model was: The covariance structures for litter ()  group ()  and residual were as in the classical bivariate Model (2)  but for the genetic effects (direct and social)  the covariance structure was: All analyses were performed by AI-REML  using the DMU software []. For the social genetic effects models (Models 2 and 4)  the total heritable variance  phenotypic variance  and total heritable variance relative to the phenotypic variance were calculated [  ]. The total heritable variance () was calculated as: where  is the average number of pigs in each group at the start of the performance test. The proportion of total heritable variance to the phenotypic variance  that determines the potential of the population to respond to selection (T) [  ] was calculated as   where  is the phenotypic variance. In our study  pigs within a group were related. Thus   was calculated for related individuals as []: where  is the average additive genetic relationship within groups. To assess the importance of SGE  log likelihood tests were performed by calculating differences in likelihood between the univariate classical Model (1) and the univariate social genetic Model (2). Similarly  likelihoods of the bivariate classical Model (3) and the bivariate social genetic effects Model (4) were compared. We compared the abilities of the univariate and bivariate models to predict phenotypes by calculating correlations between predicted breeding values and phenotypes corrected for fixed effects in a validation dataset. For this purpose  a dataset was constructed by omitting phenotypes recorded during the last half year (October 1st 2015 to April 1st 2016)  which were used for validation. Using this data  breeding values were predicted for all animals in the validation dataset but correlations between predicted and corrected phenotypes were calculated separately for boars and gilts. The number of observations in the prediction dataset was 57 038 and the number of observations in the validation dataset was 23 426. The corrected phenotypes were the residuals from a GLM model in the SAS software version 9.4 (Copyright © 2002-2012 SAS Institute Inc. SAS) that included only the fixed effects described above for the univariate and bivariate models. Four different predicted breeding values were evaluated []:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     where  and  are the direct breeding values for individual  from the classical model and the social genetic effects model  respectively   is the sum of the social breeding values of mates  from the social genetic effects model.  is the total phenotype of an individual according to the social genetic effects model []. Correlations of predicted breeding values with corrected phenotypes were only computed for those animals for which their sires had a least one progeny with phenotype in both the prediction dataset and the validation dataset. Thus  the minimum and maximum numbers of offspring per boar were 1 and 101  respectively. Furthermore  only groups without missing phenotypes were included. Thus  the results on predictive ability of the models were based on 45 sires and 156 groups. For both the univariate and bivariate models  differences in predictive ability of the classical and social genetic effects models were evaluated by testing whether the correlation between the corrected phenotypes  and  were statistically different from the correlation between the corrected phenotypes  and  using a Hotelling-Williams test []. The univariate classical and social genetic effects models had similar estimates of variance components for DGE  group and litter effects  and residuals (Table ). For the social genetic effects model  we obtained a significant social genetic variance of 7.4 ± 2.6  indicating the presence of SGE. The estimate of the genetic correlation between DGE and SGE was equal to - 0.24 (0.13)  which indicated competitive behavior between the pigs. The estimated heritability for ADG was equal to 0.22 ± 0.01 with the classical model and the estimate of T for the social genetic effects model was surprisingly similar (0.23 ± 0.01). Nevertheless  the presence of SGE was supported both by the significant social genetic variance and by a log-likelihood test that showed that the social genetic effects model could not be reduced to the classical animal model (P < 0.05). In the bivariate model  the estimate of the direct genetic variance was 17% higher for boars (2883 ± 433) than for gilts (2389 ± 164) with the classical model. The residual variance was 29% higher for boars than for gilts with both models (P < 0.05). The estimate of the social genetic variance was also higher for boars (13.8 ± 5.8) than for gilts (9.3 ± 3.9) but these estimates were not statistically different. Estimates of heritabilities were 0.22 ± 0.01 for boars and 0.24 ± 0.02 for gilts using the classical model  while estimates of T were 0.32 ± 0.02 for boars and 0.27 ± 0.01 for gilts. The estimate of the genetic correlation of DGE between boars and gilts was high and favorable (0.88 ± 0.02) with both the classical and the social genetic effects models. The group variance was lower for the social genetic effects model than for the classical model for both boars and gilts. All estimates of genetic correlations involving SGE had large standard errors. The estimate of the genetic correlation between DGE and SGE was negative and stronger for gilts (- 0.22 ± 0.14) than for boars (- 0.04 ± 0.16) but due to their large standard errors  they did not differ significantly from zero. The estimate of the genetic correlation of SGE between the two sexes was low (0.30 ± 0.30). The estimate of the genetic correlation between the DGE for boars and the SGE for gilts (- 0.22 ± 0.14) and of the genetic correlation between the DGE for gilts and the SGE for boars (- 0.064 ± 0.15) were not statistically different from 0. Table  provides the predictive abilities (correlations of predicted breeding values with corrected phenotypes) for the classical and social genetic effects univariate and bivariate models. With the univariate model  the predictive ability of DGE was similar for the classical and social genetic models for both sexes (0.165 and 0.164). In general  predictive abilities were lower for boars than for gilts for all models. With the univariate model  predictive abilities of the sum of the social breeding values for group mates  were equal to 0.085 and 0.067 for gilts and boars  respectively. By applying a social genetic effects model instead of a classical model  predictive ability improved from 0.165 to 0.177 for  for boars and from 0.235 to 0.250 for gilts. This increase in predictive ability was  however  only significant (P = 0.004) for gilts. Fitting a bivariate model increased the predictive ability of the sum of the social breeding values for group mates  considerably for boars (0.165). The predictive ability of DGE with the classical model was 0.170 for boars  which increased to 0.196 for the total phenotype with the social genetic effects model. For gilts  the predictive ability of DGE increased from 0.251 with the classical model to 0.262 with the social genetic model. With the bivariate model  the increase in predictive ability  when applying the social genetic effects model instead of the classical model was significant for both boars (P = 0.001) and gilts (P = 0.047). In this study  we estimated (co)-variance components for DGE and SGE for boars and gilts by using a bivariate model  which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. Although all estimates involving social genetic effects had large standard errors  our results indicate that both the variance of social genetic effects and the co-variances between DGE and SGE differed between gilts and boars. We estimated a genetic correlation of 0.88 between ADG in gilts and boars  which was significantly different from 1 and shows that ADG in boars and sows are different traits. This result is in contrast to estimates reported by Saintilan et al. []  who found that genetic correlations between gilts and boars for daily gain were not significantly different from 1 (0.95)  but their estimates were based on a much smaller number of observations (1121 males and 508 females). Several reasons may explain why genetic parameters differ between sexes. First  there is a scale effect because of a difference in ADG levels between boars and gilts  which is indeed reflected in the direct variances  which were much higher for boars than for gilts. Second  there may be selection bias  since approximately 6% of the tested boars were not included in the data because they were performance-tested at a boar test station. These boars most likely belong in the upper end of the population with respect to performance for ADG but this was not reflected in lower variance for DGE for boars. Finally  there may be a biological explanation for the difference in parameter estimates between boars and gilts  since social breeding values are associated with behavioral differences. For example  pigs with low breeding values for SGE perform more non-reciprocal biting than pigs with high SGE breeding values []. However  no previous studies have investigated the effect of SGE breeding values on the behavior of boars and gilts when they are housed separately  since gilts and castrated males were mixed in pens in the study of Camerlink et al. []. Still  it has been reported that boars and gilts have different behaviors. Our estimates of the correlations between DGE and SGE indicate competitive behavior between gilts but not between the boars. Thus  more competitive behavior such as aggressions among gilts than among boars is expected. In slaughter pigs  Boyle and Björklund [] showed that  in pens that included intact boars  antagonistic behaviors (mounting and nudging) were more frequent than in pens with gilts only. Similarly  Teixeira and Boyle [] found that aggressive and mounting behaviors were more frequent in intact boars than in gilts. In addition  boars had more skin lesions and bruises on their carcass than gilts. Bünger et al. [] reported higher frequencies of knocking  fighting  and mounting in intact boars than in gilts. In addition  some studies indicated that tail damage is more severe in gilts than in boars. For example  Zonderland et al. [] investigated the number of days before 40% of the piglets had tail damage and the number of days a piglet experienced tail damage in male and females piglets housed in separate pens. In the female piglet pens  40% of the piglets had tail damage after 11 days  whereas 40% of the male piglets had tail damage after 16 days. The duration of tail damage was also longer in the female compared to the male pens. Overall  these studies of behavioral differences between the sexes imply that boars are more competitive than gilts. However  we need more studies and data to quantify how the social genetic parameters for each sex are reflected in social behavior. Our estimates of social genetic variances were significant for both the univariate model and the bivariate model  which indicates presence of SGE. The presence of SGE was also supported by the log likelihood test  which showed that the univariate social genetic effects model fitted the data better than the classical model. Estimates of T (0.32 for boars and 0.27 for gilts) were higher with the bivariate model than with the univariate model (0.23)  which was primarily due to differences in the estimates of social genetic variances  which were higher for both boars and gilts in the bivariate (Table ) than in the univariate model (Table ). For the univariate model  the estimate of T was not much higher than the estimate of  (0.23 vs. 0.22) but this was primarily caused by the unfavorable genetic correlation observed between DGE and SGE  which reduced T []. This was also reflected in the results from the bivariate model  where the estimate of T increased compared to   especially for boars  for which the estimate of the genetic correlation between DGE and SGE was close to zero. Therefore  a relatively low T compared to  should not be confused with SGE being unimportant. Instead  in those cases  realized selection response to selection on DGE without considering SGE may be lower than expected based on the estimate of  []. Estimates of T were in the range of those reported in previous studies. Bergsma et al. [] found estimates of 0.24 for  and of 0.34 for T for daily gain  whereas the estimate of T by Chen et al. [] was higher  at 0.59. Our results weakly indicate that the predictive ability for both boars and gilts increased by applying a bivariate instead of a univariate model (Table ). Also the correlation of  with corrected phenotypes increased for the bivariate model  indicating that even a model without social genetic effects  the bivariate model is more appropriate than the univariate model. This was also supported by the fact that the estimate of the genetic correlation between ADG in boars versus gilts was significantly less than 1 (0.88) (Table ). When applying the univariate classical and social genetic effects models  genetic parameter estimates (variance of DGE and litter effects  and the correlation between DGE and SGE) were similar to those obtained for gilts using the bivariate model. As a result  in particular the predictive ability for boars increased when the bivariate instead of the univariate model was used. This was also supported by the greater increase in predictions of  for boars than for sows when the bivariate instead of the univariate social genetic effects model was used. Finally  the increase in predictive ability from using a social genetic effects model compared to a classical model using the bivariate model was significant for both boars ( = 0.047) and gilts ( = 0.001). In the univariate model  the increase in predictive ability was not significant for boars. Bijma [] showed that the optimal design for estimating direct and social genetic parameters is one in which groups consist of animals from two families. He also showed that 250 to 500 groups are needed in order to accurately estimate variance components []. Especially  the correlation between DGE and SGE is difficult to estimate accurately []. In our study  we had 7309 groups. However  since our data came from a herd performance test program and not from an experiment  our groups were composed of varying numbers and sizes of families. Group sizes were also relatively large  which means that they were always composed of more than two families. Thus  the group composition in our data was probably not optimal for estimation of variance components. However  in practical pig breeding  it is unrealistic to perform an experiment with 500 groups of two families each. Another complicating factor is that our pigs were housed in different breeding herds  which makes it more difficult to estimate SGE due to differences in the environment between herds []. The environment of the herds was standardized with respect to feeding  density  etc.  but herds differed in how pigs were mixed prior to the performance test. In some herds  pigs were less likely to be mixed with other pigs from the same litter than in other herds. This may be a problem because the phenotypic social effects of a pig depends on how much it is related to the recipient []. Recently  Canario et al. [] showed that early-life social effects in pigs affect the growth of their group mates later in life  such that pigs that have been through the same early life experience  develop similar social skills. Such effects may have an impact on our estimates of SGE because some pigs were more likely to be mixed with pigs from their own litter than with pigs from other litters. Moreover  Alemu et al. [] showed that the social genetic model may result in biased estimates of social genetic parameters if the groups consist of a combination of sibs and random individuals. This can be solved partly by dividing effects into SGE on kins and SGE on unrelated individuals [  ]. However  when SGE differ between kins and non-kins  genetic parameters are not fully identifiable because of confounding between direct and social effects of members of the same families []. We investigated fitting the number of sibs in a group and the genetic relationship within a group as covariates in the model  but this did not improve the predictability of our models  and thus they were not included in the final models. The increase in predictive ability from using a social genetic effects model compared to a classical animal model was only significant for gilts in the univariate model. Duijvesteijn [] showed that the accuracy of social breeding values is mainly determined by the number of sires represented in both the prediction and the validation dataset. The improvement in predictive ability from using a social genetic model compared to a classical model was not significant []. The study by Duijvesteijn [] included data on progeny from 68 sires  whereas we had only 45 sires. It is difficult to increase the number of sires because sires must have offspring in both the prediction and validation datasets and because the prediction must be performed in whole groups []. Adding genomic information may be a way to increase the accuracy of predictions of breeding values. Alemu et al. [] showed that the accuracy increased by 32 and 35% when applying genomic predictions in a sire model including SGE in two lines of laying hens compared to using parent average estimated breeding values. The pigs in our study were grouped in pens of different sizes. The SGE may depend on group size  which can be accounted for by adding a dilution effect []. In our initial analyses  we investigated fitting a dilution effect in the univariate social genetic effects model. However  since including a dilution effect did not increase the fit of the model  it was not included in the final models. We used data on purebred gilts and boars  but in practice  slaughter pigs are crossbreds. Ellen et al. [] discussed genetic improvement for traits affected by social interactions in relation to crossbred performance. If the correlation between purebred and crossbred performance is low  information from crossbreds is needed to improve socially affected traits  as is the case with the DGE [  ]. To date  we are not aware of studies that have quantified the relationships of SGE between purebreds and crossbreds. We used purebred gilts and boars that were kept in separate pens  but in practice  gilts and boars may be mixed. Boars and gilts will probably behave differently in mixed than in sex-specific pens. With mixed pens  it would be possible to divide SGE according to the sexes of the focal and recipient pigs []. To date  how the sex-specific SGE are expressed in mixed pens is unknown. In addition  when boars and gilts are selected for SGE in sex-specific pens  there is the question of which estimated breeding value should be used in selection since both boars and gilts get one estimated breeding value for each sex. Because their progeny will be half males and half females  selecting both males and females on the average estimated social breeding value for each sex would be an option. In this study  we tested the hypothesis that DGE and SGE for ADG in pigs differ between boars and gilts and that accounting for these differences will improve the predictability of the social genetic effects model. Using a bivariate social genetic effects model resulted in different variance component estimates than the univariate model. For boars  the estimate of the covariance between DGE and SGE was close to 0 but highly negative for gilts  which indicates that there is competition between gilts but not between boars. For both the classical and social genetic effects models  the estimate of the genetic correlation of ADG between gilts and boars was significantly less than 1 (0.88)  which indicates that ADG in boars and gilts are different traits. Based on this result  and the fact that the bivariate social genetic effects model had better predictive ability than the univariate model  we suggest that ADG in boars and gilts should be treated as separate traits in both classical and social genetic effects models. Significant genetic variances of SGE for ADG show the presence of SGE for both the univariate and bivariate models  which indicate that a social genetic effects model should be used instead of a classical model.

This study investigated the accuracy of genomic prediction based on porcine SNP60 Beadchip data using training and validation datasets from populations with different genetic backgrounds that were challenged with different PRRSV isolates.ResultsGenomic prediction accuracy averaged 0.34 for viral load (VL) and 0.23 for weight gain (WG) following experimental PRRSV challenge  which demonstrates that genomic selection could be used to improve response to PRRSV infection. Training on WG data during infection with a less virulent PRRSV  KS06  resulted in poor accuracy of prediction for WG during infection with a more virulent PRRSV  NVSL. Inclusion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in linkage disequilibrium with a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 4 was vital for accurate prediction of VL. Overall  SNPs that were significantly associated with either trait in single SNP genome-wide association analysis were unable to predict the phenotypes with an accuracy as high as that obtained by using all genotyped SNPs across the genome. Inclusion of data from close relatives into the training population increased whole genome prediction accuracy by 33% for VL and by 37% for WG but did not affect the accuracy of prediction when using only SNPs in the major QTL region.ConclusionsResults show that genomic prediction of response to PRRSV infection is moderately accurate and  when using all SNPs on the porcine SNP60 Beadchip  is not very sensitive to differences in virulence of the PRRSV in training and validation populations. Including close relatives in the training population increased prediction accuracy when using the whole genome or SNPs other than those near a major QTL."

Overall  SNPs that were significantly associated with either trait in single SNP genome-wide association analysis were unable to predict the phenotypes with an accuracy as high as that obtained by using all genotyped SNPs across the genome. Inclusion of data from close relatives into the training population increased whole genome prediction accuracy by 33% for VL and by 37% for WG but did not affect the accuracy of prediction when using only SNPs in the major QTL region. Results show that genomic prediction of response to PRRSV infection is moderately accurate and  when using all SNPs on the porcine SNP60 Beadchip  is not very sensitive to differences in virulence of the PRRSV in training and validation populations. Including close relatives in the training population increased prediction accuracy when using the whole genome or SNPs other than those near a major QTL. Improving phenotypic performance of livestock is the overall goal of animal breeding programs. For some economically important traits  phenotypes on selection candidates or close relatives are difficult to obtain due to high cost of phenotyping  strict biosecurity measures  or age at which phenotypes are measurable. Genomic prediction provides an attractive alternative to select for these traits. Genomic prediction involves the use of genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome to predict phenotypes that have not been observed in the selection candidates []. SNP chips that contain thousands to hundreds of thousands of genetic markers that cover the whole genome are now available for most livestock species []. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically devastating disease in the swine industry caused by a rapidly mutating virus (PRRSV) []. Genomic prediction for response to the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in pigs would be highly valuable to the swine industry  as most selection takes place in high health nucleus farms that are unlikely to face PRRSV outbreaks. Conducting experimental PRRSV infection trials requires the use of strictly regulated biocontainment facilities and is expensive and labor intensive. Therefore  the ability to combine data from pigs with different genetic backgrounds that were infected with different PRRSV isolates to use as a training population for genomic prediction of response to other PRRSV isolates of unrelated piglets would be very beneficial. The data used in this study were from the PRRS Host Genetics Consortium (PHGC) [] and included phenotypes on weight gain (WG) and viral load (VL) from nine trials of ~ 200 piglets that were infected with the NVSL 97-7985 (NVSL) PRRSV isolate [] and from four similarly sized trials of piglets infected with the KS2006-72109 (KS06) isolate. Using data from the first eight NVSL trials  Boddicker et al. [  ] discovered and validated a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on  chromosome (SSC) 4 for VL and WG and showed that a single SNP in this region  WUR10000125 (WUR)  explained most of the genetic variance of the QTL. Furthermore  using the NVSL data  Boddicker et al. [] showed that the accuracy of genomic prediction across breeds was maximized when only the SNPs within the 1-Mb window containing the WUR SNP were used. Our investigation expands these questions to prediction across PRRSV isolates. Hess et al. [] showed that genotype at the WUR SNP was associated with VL for both PRRSV isolates but with WG only for the NVSL isolate. Genetic correlations for VL and WG between the two isolates were both estimated to be 0.86  which indicates that accurate genomic prediction across isolates should be possible. Also  using field data  which likely contained multiple PRRSV isolates or strains of infection  Serão et al. [] showed that genomic prediction of PRRSV antibody response was moderately accurate. These findings are important to the swine industry  as PRRSV is a rapidly mutating virus [  ] and different strains are infecting industry populations and are likely to evolve from one outbreak to the next. Except for the SSC4 QTL  which was associated with VL in both isolates  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the data used in this study did not identify genomic regions that overlapped between the two PRRSV isolate datasets []  in spite of the high genetic correlations that have been estimated for traits between isolates []. However  although the most strongly associated regions were inconsistent between these two PRRSV isolates  we found that genes near these SNPs were enriched for several of the same gene ontology (GO) terms. Against this background  the objectives of this study were to assess the accuracy of genomic prediction for VL and WG in the following scenarios: (1) across PRRSV isolates and genetic sources and (2) using all SNPs  all SNPs other than those in the SSC4 QTL region  or only the WUR SNP. All experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the Kansas State University (KSU) Animal Care and Use Committee. Lunney et al. [] provided a detailed description of the study design employed in the PHGC trials used in this study. Briefly  13 trials of approximately 200 commercial crossbred piglets each were sent to Kansas State University at weaning  given 1 week to acclimate  then inoculated intramuscularly and intranasally with 10 TCID50 of either the NVSL 97-7985 (NVSL) [] or KS2006-72109 (KS06) PRRSV isolate. Blood samples were collected at 0  4  7  11  and 14 days post-infection (dpi) and then weekly until termination of the trial at 42 dpi. Individual weights were observed weekly throughout the trial. At 42 dpi  piglets were euthanized and ear tissue was collected for genomic DNA extraction  which was sent to GeneSeek  Inc. (trials 1–10; Lincoln  Nebraska  USA) or Delta Genomics (trials 11–15; Edmonton  Alberta  CA) and genotyped using the Illumina Porcine SNP60 Beadchip []. Quality control of genotype data has been previously described []. Briefly  after filtering genotypes with GenCall scores lower than 0.5  minor allele frequencies less than 0.01  and genotyping call rates less than 0.80  52 386 SNP remained  with an overall genotyping rate of 99.2%. In total  data on 2288 commercial crossbred piglets from eight genetic backgrounds were used. Piglets averaged 26.6 (± 2.4) days of age and weighed 7.17 (± 1.4) kg at the time of infection. Of this total  1557 piglets were infected with NVSL  with an average weight of 7.34 (± 1.4) kg and 26.6 (± 2.6) days of age at inoculation. The remaining 731 piglets averaged 26.7 (± 1.9) days of age and weighed 6.80 (± 1.29) kg on average at the time of inoculation with KS06. A more detailed description of the populations used in each trial is in Waide et al. []. Trial 9 involved pigs from the ISU RFI selection lines [] and were excluded from these analyses. Trial 13 was also excluded from these analyses because piglets from this trial had much lower and more variable viremia profiles compared to the other KS06 trials. Relationships between piglets used in these trials were investigated using principal component analysis (PCA) of genotypes for all SNPs using the R function prcomp []  as shown in Fig. . Principal components analysis of the SNP genotype data. Each point represents a single animal  with each color representing one of the eight genetic lines used in this study. The numbers for each genetic line match those shown in Table . The breed makeup of the animals for each genetic line is shown in the same color.  landrace   large white  and  yorkshire. Breeds are presented as breed of sire × breed of dam The two phenotypes analyzed in this study were described by Boddicker et al. []. Briefly  the amount of PRRSV RNA in blood samples was estimated using quantitative PCR and reported as the log of PRRSV RNA copies relative to a standard curve. Viral load (VL) was calculated as the area under the curve of viremia up to and including 21 dpi. WG was calculated as the difference between body weight at 42 and 0 dpi. Bayesian variable selection  Bayes-B  was used to estimate additive and dominance effects for 52 268 SNPs for genomic prediction using the following model: where  = vector of phenotypic observations   = incidence matrix relating phenotypes to fixed effects   = vector of fixed effects of sex  the interactions of pen and parity with trial  genotype at the WUR SNP  and covariates of initial age and weight   = vector of the additive genotype covariates coded as - 10  0  and 10 for the     and  genotypes  respectively  for SNP    = additive effect for SNP    = indicator for whether the additive effect of SNP  was included ( = 1) or excluded from ( = 0) the model for a given iteration of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain   = vector of the dominance genotype covariates coded as 10  0  and 10 for the     and  genotypes  respectively  for SNP    = dominance effect for SNP    = indicator for whether the dominance effect of SNP  was included () or excluded from () the model for a given iteration of the MCMC chain  and  = vector of residual errors. The prior probability that a given SNP was excluded from the model ( and ) was set equal to p = 0.99  fitting approximately 1% or 523 additive effects and 523 dominance effects in each of 51 000 iterations of the MCMC chain  with the first 1000 iterations designated as burn in. In all analyses  genotype at the WUR SNP was included as a fixed effect and SNPs within 2.5 Mb on either side of the WUR SNP were excluded from the model. Using the estimates obtained from the Bayes-B analysis  the genomic estimated genotypic value (GEGV) for the whole genome  excluding the WUR region (Genome-WUR)  was obtained for each animal in the validation population using the following equation: where  = the genotypic value for individual    and  are as described above   = estimate of the additive effect for SNP   and   = estimate of the dominance effect for SNP . To estimate the prediction accuracy of GEGV based on genotype at the SSC4 QTL alone  we used estimates of the fixed effect for the WUR SNP from the Bayes-B analysis of the training population to estimate GEGV in the validation population. To estimate the predictive accuracy of the whole genome  we used the sum of the Genome-WUR GEGV and the GEGV based on the fixed effect estimates for the WUR SNP. Figure  shows examples of how the data were split into training and validation groups for the five main genomic prediction scenarios described in the following  followed by an example of each scenario: (1) genomic prediction across PRRSV isolate (black arrows in Fig. a): e.g.  all data from the NVSL isolate used for training and all data from the KS06 isolate used for validation (N <U+2192> K); (2) genomic prediction across genetic line with both PRRSV isolates in training (red arrow in Fig. a): e.g.  trials 4–8  15 from the NVSL isolate and trials 10  12  and 14 from the KS06 isolate used for training and trials 1–3 from the NVSL isolate used for validation (NK <U+2192> N); (3) genomic prediction across genetic line within PRRSV isolate (small blue arrow in Fig. b): e.g.  trials 11  12  and 14 from the KS06 isolate used for training and trial 10 from the KS06 isolate used for validation (K <U+2192> K);. (4) genomic prediction across genetic line and PRRSV isolate (large blue arrow in Fig. b): e.g.  trials 11  12  and 14 from the KS06 isolate used for training and trial 15 from the NVSL isolate used for validation (K <U+2192> N); (5) including genetic line across PRRSV isolate (purple arrow in Fig. b): e.g.  trials 1–8 and 15 from the NVSL isolate used for training and trial 14 from the KS06 isolate used for validation (N <U+2192> K). Scenarios used for training and validation for genomic prediction. Pink  purple  and blue colored rectangles represent each of the three genetic lines with pigs in both NVSL and KS06 trials  with the trial number indicated inside the rectangle. Gray colored rectangles represent individual genetic lines with only one trial of PRRSV infected pigs.

Genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates using all data indicated by black arrows; across breeding company using both PRRSV isolates in training indicated by red arrows.  Genomic prediction across PRRSV isolate including validation breeding company in training indicated by purple arrow; genomic prediction across genetic line within PRRSV isolate and across genetic lines and isolate indicated by small and large blue arrows  respectively In order to determine the contribution of genetic relationships between animals in the training and validation datasets  the accuracy of genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates when validating on data from one genetic line was compared by including or excluding the genetic line used for validation from the training data (purple and large blue arrow in Fig. b  respectively). These analyses were only conducted for genetic lines that had data for both PRRSV isolates (five trials for the NVSL data and three trials for the KS06 data; Fig. ). Accuracy of genomic prediction was calculated as the correlation between the GEGV and phenotypes adjusted for the fixed effects included in the genomic prediction model  divided by the square root of the heritability of the trait for the PRRSV isolate of infection in the validation population  as estimated by Hess et al. []  which were 0.31 and 0.40 for VL and 0.30 and 0.24 for WG in NVSL and KS06  respectively. For example  when we trained on VL from one or more NVSL infection trials and validated on VL from one or more KS06 infection trials  genomic prediction accuracy was calculated as the correlation between the GEGV and adjusted phenotypes for VL in the KS06 trial(s) divided by the square root of the estimate of heritability for VL obtained by Hess et al. [] using all KS06 data. Phenotypes were adjusted for estimates of fixed effects (sex  interactions of pen and parity with trial  PRRSV isolate  and covariates beginning age and weight; genotype at the WUR SNP was included as a fixed effect for the Genome-WUR analyses only) within the validation population using a fixed effects only model in R (R function lm) []. The data used in this study consisted of 2288 pigs from eight genetic lines that were infected with one of two PRRSV isolates. Information on each trial is in Table . Principal component analysis (PCA) of SNP genotypes from all animals used in this study clustered pigs from each genetic line together (Fig. ). The first principal component (PC) explained 7.2% of the variance in genotypes and PC2 explained 6.4%. PC1 distinguished pigs from genetic line 1 from pigs from genetic line 7  and each of these lines from pigs in the other genetic lines. PC2 separated pigs based on their breed composition  separating progeny of Duroc sires from those of other sires. This breed separation agrees with previous reports that show clustering of Large White (LW)  Landrace (LR)  and Pietrain pigs together and separate from Duroc pigs based on genomic data []. Although genomic regions associated with VL were not consistent across PRRSV isolates []  except for the SSC4 QTL  we found that genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates (black arrows in Fig. a) was moderately accurate. When training on the NVSL data and validating on the KS06 data (N <U+2192> K)  the accuracy of whole-genome prediction was 0.32  while training on the KS06 data predicted GEGV in the NVSL data (K <U+2192> N) with an accuracy of 0.38 (Fig. a). When we removed the effect of the WUR SNP from the prediction (Genome-WUR)  these accuracies reduced to 0.12 and 0.10  respectively (Fig. a). Accuracy of prediction using only the WUR SNP (WUR only) was the same as the accuracy obtained when using the whole genome (Fig. a). For whole-genome and WUR only predictions  K <U+2192> N was more accurate than N <U+2192> K  but K <U+2192> N and N <U+2192> K had equivalent accuracies when using Genome-WUR. Accuracy of genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates. Accuracy of genomic prediction for VL for different training-validation scenarios  presented as the average correlation between genomic estimated genetic values and adjusted phenotypes divided by the square root of heritability in the validation population for that scenario. Accuracy of genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates for the whole genome  genome minus the WUR genotype (Genome—WUR)  and using only the WUR SNP (WUR only) for viral load () and weight gain ()  Including the validation genetic line in the training population increased accuracy of prediction most for the Genome-WUR prediction (Fig. a; genomic prediction accuracies for individual trials are in Fig. a). The average prediction accuracy for Genome-WUR when the validation genetic line was excluded from training was 0.005  which increased to an average of 0.16 when the validation genetic line was included in training (Fig. a). This suggests that the Genome-WUR predictions are primarily based on genetic relationships. The accuracy of Genome-WUR prediction for line 1 in the NVSL data (indicated by triangles in Fig. a) was very low  even with inclusion of related animals in the training population. If the accuracy for this line is ignored  the average accuracy of K <U+2192> N genome-WUR prediction increased from 0.03 to 0.24 when related animals were included in training. Inclusion of related animals in the training population did not have an effect on the accuracy of prediction using only the WUR SNP (Fig. a). Accuracy of genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates. Accuracy of genomic prediction for different training-validation scenarios  presented as the average correlation between genomic estimated genetic values and adjusted phenotypes divided by the square root of heritability in the validation population for that scenario.

Average accuracy of prediction across genetic lines when training and validation are on the same PRRSV isolate  across isolates  or using both isolates for viral load () and weight gain (). Individual points represent the accuracy of prediction for one trial  with genetic lines that are represented in both PRRSV isolates having the same black shape and gray diamonds representing the trials  which were not replicated Since the PRRSV mutates rapidly []  it would be valuable to be able to use data from response to one PRRSV isolate to predict the ability of pigs to respond to another PRRSV isolate. Furthermore  collection of data on response to PRRSV infection is expensive and difficult. Thus  it would be beneficial to use all available data for genomic prediction  resulting in a training dataset consisting of pigs infected with one of several different PRRSV isolates. To assess the effect of PRRSV isolates in the training dataset  we compared genomic prediction across genetic lines within one PRRSV isolate  across PRRSV isolates  and using data from infections with both PRRSV isolates in training  represented by the small blue  large blue  and red arrow  respectively  in Fig. b. Results show that whole-genome prediction was moderately accurate for all these scenarios (Fig. a). Training on VL in the KS06 data gave the highest accuracy for K <U+2192> N and K <U+2192> K Genome-WUR prediction. On average  whole-genome and WUR-only prediction were not sensitive to the PRRSV isolate used in training. Trial 8 had zero accuracy for WUR-only prediction in the within isolate  across isolate  and both isolates in training scenarios (indicated by a gray diamond). This trial was previously shown to have very low predictive accuracy using only the SSC4 QTL []; genotype at the WUR SNP did not have a statistically significant association with VL in that trial []. Accuracies for genomic prediction of WG across PRRSV isolates are in Fig. b. Whole-genome or Genome-WUR predictions were most accurate for N <U+2192> K. However  for K <U+2192> N  WUR only prediction was more than twice as accurate as whole-genome and Genome-WUR prediction (Fig. b). The SSC4 QTL was shown to have a large effect on WG in the NVSL data [] but was not significantly associated with WG in the KS06 data []. Bayes-B results showed that the 1-Mb window around the WUR SNP explained 10.4% of genetic variance for WG in the NVSL data  but only 0.05% in the KS06 data (data not shown). GWAS of WG in the KS06 data detected no QTL with large effects but many small effects spread across the genome []. Furthermore  genes near SNPs that were moderately associated with WG in the KS06 data were not enriched for metabolic GO terms  unlike those for WG in the NVSL data. The NVSL isolate is more virulent than the KS06 isolate; piglets infected with the KS06 isolate had lower viral load and higher WG than pigs infected with the NVSL isolate []. Additional KS06 infection trials may be needed to accurately estimate SNP effects for WG.  Including data from the validation genetic line in training had no effect on the average accuracy of genomic prediction of WG for either PRRSV isolate (Fig. b)  but the average accuracies had large standard errors. Figure b shows the trial specific accuracies that were averaged to get each of these estimates. When training on WG from the KS06 trials and predicting trials 1 to 3 or trial 5 of the NVSL data  Genome-WUR prediction yielded negative accuracies but the accuracies of WUR only and whole-genome prediction were positive. Genome-WUR prediction of WG from trial 14 of the KS06 data was moderately accurate  0.33  but WUR-only prediction accuracy was negative  - 0.14  and whole-genome prediction accuracy was low  0.07 (Fig. b). When training on WG in the NVSL data  whole-genome and Genome-WUR prediction most accurately predicted WG from trial 11 of the KS06 data (Fig. b). Accuracies of across-breed prediction of WG for K <U+2192> N using the whole genome ranged from 0.16 to 0.54. The most notable increase in prediction accuracy due to inclusion of related animals in the training set was for VL in NVSL trial 15 from line 7  for which this increased the Genome-WUR prediction accuracy from - 0.01 to 0.27. Genetic line 7 was separated from all other lines by PCA  which may explain these large increases in accuracy. However  inclusion of related animals in the training set did not substantially increase the prediction accuracy for WG in trial 15. In fact  the largest increases in accuracy due to inclusion of related animals in the training set were for KS06 trial 10  which is from the same line as NVSL trial 15. For this trial 10  inclusion of related animals in the training set led to an increase in accuracy for WG from 0.22 to 0.30 for whole-genome prediction and from 0.02 to 0.18 for Genome-WUR prediction  while WUR-only prediction was not affected by including related animals in the training set. Figure b shows the average accuracy for WG of whole-genome  Genome-WUR  and WUR-only prediction within isolate  across isolates  and when training on both isolates. Whole-genome and Genome-WUR prediction of WG in the NVSL data was most accurate when NVSL data was included in training (within isolate  N <U+2192> N  and both isolates in training  NK <U+2192> N). NK <U+2192> N was numerically more accurate than N <U+2192> N for whole-genome and Genome-WUR  0.38 to 0.40 and 0.15 to 0.20  respectively  but the average accuracies were not statistically significantly different from one another ( test  value > 0.05). NK <U+2192> N whole-genome prediction was statistically significantly more accurate than K <U+2192> N prediction (0.29 to 0.40;  test  value = 0.05). No patterns could be discerned from the prediction accuracies of WG in the KS06 data when averaged across all trials. The most notable pattern was for WG in trial 14  in which including both isolates in training was significantly less accurate than within isolate prediction for whole-genome (0.06 to 0.51)  Genome-WUR (0.18 to 0.33)  and WUR-only prediction (- 0.13 to 0.43). Prediction of WG in KS06 trial 11 was most accurate when WG in the NVSL data was used in training for whole-genome  Genome-WUR  and WUR-only prediction. The results presented in this study show that even without identifying overlapping genomic regions in GWAS  moderately accurate genomic predictions for host response to PRRS can be obtained across two isolates of the PRRSV. Genomic prediction using the whole genome was more accurate than Genome-WUR or WUR-only prediction for all scenarios for both VL and WG  except when excluding related animals from training in K <U+2192> N for WG  for which using WUR-only was most accurate. For VL  the most accurate genomic prediction scenario involved using the whole genome to predict across PRRSV isolates when the validation genetic line was included in the training data. For WG  the most accurate genomic prediction scenario involved whole-genome prediction with both PRRSV isolates included in the training data. Overall  genomic prediction of WG was less accurate than genomic prediction of VL. This may  in part  be a result of the higher heritability of VL compared to WG [  ] and of differences in the effect of the SSC4 QTL on WG for these two PRRSV isolates. Furthermore  growth rate is a common trait that is selected for in the commercial pig industry []  whereas there is no selection on VL after PRRSV infection. Although the WG used in this study was in piglets infected with PRRSV  as opposed to healthy piglets  prediction of this trait may be affected by prior selection in the industry. We used Bayes-B with p = 0.99 for all analyses in this study. Generally  Bayes-B is more appropriate when analyzing a trait with one or several major QTL  because Bayes-B allows for each SNP to have its own variance []. In contrast  with Bayes-C and Bayes-Cp  the fitted SNPs have a common variance []. Because the only major QTL was included as a fixed effect in all analyses  it may have been more appropriate to use Bayes-C for prediction with SNPs from the rest of the genome. To investigate this  we repeated the across isolate Genome-WUR analyses using Bayes-C with p = 0.99. Resulting prediction accuracies were not affected for VL but declined by 18% for WG (data not shown). We also analyzed the data using Bayes-C with p = 0  which is equivalent to GBLUP  and found that prediction accuracies were similar to those from Bayes-B with p = 0.99 (data not shown). The Bayes-Cp method also provided less accurate genomic predictions than Bayes-B with p = 0.99 for both VL and WG. Finally  accuracy was not affected when p in Bayes-B was set equal to the estimate from Bayes-Cp analysis  compared to using p = 0.99. For VL and WG in the KS06 data  Bayes-Cp estimates of p were 0.99. For VL and WG in the NVSL data  p was estimated to be 0.56 and 0.42  respectively. Each of these comparisons was made using the Genome-WUR SNP set  as these are the only Bayesian analyses conducted throughout the study. However  the limited datasets prevented a thorough analysis and comparison of alternate methods and priors. Our estimates of genotypic value include both additive and dominance effects  whereas genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) are calculated based on only additive effects []. For whole-genome prediction in our data  the accuracy of GEBV across PRRSV isolates was the same as the accuracy of GEGV for VL but increased by 30% for WG  from 0.34 to 0.4 for N <U+2192> K and from 0.1 to 0.16 for K <U+2192> N. This may be because dominance effects were were small for WG and adding dominance effects with the same prior variance as additive effects added noise to the predictions. Prediction of VL across lines within PRRSV isolate was more accurate when using the whole genome than WUR-only prediction  and WUR-only was more accurate than Genome-WUR prediction. Genome-WUR had very little to no predictive ability within isolate for VL  indicating that the effects of the SSC4 QTL contributed most of the prediction accuracy in this scenario. Genome-WUR accuracy was moderately negative for NVSL trial 6  which may be because pigs in this trial were purebred Landrace  while pigs in other trials were crossbreds. The accuracy of within-isolate prediction for VL in NVSL trial 8 was negative for whole-genome and Genome-WUR prediction and near zero for WUR-only (0.02)  which is not explained by PCA or the average VL in this trial. The near zero accuracy of WUR-only prediction for trial 8 can be explained by the lack of significant effects of the WUR SNP on VL in this trial []. Within PRRSV isolate  prediction of WG was more accurate for the NVSL trials than for the KS06 trials. In the NVSL trials  whole-genome prediction accuracy was higher than WUR-only prediction  and WUR-only prediction was more accurate than Genome-WUR prediction. In the KS06 trials  whole-genome and WUR-only prediction accuracies were equivalent and higher than Genome-WUR prediction accuracies. WUR-only prediction was more accurate in the NVSL trials than in the KS06 trials  which is due to the lack of an effect of the WUR SNP on WG in the KS06 isolate []. The effect of WUR in KS06 is smaller than in NVSL data  however it is in the same direction. With this  even the small effect of WUR in the KS06 data predicts the NVSL WG in the same direction with smaller magnitude of effect. However  the large effect of WUR in the NVSL data poorly predicts the KS06 WG  since more of the variance is explained by other regions of the genome. Whole genome predicts well in both directions since the whole-genome prediction is based on addition of the effects from the rest of the genome and the WUR SNP  so if either part has predictive ability  it contributes to the predictive ability of the whole genome. On average  inclusion of data from the validation genetic line in the training population increased the accuracy of whole-genome and Genome-WUR prediction for both VL and WG  as expected with greater relationships between the training and validation animals [   ]. Although other studies have found that genomic prediction across breeds has very low or no accuracy [    ]  we showed that there was some predictive ability across genetic lines in our data when using the whole genome. Although the training and validation data used in that scenario were from different genetic lines  the commercial lines of crossbred pigs used here were likely genetically more similar than the purebred Holstein and Jersey populations used by Hayes et al. []. Ibán<U+1EBD>z-Escriche et al. []  de Roos et al. []  and Toosi et al. [] examined the accuracy of genomic prediction across breeds by simulation  which requires many assumptions that are often violated in real data. Another likely explanation for differences in the predictive ability across genetic lines in our study from literature data was the large predictive contribution of the SSC4 QTL. Inclusion of related animals in training increased the accuracy most for Genome-WUR prediction  followed by whole-genome prediction  and least for WUR-only prediction. Therefore  accuracy of genomic prediction across genetic backgrounds without related animals in training and validation may be higher when there are one or several QTL with large effects compared to cases when all QTL effects are small and spread across the genome.  Prediction accuracies for VL across isolates and genetic lines followed the same pattern as within-isolate prediction across lines  with whole-genome prediction having the highest accuracy  followed by WUR-only prediction  and with Genome-WUR having the least accurate prediction. For across-isolate prediction of WG  accuracy patterns switched between the two isolates; for K <U+2192> N  WUR-only prediction was more accurate than whole-genome and Genome-WUR prediction  and whole-genome prediction was more accurate than Genome-WUR prediction; for N <U+2192> K  whole-genome prediction was slightly more accurate than Genome-WUR prediction  and the accuracy of Genome-WUR prediction was 51% higher than that of WUR-only prediction. For KS06 trials 10  11  and 12  the accuracy of WUR-only prediction was low but positive (range 0.19–0.26). However  WUR-only prediction had a negative accuracy (- 0.14) for KS06 trial 14  which can be explained by the fact that direction of the effect of the WUR SNP on WG was opposite ( animals had numerically higher WG than  animals) to its effect in other KS06 trials [].  For prediction of VL for each PRRSV isolate in validation  average accuracies were similar for within isolate  across isolate  and with both isolates in training for whole-genome and WUR-only prediction. Genome-WUR prediction was most accurate when the KS06 data were used for training. For WG  on average  whole-genome and Genome-WUR predictions were most accurate when NVSL trials were included in training; N <U+2192> N was more accurate than K <U+2192> N  N <U+2192> K was more accurate than K <U+2192> K  and NK <U+2192> K was more accurate than both N <U+2192> K and K <U+2192> K. This may be due to the absence of large effects observed in the GWAS for WG in the KS06 data []. For WUR-only prediction of WG in the NVSL data  accuracies were similar for within isolate  across isolate  and with both isolates in training for each validation isolate  with WUR-only prediction of WG having higher accuracy for the NVSL data than for the KS06 data. For WUR-only prediction of WG in the KS06 data  within-isolate prediction was more accurate than across isolate and with both isolates in training. Genotype at the WUR SNP was shown to be associated with WG in the NVSL data but not in the KS06 data  which explains the greater accuracy for WUR-only prediction in the NVSL trials. Effects of the WUR SNP were in the same direction as in the NVSL trials in 3 of 4 KS06 trials. Thus WUR-only prediction had similar accuracy for N <U+2192> N and K <U+2192> N. Although GWAS in this data showed that the most strongly associated regions were inconsistent between these two PRRSV isolates  we found that genes near these SNPs were enriched for several of the same gene ontology (GO) terms. We performed genomic prediction using SNP subsets based on either SNPs that were associated with the trait in the training population or SNPs that were near genes with the enriched GO terms. However  SNP subsets based on association or GO term enrichment information gave lower accuracies than the whole genome (results not shown). Also  excluding the SNPs that were included in the association or GO term enriched categories from whole-genome predictions (results not shown)  did not decrease prediction accuracies  which further indicates that these SNP subsets did not contribute significantly to the prediction accuracy. However  in contrast to prediction using only the GO term SNPs  a randomly selected subset of SNPs of the same size had zero predictive accuracy. Jointly  these results indicate that the GO term SNPs are in regions that harbor QTL  but that their effects can also be captured by high-density SNPs outside these regions. Other statistical methods may be needed to capitalize on the addition of functional annotation of GWAS associations to increase the accuracy of genomic prediction. For example  SNPs could be assigned to subsets based on annotation of genes and different prior distributions of effects could be allowed for each subset  as implemented in the method Bayes-R []. In this approach  the whole genome is used for prediction  but the probability of association for SNP subsets is determined by their possible biological relevance. Bayes-N [] is another Bayesian GWAS and prediction method that could be used in this context. Bayes-N uses a nested model  in which the association of groups of SNPs with the phenotype is analyzed first  followed by associations of SNPs within the associated groups []. Our results for within PRRSV isolate Genome-WUR prediction for VL in the NVSL data were similar to the results of Boddicker et al. []  which used data from trials 1 to 8; however our WUR-only prediction accuracy was lower than obtained by Boddicker et al. []. For trial 4  Boddicker et al. [] showed a negative accuracy when using SNPs across the genome except for the SSC4 QTL (similar to our Genome-WUR scenario)  whereas our analysis showed a moderately positive prediction accuracy. There are several possible reasons for these differences. Boddicker et al. [] used the Bayes-C method of GenSel []  while we used Bayes-B. Second  we fitted initial age and weight as covariates  while these effects were not fitted in their model. Third  our training dataset included an additional trial of data (trial 15). In addition  Boddicker et al. [] predicted breeding values  while we estimated genotypic values using both additive and dominance effects for each SNP. Finally  Boddicker et al. [] adjusted phenotypes in the validation population using estimates of fixed effects obtained from an ASReml analysis of all eight trials  while we used only the validation data to adjust for fixed effects. Genomic prediction of response to PRRSV infection was moderately accurate on average  including genomic prediction across PRRSV isolates and across genetic lines. Overall  the Bayes-B method yielded the most accurate genomic predictions. Bayes-C and Bayes-Cp methods did not increase the accuracy of genomic prediction in this study. Whole-genome prediction across PRRSV isolates and genetic lines was moderately accurate  but accuracy was greatly reduced when SNPs in the SSC4 QTL region were removed from the prediction. The previously identified QTL on SSC4 [] had a large effect on VL for both PRRSV isolates and on WG for the NVSL isolate []  and therefore  had a large contribution to prediction accuracy. Greater relationships between training and validation populations had larger effects on genomic prediction accuracy when there were many QTL with small effects for the predicted trait. Especially for VL  inclusion of related animals in the training set yielded the largest increase in the accuracy of Genome-WUR prediction. Using the whole genome for prediction was most accurate and use of only SNPs shown to be associated with the trait decreased prediction accuracy. Furthermore  SNPs near genes annotated with biologically relevant GO terms had less predictive ability than the whole genome. This study reveals that the swine industry can use heterogeneous training and validation datasets to implement genomic selection for improved response to PRRSV infection. Genomic selection for either VL or WG is unlikely to lead to piglets that are resistant to PRRSV infection  but will lessen the negative effects of PRRSV infection. Genomic selection for improved response to PRRSV infection will also likely lead to selection of pigs that have improved responses to infection with other viruses or bacteria  increasing the overall robustness of pig.

Thus  avoiding the use of a multiplier tier will increase the profitability of the breeding program in the short term. The optimum number of selection candidates increases with the length of the time horizon and production output. Using too many selection candidates relative to the optimum leads to less reduction in profitability than using too few selection candidates. In European aquaculture  most breeding programs are operated by private companies  i.e. the governments’ involvement is limited [  ]. Profitability of breeding programs  therefore  is a key determinant in the adoption of selective breeding []. Cost-benefit analysis can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an investment  to find its optimal scale  and to identify its constraints []. The theory for cost-benefit analysis of breeding programs  in particular for livestock species  was developed by Hill []  Moav []  Weller []  and Wilton et al. []. The general concept is that benefits and costs of a breeding program are expressed relative to a baseline scenario without genetic improvement. Costs include investments for husbandry and testing facilities  rearing of selection candidates  trait recording  and genetic analysis. Benefits follow from the increase in genetic levels of traits  the economic values of these traits  and production output of the company  market  or industry. Benefits are permanent and cumulative  but delayed relative to the costs incurred to implement selection. To account for differences in timing of benefits and costs  these are discounted to their present values. The difference in present values of benefits and costs—the net present value—for a given time horizon is a measure of the profitability of the breeding program. Genetic improvement increases farm profit  either via cost reduction per unit product  increased production output  or a combination of both. When breeding is a highly specialized and concentrated activity  such as in salmonids and livestock [  ]  genetic progress is not necessarily reflected in the market price of eggs  young animals  or parent stock []. Instead  the benefits of the breeding program are distributed between the breeding company and its clients  such that the minimum proportion of benefits accrued by the breeding company covers its costs. Integrated companies accrue all benefits from genetic progress generated by the breeding program. Genetic progress can be disseminated with or without a multiplier tier. Generally  pig and poultry breeding programs consist of a nucleus and one or more multiplier tiers. The nucleus consists of various pure lines that are differentially selected. For example  a sire line may be selected for lean tissue growth and a dam line for reproduction. In the multiplier tier  crossbreeding is performed to exploit heterosis  and market-specific crosses are made to meet the needs of different markets. Because of the limited reproductive ability of pigs and poultry  multiplier tiers are required to disseminate genetic progress [  ]. In aquaculture  breeding programs with and without a multiplier tier exist. Specialized breeding companies for salmonids usually make use of a multiplier tier  partly because the fecundity of salmonids is insufficient to supply the entire market directly from the nucleus. Integrated breeding companies control the entire process from reproduction to harvest and operate a breeding program as an integrated part of the process []. Some integrated companies use a multiplier tier  while others do not. When a multiplier tier is used  the highest ranking animals may be used for nucleus replacement and the next tier for multiplier tier replacement  or vice versa. It is unclear which strategy is most profitable. Integrated companies that do not use a multiplier tier use the nucleus to supply production. A multiplier tier can result in delay between genetic progress and its dissemination [] and may thereby negatively affect profitability of a breeding program. Thus  studying the economic consequences of implementing a multiplier tier is relevant in aquaculture breeding programs. For integrated companies  the general objective of investing in a breeding program is maximization of the net present value. Benefits are proportional to the selection intensity and production output of the company  while costs are largely proportional to the number of selection candidates. Therefore  there is an optimum number of selection candidates that maximizes net present value. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of investing in a breeding program by an integrated aquaculture company. The second objective was to evaluate the profitability of alternative breeding program designs. The third objective was to describe the relationship between net present value and the number of selection candidates  length of the time horizon  and production output  and to estimate the optimum number of selection candidates. The baseline for the analyses was based on an existing breeding program for gilthead seabream. Improvement of the nucleus had priority over the multiplier tier  which was partly replaced once every three years. Alternative breeding programs were annual multiplier tier replacement  annual multiplier tier replacement with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier  and a breeding program without a multiplier tier. In all breeding programs  the number of parents per selection round and the number of selection candidates were equal to those in the baseline program  hence the selection intensity and selection index remained the same over breeding programs. The baseline breeding program was based on the existing breeding program of the integrated company Andromeda S.A.  one of the largest producers of gilthead seabream. A schematic overview of this breeding program is in Fig. . It consists of a nucleus of 320 fish  comprised of four year classes  with an overall male to female ratio of 1:1. Because seabream is a protandrous hermaphrodite  younger year classes consist primarily of males and older year classes primarily of females. Thus  broodstock may initially contribute to offspring as males and later as females  which explains the relatively large size of the nucleus. Every year  80 males and 80 females are selected from the nucleus and distributed over eight spawning tanks according to a mating design that manages contributions of parents. Seabream is a batch spawning species that can produce 20 000 to 80 000 eggs per day for a period of up to three months []. Equal quantities of fertilized eggs from all spawning tanks are collected on the same day  pooled  and larvae are reared communally. After weaning  2500 juveniles are selected at random  tagged  fin clipped  and transferred to a sea cage. Microsatellite analyses are used for pedigree reconstruction. Selection is performed after 18 months when the fish reach 400 g. Every selection round  2215 selection candidates survive of which the 80 highest ranking fish based on aggregate genotype are selected as replacements for the oldest year class in the nucleus. Once every three years  an additional 350 fish of the next tier are selected to replace half of the multiplier tier  which is used to produce juveniles for production. Schematic overview of the baseline breeding program The genetic selection differential  i.e. the difference in the mean value of the aggregate genotype of selected individuals relative to the mean of all selection candidates  was first predicted from the sum of products of genetic gain per trait per selection round and economic values. The breeding goal included three traits: thermal growth coefficient (TGC)  thermal feed intake coefficient (TFC)  and mortality rate (M) []. TGC is a measure of growth rate corrected for initial bodyweight and the sum of lifetime daily temperatures. TFC is a measure of feed intake rate corrected for initial bodyweight and the sum of lifetime daily temperatures. M is mortality rate in percent per day. Baseline trait levels  genetic parameters  and economic values are in Table . Estimation of genetic parameters for TGC and TFC is described in “Appendix ”. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between TGC and TFC were assumed to be equal to 0.8 and 0.9  respectively (“Appendix ”). M was assumed to be uncorrelated to TGC and TFC. Genetic gains in TGC and TFC in the nucleus were predicted using SelAction []  applying 1-stage truncation selection on estimated breeding values. Common environmental effects were set to zero. Genetic gain was predicted as if 80 males and 81 females produce offspring (SelAction does not allow half-sibs groups with equal numbers of males and females). The number of surviving selection candidates was 2125. The numbers of full-sib and half-sib records per selection candidate were estimated from stochastic simulation. With eight spawning tanks each holding 10 males and 10 females  there were 800 possible combinations of parental pairs. A total of 2125 offspring were simulated with each parental pair having an equal chance to contribute offspring. Over 1000 simulations  per selection candidate the mean number of full-sibs was 2.7 and the mean number of half-sibs was 50. The average number of dams of half-sibs was 8.4. In SelAction  a full-sib group of 3 and a half-sib group of 50 originating from eight dams were thus included. Although in reality younger year classes consist primarily of males and older year classes primarily of females  here an abrupt sex change from all male to all female was assumed at the age of 4 years. Thus  selected proportions () were set to 0.0376 for both sexes. The selection index contained records of TGC based on own performance  best linear unbiased predictions (BLUP) of breeding values of the parents  and records of TGC on three full-sibs and 50 half-sibs. No phenotypes for TFC were recorded. Genetic gain in M was predicted based on mass selection on cumulative mortality  where the selected proportion equalled the surviving fraction of selection candidates and genetic correlations with other traits were assumed to be zero (“Appendix ”). The genetic selection differential as predicted here account neither for non-linear relationships between trait levels and change in farm profit nor for interactions between traits. To account for these  the genetic selection differential was also predicted using the bio-economic model described in Janssen et al. [] by using baseline trait levels and trait levels after one round of selection as inputs. The genetic selection differential was calculated as the increase in gross margin between the baseline and after one round of selection  divided by the volume of fish production before genetic improvement. Gene flow [  ] was used to simulate increases in the genetic level of each age class of the nucleus and multiplier tier over time. In the nucleus  the 5-year old female year class was replaced every year by 80 2-year old selected males. All year classes in the nucleus were assumed to have equal contributions to selected males  hence mortality in year classes was ignored. A vector  was defined to simulate the flow of genes between age classes over time. The elements in  defined the genetic level in each year class of the nucleus at time  (years). The length of  was five: one for 1-year old selection candidates and four for the 4-year classes. We defined a matrix  that described the flow of genes due to reproduction and aging  and a vector  that described the increase in breeding values due to selection  such that: where   element  of matrix  is the proportion of genes in age class  at time  that came from age class  at time   and element  of vector  denotes the genetic selection differential. The multiplier tier was treated as two age classes with a 1:1 sex ratio  originating from two different selection rounds. Both age classes were assumed to contribute equally to juvenile production  hence the genetic level of fish in production facilities was determined by the average genetic level in the multiplier tier. The genetic selection differential for the 350 fish selected for multiplier tier replacement was lower than that for the 80 fish selected for nucleus replacement. For the nucleus    hence selection intensity () was 2.18. For the  fish used for replacement of both the nucleus and multiplier tier    hence  was 1.39. For the 350 fish selected for the multiplier tier   was thus . Genetic gains in TGC and TFC were proportional to   but genetic gain in M was not because  for M depended on the surviving proportion. Thus  the genetic selection differential  was split between the genetic selection differential due to improvement of TGC and TFC () and the selection differential due to improvement of M (). The genetic selection differential in the multiplier tier was expressed relative to  and  in the nucleus. A vector  was defined to simulate the flow of genes towards and within the multiplier tier. The elements in  defined the genetic level in each age class at time  (year). The length of  was two: the two age classes of the multiplier tier. For years without replacement ( = 1  3  4  6  7  etc.)  average breeding values did not change  hence: The oldest age class in the multiplier tier was replaced at  = 2  5  8  11  etc. For these years  we defined a matrix  that described the flow of genes from the nucleus to the multiplier tier  a matrix  that described the flow of genes in age classes of the multiplier tier due to aging  and a vector  that described the increase in average breeding values due to selection  such that: where   element  of matrix  is the proportion of genes in each age class  of  at time  that came from age class  of  at time  - 2. In this breeding program  part of the multiplier tier was replaced annually. Vector  was defined as before (Eq. ). The multiplier tier was made up of 4 year classes of 175 fish  hence the length of vector  was four. For the  fish used for replacement of both the nucleus and multiplier tier   and  =1.67. For the 175 fish selected for the multiplier tier   was thus . The genetic selection differential was expressed relative to  and  in the nucleus in the baseline. Vectors and matrices       and  were redefined as: where . In this breeding program  part of the multiplier tier was replaced annually but priority was put on improvement of the multiplier tier over the nucleus. For the multiplier tier     =1.85. For the nucleus  . Genetic selection differentials were expressed relative to  and  in the nucleus in the baseline. Vector  was defined as in Eq.   where vector  was defined as: Vector  was defined as in Eq.   where vector  was defined as: This was a breeding program without a multiplier tier. We assumed that in the baseline breeding program the size of the nucleus was too small to supply production year round and expansion of the nucleus would relieve this constraint. Thus  the nucleus was expanded to 700 fish  consisting of 4 year classes of 175 fish each. Thus   and  =1.85. The number of parents per selection round was kept at 160  hence some fish would not be used to produce selection candidates but only to supply production. The genetic selection differential was expressed relative to  and  in the nucleus in the baseline. Vector  was defined as in Eq.   where vector  was defined as: For breeding programs with a multiplier tier  benefits in year  were calculated as the average of vector  multiplied by 5000 tons per year. For the breeding program without a multiplier tier  benefits in year  were calculated as the average of the last four elements of vector  multiplied by 5000 tons per year. For all breeding programs  annual benefits were delayed by one extra year  which is approximately halfway between the total duration of larval rearing and grow out. Instead of considering initial investment and operational expenses separately  as in conventional cost-benefit analysis e.g. []  all costs were converted to annual costs. By using annual costs  irregular investment costs were smoothed over time and the issue of financing is circumvented. The investment pattern and the way of financing are highly specific to individual companies  hence using annual costs instead of cash-flows improves general applicability of the analyses. Costs were estimated from bookkeeping records of Andromeda S.A. Only costs specifically required for the breeding program were included  hence costs for reproduction that would also be necessary without a breeding program were excluded. For investments in buildings and tanks  an annuity was calculated based on a lifetime of 20 years and an interest rate of 4.5% []. Buildings and tanks had salvage values of zero. Costs for husbandry of the nucleus included feed  daily care  and management of the breeding program. Costs for rearing selection candidates included separate rearing  tagging  handling  and quarantine of selected fish. Costs of separate rearing were calculated as the opportunity costs of selling selection candidates minus revenues from selling unselected fish at a discount. Costs of trait recording included all activities required to measure bodyweight. Costs of external services included genetic analysis with microsatellites for parentage assignment and consultancy. For the breeding program without a multiplier tier  annual costs were reduced due to savings on broodstock facilities and husbandry costs. Costs were on average incurred halfway through the 2-year period required for rearing selection candidates  hence costs were incurred for the first time one year after initiation of a breeding program and every year thereafter. First  cost-benefit analyses were based on annual benefits and costs as of the start of the breeding program. The net present value was calculated as []: where  are benefits in year    are annual costs  which are constant over time  and  is a discount factor calculated as  where  is the discount rate. Thus   gives the sum of all discounted benefits minus the sum of all discounted costs as of the start of a breeding program up to a time horizon of  years. The discount rate was set equal to a risk-free rate of return on private investment of 4.5% per year plus a risk premium of 2% per year  summing to 6.5% per year []. The  was calculated up to a time horizon of 20 years. Second  with the aim of explaining differences between breeding programs and for their later optimization   was approximated algebraically as [based on 5]: where  is the average increase in benefits per year and  is the average delay between costs made for a selection round and resulting benefits. However  when the benefits of a selection round were incurred exactly was not self-evident. For breeding programs with a multiplier tier  part of the benefits followed from the genetic selection differential in the multiplier tier and another part followed from the genetic selection differential in the nucleus  which was gradually transmitted to the multiplier tier in successive years. Furthermore  in the baseline breeding program  benefits increased only once every three years  instead of annually. To find   Eq.  was solved for   estimated by simulating the increase in genetic level to  and  using the gene flow model described above. Results of the cost-benefit analyses were used to describe the relationship between profitability and number of selection candidates  length of the time horizon  and production output  and to estimate the optimum numbers of selection candidates. For the given index  breeding goal  and number of selected individuals  annual benefits were proportional to production output  genetic gain in TGC and TFC was proportional to   and annual costs were assumed to be proportional to the number of selection candidates (). The accuracy of selection increases when the number of full- and half-sib records increases  but this effect was ignored because it was of minor importance: doubling the number of full- and half-sib records increased the accuracy by less than 2%. Genetic gain in M was independent of the number of selection candidates  because it was determined by the surviving proportion (“Appendix ”). Rewriting Eq.  as a function of production output  (tons/year)    and   gives: where  is the average increase in annual benefits from genetic gain in TGC and TFC per unit of selection intensity    is the average increase in annual benefits from genetic gain in M  and  are average annual costs per surviving selection candidate. From    can be approximated algebraically as []: where  is 80 selected animals for breeding programs with multiplier tier and 175 for the breeding program without a multiplier tier. For simplicity  effects of  on genetic variation were ignored.  was calculated for a time horizon of 10 years  a production output of 5000 tons  and a range of selection candidates. Investment was optimum when  []. From Eqs.  and  and  at optimum investment  optimum  () was calculated based on [] as: The number of selection candidates was optimized for a production output of 5000 tons per year at varying time horizon lengths  and for varying production outputs at a time horizon of 10 years. Using these estimated optimum numbers of selection candidates   was estimated from Eq.   where  was approximated from Eq. . For the nucleus in the baseline breeding program  genetic gain for each trait due to a single selection round is in Table . The selection differential () was €198/ton production  of which €180/ton was due to improvements in TGC and TFC () and €18/ton was due to improvement in M (). Simulations in the bio-economic model resulted in a selection differential of €197/ton production  indicating that non-linearity and trait interactions were negligible. For comparison  the product price received by the fish farming company was €4500/ton. Mean genetic levels of the nucleus and multiplier tier over 10 years from the start of breeding programs are in Fig. . In the baseline breeding program  the mean genetic level of the nucleus increased at a more or less constant rate  while the mean genetic level of the multiplier tier increased stepwise once every three years. For longer time horizons  the increase in mean genetic levels approached €56.5/ton production per year in the nucleus and €169/ton production per three years in the multiplier tier.

The genetic level of animals used in production was highest up to year 10 in the breeding program without a multiplier tier. Thereafter  the genetic level of the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement was highest. The genetic level of animals used in production was higher up to year 7 for the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier than for both the baseline breeding program and the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement (with nucleus priority).

The baseline breeding program had the lowest  up to year 17. After year 17  the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier had the lowest . The breeding program without a multiplier tier had the highest  up to year 22. After year 22  the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement had the highest .

The average delay () between costs made for a selection round and resulting benefits was 4.2 years.  could thus be calculated from Eq.  as: For the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement   was 2.5 years and  was €282 000 per year. For the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier   was 0.4 years and  was €176 000 per year. For the breeding program without a multiplier tier   was 2.1 years and  was €247 000 per year. For a 10-year time horizon and a production output of 5000 tons   increased with the number of selection candidates up to an optimum  after which it gradually decreased (Fig. ). Optimum numbers of selection candidates were 1218 in the baseline breeding program  2015 in the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement  1970 in the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier  and 2756 in the breeding program without a multiplier tier.

With optimum numbers of selection candidates and a production output of 5000 tons (Fig. a)  the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier had the highest  up to year 10. Thereafter  the breeding programs with annual multiplier tier replacement and without a multiplier tier were superior. With optimum numbers of selection candidates and a time horizon of 10 years (Fig. b)   was similar across breeding programs for any production output  except for the baseline breeding program  which had a much lower .

Blue line: baseline breeding program  red dotted line: breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement  green dashed line: breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier  violet dashed line: breeding program without a multiplier tier In the baseline breeding program  part of the multiplier tier was replaced only once every three years. Annual multiplier tier replacement results in a consistently higher   because the average delay between costs made for a selection round and resulting benefits is shorter. In the short term  putting priority on improvement of the multiplier tier over the nucleus resulted in a relatively fast increase in the average breeding value of animals used in production. This explained the higher  of the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier for the first 9 years relative to the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement (with nucleus priority). In the long term  however  the genetic level of animals used in production is determined by the genetic selection differential in the nucleus and putting priority on improvement of the multiplier tier is at the expense of the genetic selection differential in the nucleus. This explains the lower  in the long term of the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier relative to the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement (with nucleus priority). A multiplier tier causes substantial delay in benefits from genetic improvement. Compared to the baseline breeding program and the breeding program with annual multiplier tier replacement  the breeding program without a multiplier tier had a lower genetic selection differential but the average delay between costs made for a selection round and resulting benefits was shorter. The shorter delay more than compensated for the reduction in genetic selection differential  resulting in a higher  for the first 22 years. This has important implications for the design of breeding programs. In livestock species  a multiplier tier is used to disseminate genetic progress  to exploit heterosis  and to create market-specific crosses. In aquaculture breeding programs  selection in multiple pure lines is not common  except for carp []  hence a multiplier tier does not offer any advantage with respect to heterosis or creation of specific line crosses. For most fish species  except salmonids  a multiplication tier is also not required to disseminate genetic progress because  generally  fish have a high fecundity rate []. Nevertheless  some integrated breeding companies use a multiplier tier  for example  to maintain a high level of biosecurity in the nucleus  and for flexibility in juvenile production. Such advantages should be weighed against the loss in  of having a multiplier tier. Results for the optimum number of selection candidates illustrate the importance of production output and time horizon as design parameters for breeding programs. A higher production output and a longer time horizon generate higher benefits  which  in turn  warrant higher annual costs. When the number of selection candidates was optimized  the breeding program with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier had the highest  during the first 10 years but for time periods beyond this  other breeding programs were superior. These results demonstrate that re-ranking of breeding programs can occur with increasing time horizon. For the breeding programs considered  no re-ranking occurred with increasing production output  regardless of the time horizon. Our results apply specifically to integrated breeding companies. Nevertheless  investments in a breeding program must be cost effective also for specialized breeding companies  because budgets are always limited and competitiveness of a breeding company is determined by the genetic level of its products. On the one hand  specialized breeding companies often supply a relatively large proportion of the market compared to integrated breeding companies []  which warrants relatively large investments in the breeding program. On the other hand  specialized breeding companies accrue only a proportion of benefits obtained from genetic improvement. Thus  for a given production output  the optimum level of investment in a breeding program by a specialized breeding company may be lower than for an integrated company. Ultimately  investment in a breeding program by specialized breeding companies is driven by the expected outcome of the complex dynamics between the genetic level of its products relative to the competition  market shares  and the extent to which premium products fetch premium prices []. For aquaculture breeding programs  only a few cost-benefit analyses have been performed [  ]. In all these studies  the profit equation that was used to derive economic values of traits did not provide an adequate description of the farming system []. Thus  the resulting economic values led to biased estimates of gains in farm profit after genetic improvement  and benefits could not be accurately estimated. Ponzoni et al. [] and Ponzoni et al. [] performed cost-benefit analyses of national breeding programs for Nile tilapia and common carp  respectively. Because benefits of these programs were distributed nationwide  they were highly profitable. When genetic improvement is disseminated nationwide  most benefits will accrue to consumers  because in an open and competitive market  lower production costs will be followed by lower market prices of fish. This is different from our study  where genetic improvement affects only production costs of a single company. Zuniga-Jara and Marin-Riffo [] performed a cost-benefit analysis of a breeding program for abalone for an integrated company and their results were much less favourable than ours  largely because investments to expand production capacity were considered to be costs of the breeding program. The profitability of breeding programs in aquaculture has  in multiple occasions  been reviewed based on the (discounted) benefit-cost ratio e.g. [  ]. Although this ratio is appealing  it may not be an appropriate evaluation criterion for breeding programs  because it favours underinvestment. For example  decreasing the optimum number of selection candidates by 10% results in a higher benefit-cost ratio  whereas it is at the expense of  by definition. Economic values used in this study were derived for a situation in which production output of a farm is limited by stocking density []. Consequently  the genetic selection differential resulted from both a cost reduction per unit product and an increase in production output. Throughout Europe  different regulations apply that constrain production output of farms  and economic values depend on these quota []. If the quota were on production output instead of stocking density  improvement of TGC would not increase production output. Consequently  the economic value of TGC and the genetic selection differential would be lower than in the current study. We also assumed that the increased production output due to genetic improvement did not affect the market price of fish. This assumption is justified when the relative increase in supply is small and slow  and is absorbed by increasing demand []  i.e. when the company produces only a small fraction of the total supply. Moreover  any price effect would be similar for all alternative breeding programs compared  i.e. would have only a limited impact on their relative performance. Thus  in our view  this assumption is justified. Estimation of the genetic selection differential was subject to some simplifications. Equal contributions of year classes in the nucleus were assumed  whereas skewed contributions could be expected because average breeding values of older year classes were lower than those of younger year classes. The rate of genetic gain would benefit from a larger contribution of parents from younger year classes with higher average breeding values. For example  the extreme case with maximal contributions from age classes 2 (males) and 4 (females) of the nucleus  such that  (top rows of Eqs.  and ) resulted in a 2.6% higher  in year 10. However  this would also result in an increase in the rate of inbreeding  but this could be controlled by balancing contributions of year classes. Thus  taking unequal contributions of year classes into account would make the prediction of the genetic selection differential unnecessarily complex. The assumed genetic parameters imply that feed conversion ratio (FCR) improves as a correlated response to selection on TGC. However  there is some debate about the effect of selection on growth on FCR in fish  see review in []. Although a reduction in FCR is expected  it is useful to predict the genetic selection differential when there is no correlated response in FCR. For the predicted genetic gain in TGC of 1.089 g/(day degrees·1000) (Table )  genetic gain in TFC was increased in the bio-economic model up to the level that the resulting value of FCR was equal to FCR at levels of TGC and TFC before genetic improvement. The resulting value for genetic gain in TFC was 0.70 g/(day degrees·1000)  which was higher than genetic gain in the baseline breeding program. Thus  this value for genetic gain in TFC may be considered the maximum correlated response for the predicted genetic gain in TGC. If there is no correlated response in FCR  the selection differential in the baseline breeding program would be €137/ton production  i.e. a reduction of 31%. For genetic gain in M  we assumed own performance selection on binomial records (dead or alive)  such that all surviving selection candidates had equal estimated breeding values for M. Genetic gain would be higher when family information are used. With family information  all surviving selection candidates within a family would have equal estimated breeding values allowing for between family selection only. A possible correlated response in M from selection on TGC was ignored  leading to a conservative estimate of benefits due to improvement of M. Traits that are genetically correlated to survival could be used in the index for within-family selection. Several studies have reported positive genetic correlations between growth rate and survival  indicating that growth rate can be used as a selection criterion to improve survival [   ]. These studies analysed only direct genetic effects and ignored indirect genetic effects on group mates  although these may explain a substantial part of the heritable variation []. A negative correlation of - 0.79 between the direct genetic effect of survival and indirect genetic effect of growth rate in a competitive environment suggests that an individual that has a high breeding value for survival will have a negative effect on the growth rate of its group mates []. Similarly  competition may also lead to a negative correlation between the direct genetic effect of growth rate and the indirect genetic effect of survival  but as far as we know  this correlation has not been studied in fish. A negative correlation between the direct genetic effect of growth and indirect genetic effect of survival would imply that faster growth in one fish may be at the expense of survival of its group mates. In case of competition  this correlation may be antagonistic to the correlation between the direct genetic effects of growth and survival. Thus  when indirect genetic effects are ignored  correlated response in survival when selecting on growth rate may be overestimated. Because we ignored a potential negative correlation between the direct genetic effect of growth and indirect genetic effect of survival  we also ignored the positive correlation between the direct genetic effects of growth and survival. The breeding program of Andromeda S.A. is used to supply many different production sites across the Mediterranean. Thus  conditions for rearing selection candidates differ from those in production  which may cause genotype-by-environment interactions. Differences in the temperature regime at different sites can affect economic values of traits [] and absolute changes in economic values directly affect the genetic selection differential. Both genotype-by-environment interaction and changes in relative economic values would lead to re-ranking of selection candidates  which would decrease the genetic selection differential. Furthermore  the genetic selection differential was assumed to be constant over generations. In reality  this is unlikely  because both genetic gain in individual traits and economic values may be non-linear over multiple generations. On the one hand  genetic gain in TGC and TFC was based on equilibrium genetic parameters  based on the Bulmer effect  hence the genetic selection differential that we used is conservative for the first generations. On the other hand  genetic gain in M is assumed to be constant  whereas constant genetic gain on the liability scale of cumulative mortality results in exponentially decreasing genetic gain on the observed scale for M. Thus  the genetic selection differential due to improvement of M would decrease over generations. Each parental pair was assumed to have the same chance to produce offspring. In reality  the numbers of offspring per parent are skewed  which would increase the rate of inbreeding. Rate of inbreeding is managed by a mating design that controls parental contributions to replacement stock. Measures to control the rate of inbreeding may reduce the genetic selection differential. Compared to the baseline breeding program  all alternative breeding programs had an equal number of parents per selection round  an equal number of selection candidates  and an equal or lower selection intensity. Thus  each breeding program evaluated had similar or lower rates of inbreeding than the baseline breeding program. The baseline breeding program had a positive net present value after 5 years and was highly profitable thereafter. For a short time horizon  putting priority on improvement of the multiplier tier over the nucleus is more profitable than putting priority on nucleus improvement  and vice versa for a long time horizon. Use of a multiplier tier increases the delay between costs made for selection and resulting benefits. Thus  avoiding the use of a multiplier tier will increase the profitability of the breeding program in the short term. The number of selection candidates can be optimized to maximize net present value of a breeding program and this optimum increases with the length of the time horizon and production output. Using too many selection candidates relative to the optimum leads to less reduction in profitability than using too few selection candidates. benefits in a given year (€) average increase in annual benefits (€/year) average increase in annual benefits from genetic gain in TGC and TFC per unit of  (€/year) average increase in annual benefits from genetic gain in M (€/year) average annual costs per surviving selection candidate (€/year) discount rate (%/year) selection intensity mortality rate (%/day) net present value (€) algebraically approximated  (€) selected proportion production output (tons/year) discount factor selection candidates optimum number of selection candidates number of selected animals genetic selection differential (€/selection round) genetic selection differential due to improvement of M (€/selection round) genetic selection differential due to improvement of TGC and TFC (€/selection round) time (year) thermal growth coefficient (g/(day degrees·1000)) thermal feed intake coefficient (g/(day degrees·1000)) average delay between costs made for a selection round and resulting benefits (year) Chavanne H  Janssen K  Hofherr J  Contini F  Haffray P  Komen H  et al.

Our results confirmed the presence of positive directional dominance for pig litter size and suggested that it should be taken into account when dominance effects are included in genomic evaluation procedures. The consequences of ignoring directional dominance may affect predictions of breeding values and can lead to biased prediction of inbreeding depression and performance of potential mates. A model that assumes Gaussian dominance effects that are centered on a non-zero mean is recommended  at least for datasets with similar features to those analyzed here. Since the availability of dense genotyping panels []  genomic prediction [  ] has become a very successful strategy for the prediction of breeding values of candidates for selection. Genomic prediction methods are based on the evaluation of the additive substitution effects of markers that capture a large part of the dominance and higher-order interaction effects []. However  estimating dominance effects may be relevant because their estimates can be used to allocate mates among candidates for selection [  ]. Two approaches have been suggested to estimate the effects of dominance in genomic prediction methods. The first [] directly models the additive (a) and dominance (d) effects  while for the second  Vitezica et al. [] proposed to include allele substitution (a) and dominance deviation (d) effects in order to compute appropriate breeding values. However  both these approaches impose a Gaussian regularization of additive and dominance effects that forces a symmetric distribution of the posterior estimates. Nevertheless  the classical theory of quantitative genetics [] argues that inbreeding depression and heterosis are based on the presence of directional dominance (i.e.  a higher percentage of positive than negative dominance effects) and this contrasts with the assumption of symmetry of the above-described procedures. This discrepancy can be overcome in at least two ways: (1) by assuming that the mean of dominance effects differ from zero  which leads to the inclusion of a covariate for the average individual homozygosity in the statistical model  and (2) by using skewed distributions for the regularization of dominance effects. The first approach can be called regression on genomic inbreeding and it was empirically used by Sun et al. []  Silió et al. []  Aliloo et al. [] and Zeng et al. []  and proved by Xiang et al. []. As far as we are aware  the second approach was never applied in the field of animal genetics  although it may be of considerable value since it ensures that the most frequent dominance effects are close to zero. In contrast  regression on genomic inbreeding implies that the mean and mode of the dominance effects are equal  although they may differ from zero. In the statistical literature  there is a broad corpus on the specification of skewed distributions [  ] and  among them  the family of skew-elliptical distributions defined by Sahu et al. [] can be easily implemented in Bayesian regression using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques []. The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) model that uses a prior skewed distribution for dominance effects; (2) to compare it with the model with inclusion of a covariate for inbreeding proposed by Xiang et al. []; and (3) to confirm the presence of directional dominance for pig litter size. The data used in this study were from two unrelated pig lines provided by Genus plc (Hendersonville  TN  USA). Genotypes for all sows were generated using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego). After quality control  i.e. excluding genotypes from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 and a call rate lower than 0.95 in each population  37 900 and 37 011 genotypes for SNPs remained for lines 1 and 2  respectively. Individuals with a call rate lower than 0.95 were also removed. Finally  the number of sows included in the analysis were 3631 and 2612 for lines 1 and 2  respectively. In total  13 449 and 11 581 records on litter size (number of piglets born alive) were available for these sows  with an average litter size of 11.7 ± 2.9 and 12.4 ± 3.0 for lines 1 and 2  respectively. The first step was the definition of a Full Model that included both approaches for directional dominance  i.e. regression on genomic inbreeding and a skewed distribution for SNP effects). Then  a subset of model parameters was set to 0 in order to identify reduced models. The Full Model was: where  is the vector of phenotypic records   is the general mean   is a covariate that can be interpreted as inbreeding depression or heterosis   is a vector of order of parity effects (4 levels - 1st  2nd  3rd and > 3rd)   is a vector of farm-year-month of farrowing effects (3163 levels for line 1 and 4293 for line 2)   is a vector of permanent environmental effects (3631 and 2612 levels for lines 1 and 2  respectively)   and  are vectors of additive and dominance effects (37 900 and 37 011 levels)  and  is a vector of residuals. Furthermore   is a vector of the average SNP homozygosity of the individuals and        and  are incidence matrices that link the phenotypic records with        and   respectively. Under the Bayesian paradigm  prior distributions were uniform for    and for each element of   univariate Gaussian for each element of    and   and skew Gaussian for each element of . Finally  prior distributions for the variances of farm-year-month of farrowing ()  permanent environmental ()  additive ()  dominance ()  and residual effects () were scaled inverted Chi square (see “” for a full description of the Bayesian inference). It should be noted that directional dominance comprises two model parameters  one covariate for the average SNP homozygosity () and one asymmetry parameter () that is involved in the skew Gaussian prior distribution of dominance effects. Based on the Full Model  three reduced models were defined as follows: Model SC: symmetric dominance effect with the inbreeding depression covariate  i.e. the asymmetry parameter () was set to zero. This model was equivalent to that defined by Xiang et al. []. Model AN: asymmetric dominance effect without the inbreeding depression covariate  i.e. covariate  was set to zero. Model SN: symmetric dominance effect without the inbreeding depression covariate  i.e. both asymmetry parameter  and covariate  were set to zero. This model was equivalent to that defined by Su et al. []. The four models (Full  SC  AN  SN) were analyzed using a Gibbs sampler [] (see “” for a full description) that provided posterior distributions for all unknowns in the model  i.e. individual breeding values () and dominance deviations ()  additive and dominance variances ( and )  and the expected inbreeding depression per percentage of inbreeding (). Models SC  AN and SN were analyzed by five chains of 75 000 iterations  after discarding the first 25 000. Each chain used a different random seed. As the convergence of the Full Model was clearly the worst  the Gibbs sampler implementation for this model was set to five chains of 250 000 iterations  after a burn-in of the first 50 000. Convergence and effective sample size were checked using the standard procedures [] with CODA package [] and by visual inspection of the chains. Finally  models were compared using the deviance information criteria (DIC) [] and the logarithm of the conditional predictive ordinate (LogCPO) [] (see “” for a full description). The results of the convergence and the effective size of the MCMC chains are presented in Additional file : Tables S1 and S2. The average number of iterations required until convergence was computed using the Raftery and Lewis approach [] and ranged from 93.0 (for parameter  in the SC Model for line 1) to 9204.0 ( in the Full Model for line 1). The estimated effective sample size (EFS) of the MCMC chains [] ranged from 82 ( in the SN Model for line 2) to 16 510 ( in the Full Model for line 1). Finally  the required numbers of samples to achieve an accuracy of 0.1 for the 0.5 quantile with a probability of 0.95 were calculated using the Raftery and Lewis approach [] and ranged from 3210 ( in the SC Model for line 1) to 290 280 ( in the Full Model for line 1). Posterior mean estimates (and posterior deviations) of variance components  asymmetry parameters  and expected inbreeding depression and results of the comparison of models are in Tables  and  for lines 1 and 2  respectively. Posterior estimates of the variance of the additive effects () under Model SN were equal to 0.394 × 10 and 0.678 × 10 for lines 1 and 2  respectively. Compared with the SN Model  these estimates were slightly lower for the AN Model (0.345 × 10 and 0.617 × 10)  those for the SC Model were moderately higher (0.439 × 10 and 0.701 × 10) (Tables  and ) and those for the Full Model were similar (0.381 × 10 and 0.615 × 10). A different pattern was observed for the variance of dominance effects ()  with posterior mean estimates being equal to 0.369 × 10 and 0.430 × 10 for lines 1 and 2  respectively  for Model SN (Tables  and ). Models that allowed for asymmetry of dominance effects (AN and Full) provided higher posterior mean estimates of the variance of dominance effects (0.769 × 10 and 0.536 × 10 for line 1 and 0.872 × 10 and 0.993 × 10 for line 2  respectively) than the SC Model (0.122 × 10 and 0.334 × 10 for lines 1 and 2  respectively). Because of the above results  estimates of additive genetic variance () and narrow sense heritability () were higher for Models AN and Full than for Models SN and SC (Tables  and ). In contrast  posterior mean estimates of the variance of dominance deviations () and percentage of dominance variation () were lower for Models SN and SC than for Models AN and Full (Tables  and ). Estimates of the variance of farm-year month effects () and of residuals () were consistent between models  ranging from 0.160 to 0.161 for line 1 and from 0.296 to 0.299 for line 2 for the farm-year-month variance and from 6.567 to 6.570 and from 6.630 to 6.635 for the residual variance for lines 1 and 2  respectively. However  the estimates of the variance of permanent environmental effects () differed substantially between models (Tables  and )  with posterior mean estimates for the SN and SC Models being the highest (0.478 and 0.572 for line 1 and 0.580 and 0.614 for line 2  respectively) and decreasing when asymmetry was allowed  reaching the lowest estimates for Models AN (0.308 and 0.380 for lines 1 and 2  respectively) and Full (0.394 and 0.333). Posterior mean estimates of the asymmetry parameter for dominance effects () were all positive (Tables  and  and Fig. ) and ranged from 0.135 (line 1 and Model Full) to 0.380 (line 1 and Model AN). However  it should also be noted that posterior probabilities of a positive value for  were higher than 0.999 for Model AN  while the highest posterior density regions at 95% (HPD95) for  included zero for the Full Model for both lines. Posterior distribution of the asymmetry parameter (<U+03BB>) under Models AN and Full for lines 1 and 2 The regression coefficient on individual homozygosity () was estimated with Models SC and Full (Tables  and  and Fig. ). With the SC Model  posterior mean estimates of  were clearly negative (- 12.15 and - 7.95 for lines 1 and 2  respectively)  but equal to - 5.72 and 1.73 for lines 1 and 2 for the Full Model. It should also be noted that posterior standard deviations were higher for the Full than for the SC Model. The HPD95 regions for  included zero for the Full Model  but posterior probabilities of negative values were always higher than 0.99 for Model SC. Posterior distribution of the covariate for individual homozygosity (b) under Models SC and Full for lines 1 and 2 Results for the expected inbreeding depression () per percentage of inbreeding are in Tables  and  and Fig. . Posterior mean (and posterior standard deviation) estimates of  for the SN Model were - 0.016 (0.005) piglets for line 1 and - 0.008 (0.005) piglets for line 2. However  posterior mean (and posterior standard deviation) estimates for remaining Models (AN  SC and Full) were remarkably lower  being - 0.044 (0.006)  - 0.045 (0.006)  and - 0.045 (0.006) for line 1 and - 0.028 (0.008)  - 0.025 (0.008) and - 0.029 (0.008) for line 2. Posterior distribution of the expected inbreeding depression for an inbreeding level of 0.10 for lines 1 and 2 Correlations of estimates for the SNP additive () and dominance () effects and for breeding values () and dominance deviations () between the four models of analysis are in Additional file : Tables S3 and S4. Correlations of estimates of the additive and dominance effects between models were always higher than 0.990 and correlations of estimates of breeding values and dominance deviations between models were also close to 1. However  it should be noted that the correlations between the estimated breeding values from the SN Model and the dominance deviations from the AN Model with the estimates from the remaining models were remarkably lower than those from the other models. In the first case  they ranged from 0.933 to 0.944 in line 1 and from 0.794 to 0.842 in line 2 and in the second case  from 0.769 to 0.944 in line 1 and from 0.702 to 0.857 in line 2. Results of the model comparison tests (logCPO and DIC) are also in Tables  and . In both lines  the model with the best fit for both tests was the SC Model  followed by the SN and AN Models. The Full Model had the worst fit. The advent of dense genotyping information has allowed the development of models for genomic evaluation [] that have revolutionized the field of animal breeding during the last decade. Most models for genomic evaluation are designed to deal with the classical statistical problem of large  and small   because the number of parameters to evaluate is frequently larger than the number of phenotypic data. The most common approach for dealing with this problem is the use of some kind of regularization of the effects of SNPs []. Several approaches have been suggested  ranging from simple Gaussian regularization [] to more complex models that involve t-shaped []  double exponential [  ]  or mixtures of distributions [    ]. However  all these methods of regularization use symmetric distributions that  from a Bayesian perspective  imply that marker effects are centered at zero. This assumption seems reasonable for the additive or substitution effects  but it is not so clear for dominance effects. In fact  the classical theory of quantitative genetics attributes the phenomenon of inbreeding depression (or heterosis) to the presence of directional dominance or  in other words  a positive average of dominance effects  jointly with a decrease (or increase) in the degree of heterozygosity []. In this study  we considered two approaches to model directional dominance in genomic evaluation methods. The first assumed a prior distribution for dominance effects that allowed a mean that was different from 0  i.e. Model SC  following the work of Xiang et al. []; the second assumed that dominance effects followed a skew Gaussian distribution that has a higher probability of positive (or negative) effects  i.e. Model AN. Finally  both approaches were combined into a Full Model. All models were implemented using a Gibbs sampler. The analysis of the MCMC chains indicated that convergence was achieved with the proposed burn-in for all models and both lines (25 000 iterations for AN  SC and SN Models and 50 000 for the Full Model). Nevertheless  the EFS was heterogeneous across parameters and models. In general  the EFS of the variance of dominance effects was smaller than that of the variance of additive effects  and the EFS of the parameters related with directional dominance ( and ) were very large for the AN and SN Models and remarkably smaller for the Full Model. Nevertheless  the sizes of the five Gibbs sampler chains (5 × 75 000 iterations for AN  SN and SC Models and 5 × 200 000 for the Full Model) were always larger than the length required for estimation of the 0.5 quantile of the posterior distributions with an accuracy of 0.1 and with a probability of 0.95  based on the Raftery and Lewis approach []. Results from Models SC and AN provided clear evidence of directional dominance for both lines (Figs.  and ); posterior distributions of the regression coefficient on individual homozygosity ( in Model SC) and the asymmetry parameter ( in Model AN) did not include zero in the highest posterior density at 99%. These results confirm the presence of directional dominance for litter size in pigs and they are in line with extensive reports on positive estimates for inbreeding depression and heterosis in the literature [  ]. However  results from the Full Model were not so clear because it suffered from some degree of statistical confounding of  and   as observed in the strong posterior correlation (0.91) between the Gibbs samples of  and  (see Additional file : Figures S1 and S2). As a consequence  their posterior distributions were wider and they included zero in the HPD at 95% for  and  (Figs.  and ) and convergence and EFS for both these parameters were worse than with the SC and AN Models (see Additional file : Tables S1 and S2). Models that allow the presence of directional dominance (SC  AN  Full) were able to predict the expected inbreeding depression () in populations that had a low range of levels of genealogical inbreeding. This approximation uses the classical additive model of inbreeding depression [] but replacing dominance effects of causal polymorphisms with dominance effects of SNPs. In this approach  a linear relationship between inbreeding and inbreeding depression is assumed. Results were presented as the expected inbreeding depression per percentage of inbreeding. In the analyzed populations  the expected inbreeding depression coefficients under these models were around - 0.045 and between - 0.025 and - 0.028 piglets in lines 1 and 2  respectively. These results concur with those of Vitezica et al. []  who also reported larger estimates of inbreeding depression in line 1 than in line 2 and they are close to the estimates of inbreeding depression for litter size in other pig populations [  ]. In contrast  the estimates provided by the SN Model were substantially closer to 0  i.e. - 0.016 and - 0.008 piglets for lines 1 and 2  respectively. This may indicate that models that do not allow for directional dominance  such as the SN Model  cannot predict the magnitude of inbreeding depression (or heterosis) correctly and  thus  lead to biases if they are used for the prediction of future mate performance and mate allocation []. Nevertheless  there were some remarkable differences between the results obtained for the two lines  which are interesting to analyze further. Evidence of directional dominance was larger for line 1 than for line 2 for both approaches (estimates of - 12.15 vs. - 6.48 for  in Model SC and of 0.38 vs. 0.25 for  in Model AN)  although posterior estimates of the dominance variance were lower for line 1 for all models. This suggests that the magnitude of directional dominance (or inbreeding depression) is not necessarily related to the amount of dominance variance estimated from resemblance between relatives. In fact  in the presence of inbreeding  the total genetic variance is split into five components [  ]: the additive and dominance genetic variances in the base population  the dominance genetic variance between homozygous individuals  the covariance between additive and dominance effects between homozygous individuals  and the square of the inbreeding depression. Traditional approaches to estimate dominance variance using genealogical [  ] or genomic dominance relationships [] only take the additive and dominance variance in the base population into account and ignore the remaining variance components. It is possible that the presence of directional dominance also allows some of the other variance components that are not considered under the assumption of multivariate normality to be captured. Of particular significance is the fact that the estimates of the variance of dominance effects differed substantially between models. Lower estimates were obtained with the SC Model  whereas estimates from Models SN  AN and Full were higher. The cause of the inflation of dominance effects under the last three models may be the restrictions imposed by the assumed prior distributions. Under Model SN  the prior distribution forced the mean and mode of effects to be centered at zero. Thus  if directional dominance exists  specific estimates of the effects of SNPs would attempt to accommodate this  which would lead to an increase in the variance of dominance effects. Model AN allowed the presence of more positive (or negative) dominance effects but it forced the mode of the distributions to be close to zero. Estimates of the effects of SNPs for Model AN may be even larger than for Model SN  but as the prior distribution forced them to have a mode close to zero  the variance of dominance effects was also inflated in Model AN. Furthermore  the increase in the variance of dominance effects in Models SN  AN and Full with respect to Model SC was compensated by a corresponding decrease in the permanent environmental variance  as pointed out in other studies [  ]. Thus  the estimate of the permanent environmental variance was the largest for Model SC for both lines. The differences between models were also reflected in the correlations of estimates of breeding values and dominance deviations between models. Although the correlations for estimates of SNP additive and dominance effects between models were very high (see Additional file : Tables S3 and S4)  the correlations for estimates of breeding values and dominance deviations provided some exceptions. For breeding values  estimates from the model that did not consider directional dominance (Model SN) had lower correlations with estimates from the other models (SC  AN and Full). This suggests that the inclusion of directional dominance with either of the two approaches would result in substantial changes in the ranking of individuals based on estimates of breeding values  which may have consequences for breeding decisions. In addition  the correlations between estimates of dominance deviations from Model AN with those from the other models were also lower (0.70–0.94)  which may imply that the use of skewed prior distributions affects estimation of dominance deviations and the prediction of performance of future individuals (or crosses). The best model based on the two criteria used for comparison of models was the SC Model  followed by the SN and AN Models; the Full Model provided the worst fit for both lines. Model SN does not consider directional dominance and thus  it was penalized relative to Model SC. Models AN and Full were equally able to capture directional dominance since they led to similar estimates of inbreeding depression. However  they were penalized because the number of unknowns in these models is larger than in Model SC; they estimate  and one auxiliary variable for the dominance effect of each SNP. In the light of these results  the main finding of our study is that Model SC  as defined by Xiang et al. []  is recommended for the analysis of traits when directional dominance (or inbreeding depression) is expected and when resulting estimates of dominance effects are used for prediction of performance of future mates and mate allocation []. This recommendation is strengthened by the ease with which the SC Model can be formulated based on the genomic dominance relationship matrix []  which helps to reduce the computational burden and directly provides predictions of additive and dominance effects for each individual. However  the application of skewed distributions should not be completely discarded for new lines of research. First  we assumed that the additive and dominance effects were independent  although it is possible to use multivariate asymmetric distributions []  as in the models of Wellman and Bennewitz []  which consider a relationship between the magnitudes of additive and dominance effects. Second  the assumption of Gaussian distributions can be replaced by the asymmetric version of any other distribution  such as t-shape or double exponential distribution  leading to asymmetric versions of the Bayes B [] or Bayesian Lasso [] approaches. These approaches may avoid the large increase in the variance of dominance effects since most of the estimates of the dominance effects of SNPs will be forced to be zero [] or closer to zero [] than with a prior Gaussian distribution. Finally  all the approaches described here assume that directional dominance is homogeneous along the genome. However  there is evidence in the literature of local differences in the causes of inbreeding depression across the genome [  ]. Further research is needed to investigate this phenomenon and  also  to model additional causes of inbreeding depression (or heterosis)  such as epistatic interactions []. The results of our study confirm the presence of positive directional dominance for litter size in two lines of pigs. Ignoring this in genomic evaluation models with dominance effects alters the prediction of breeding values and may cause bias in the prediction of inbreeding depression (or heterosis) and of the performance of future mates. These effects can be avoided by using two alternative models  one that includes a non-zero mean of dominance effects and another that uses skewed prior distributions for them  with the latter providing a better fit. Thus  this approach should be recommended for modeling dominance effects  at least for datasets that have similar features as those analyzed here.

First  we define the joint posterior distribution of all the unknowns in the model as: where  is the vector of phenotypic data   is the general mean   is a covariate with the average SNP homozygosity         and  are the vectors of order of parity  farm-year-month of farrowing  permanent environmental  additive and dominance effects  respectively.        and  are the farm-year-month of farrowing  permanent environmental  additive  dominance and residual variance and  is the parameter that reflects the asymmetry of the dominance effects. The conditional distribution of the data given all the unknowns in the model was: where  is the number of data   is the - element of the vector  of the average SNP homozygosity  and        and  are the - rows of the        and  matrices that link the phenotypic records with        and   respectively. The prior distributions for the general mean ()  the covariate with the average homozygosity ()  each level of the order of parity effects ( and the asymmetry parameter () were uniform within appropriate bounds    being a large real number. The prior distributions for     and  were the products of the following Gaussian distributions: where    and  are the numbers of elements of     and   respectively. Furthermore  the prior distribution for  was the product of the following skew Gaussian distributions []: where  and  denote the density function and cumulative distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution. Following Sahu et al. []  the first three moments of a skewed Gaussian () distribution——are: Note that when     and   as in the standard Gaussian distribution. Finally  the prior distributions for the variance components        and  were scaled inverse Chi square distributions: with parameters  and   that correspond to uniform distributions over the positive real scale. The Gibbs sampler is an updating sampling scheme [] that needs to sample from the full conditional distributions of all unknowns in the model. The full conditional distribution of    and each level of       and  were univariate Gaussian as in the standard implementation of the Gibbs sampler in the mixed model []. The conditional distribution of each level of  is the product of a Gaussian distribution with a skewed Gaussian () distribution with parameters  and : where  is the vector of the dominance effects without the - effect ()   is the - row of matrix . In order to facilitate the conditional sampling of   we invoked the following property of the skewed Gaussian distribution []: which allows to understand the skewed Gaussian distribution as a mixture of an infinite number of standard Gaussian distributions with  variance and mean defined by    being a variable distributed by a half normal () distribution. This property allows us to define the conditional densities for each level of  as the product of two Gaussian densities: where  is the vector of the dominance effects without the - effect ()   is the - row of the  matrix and  is the vector of auxiliary variables with the following half normal () prior distribution: Consequently  the conditional distribution for each element of  was: and the conditional distributions for  was: Furthermore  the conditional distribution for  was the following scaled inverted Chi square distributions: Finally  the full conditional distribution for       and  were also the following scaled inverted Chi square distributions: with . The Gibbs sampler also allows to calculate posterior distributions of the any combination of parameters of the model. Thus  we calculated for each iteration of the Gibbs sampler the following approximations for the additive and dominance genetic variances [] as: where  is the number of individuals in the population and  and  the breeding and the dominance deviation values for the - individual. They were calculated as: where  as defined by Xiang et al. []   was the observed allelic frequency for the - SNP and Note that this parameterization implies a population under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and that the covariance between the breeding values and dominance deviations is equal to zero. Finally  we also calculated the expected inbreeding depression () for each percentage of inbreeding as [  ]: The computational costs of a Gibbs sampler implementation of the models with 75 000 iterations after a burn-in of the first 25 000 were approximately 100 and 80 CPU hours for populations 1 and 2  respectively. The analysis were performed with single thread process of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v2 @ 2.80 GHz processor. The deviance information criterion (DIC) was defined by Spiegelhalter et al. []. It compares the global quality of two or more models accounting for model complexity. For a particular model M  the DIC is defined as: where  is the posterior expectation of the deviance   and  is the deviance evaluated at the posterior mean estimate of the parameter vector . The computation of DIC is composed by two terms  i.e.   is a measure of model fit and  is related to the effective number of parameters. Models with smaller DIC exhibit a better global fit after accounting for model complexity. If we consider the data vector   where  is the - datum and  is the vector of data with - datum deleted  the conditional predictive distribution has a probability density equal to: where  is the vector of parameters (  and ) in the Full Model). Therefore   can be interpreted as the probability of each datum given the rest of the data  and it is known as the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO) for the - datum. The pseudo log-marginal probability of the data is then: A Monte Carlo approximation of the CPO suggested by Gelfand [] is   where   and  is the number of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) draws  and  is the - draw from the posterior distribution of the corresponding parameter. The higher the value of the LogCPO  best fit of the model to data.
