This study investigates variation in the genes      and  in Merino-like feral sheep populations from New Zealand and its offshore islands. These genes have previously been shown to influence wool  lamb survival and animal health. All the genes were polymorphic  but no new allele was identified in the feral populations. In some of these populations  allele frequencies differed from those observed in commercial Merino sheep and other breeds found in New Zealand. Heterozygosity levels were comparable to those observed in other studies on feral sheep. Our results suggest that some of the feral populations may have been either inbred or outbred over the duration of their apparent isolation. The variation described here allows us to draw some conclusions about the likely genetic origin of the populations and selective pressures that may have acted upon them  but they do not appear to be a source of new genetic material  at least for these four genes. It is thought that livestock genetic variation has decreased through breed substitution and crossing of local and global breeds []. Accordingly  interest in feral populations has increased because they are potential sources of genetic variation that may have been lost in commercial sheep flocks [  ]. It has been argued that reintroducing genetic variability could enhance production in commercial breeds []. New Zealand (NZ) has eleven feral sheep populations either on the mainland  or on offshore islands []. The mainland populations originated from farmed sheep []  while those on offshore islands either originated from farms  or were liberated as a food source for mariners []. These populations have been described previously [      –]. In this study  the level of genetic variation of four genes was determined in order to ascertain whether the isolation of these flocks had preserved greater genetic diversity compared to their commercial counterparts in NZ. These four genes are located on three different chromosomes i.e.  (chromosome 11; a keratin-associated protein gene that encodes a protein KAP1-1 commonly found in wool)   (chromosome 11; encoding wool keratin K33)   (chromosome 26; encoding the seven-transmembrane domain beta-3 adrenergic receptor ADRB3) and  (chromosome 20; encoding a class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein DQA2). Previous studies have reported that variations in the keratin and keratin-associated protein genes  including the ones above  influence many wool properties including fibre diameter []  staple strength []  mean staple length [] and the brightness of wool []. Accordingly  given the wide phenotypic variation seen in the wool of feral sheep [  ]  one might expect to see increased variation in these genes. Neonatal lamb mortality  particularly in Merino sheep  represents a large loss to the NZ sheep industry. Allelic variation in  has been associated with survival in various sheep breeds []  thus it might be expected that previously reported or new alleles would be found at a higher frequency in feral populations routinely exposed to harsh environmental conditions. It has been reported that feral sheep may have an increased resistance to a number of diseases. This resistance could imply that variation in key immune function genes such as the highly polymorphic MHC genes is important  as it plays a role in the immune response to pathogens and parasites [–]. Collectively the four genes chosen here cover a variety of different animal traits that could be associated with variation in the ability to survive in remote and potentially more severe environments  and where feed availability was probably reduced relative to farmed sheep. Ten feral flocks and two reference flocks (non-feral) were investigated in this study (Table ). Genomic DNA from these sheep was obtained from whole blood collected on FTA Classic Cards (Whatman BioScience  Middlesex  UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reference flock allele frequencies (see Tables  and ) were sourced from published data [  –] and from NZ commercial sheep DNA samples stored at Lincoln University. PCR amplifications and genotyping approaches were carried out using previously described methods [  –] Allele frequencies  number of alleles  observed heterozygosity ( )  expected heterozygosity ( with a Levene's correction) and coefficient of inbreeding () estimates based on the method of Weir and Cockerham [] were determined using GENEPOP version 4.0.7 []. This software was also used to determine deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the Exact Test with a Markov Chain Method [] (10 batches  5 000 iterations per batch and a dememorization number of 10 000). Corrections for multiple significance tests were performed using Fisher's method and by applying a sequential Bonferroni type correction [].  estimates were calculated across all the populations and genes (global ) and for individual populations and genes. Allelic richness  a measure of genetic diversity at a single locus  was determined using FSTAT version 2.9.3 [] and included rarefaction to correct for sample size variation []. Allele frequencies for each feral population were compared to those of Merino sheep sourced from NZ commercial farms [] and to the combined allele frequencies in breeds commonly found in NZ [  –]. This was undertaken to determine which groups were more closely related to each other based on \"distance\" measured by the Pearson <U+03C7>-statistic for each possible pair of breeds and their respective estimated gene frequencies. All genes investigated in this study were polymorphic and allele frequencies for each gene varied among the studied flocks (Table  and ). No new allele was identified for any of the genes in any of the sheep typed in this study. All the  alleles previously described were present in the feral sheep except allele  absent in four breeds  including one population from Arapawa Island (Hokonui sheep) and one from Pitt Island (Mohaka sheep)  and allele  absent in the populations from Herbert Forest and Chatham Island. Previous studies have reported five  alleles []  all of which occurred in the feral populations. Alleles  and  were found in all the populations whereas alleles  and  were absent in the sheep from Arapawa Island and the Mohaka populations  allele  was absent in those from Mohaka and alleles  and  in those from the Pitt Island and Hokonui  respectively. Six different  alleles were detected in the feral sheep. The lowest diversity was observed in the Mohaka population with only three alleles while it was greatest in the sheep from Pitt Island with six alleles. It is interesting to note that alleles  and   which occur at relatively low frequencies in other commercial breeds in NZ []  were absent in all the feral populations. The frequency of allele  is low in NZ commercial sheep and was only found at a low frequency in the sheep from Pitt Island and Hokonui. The distribution of  alleles varied considerably among populations with some alleles completely absent in some populations. The lowest diversity was observed in the sheep from Mohaka with only two  alleles. Conversely  thirteen  alleles were present in the sheep from Pitt Island. For all four genes  in most cases allele frequencies in the feral populations differed significantly (p = 0.025) from the frequencies in the reference flocks  most of the differences being highly significant (p < 0.001). The following exceptions were found: (1) frequencies of  alleles of sheep from Chatham Island (p = 0.113)  Woodstock (p = 0.434)  Herbert (p = 0.055) and Mohaka (p = 0.098) were not significantly different from those of the Merino reference flock  and those of sheep from Mohaka (p = 0.673)  Campbell Island (p = 0.084) and Hokonui I (p = 0.454) were not different from those of all breeds and (2) frequencies of  alleles of sheep from the Arapawa Island I did not differ from those of either reference flock (Merino p = 0.332; All breeds p = 0.771). Allelic richness  observed ( ) and expected ( ) levels of heterozygosity and coefficient of inbreeding () are shown in Table . On average between 2.03 and 4.86 alleles were detected per polymorphic gene across all the populations. The lowest number of alleles was observed for the  gene (1.59) in the sheep from Arapawa Island II while the greatest number of alleles was found for  (6.12) in the Hokonui II sheep. Allelic richness was highest for  and lowest for  in all feral populations except for the Mohaka sheep. Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from a low of 0.06 observed for  to a high of 1.0 for   and a low of 0.13 for  and a high of 0.86 for   respectively. Arapawa I sheep had the highest mean estimate for  and  over all of the genes (0.73 and 0.73  respectively)  while Mohaka sheep had the lowest mean estimate for  and  (0.43 and 0.38  respectively). Allele sharing was high between animals originating from Campbell Island and Pitt Island for  and among the Arapawa II flock of feral sheep for  and lower among the Arapawa I flock for . Finally  allele sharing among sheep from Woodstock was very low for . This is the first report describing DNA variation in feral sheep from NZ. The genes investigated in this study were chosen because they had previously been shown to influence wool traits []  cold survival [] and footrot resistance [  ]. No new allele was identified for any of the genes in the feral sheep  suggesting that they will not be a source of alternative genetic variability  at least for these genes. The allelic richness and heterozygosity results (observed and expected) are comparable with those presented in previous studies of non-NZ wild sheep populations [–]. Although the feral sheep sampled were chosen so that they were representative of their populations  there is no guarantee that the farmers who maintain these populations on the NZ mainland have been able to maintain genetic diversity  especially because the flocks sizes are small compared to the original populations. Allele sharing among four offshore island flocks (Arapawa I and II  Pitt Island and Campbell Island) was significant for one gene but not necessarily for the same gene. Sheep populations from both Pitt and Campbell Islands  have undergone extensive size reduction before being relocated to the mainland and it is surprising that the level of inbreeding is not higher. In contrast  among the mainland Woodstock sheep  many different alleles are detected for  suggesting this flock is outbred  although other loci would need to be typed to confirm this. This is most likely due to the ongoing introduction of new genetic material from other Merino sheep which are typically farmed in areas adjacent to this population. Sources of genetic variation in the feral sheep populations include founder effects  random drift  balancing selection  genetic bottlenecks  or combinations of these. Each will be discussed below. Genetic drift may have affected these feral populations []. However  in some feral populations allele frequencies were similar to those in commercially farmed Merino sheep. This may not be surprising since both the feral and commercial merino sheep share the same Australian origin  and the two groups have been separated at most by 50 generations. In some cases  allele frequencies in the feral populations were not \"Merino-like\" and tended to show greater similarity to allele frequencies in other common farmed sheep in NZ. This provides support for the anecdotal contention that these feral sheep have at times interbred with farmed non-Merino sheep. There is evidence of genetic differences between groups of sheep on remote yet neighbouring islands. Chatham and Pitt Island sheep are thought to be descendents of the same founding Merino sheep  yet they show quite different allele frequencies for many of the genes studied here. Pitt and Chatham Island feral sheep have distinct wool colours but whether this is a result of the differences in the genes studied cannot be ascertained here. Founder effects may influence the genetic diversity of feral populations []. It is apparent from early farming records that many of these flocks were initiated with 50 or less animals and hence the likelihood of finding rare alleles in the founding individuals might be small. Both  variants  and  are rare in farmed NZ sheep [] and they are absent from the feral populations studied here. An alternative explanation to the founder effect is that particular  alleles have been lost in the feral populations because they provide no selective advantage. This is called balancing selection and it reflects the situation where alleles are retained in a population by forms of selection such as heterozygote advantage  frequency-dependent selection [] or selection varying in space and time that favours some alleles in certain environments [].  alleles  and  are associated with cold survival  alleles  and  are linked to cold-related mortality  and allele  has a strong association with cold-related mortality and total mortality []. The complete absence of  allele  in the feral populations could be due to the fact that these flocks were exposed to cold climatic conditions during lambing and death of lambs carrying the allele. A number of studies have suggested that feral sheep show few signs of susceptibility to infection by ectoparasites [  ] and fly strike [] when compared to other domesticated sheep breeds. The reason why these animals may be more resistant to parasites remains unknown  but may involve genetic variation or reduced/non-exposure to the pathogens. Charbonnel and Pemberton [] have suggested that infection with  imposes a selection pressure in the Soay sheep of the island of Hirta in Scotland  and that this is reflected in the temporal divergence of the MHC genes over a relatively short period between 1988 and 2000. In the context of the results reported here  while the MHC allelic richness is at times low  in the absence of any data or evidence of on-going disease challenge it would be speculative to attempt to draw any conclusions. It should be noted that for   allele sharing was high within one island population but low within the mainland feral population  suggesting that the island population may have undergone some selection pressure. Allele sharing at  and  was typically low suggesting the flocks may be outbred. Allele richness was highest for  indicating that the level of genetic diversity has remained quite high in these feral sheep populations. Feral sheep populations have some unique wool characteristics including at times a hairy birth-coat type  which has been shown to offer some advantage in improving lamb survival [–]  the ability to shed their wool []  tightly curled wool [] and various coat colours and markings []. The genes responsible for these traits have yet to be identified  but may include some of the genes for keratins and KAPs that constitute wool fibre. Genetic bottlenecks can cause loss of genetic diversity []. Like founder effects  they are largely responsible for the loss of low-frequency alleles and tend to increase the abundance of intermediate- and high-frequency alleles []. It is generally admitted that sheep populations from Pitt and Campbell Islands originated from a small number of founding animals that multiplied subsequently. After reaching a size of approximately 4 000 sheep on both islands  genetic bottlenecks most likely occurred  when the majority of the sheep were slaughtered  and small numbers of sheep were transferred to NZ to create the flocks studied here. Thus these island populations may have been subject to both founder and bottleneck effects  but the data presented here does not show any strong evidence in favour of the historically documented bottlenecks and there are no obvious differences in allelic richness between the Pitt and Campbell island populations compared to the other feral sheep populations.

An alternative approach to overcome the limited power of individual studies is to combine data from two or more independent designs. In the present study we report a combined analysis of two independent design (a French and a Dutch F2 experimental designs)  with 2000 F2 individuals. The purpose was to further map QTL for growth and fatness on pig chromosomes 2  4 and 6. Using QTL-map software  uni- and multiple-QTL detection analyses were applied separately on the two pedigrees and then on the combination of the two pedigrees. Joint analyses of the combined pedigree provided (1) greater significance of shared QTL  (2) exclusion of false suggestive QTL and (3) greater mapping precision for shared QTL. Combining two Meishan x European breeds F2 pedigrees improved the mapping of QTL compared to analysing pedigrees separately. Our work was facilitated by the access to raw phenotypic data and DNA of animals from both pedigrees and the combination of the two designs with the addition of new markers allowed us to fine map QTL without phenotyping additional animals. Over the past fifteen years  the construction of genetic maps in livestock species has enhanced efforts to dissect the molecular basis of the genetic variation of agriculturally important traits. In pig  a number of experiments have been set up to identify QTL and many chromosomal regions harbouring genes influencing traits of interest have been identified [] and reported in QTLdb  []. However  in most cases mapping resolution remains limited and the QTL detected are rather inaccurately located. Mapping accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of phenotyped and genotyped individuals and/or the number of informative markers. However  collecting this additional information is often time-consuming and/or expensive. An alternative approach to overcome the limited power of individual studies is to combine data from two or more independent designs. Combining several pedigrees together increases the number of animals without additional phenotyping or genotyping costs. Without access to raw data  meta-analysis of published results can be an informative approach to increase precision. Allison and Heo [] have proposed meta-analytical techniques that can be used under difficult conditions. However  these analyses are complicated by the differences among testing methods and experimental designs and finally  the gain in accuracy of QTL mapping is limited. Availability of the raw data to analyse jointly independent data sets is probably a better way to combine different QTL mapping designs. In pig  some studies aiming at combining pedigrees in order to increase the power of QTL detection have already been carried out. Walling et al. [] have combined French  British  Dutch  American  Swedish and German studies to detect QTL on pig chromosome 4 or SSC4 (for  chromosome 4) and Perez-Enciso et al. [] have combined pedigrees from Spanish  French and German designs to refine the location of a QTL for growth and fatness traits on SSCX. However  these analyses are complicated by the lack of common markers and often by slight differences in trait definitions and measurements. In addition  parental populations are usually different  and the QTL segregating in the various designs are not necessarily the same. Under these conditions  combining data sets from different origins may not be optimal to improve estimations of QTL localisations and effects. Here we report an analysis of QTL located on SSC2  SSC4 and SSC6  that combines French and Dutch F2 pedigrees involving Meishan (MS)  Large White (LW) and Landrace (LR) breeds. The analysis was focused on these three pig chromosomes because previous detection analyses [–] have shown that the QTL identified on these chromosomes contribute less to the global variance of the traits than QTL detected for example on SSC7 or SSCX. To optimize this joint analysis and re-construct a unique genetic map from the 2000 F2 offspring of this combined design  additional microsatellite markers were included in either one or both pedigrees. Using single- and multiple-QTL mapping analyses on each pedigree and on the combined pedigree  we investigated the benefits of combining pedigrees (i.e. doubling the pedigree size) to refine the location of QTL for growth and fatness on SSC2  4 and 6. QTL mapping data from two experimental F2 crosses between European pig breeds x Meishan were used: (1) the French PORQTL pedigree produced at INRA []  by mating six Large White sires and six Meishan dams and then six F1 sires and 20 F1 dams to produce 1052 F2 animals; all pigs were born and raised at the INRA GEPA experimental unit (Poitou-Charentes) and (2) a Dutch pedigree  obtained at the University of Wageningen (WU) [  ] by mating 19 Meishan sires and 126 Large White or Landrace dams and then 39 F1 sires and 265 F1 dams to produce 1212 F2 offspring; this Dutch design was conducted in five different breeding companies. Among the 39 Dutch half-sib families  we selected the 24 largest families  amounting finally to 1919 French and Dutch F2 animals. Details on the phenotypic data have been reported respectively for the French pedigree in [] for growth and fatness traits  [] for teat number  [] for carcass composition traits and [] for IntraMuscular Fat (IMF) and for the Dutch pedigree in [–] for growth  fatness and meat quality traits [–] and in [] for teat number. Nine traits related to growth  fatness and teat numbers (Table ) were included in a joint analysis of the pedigrees. Seven of these nine traits i.e. birth weight  weaning weight  carcass weight  teat number  IMF  Back-Fat Thickness (BFT) between the 3rd and 4th ribs of a carcass at 6 cm from the spine and  (LD) depth were chosen because they had been recorded in both designs with the same conditions. The two remaining common traits i.e. Life Weight Gain (LWG) and meat percentage were already available for the Dutch pedigree and had to be computed for the French pedigree. Meat percentage was computed in the Dutch pedigree with the Hennessy Grading Probe formula taking BFT and muscle depth into account. For the French pedigree  we applied a similar formula as that used in France at the time of the experiment [] which is also based on back fat thickness and muscle depth (meat percentage = 55.698 - 0.710 × BFT + 0.198 × LD). LWG is an average daily gain estimated throughout the entire animals' life and is calculated as weight/age. Some additional economically important traits that had been recorded only in one of the two pedigrees but for which a significant QTL had been previously detected  were analysed only in the corresponding pedigree. These traits were related to additional fatness (X2  measured between the 3rd and the 4th lumbar vertebrae at 8 cm from the spine)  cut weights (shoulder  midriff  ham  loin  leaf fat  foot  belly  kidney and head) for the French pedigree and meat quality (pH in m.  and in m.  taken 24 h after slaughter  L*  a* and b* colour values of m.   driploss  cookloss and shear force) for the Dutch pedigree (Table ). These traits are not shared by both designs  but are economically important and thus were re-analysed in this study with additional microsatellite markers. In order to compare QTL detection results among the French  Dutch and combined pedigrees  a consensus linkage map based on genotyping data from the two Meishan x European breeds F2 populations was generated. The aim was to have a density of one marker every 10 cM within the previously described QTL regions and every 20 cM on the rest of the chromosomes. QTL regions extended from the telomere of the p arm to microsatellite SW240 on SSC2  between microsatellites S0301 and S0214 on SSC4 and along two regions on SSC6 (between SW2535 and SW1057 and between S0059 and SW607). Initially  French and Dutch pedigree were genotyped over these three chromosomes with 22 and 29 microsatellite markers respectively [  ]. Five microsatellite markers on SSC2  five on SSC4 and six on SSC6 were common to both designs. Additional informative microsatellite markers were included for one or both pedigree(s)  to obtain a unique set of common markers. Among the markers genotyped on both pedigrees on SSC6  microsatellite 261M17 was specifically designed from the BAC end-sequence bT261M17SP6 with primers 5'-CTCTTCCATTCCCTGATTGC-3' and 5'-CCCCTTCCTCACCTCTTTCT-3' to fill the gap between S0121 (122 cM) and SW322 (152 cM). On the common map  this new microsatellite is located 12.8 cM from S0121 and 17.4 cM from SW322. Finally  for SSC2 four additional microsatellites were analysed in the French pedigree and two in the Dutch population  for SSC4  two in the French pedigree and one in the Dutch population and for SSC6  four in the French pedigree and three in the Dutch population. New genotyping data were obtained at INRA as previously described []. All the genotypes were validated and stored in the Gemma database []. Only common markers were kept in the analysis  except for S0217 and SW2466 that were used only on the Dutch animals and SW1089 and SW607 only on the French animals. Microsatellites S0217 and SW1089 and microsatellites SW2466 and SW607 which mapped to the same position respectively on SSC4 and SSC6 were considered as unique markers in the combined analysis. Marker maps were ordered using CriMap package []  considering all the F2 animals of the two designs. The sex-averaged maps are presented in Figure . . Microsatellite markers in bold were added for the analysis of the French animals and markers in italics for the Dutch animals; *: on SSC4  microsatellite S0217 is genotyped only on Dutch animals and SW1089 on French animals; on SSC6  SW2466 is genotyped only on Dutch animals and SW607 on French animals Before QTL detection  phenotypes were corrected for the usual fixed effects using a linear model (GLM procedure  SAS 9.1  SAS Institute  Inc.). For traits previously analysed  published fixed effects and covariates were used and for the other traits  fixed effects and covariates that were significant at the 5% level in the variance analysis were kept in the final model. Corrected data showed similar variances for the traits common in both designs but recorded independently so that no standardisation was applied. QTL analysis using these corrected data was performed with the QTLMap software developed at INRA [  ] based on interval mapping without any hypothesis on the number of QTL alleles present in the Meishan and European breeds. The test statistic was computed as the ratio of likelihoods under the hypothesis of one (H1) vs. no (H0) QTL linked to the set of markers considered. Under hypothesis H1  a QTL effect for each sire and each dam (only dams with more than 10 offspring were taken into account) was fitted to the data. All sufficiently probable (above 0.10) dam phases were considered  so that the likelihood  could not be entirely linearised. For every cM along a linkage group  the likelihood  could be written as: where: <U+220F>is a product over full-sib families of sire  and dam i   is a summation over dam phases with a probability greater than 0.10    (|) = linkage phase probability for sire  given marker information    = linkage phase for dam  given marker information and sire linkage phase   = density function of the adjusted phenotype  of the offspring  of the  th dam and the  th sire  conditional on the chromosome segments transmitted by the sire () and the dam ().  is supposed to be normally distributed with a mean  and a variance estimated within each sire family  where  is the transmission probability from parents  and  to offspring   and  and  can be parameterised as  and  and  being the within-half-sib and within-full-sib average QTL substitution effects and being the family mean for parent . Average substitution effects  which in the present case are equivalent to additive values ()  were hence estimated within each sire family as  and within each dam family as   and averaged over families to estimate the average QTL effect in the population. To guarantee an accurate estimation of the sire QTL effects  only sire families with more than 30 progeny were retained in the analysis  thus 15 sire families were omitted from the Dutch pedigree. Due to number of progeny per dam  dam effects were estimated for all dams in the French pedigree  whereas none was estimated in the Dutch pedigree. The maximum LRT along the linkage group indicated the most likely position for a QTL. Significance thresholds were empirically computed using 1000 simulations under the null hypothesis  assuming an infinitesimal polygenic model (i.e. the trait is controlled by an infinite number of additive loci  each with infinitesimal effect and is thus not influenced by a major QTL) and a normal distribution of performance traits []. In practice  for progeny p  simulated phenotypes y were sampled as the sum of a polygenic part u and an environmental part e with normal distributions of mean = 0 and variances depending on the heritability of the trait  the total phenotypic variance being 1. The polygenic parts were sampled on the F1 sires and dams (u and u  respectively) and the transmission to the progeny was simulated as u = 0.5 u + 0.5 u  resulting in y = 0.5 u + 0.5 u + e for progeny p. Simulations were preferred to permutations because of the family structures []. With these structures  permutations have to be performed within full-sib families to respect data variability in the different families. In our case  data number within each family was not sufficient to achieve an extensive description of the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. QTL were considered significant if the chromosome-wide significance threshold exceeded 5% and suggestive if it exceeded 10%. Chromosome-wide significance thresholds were preferred to genome-wide significance thresholds since only three chromosomes were included in the analyses. Estimated significant thresholds (at the 5% chromosome-wide level) varied with traits and pedigree ranging between 45 and 50 for each independent pedigree and 80 and 85 for the combined pedigree. Confidence intervals around a QTL position were empirically determined by the \"2-LOD drop-off\" method []. For each chromosomal region  QTL detection analyses were applied separately on the French and Dutch pedigrees  and then on the combination of both pedigrees thereafter named \"combined pedigree\". Additional analyses were carried out with QTLMap to test the segregation of two linked QTL in a linkage group [] and revealed two situations: (1) when a significant QTL had been previously detected (H0 versus H1)  the null hypothesis was \"one QTL segregating at the maximum likelihood position estimated under H1\" and (2) when no QTL had been previously detected (H0 versus H1)  the null hypothesis was \"no QTL\". In both cases  the alternative hypothesis (H2) was \"two linked QTL segregating on the linkage group\". The LRT were computed following a grid-search strategy  using first 5 cM steps along the chromosome to identify significant regions in which then finer steps (1 cM) were applied. Significance thresholds were empirically estimated by a thousand simulations under the null hypothesis as described by Gilbert and Le Roy []. When H0 was \"no QTL\"  thresholds were the same as those computed previously for single QTL tests. When H0 was \"one QTL segregating at the maximum likelihood position x_max estimated under H1\"  simulations were done assuming that the trait was controlled by a QTL located at x_max and having the effect estimated for the maximum likelihood at position x_max in the single QTL analysis  all F1 being considered as heterozygous for the QTL. Estimated significant thresholds (at the 5% chromosome-wide level) varied with traits and pedigree  ranging between 85 and 90 for each independent pedigree and between 140 and 150 for the combined pedigree. Finally  QTL detection was also carried out on the adjusted data using a Line-Cross model (LC) with the online version of QTLExpress []. In this report  the method is only briefly described since results are not shown in detail. The LC model assumed that Meishan and European breeds were fixed for alternate QTL alleles. With the LC model  the adjusted phenotypes were fitted to a linear model including additive and dominant components [] and the chromosome-wide significance thresholds were determined by permutations of data as described by Churchill and Doerge []. For chromosomes SCC2  SSC4 and SSC6  the estimated marker orders of their linkage maps were consistent with those of the published USDA-MARC linkage maps  and their sex-averaged lengths were 149 cM  116 cM and 166 cM  respectively (Figure ). Table  shows the QTL detection results for each chromosome separately and for each independent pedigree and the combined pedigree. These results were obtained by using the half-full sib model with the QTLMap software. Additional analyses were done with the Line Cross model (which assumes that parental breeds are fixed for alternate QTL alleles) with the QTLExpress online Software []. The same QTL were detected with the HFS and LC models (data not shown)  except for the QTL underlying birth weight that was only described with the HFS model in the combined pedigree. Moreover  it is worth noting that with LC model  most QTL were significant at a 1% chromosome-wide threshold whereas with HFS model significant QTL were detected at different thresholds (Table ). Single-QTL detection analyses identified a chromosome-wide significant QTL affecting loin weight with the French design and a suggestive QTL affecting back fat thickness. These two QTL are located on the telomeric end of pig chromosome 2 (SCC2p) where the IGF2 gene is located and have already been described [  ]. With the Dutch design  three chromosome-wide significant QTL affecting meat percentage  BFT and a* colour value were detected around position 25 cM  the latter two QTL already described in []. An additional suggestive QTL affecting the weight at weaning was also detected in the same region with the Dutch design. Combining the French and Dutch pedigrees  only two QTL reached the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold: significant LRT values were obtained for a QTL influencing back fat thickness at position 1 cM and for a QTL affecting meat percentage at position 32 cM. Using multiple-QTL analyses no additional QTL was detected on SSC2. Additional analyses related to parent-of-origin effect were computed but are not reported in the present study. With the French design on SSC4  two significant QTL affecting birth weight and belly weight around position 55 cM  and one QTL affecting life weight gain around position 66 cM were detected  all three QTL already described in [  ]. Two additional suggestive QTL also previously described in [] were identified affecting intra-muscular fat content at position 0 cM and back fat thickness at 61 cM []. Two new suggestive QTL were detected  affecting X2 at 14 cM  and head weight at 42 cM. Using multiple-QTL detection analyses  a pair of QTL localised at positions 30 cM and 74 cM was detected for teat number. With the Dutch design  only one QTL  previously described in [] and affecting intra-muscular fat content at 0 cM reached the 10% chromosome-wide suggestive. When combining the French and Dutch pedigrees this QTL reached the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold (Figure ). A QTL affecting birth weight around position 55 cM  and a QTL affecting life weight gain at 83 cM  detected only with the French design  were also confirmed in the combined analysis. Using multiple-QTL tests  the hypothesis of two QTL affecting this trait was more likely than a single-QTL hypothesis: the test for loci at 59 and 90 cM reached the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold (Figure ). Additionally  a suggestive QTL influencing teat number was detected in the combined analysis at 46 cM using the single-QTL analysis. The two-QTL model retained in the analysis of the French pedigree for this trait was not significant with the combined analysis. . The solid line gives the result for the combined pedigree  the circled line for the French pedigree and the crossed line for the Dutch pedigree; for each analysis  the LRT is presented in proportion to the 5% threshold on the chromosome . The z axis gives the value of the LRT divided by the 5% threshold at the chromosome-wide level  the surface shown in gray corresponding to a ratio higher than 1 With the French design on SSC6  a significant QTL affecting midriff weight at 144 cM and two other suggestive QTL one influencing loin weight (99 cM) and one affecting teat number (110 cM) were detected. With the Dutch design  a significant QTL influencing L* parameter at 103 cM and two other suggestive QTL one affecting birth weight (136 cM) and one affecting teat number (154 cM) were identified. For this last trait  a two-QTL model was significant at the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold for two loci localized at 50 and 155 cM. When combining the French and Dutch pedigrees only one significant QTL affecting teat number at 104 cM was detected at the 5% chromosome-wide threshold. The aim of this study was to combine two F2 designs produced independently in France and in the Netherlands to detect QTL influencing economically important traits. These two designs were selected on the following criteria: (1) comparable founder breeds (Meishan and Large White and/or Landrace European breeds) and (2) the quasi-equal number of offspring produced in both protocols. Furthermore  although the European breeds were not identical  the Meishan sires used in the Dutch pedigree are related to the French Meishan dams. This supports the assumption that common Meishan QTL alleles segregated in both designs. European and Meishan breeds should have contrasted haplotypes (haplotypes being highly similar in both Meishan pedigrees) and QTL should segregate for the same loci. However  the two populations differ with respect to the number of families (six F1 sire families in the French design versus 39 F1 sires families in the Dutch design) and the reciprocal cross used to produce the F1 animals. To combine these designs the six French families and 24 of the 39 Dutch families  composed of more than 30 offspring  were retained. Our study focused on three pig chromosomes  SSC2  SSC4 and SSC6  for which QTL had already been detected. Despite the lack of overlap between some of the identified QTL from the pedigrees analysed separately  joint analyses of the combined pedigree should provide (1) greater significance of shared QTL  (2) exclusion of false suggestive QTL and (3) greater mapping precision for shared QTL. First  we investigated how the addition of new genotypes influenced the two designs. QTL detections were performed independently for each pedigree and for all the traits to be compared to the results previously published. We were then able to estimate the advantage between a combined analysis and independent analyses. In the analysis with the French design  the results were consistent with those previously reported although some differences were observed. In 2001  Bidanel et al. [] have reported a highly significant QTL underlying BFT on SSC4 between two markers located at positions 43 and 83 cM. Addition of microsatellite SW35 at 52.7 cM in the present study resulted in a loss of significance for this trait (10% chromosome-wide threshold). On the opposite  we detected in the same region a suggestive QTL affecting head weight which had not been previously identified in this pedigree []. This shows that the addition of a single highly informative marker in a region with a low marker density can change results to a great extent. Cepica et al. [] have reported a QTL affecting head weight in the same region on this chromosome. On SSC6  Milan et al. [] have described a suggestive QTL for belly weight between positions 2 and 32 cM In our analysis  this QTL was neither significant  nor suggestive. In this case also  a microsatellite  SW2535  was also added above SW2406  which allowed a better coverage of the telomeric part of the chromosome. Due to the addition of this marker  we can conclude that the previously suggested QTL is probably a false-positive. Finally  with the French pedigree  three new QTL on SSC6: two QTL  one affecting loin weight (99 cM) and one affecting teat number (110 cM)  and one significant QTL influencing midriff weight (144 cM). Previous studies had revealed QTL affecting loin weight on SSC6 at 83 cM in crosses involving Pietrain  Large-White and Leicoma animals []  and between 122 and 149 cM with a Duroc x Pietrain design []. With the Dutch pedigree alone  it was possible that our results differed from those previously reported because of (1) the addition of new markers (as for the French pedigree)  (2) the selection of 24 families among the 38 that were used by de Koning et al. [] and (3) the model used (mixture of full and half-sib families vs. line cross model). Initially  de Koning et al. have detected many QTL regions using a line-cross model and our results are closer to those obtained using a half-sib model [–]. Among the previously QTL detected  we did not confirm two suggestive QTL influencing the b* colour value [] and LWG on SSC6 []. These differences could be due to the addition of new markers showing that these QTL are false-positive ones. However  we cannot exclude that they were lost because of the reduction of the number of families. It is possible that these QTL were segregating in some of the 14 excluded families  which results in loss of power. However  with the addition of new markers in the Dutch pedigree  we detected a new QTL underlying the L* colour value on SSC6 at 103 cM. No QTL influencing this meat quality trait has been reported in this region. In a Landrace x Iberian design  Ovilo et al. [] have described one QTL at 40 cM on SSC6 influencing meat lightness in interaction with another locus on SSC18. We also detected a QTL underlying birth weight at 136 cM while Yue et al. [] had reported a QTL for the same trait in a cross between Meishan and Pietrain breeds at 98.2 cM. Our results illustrate the influence of marker density to exclude false-positive QTL and to detect new ones. In 2008  Hu and Xu [] have demonstrated using simulations that when the interval between two adjacent markers decreases  the power of QTL detection increases. Here we confirm this statement with real datasets. The size of a QTL design has a major influence on the power of QTL detection. A QTL can be detected thanks to the recombination events occurring during the gamete production in F1 animals. In an F2 protocol  the number of recombination events is limited. Therefore  to confirm or refine the position of QTL initially detected with an F2 protocol  the number of crossing-over events cannot be increased without additional animals. Producing additional animals is expensive and time-consuming. Thus  a joint analysis of independent pedigrees is an easy alternative to enhance the number of F2 animals in the design. One suggestive QTL affecting intramuscular fat content on SSC4 had been detected in both the French and Dutch pedigrees independently. By combining the two designs  this QTL reached a 5% chromosome-wide significant threshold. As shown on Figure   the two pedigrees contributed equally to the LRT. The proportion of segregating fathers per pedigree and/or the QTL effect were probably too small to detect this QTL in each pedigree independently but the combined pedigree resulted in more power and the QTL reached the significance threshold. For SSC2  independent analyses of each pedigree indicated that a single QTL influencing BFT and meat percentage was segregating on the telomeric end of the short arm of this chromosome but not at the same position. With the French pedigree  LRT value was maximal in the IGF2 region (0 cM) whereas with the Dutch design it was around 28 cM. Analysis of the combined pedigree confirmed that in fact two linked loci are segregating in this region  i.e. the IGF2 gene and a locus located around 30 cM (Figure ). QTL influencing meat percentage have been previously detected between 40 and 60 cM with crosses involving either Meishan  Pietrain and Wild Boar breeds []  or Large White and Meishan animals []. . The solid line gives the result for the combined pedigree  the circled line for the French pedigree and the crossed line for the Dutch pedigree; for each analysis  the LRT is presented in proportion to the 5% threshold on the chromosome Concerning the two-QTL detection analysis  our study provides evidence that combining two pedigrees and adding new markers increases the power of QTL detection. With a single-QTL analysis  we can conclude that there is a single QTL at 80 cM on SSC4 influencing life weight gain whereas in fact this maximum statistic is probably due to the combined actions of two QTL. The combination of two designs indicates that the presence of two different QTL located at 60 and 90 cM and common to both populations is more likely than the segregation of a unique QTL at 80 cM (Figure ). The benefit of combined analyses is essentially obtained when the QTL is segregating in both pedigrees. If QTL were segregating in only one of the two designs  detection power and estimated QTL effect could be reduced. We observed this situation for some QTL initially detected independently in one of both pedigrees. For example  a significant QTL affecting birth weight was detected only with the French design at 53 cM on SSC4 and was confirmed with the combined pedigree but it was not a major segregating QTL in the Dutch pedigree  the significance of this LRT was reduced in the combined analysis. Thus  this QTL is specific to the French pedigree. At the extreme  a QTL previously detected in one pedigree may be undetectable in the combined analysis. This situation was observed only for suggestive QTL such as that affecting birth weight on SSC6 detected in the Dutch pedigree only. Thus these QTL are also specific to the pedigree in which they were detected. The same situation has been reported by Walling et al. [] who have shown that among seven different pedigrees a QTL affecting birth weight detected on SSC4 segregated in the French pedigree only but after adding the six other pedigrees  although the QTL was still detected  its significance was lower and its effect was divided by two. QTL segregating in several independent designs will be largely influenced by the breeds used. On the one hand  by combining two pedigrees (involving only three breeds)  Kim et al. in 2005 [] have detected 10 new QTL undetected in either of the two pedigrees. In this case  the combination of pedigrees increased the number of interesting regions. On the other hand  Pérez-Enciso et al. [] in 2005 have demonstrated that by combining pedigrees  the possibility of detecting new QTL is sometimes reduced. This analysis was performed using five independent crosses involving six pig breeds (Iberian  Landrace  Large White  Meishan  Pietrain and Wild Boar). If a QTL allele is fixed in one breed involved in one cross only  the addition of other pedigrees that do not involve these breeds can reduce the effect of this QTL and therefore make it less detectable. This is also supported by the report of Guo et al. [] in 2008 who have shown that if a QTL is population-dependant it is highly probable that combining pedigrees will provide no benefit. To avoid this drawback of a joint analysis  Guo et al. have combined two Meishan x Large White pedigrees with F0 animals coming from the same populations. Combining pedigrees seems more advantageous if pedigrees involve similar breeds like in our combined study. In our case  the breeds involved in both pedigrees were genetically very similar  which led to the detection of common QTL (BFT on SSC2 or IMF on SSC4). In some cases  the QTL detected with the combined pedigree had only been described in one of the two designs like birth weight on SSC4. This result can be due to either a population specific QTL  or to differences in the proportion of families contributing to the statistic signal. An important advantage of a combined analysis is to estimate more precisely mapping intervals. This parameter may be largely influenced by the total number of markers used and the number of common markers analysed on the different designs. In our study  new data were generated by genotyping animals of both pedigrees with additional microsatellite markers to maximise the power and the precision. Previous studies that combined two or more pedigrees only analysed pre-existing datasets. The originality of our study is the large number of common markers  i.e. 29 common markers evenly spaced along the three chromosomes. In 2003  Bennewitz et al. [] have combined two bovine granddaughter designs and surprisingly  obtained larger confidence intervals than with single designs. Previously  using simulations they had estimated that an increase of population size led to a reduction of confidence intervals [  ]. Thus  they have proposed that the increase in confidence intervals is probably due to the fact that the families were genotyped with different sets of markers and only a few belonging to both sets. Using a dataset of highly common markers makes it possible to increase the confidence interval of a QTL. In our analysis  we avoided this drawback by analysing a unique set of microsatellite markers on both pedigrees and on the combined one. With a single set of markers  we obtained narrower confidence intervals than previously reported estimated intervals calculated with the same drop-off method [  ]. In the present study  confidence intervals varied from 3 to 30 cM  with an average size of 15 cM. In the initial analyses  the confidence intervals spanned on average 40 cM. Unfortunately  since in the first analyses reported by de Koning et al. [  ] no confidence intervals were calculated  we could not carry out a comparison. Combining two Meishan x European breeds F2 pedigrees improved the mapping of QTL compared to separate analyses of the pedigrees. We detected new QTL  confirmed some QTL which were previously described and excluded false positive QTL. Our work was facilitated by the access to raw phenotypic data and DNA of animals from both pedigrees. Analysis of a single set of markers proved more efficient to obtain smaller QTL intervals. The combination of two designs involving very similar breeds with the addition of new markers allowed us to fine-map QTL without phenotyping additional animals.

Traditional family-based aquaculture breeding programs  in which families are kept separately until individual tagging and most traits are measured on the sibs of the candidates  are costly and require a high level of reproductive control  e.g. through stripping of the parents []. Therefore  alternatives to the above traditional family-based breeding programs are often used in aquaculture breeding schemes. The most widely used alternative is a selection scheme  in which families are reared communally and the candidates are selected based on their own individual measurements of the traits under selection. However  in the latter selection schemes  inclusion of additional traits depends on the availability of non-invasive techniques to measure the traits  such as the Torry Fat meter [] to measure fat content  since family information is not available. This is a severe limitation of these schemes. In genomic selection schemes []  large numbers of (SNP) markers can be used instead of pedigree information and thus family-based selection schemes as in [  ] are not needed. However  in aquaculture breeding there are many thousands of selection candidates and test individuals  which make genotyping costs high even if the genotyping costs per individual are low. The aim of this paper is to develop a new selection scheme that combines communal rearing of families  pre-selection of candidates  DNA pooling and genomic selection and makes multi-trait selection possible in aquaculture selection schemes without keeping families separately until individual tagging is possible. We compare the effects of different designs on accuracy of selection  genetic gain and rates of inbreeding using computer simulations. A population with an effective population size () of 1000 was simulated for 4000 generations according to the Fisher-Wright population model [  ]. Five hundred males and 500 females were randomly selected and mated using sampling with replacement. From the last of these 4000 generations  generation zero () of the selection population of the breeding scheme was obtained. For generations -  the selection population was simulated as follows. One hundred sires and 100 dams ( = 100) were randomly split into groups with  families per group ( = 1  10 or 100  the latter resulting in all individuals being in one group). There was also one scheme with  = 50 and  = 10. Each sire was randomly mated to one dam and vice versa  using sampling without replacement. Each mating resulted in a family that was split into one group of (/) selection candidates and a second group of (/) test individuals ( = 20000 and  = 2000  20000 or 50000). Hence  family sizes were (+)/ offspring with equal numbers of males and females. Every selection candidate family was grouped with ( - 1) other randomly chosen families. Similarly  every family of test individuals was grouped with the test individuals from the same ( - 1) other families as were the selection candidates  i.e. the same families were grouped together as test individuals and selection candidates. Strictly  it will not be necessary to group the candidate families separately  as classical parentage testing can be done using the same markers used to estimate the effects of the traits. Two traits were considered: GROWTH  a trait measured on the  selection candidates; and SIB_TRAIT  a trait that is measured on  test individuals (sibs of the candidates)  which were sacrificed to record the SIB_TRAIT. The  selection candidates were mass-selected across all families for their GROWTH phenotype. A total of  candidates passed this preselection step  and (-) individuals were culled   being 1000 or 2000. The test individuals were recorded for the SIB_TRAIT. Within each group  the 50% highest SIB_TRAIT individuals were sorted into the H-pool and the 50% lowest into the L-pool. DNA of the H-pool was extracted  pooled and genotyped. Similarly the L-pool's DNA was extracted  pooled and genotyped  which resulted in estimates of the within-pool frequencies of the marker alleles. These frequency estimates were assumed to contain no errors here. Marker effects were estimated and used to estimate the genome-wide breeding values () for the SIB_TRAIT of the  selection candidates (see Calculation of phenotypic values and true and estimated genome-wide breeding values).  sires and  dams were selected across families and groups from these preselected selection candidates using truncation selection for the SIB_TRAIT . Creation of the genomes of the population was as described in []. Briefly  the genome structure of individuals was diploid with 10 chromosomes 100 cM long. The infinite sites mutation model [] was used to create new bi-allelic SNP  using a mutation rate of 10 per nucleotide and assuming the number of nucleotides per cM to be 1000000. Inheritance of the SNP followed Mendel's law and the Haldane mapping function [] was used to simulate recombinations. For each trait 50 SNP per chromosome were sampled randomly to be QTL (sampling without replacement from the SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05). From the remaining SNP  1000 with the highest MAF were chosen as genetic markers. This resulted in a total of 10000 markers spread over 1000 cM. Reduced numbers of markers were obtained by selecting every 10 and 20 marker  resulting in a number of markers   = 1000 and 500 markers  respectively. The reduced marker sets either reflected a situation where few markers are known or where genotyping costs are reduced by genotyping few markers. Effects of the QTL alleles were sampled from the gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.4 and a scale parameter of 1.66 []. There were no pleiotropic QTL effects  and no genetic or environmental correlation between the two traits. The QTL effects were assumed to be either positive or negative with a probability of 0.5  because the gamma distribution only gives positive values. After sampling  these QTL allelic effects were standardized so that the total genetic variance was 1 for each trait. The true genome-wide breeding value of an individual for  = GROWTH and  = SIB_TRAIT was calculated as: where is the number of copies that individual  has at the  QTL position and  QTL allele  and  is the effect of the  QTL allele at the  position. The phenotypic value of the individuals for trait  was simulated by adding an error term sampled from a normal distribution to the true breeding value (: where  () is an error term for animal   which was normally distributed N(0  ) and was adjusted so that the heritability was 0.4 for GROWTH and 0.1 or 0.4 for SIB_TRAIT. The statistical model used to estimate the marker effects on SIB_TRAIT was the BLUP of marker effects method []  using the mixed model equations: where  is a vector of the estimated SNP effects;  is a matrix of SNP genotypes  where element equals the standardised genotype of individual  for SNP   i.e. is -2 /v  (1-2)/v or 2(1-)/v for genotypes '11'  '12'  or '22'  respectively  where  is heterozygosity ( = 2(1-)) and is allele frequency at locus ;  is the variance ratio of the error variance to the SNP variance  which is the genetic variance divided by the number of SNP in the genome; is the phenotype of individual   which is 1 (0) if  belongs to H (L)-pool. Thus  at this stage the phenotype is assumed binary  either because it is truly binary or because a continuous variable is split into two classes. Each pool (H  L) contains 50% of the individuals. Since the test individuals are not individually genotyped  is unknown  but  is expected to equal the (co)variance matrix of SNP genotypes () times the number of individuals (). Here  the covariance matrix of the SNP genotypes will be estimated from the individually genotyped selection candidates instead of from the test individuals  i.e. element () of this matrix is calculated by Cov( )  where is the standardised genotype of the -th selection candidate. Also  cannot be calculated because the test individuals are not individually genotyped.  is expected to equal the covariance between genotypes () and phenotypes times . The following regression equation will be used to estimate the covariance between the genotypes and phenotypes: where is the average difference in allele frequency for SNP  between the individuals with ' = 1' and those with ' = 0'; is the regression of the SNP genotype on the phenotype; and  is the difference in phenotype  which is 1. Since the variance of  is 0.25 (50% of the 's are 1)  the above regression equation reduces to: and thus (;) is estimated by 0.25*  where is recorded by the pooled genotyping of the '= 1' individuals and the '= 0' individuals. In conclusion   is estimated by *Cov() and  is estimated by   which are needed for Equation [1]  and Cov() and  are estimated from the genotypes of the selection candidates and from the pooled genotypes  respectively. Estimated genome-wide breeding values for the selection candidates for SIB_TRAIT were obtained by summing the effects of the markers times the standardised genotypes times a regression coefficient to transform the GEBV from the binary data scale to the continuous data: where the regression coefficient (S  ;  )/(S  )  is the true breeding value of individual . The regression  was calculated here using the the from the simulation. In practice  another method needs to be devised to estimate   e.g. by regressing the phenotypes onto the EBV. This will reduce the selection accuracy  and this reduction depends on the available number of records to estimate the regression coefficient . The regression coefficient  also corrects for the fact that genomic selection EBV may be biased in the sense that their variance is too big relative to that of the TBV []. Equation [] implicitly incorporates the group means into the GEBV by using the estimates of the marker effects. In situations  where we have many continuously recorded phenotypes per group  the group means are expected to be more accurately estimated by the mean of the phenotypes of the individuals within the group. In this case  estimated genome-wide breeding values for the selection candidates for SIB_TRAIT were obtained by summing the effects of the markers within the group and adding a group-mean: where is the mean of the SIB_TRAIT-phenotypes of the individuals in group  to which individual  belongs;  is the mean of the S  of all individuals in group ; and  is as in Equation [2]. In Equations [2] and [3]  family means are implicitly estimated by the marker effects  as part of the total genetic effect. However  if  = 1  i.e. family means and group means coincide  the family means are estimated by the phenotypic averages of the group in Equation [3]. Selection of the candidates consisted of two steps: one pre-selection step  where selection was for GROWTH and one final selection step  where selection was for the SIB_TRAIT. The accuracy of selection was calculated as the correlation between true and estimated breeding values among the pre-selected candidates for SIB_TRAIT (). Inbreeding coefficients () were calculated based on pedigree  assuming that the  individuals were unrelated base parents. Selection schemes were run for generations (-) and summary statistics for each of the schemes are based on 100 replicated simulations. The breeding schemes were compared for the accuracy of selection of the SIB_TRAIT ()  rate of inbreeding per generation () and genetic gain of the SIB_TRAIT () and GROWTH ()  expressed in genetic standard deviation units of generation  ()) in generation . Overall  there was an increase in accuracy of selection of the SIB_TRAIT () with an increasing number of markers especially when  increased from 500 to 5000  but less so when it increased from 5000 to 10000 (Table ). The was lower with an increased number of families per group and the change in was larger from  = 1 to  = 10 than from  = 10 to  = 100.  = 1  the estimation of the family mean coincided with the estimation of the group mean such that the family mean was well estimated. With a higher number of families per group  only marker information was used to calculate family means (instead of phenotypic family means)  which reduced . This effect was larger with more families in the group. With a lower number of test individuals  i.e.  = 2000  was much lower than with larger numbers of test individuals. With the largest numbers of markers  i.e.  = 10000  was only 0.664  0.603 and 0.580  respectively  for  = 1  10 and 100. The difference in between  = 20000 and 50000 was small. With  = 50000 and  = 10000  was 0.877  0.850 and 0.845  respectively for  = 1  10 and 100  and thus depended little on  in this case  which indicates that family means were accurately estimated by the markers with such high numbers of test individuals. The latter scheme was the scheme with the overall highest . The genetic gain for the SIB_TRAIT () corresponded well to the patterns of changes in . The genetic gain for GROWTH () did not vary much between the schemes  except that was somewhat increased with  = 1 and low marker density. Overall  rates of inbreeding () did not differ much between the schemes except that there was a tendency for a higher  with  = 1 than with 10 or 100. With  = 10 or 100  markers are used to estimate family means  which may result in reduced estimates of between-family differences  and thus relatively more within-family selection. There was also a small tendency for higher <U+0394>F with  = 500 than  = 10000. With a lower heritability of the SIB_TRAIT  i.e. 0.1  accuracy of selection was reduced  as expected (Table ). However  was still rather high with a large . For example  with  = 10 and  = 20000 and 50000  was 0.557 and 0.701  respectively  for  = 500 only. The effect of heritability on was smallest for the scheme with  = 50000. Overall  genetic gain for the SIB-TRAIT () followed the pattern of changes of the accuracy of selection. The genetic gains for GROWTH () were generally higher than in Table   which is probably due to the lower selection pressure on the SIB_TRAIT when the heritability is reduced. The reduced selection pressure for the SIB_TRAIT results in smaller allele frequency changes of QTL affecting the SIB_TRAIT and of linked positions in the genome. The reduced frequency changes/genetic drift at linked positions implies that the selection pressure for GROWTH results in more response for GROWTH. Rates of inbreeding () were somewhat higher than with a higher heritability of the SIB-TRAIT  i.e. 0.4  but showed a similar pattern across the schemes. The <U+0394>F is not much affected by the heritability of the SIB_TRAIT  because selection for the SIB_TRAIT is not based on phenotypes but on marker genotypes. There was little difference in accuracy of selection with  = 1000 or 2000 (Table ). For  = 500  5000 or 10000  was 0.608  0.802 and 0.817  respectively  with  = 1000  and 0.635  0.792 and 0.803  respectively  with  = 2000. With  = 50 instead of 100  increased somewhat due to the larger full-sib family sizes  and was 0.694  0.825 and 0.837 for  = 500  5000 and 10000.  was as expected much more increased with  = 50 than with  = 100. For example  with  = 5000   increased from 0.010 to 0.020 when  decreased from 100 to 50 (Table ). Table  shows the results with the same parameters as in Table   but where group means of the selection candidates were estimated using genetic markers instead of phenotypic means. The latter may be necessary when common environmental group effects occur meaning that the phenotypic group means are not representative of the genetic mean of the group. In general  Table  shows an increasing trend for with increasing   especially from  = 500 to 5000. It also shows that the was much lower with  = 1 than with  = 10 and 100  because the family effect cannot be well estimated by the markers since the group and family means are confounded in case of  = 1. The  increased when  increased from 1 to 10  but not from 10 to 100  e.g. with  = 20000 and  = 5000   was 0.007 with  = 1 and 0.013 with  = 10. With  = 1  markers cannot estimate the family means  in which case selection is for within-family deviations as estimated by the markers  i.e. within-family selection  which is known to result in low rates of inbreeding. When comparing Tables  and   depends highly on . If  1  was considerably lower when the family means were estimated by markers rather than by phenotypic values only  e.g. 0.610 (Table ) compared to 0.838 (Table ) with  = 20000. If  = 10  was only somewhat lower when family means were estimated using markers and if  100  was equal for both methods. Hence  markers are increasingly more efficient in estimating family effects with increasing . Implementation of genomic selection in aquaculture breeding schemes is hampered by the large number of individuals that need to be genotyped []. Here  we present a method to apply DNA pooling in genomic selection  which dramatically reduces the genotyping costs of the test-population []. The DNA pooling further avoids pedigree recording  as is the case in traditional family-based designs  in the test-population  and the dense SNP genotyping also achieves this in the selection candidate groups. In addition  the low genotyping costs of the DNA pools make it very cost-effective to extend the test group to more traits that can only be measured on sibs of the candidates  i.e. towards highly multitrait breeding schemes. A methodology to estimate SNP effects from DNA pooling data was derived and yielded high selection accuracies  i.e. 0.60-0.85 with a large number of test individuals. This was especially the case if  = 20000 or more for the aquaculture breeding schemes used here  even when multiple families were grouped and genotyping of pooled samples was done. The accuracy of selection decreased with an increasing number of families per group. If  was only 2000  selection accuracy was substantially reduced  showing the importance of having large numbers of phenotypic records to accurately estimate marker effects. The methodology presented here for DNA pooling in genomic selection will be beneficial to most species  where genomic selection is applied. In most species  the cost of genotyping large numbers of test individuals hampers seriously implementation of genomic selection. Genomic selection is currently mostly used in dairy cattle  where the use of accurately progeny tested bulls reduces the size of the test population. Still  Van Raden et al. [] have had to genotype 3600 test bulls to obtain a high selection accuracy. Furthermore  the use of genomic selection instead of progeny testing for the selection of bulls implies that there will be no progeny tested bulls available in future dairy cattle schemes. Thus  in the future  the test population will consist of very large numbers of phenotypically recorded cows and the presented DNA pooling strategies can greatly reduce the genotyping costs even in dairy cattle by pooling DNA samples from cows with high and low phenotypic values  instead of individually genotyping the large numbers of cows. Selection accuracy of these schemes can be compared to a family-based genomic selection breeding program. For example  Nielsen et al. [] have reported selection accuracies of about 0.8 for a breeding program with 2000 test individuals  a trait with a 0.4 heritability and 100 families. Their scheme can be compared to the results of Table   which shows that  = 2000 has a selection accuracy of about 0.60-0.65. Hence  the schemes with  = 2000 have a selection accuracy 0.20-0.25 lower with genotyping of pooled samples than with genotyping of all individuals. However  was approximately the same as for the larger  = 20000 or 50000 here with of 0.60-0.85 and 0.60-0.90  respectively. Genetic gain for GROWTH was increased in Table  when  = 1 and marker density was low. In this situation  the estimation of the marker effects resembles that of a TDT (Transmission Disequilibrium Test) for quantitative traits  where the effect of the marker is also estimated within families but is expected to be the same across all families  i.e. the markers are picking-up LD but are corrected for family effects (spurious associations). If the marker density is low  the markers will show only low LD with the QTL  and since they are also not picking up family effects  marker effects will be small. The latter results in a relatively low efficiency of the marker-assisted selection part of the selection for SIB_TRAIT and thus in relatively small allele frequency changes of positions linked to the largest SIB_TRAIT QTL. The latter implies that the selection for GROWTH is not hindered by such frequency changes and thus may explain why the selection for GROWTH is relatively efficient when  = 1 and marker density is low. We also investigated the effect of different correlations between GROWTH and SIB_TRAIT. Here we assumed that every QTL had correlated multi-normally distributed effects for GROWTH and SIB_TRAIT with a correlation of 0.3  0.0 and -0.3 (since we lacked a Multitrait-Laplacian distribution sampler). With group means estimated as the mean of the phenotypes of the individuals within the group and  = 10  was reduced by 18% and by 24% when the correlation was -0.3 instead of 0.0. With a correlation of 0.3  increased by 20% and by 24%. The breeding scheme suggested here relies heavily on the success of genotyping pooled samples. Our method assumed accurately estimated allele frequencies in both the L- and H-pools  but estimation errors on the pool mean frequencies have been reported  e.g. variance of the estimation error  i.e. the so-called technical error was estimated by Craig et al. [] to be 6.8 × 10. Macgregor et al. [] have reported that these errors depends on several parameters  such as density of the SNP chip  pooling strategy and array dependent parameters such as number of beadscores per SNP. Baranski et al. [] have found a correlation between individual and pooled genotypes of 0.98 for a scheme with 60 families  one animal/family/pool  and three replicates per pool. Each pool consisted of susceptible and resistant groups for infectious salmon anemia of Atlantic salmon  where 15 individuals per family had been individually tested for the disease. The improved results with large numbers of test fish per pool suggest that the accurate estimation of allele frequencies in the high and low pool are crucial to estimate the marker effects. In case the DNA pooling technique does not achieve such a high accuracy  the DNA pooling can be replicated in order to achieve the required accuracy  i.e. the error variance of the average of the allele frequencies estimates over all 'low' ('high') replicated pools is (1-)/ + /  where  is the true allele frequency   is the total number of individuals in all 'low' ('high') pools   is the number of replicated DNA poolings  and is the technical error due to the pooling technique  which we assumed to equal 0. The / term can be reduced by increasing the number of replicates. Our numbers of individuals of 2 000/2  20 000/2 and 50 000/2 could be interpreted as an effective numbers of individuals    where Given this equation for   combinations of     and  can be found that result in error variances similar to those presented in this paper. Selection accuracy for quantitative traits may be further improved by removing individuals around the population mean from the DNA pools  which will increase the differences in allele frequencies. However  the number of individuals within each of the DNA pools will be reduced  which increases the variability of the allele frequency estimates. The former will improve selection accuracy whilst the latter will reduce it. Thus  further research is needed to investigate the optimal phenotypic selection differential between the two DNA pools. The genotyping costs of the test individuals have been much reduced by the grouping strategy. However  we still require genotyping of the selection candidates. Due to the preselection step for GROWTH  the number of candidates to be genotyped was reduced from 20000 to 1000 or 2000 in this scheme  which hardly affected the . Hence  there will still be a considerable number of individuals to be genotyped. The costs of this genotyping could be reduced by applying a low-density SNP chip to these candidates  as suggested by Habier et al. []. The grouping strategy may help to correct for the skewed contribution of parents that often occurs in mass spawning populations  see e.g. []. The number of families that should be reared per group to reduce the skewedness of parental contributions needs to be optimised per population. Phenotyping 20000 animals for the sib trait might be very costly but that will depend on the trait. For instance  if the trait was resistance to a disease challenge  the phenotyping might simply consist in sorting the dead and alive fish. This new selection scheme combines communal rearing of families  pre-selection of candidates  DNA pooling and genomic selection and makes multi-trait selection possible in aquaculture selection schemes without keeping families separately until individual tagging is possible. The new scheme can also be used for other farmed species  for which the cost of genotyping test individuals may be high  e.g. if trait heritability is low.

Using these populations  numerous QTL for many traits have been mapped []. However  the mapping resolution of these studies is usually limited by the size of the population. One way to increase the number of individuals is to conduct a joint analysis of several experimental designs. In dairy cattle breeding  a joint analysis of two half-sib designs with some overlapping families has been performed by Bennewitz et al. [] and has shown that a combined analysis increases statistical power substantially  due to the enlarged design and especially due to increased half-sib family size. In pig breeding  a joint analysis has been successfully implemented by Walling et al. [] in which seven independent F-crosses have been analysed in a combined approach for one chromosome. The mapping procedure developed by Haley et al. [] was used where some breeds are initially grouped together in order to fulfil the assumption of the line cross approach (i.e. two founder lines are fixed for alternative QTL alleles). Further examples can be found in Kim et al. [] and Pérez-Enciso et al. []  both using pig crosses  or in Li et al. [] using laboratory mouse populations. Analysing several F-crosses jointly could be especially useful when the founder breeds used for the crosses are the same in all the designs. This situation can occur in plant breeding  where crosses are produced from a diallel design of multiple inbred lines (e.g. Jansen et al. []). Although rare in livestock breeding  one example is the experiment described by Geldermann []. For this kind of experiment Liu and Zeng [] have proposed a flexible multiallelic mixture model  which estimates an additive QTL effect for each founder line and a dominant QTL effect for each founder line combination. They have estimated their model by adopting maximum likelihood using an EM algorithm. The aim of the present study was to conduct a joint genome scan covering the autosomes for three porcine F-crosses derived from three founder breeds. For this purpose  the method of Liu and Zeng [] was modified in order to include imprinting effects. The effect of a combined analysis was demonstrated by comparing the results for three traits with those obtained when the three crosses were analysed separately. The experimental design is described in detail by Geldermann et al. [] and only briefly reminded here. The first cross (MxP) was obtained by mating one Meishan (M) boar with eight Pietrain (P) sows. The second cross (WxP) was generated by mating one European wild boar (W) with nine P sows  some of which were the same as in the MxP cross. The third cross (WxM) was obtained by mating the same W boar with four Meishan (M) sows. The number of F-individuals in the MxP  WxP and WxM crosses was 22  28 and 23  respectively and the the number of F-individuals was 316  315 and 335  respectively. The number of sires in the F-generation was between two and three. The joint design was built by combining all three designs. All individuals were kept on one farm; housing and feeding conditions have been described by Müller et al. []. All F-individuals were phenotyped for 46 traits including growth  fattening  fat deposition  muscling  meat quality  stress resistance and body conformation  see [] for further details. In this study  we investigated three traits i.e. back fat depth  measured between the 13 and 14 ribs  daily gain and carcass weight. The phenotypes were pre-corrected for the effect of sex  litter  season and different age at slaughtering before QTL analysis. The means and standard deviations of the observations are given in Table . There is substantial variation within and between crosses for all three traits. Altogether 242 genetic markers (mostly microsatellites) were genotyped  covering all the autosomes  with a large number of overlapping markers in the crosses. Both sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis because they deserve special attention (Pérez-Enciso et al. []). A common linkage map was estimated using Crimap []. Due to the large number of overlapping markers these calculations were straightforward. It was assumed that two founder breeds (breed  and   with  and  being breed M  P  or W) of a single cross are divergent homozygous at a QTL  i.e. showing only genotype  and   respectively. Although the three breeds in this study are outbred breeds  this assumption holds approximately  because the breeds have a very different history and are genetically divergent (see also Haley et al. []). Subsequently  for each F-individual of a certain cross four genotype probabilities      and  were calculated for each chromosomal position. The upper subscript denotes the parental origin of the alleles (i.e. paternal () or maternal () derived) and the lower subscript denotes the breed origin of the alleles (i.e. breed  or ). These probabilities were estimated using a modified version of Bigmap []. This program follows the approach of Haley et al. [] and uses information of multiple linked markers  which may or may not be fixed for alternative alleles in the breeds. The information content for additive and imprinting QTL effects were estimated for each chromosomal position  using an entropy-based information measure as described by Mantey et al. []. The information content for the additive QTL effect represents the probability that two alternative QTL homozygous genotypes can be distinguished  given the individuals are homozygous. Similarly  the imprinting information content denotes the probability that two alternative heterozygous QTL genotypes can be separated  given that the individuals are heterozygous. The information content was solely used to assess the amount of information available to detect QTL and was not used for the QTL mapping procedure. On the whole  the genetic model followed the multiallelic model of Liu and Zeng []  but was extended to account for imprinting. It is assumed that the breeds are inbred at the QTL. The genetic mean was defined as the mean of the  = 3 founder breeds. Considering one locus  the mean is with  being the homozygote genotypic value in breed  ( = M  P  and W  respectively). Now let us consider haploid populations. The mean of the breeds consisting of paternal derived and maternal derived alleles at the locus is respectively. The term  () denotes the genotypic value of the paternal (maternal) derived allele. The additive effect of the paternal derived and maternal derived allele is  and   respectively. This imposes the restrictions In this haploid model  putative imprinting effects will result in different haploid means. However  in a diallelic model the two haploid means are not observable  but become part of the mean as  = + . Thus the genetic model of the diploid F-population generated from the breeds  and  is as follows: where again the upper subscripts denote the parental origin and the lower subscripts denote the breed origin of the alleles. Putative imprinting effects will result in . This genetic model was used to set up the statistical model. We used the notation of Liu and Zeng [] for comparison purposes. where  is the phenotypic observation of the  th individual in the F-cross derived from breed  and . The term  denotes the fixed effect of the F-cross. It was included in the model (and not in the model for the pre-correction of the data for other systematic effects as described above)  because it contains a part of the genetic model (i.e. the mean). The term  is a random residual with heterogeneous variance  i.e. . Vector  contains the additive effects () and vector  contains the dominance effects (    ...  ). The four  terms are row vectors of length 2* with one element equal to one and the other elements equal to zero. Each  term indicates one of the four possible additive effects in  that could be observed in the F-individual based on pedigree data. For example   denotes the putative allele in offspring  (indicated by first lower subscript ) inherited paternally (indicated by upper subscript ) from line  (indicated by second lower subscript ). The four  terms are scalars and are either zero or one. They indicate if the offspring inherited the corresponding allele from the corresponding parent. For each offspring these four terms sum up to two. Similarly   is a row vector of length   indicating which dominance effect could be possible in the offspring based on pedigree data. The scalar  is one if the offspring is heterozygous at the QTL and zero otherwise. The true  terms were unknown and therefore calculated from the four estimated QTL-genotype probabilities at each chromosomal position. For example  the term  was set equal to . The dominance term () was the sum of the two heterozygous genotype probabilities. The statistical model was a multiple linear regression. The residual variance was assumed to be heterogeneous. In order to avoid an over-parameterisation due to the restrictions shown in (1)  the genetic model (2) was re-parameterised taking the restrictions in (1) into account  as shown in Appendix. The final regression was also re-parameterised taking these restrictions into account. Hence  in fact only 2*-2 = 4 additive effects were estimated (i.e. ). The estimated paternal additive effects of the breeds were    and   respectively  where the lower subscripts M  P and W denote the three breeds. The same holds true for the maternal additive effects. The combined mendelian additive QTL effects for the three breeds were calculated as     and . The model was fitted every cM on the autosomes by adapting the  terms accordingly. The test statistic was an -test; the -values were converted into LOD-scores as  ˜ (*)/(2*log(10)) with  being the number of estimated QTL effects []  i.e.  = 7 (four additive and three dominance effects). When imprinting is not accounted for  the models (2) and (3) reduce to the proposed model of Liu and Zeng []. In this case   - 1 = 2 additive effects are estimated. In this study  this was also solved by using multiple linear regressions with heterogeneous residual variances. The highest test-statistic was recorded within a chromosome-segment (for the definition of a chromosome-segment see the next section). The global null hypothesis was that at the chromosomal position with the highest test statistic  every estimated parameter in  and  is equal to zero. The corresponding alternative hypothesis was that at least one parameter was different from zero. The 5% threshold of the test statistic corrected for multiple testing within the chromosome-segment was obtained using the quick method of Piepho []. Once the global null hypothesis was rejected  the following sub-hypotheses were tested at significant chromosomal positions by building linear contrasts. Test for an additive QTL: The test statistic was an -test with two degrees of freedom in the numerator. Test for dominance at the QTL: The test statistic was an -test with three degrees of freedom in the numerator. Test for imprinting at the QTL: The test statistic was an -test with two degrees of freedom in the numerator. The mode of imprinting (either paternal or maternal imprinting) at the QTL with significant imprinting effects was assessed by comparing the paternal and maternal effect estimates. The test of the three sub-hypotheses resulted in the three error probabilities     and  for additive  dominance and imprinting QTL  respectively. Note that if the global null hypothesis was rejected  at least one of the three sub-null-hypotheses had to be rejected as well. Therefore  correction for multiple testing was done only for the global null hypothesis  and for the sub-null-hypothesis  the comparison-wise error probabilities were reported. Finally  the number of QTL alleles that could be distinguished based on their additive effects was assessed. This was done by testing the segregation of the QTL in each of the three crosses  considering only additive mendelian effects (i.e. ignoring imprinting and dominance). The corresponding test was: Once again an -test was used and was applied for each of the three crosses. If the QTL segregated between two (three) crosses the number of QTL alleles was two (three). Note that it was not possible that a QTL segregated solely in one cross. For each significant QTL  a confidence interval was calculated using the one LOD-drop method mentioned in Lynch and Walsh []. The lower and upper bounds were then obtained by going from the lower and upper endpoints of the one LOD-drop region to the next left and next right marker  respectively. This procedure worked against the anti-conservativeness of the one LOD-drop off method. The anti-conservativeness was shown by Visscher et al. []. The procedure to include multiple QTL in the model is recursive and proceeds as follows. Initially  the genome was scanned and the 5% chromosomes-wise thresholds were estimated. Next the QTL with the highest test statistic exceeding the threshold was included as a cofactor in the model and the genome was scanned again  but excluding the positions within the confidence interval of this QTL. This was repeated until no additional significant QTL could be identified. In each round of cofactor selection  the question of whether the test statistic of previously identified QTL remained above their significance threshold levels was assessed; a QTL was excluded from the model if no longer significant. This can happen if some linked or even unlinked QTL co-segregate by chance (e.g. de Koning et al. []) and the strategy used here accounts for this co-segregation. The thresholds were calculated for chromosomes without having a QTL as a cofactor in the model considering the whole chromosome (i.e. 5% chromosome-wise thresholds). If  however  a QTL on a chromosome was already included as a cofactor  the thresholds were estimated for the chromosome segment spanned by a chromosomal endpoint and the next bound of the QTL confidence interval (i.e. 5% chromosome-segment-wise). In case more than one QTL was included as a cofactor on a chromosome  a chromosome-segment between two QTL was spanned by the two neighbouring bounds of the confidence intervals and the threshold was calculated for this chromosome segment. By defining chromosome-segments in this way  multiple QTL on one chromosome were considered. The significance thresholds were determined for the regions on the chromosomes that were scanned for QTL. In the study of Geldermann et al. []  the crosses were analysed separately  but without modelling imprinting. Therefore  in order to show the benefit of the joint analysis  the crosses were analysed again separately  but accounting for imprinting. The following standard model was applied: where  is the mean of the F-offpring of the cross      and . The terms     and  are the regression coefficients  representing the additive  dominance  and imprinting effects  respectively. The test statistic was an -test; LOD scores were obtained as described above  but using  = 3. Chromosome-segment-wise 5% threshold values were obtained again using the quick method explained earlier. Multiple QTL were considered as described above. The marker order of the estimated linkage map (see Additional file ) is in good agreement with other maps. The average information content for additive and imprinting effects was high (about 0.868 and 0.752  respectively  averaged over all individuals and chromosomal positions). This indicated that informative markers were dense enough to detect imprinting effects (which requires a higher marker density []). The results of the joint design (obtained with model (3)) for the traits back fat depth  daily gain and carcass weight are shown in Tables     and   respectively  and of the separate analysis of the three crosses (obtained with model (4)) are shown in Table . For each reported QTL in the joint design (i.e. showing an error probability smaller than 5% chromosome-segment-wise) the estimated QTL position  the confidence interval  and the comparison-wise error probabilities of the sub-hypothesis are given. A sub-hypothesis was declared as significant if the comparison-wise error probability was below 5%. QTL effects are often heavily overestimated due to significance testing (e.g. Göring et al. []). Therefore  we did not report these estimates  except for QTL showing imprinting (Table ). Instead we reported the order of the breed QTL effects in Tables     and . Thirteen QTL were found for back fat depth (see Table ) of which 11 showed a significant additive effect  five significant dominant effects and three a significant imprinting effect. The QTL on SSC12 and SSC13 were only significant because of their dominance effects. For three QTL  three alleles could be identified based on their combined additive effect. In all three cases the effect of the P breed allele was highest  followed by the effect of the M breed allele. For other QTL  the effect of the M breed allele was higher compared to that of the P and W breeds  whereby P and W were often the same when only two QTL alleles could be separated. Naturally  for those QTL without a significant additive effect no order of breed allele effects could be observed. For daily gain  15 QTL were mapped of which 11 showed a significant additive  six a significant dominant and four a significant imprinting effect (Table ). The QTL on SSC5 was only significant because of its imprinting effect and the QTL on SSC9  SSC10 and SSC16 were significant because of their dominance. For five QTL  three breed alleles could be identified and the order was always P over M over W. For the QTL with only two alleles  the alleles of breeds P and W or of P and M breeds were the same  but not for M and W breeds. For carcass weight  16 QTL were mapped of which 13 showed a significant additive  seven a significant dominant and five a significant imprinting effect. For nine QTL  three different breed alleles could be identified and the order was always P over M over W. Imprinting seemed to be important for these traits. When imprinting was not accounted for in the joint design  only eight  nine and nine QTL were mapped for respectively back fat depth  daily gain and carcass weight (not shown). Notably  all QTL found with the model without imprinting were also found when imprinting was considered (not shown). Imprinting was not always found in all breeds. For examples see Table   where estimated additive QTL effects are shown for traits with a significant imprinting effect. For example  the paternal allele effect of the P breed at the QTL for carcass weight on SSC7 was higher compared to the maternal allele effect  which pointed to maternal imprinting. This  however  was not observed in the M breed at this QTL (Table ). The QTL on SSC3 for daily gain showed opposite modes of imprinting in the M and P breeds. Also no clear mode of imprinting could be observed for the imprinted QTL on SSC2. For the remaining QTL with imprinting effects the mode of imprinting was consistent (Table ). When comparing the results of the joint design with those from the separate analysis of the crosses (Table ) it can be observed that the number of significant QTL is much lower in the separate analysis  even if all QTL across the three crosses are considered as separate QTL. Additionally  in the joint design it was sometimes possible to map several QTL for one trait on one chromosome. For example  on SSC1 three QTL were detected for back fat depth in the joint design  whereas only one was detected within the single crosses. A comparison of the plots of the corresponding test statistics is given in Figure . The plot of the joint design is much sharper and more pronounced  leading to the separation of the three QTL. This can also be found on SSC2 for the same trait (Figure ). On the one hand  in this case two QTL were found in the joint design  but one QTL in the designs MxP and WxM (Tables       and ). On the other hand  almost all QTL detected in the single designs were also found in the joint design. This can be seen when comparing the overlap of the confidence intervals of the QTL (Tables       and ). . The solid black line denotes the results from the joint analysis; the dashed gray (small dotted  black dashed) line denotes the results of the MxP (WxP  WxM) analysis; the genetic map is given in the additional files. When selecting QTL as cofactors  every QTL remained above its significance threshold level  and thus stayed in the model. For most QTL  the test statistic increased when additional QTL were selected as cofactors. Because numerous QTL were mapped in the joint design  we will not discuss all identified QTL in detail. For a comparison of QTL found in this study and found by other groups see entries in the database pigQTLdb (Hu et al. []). Some QTL have also been reported by various other groups (e.g. QTL for carcass weight on SSC4). Other QTL are novel (e.g. QTL for back fat on SSC11 and SSC18). The signs of the breed effects are often  but not always  consistent with the history of the breed. For example  the Meishan breed is known to be a fatty breed  and it would subsequently be expected that most of the M breed allele effects at the QTL for back fat depth are higher compared to the P and W breed alleles. However  this was not always observed (Table ). For daily gain and carcass weight traits  the breed allele effects of breed P are generally the highest (Tables  and )  which fits to the breeding history of P. The P breed is frequently used as a sire line for meat production and daily gain and carcass weight are part of the breeding goal. Naturally  wild pigs have not been subject to artificial selection for the three traits; their breed allele effects were almost always lowest for the three traits (Tables     and ). Because the P breed was selected for increase in daily gain and carcass length and M is a much heavier and fattier breed than W  this was expected for daily gain and carcass length. Additionally  because P was selected against back fat during the last decades and W is a lean breed  the breed effects of M and P are frequently the same and lower than the fatty M breed allele effect (Table ). Three QTL with imprinting effects were found on SSC7 of which two were paternally imprinted. The mode of imprinting was not clear for imprinted carcass weight QTL (Table )  because nearly the same paternal and maternal additive effects were observed in the M breed. De Koning et al. [] have mapped a maternal expressed QTL for muscle depth on the same chromosome. A well known gene causing an imprinting effect is   which is located in the proximal region of SSC2 (Nezer et al. []  van Laere et al. []). De Koning et al. [] have mapped an imprinted QTL for back fat thickness with paternal expression close to the  region. In our study  we found an imprinted QTL in the corresponding chromosomal region for this trait as well (Tables  and )  but it was not possible to unravel the mode of imprinting. A critical question is: are the detected imprinting effects really due to imprinting? As mentioned by Sandor and Georges [] the number of imprinted genes in mammals has been estimated to be only around 100  which is not in a good agreement with the number of mapped imprinting QTL. The assumption underlying the classical model (4) for the detection of imprinting is that the F-individuals are all heterozygous at the QTL. It has been shown by de Koning et al. [] that in cases where this assumption is violated  the gene frequencies in the F-sires and F-dams may vary randomly  which might result in a significant  but erroneous  imprinting effect. This is especially a problem  when the number of males in the F-generation is low  as in this study. The assumptions of model (4) and the pitfalls regarding imprinting effects do also hold in model (3). The additive effects were estimated depending on their parental origin  and if the F-sires are not heterozygous at the QTL the estimates of the additive effects might differ depending on their parental origin  resulting in a significant imprinting effect. Hence  some cautions have to be made when drawing specific conclusions regarding the imprinting effects  especially for the imprinted QTL with an inconsistent mode of imprinting (Table ). In some cases  imprinting effects might be spurious and due to within-founder breed segregation of QTL. Besides  the importance of imprinting for these traits has also been reported on a polygenic level within purebred pigs by Neugebauer et al. []. In addition  the same mode of imprinting in different founder alleles (Table ) can be seen as evidence for real imprinting effects for these QTL. When QTL experiments are analysed jointly  several requirements have to be fulfilled. Ideally  identical or to a large extent identical markers have to be genotyped in the designs and the allele coding has to be standardised. Subsequently  a common genetic map has to be established. Trait definition and measurement have to be standardised and  ideally  housing and rearing conditions of the animals should be the same or similar. All these points were fulfilled in the present study  since to a large extent the same markers were used  all animals were housed and slaughtered at one central unit and phenotypes were recorded by the same technical staff. Furthermore  due to the connectedness of the three designs  the situation for a combined analysis is especially favourable and allowed the use of model (3). Compared to a separate analysis  fewer parameters are estimated (i.e. seven instead of nine). Additionally the number of meioses used simultaneously was roughly three times higher. This led to the high statistical power of the joint design  which is confirmed by the large number of mapped QTL and by the reduced width of the confidence intervals. The high experimental power is probably due to the fact that not only the same founder breeds were used  but also to some extent the same founder animals within breeds. Hence the same founder alleles could be observed in the individuals of two F-crosses  which increased the number of observations to estimate the effects. This is especially the case for the WxM and WxP crosses  which both go back to one and same W boar. Model (3) was adapted from Liu and Zeng [] but was extended for imprinting effects. Modelling imprinting seemed to be important for these traits. Ignoring imprinting resulted in a reduced number of mapped QTL for all three traits. Besides  all purely mendelian QTL (i.e. non-significant imprinting) were also found when imprinting was modelled. Hence  estimating two additional parameters in order to model imprinting obviously did not reduce the power to map purely mendelian QTL  favouring the model with imprinting. Thereby it was important to account for heterogeneous residual variances. A substantial heterogeneity was expected given the variation of the phenotypes within and across the three crosses (Table ) and could be due to the different number of QTL segregating in the three crosses. Following this  it could be assumed that the heterogeneity would be reduced if more QTL were added as cofactors in the model. In Figure   the plots of the residual variances are shown for the three crosses and different number of QTL included in the model. It can be seen that the residual variances decreased and the differences became smaller  but did not disappear. One reason for this could be that there are still many more QTL segregating  which were not detected because their effects are too small. Indeed  Bennewitz and Meuwissen [] have used QTL results from a separate analysis of the same three crosses to derive the distribution of QTL effects. They have shown that the additive QTL effects are exponentially distributed with many QTL of small effects. Model (3) was also flexible with regard to the number of QTL alleles  which was important given the large number of QTL with three different breed allele effects (Tables     and ). . Solid line (dotted line  dashed line) denotes the MxP cross (WxP cross  WxM cross). Figure  also shows the benefit of including multiple QTL as cofactors in the model. The residual variances reduced continuously  which led to the increased statistical power and subsequently contributed to mapping the large number of QTL. The inclusion of QTL as cofactors is also known as composite interval mapping (CIM) and goes back to Zeng [  ] and Jansen and Stam []. There are basically two main reasons for applying CIM. The first is to decrease residual variance and increase statistical power  as also used in this study. The second is to unravel a chromosomal position harbouring a QTL more precisely  i.e. to separate multiple closely linked QTL. This also requires scanning the chromosomal region of QTL identified in previous rounds of cofactor selection (in our study also rescanning confidence intervals of identified QTL)  which  however  requires dense markers in those regions. Because marker density was not very high in this study  no attempts were made to detect multiple QTL within a QTL confidence interval. Low marker density should also be kept in mind when interpreting multiple QTL on single chromosomes  because the amount of information to separate them is limited. The high statistical power is also due to the defined relative low significance level (i.e. 5% chromosome-wise). Hence  correction for multiple testing was done only for chromosomes or chromosome-segments and not for the whole genome or even for the whole experiment considering all three traits. The low significance level was chosen because a large number of QTL with small effects are segregating in this design []  and many QTL with small effects would not have been found using a more stringent significance level. The downside of this strategy is  of course  that some mapped QTL will be false positives. The applied methods were computationally fast  mainly because of the applied regression approach  but also because the quick method was used [] for the significance threshold determination rather than applying the permutation test. Piepho [] has shown that this method is a good approximation if the data are normally distributed  which was the case in this study (not shown). Alternatively  a permutation test could have been used  which would result in more accurate threshold values and  as proposed by Rowe et al. [  ]  also for a more sophisticated identification of dominance and imprinting effects. This should be considered in putative follow-up studies. The present study showed the strength of analysing three connected F-crosses jointly to map numerous QTL. The high statistical power of the experiment was due to the reduced number of estimated parameters and to the large number of individuals. The applied model was flexible with regard to the number of QTL and QTL alleles  mode of QTL inheritance  and was computationally fast. It will be applied to other traits and needs to be expanded to account for epistasis. As stated in the main text  the restriction shown in eq (1) resulted in a re-parameterisation of the genetic model presented in eq (2). The re-parameterised model is as follows. The upper subscripts denote or the parental origin (i.e. either paternal () or maternal ()) and the lower subscripts denote the breed origin M  P  and W. This model contained only four additive effects (two paternal and two maternal). Using the above notation     and . The same holds for the maternal alleles. The applied regression model (eq (3) in the main text) estimated the four additive effects for the breeds M and P. The two effects for W not modelled were reconstructed  as shown above.

We distinguished 17 epistatic QTL pairs for carcass composition and 39 for meat quality traits. These interacting QTL pairs explained up to 8% of the phenotypic variance. Our findings demonstrate the significance of epistasis in pigs. We have revealed evidence for epistatic relationships between different chromosomal regions  confirmed known QTL loci and connected regions reported in other studies. Considering interactions between loci allowed us to identify several novel QTL and trait-specific relationships of loci within and across chromosomes. Until now  most QTL studies have considered additive and dominance effects and sometimes imprinting effects  but epistatic interactions between two or more loci are commonly ignored. The significance of interactions between different loci in explaining the genetic variability of traits has long been controversial. Epistatic effects can be clearly defined and verified when a combination of two mutations yields an unexpected phenotype that cannot be explained by the independent effect of each mutation []. For example  Steiner et al. [] have demonstrated the effect of gene interactions for a binary expressed trait (coat color)  which is influenced by two or three loci. However  the evaluation of epistasis for complex traits is much more demanding because these traits are influenced by environmental effects and large numbers of polymorphic loci []. For complex traits  it is useful to analyze the variation in a resource population established for QTL studies  by applying epistatic QTL models. Most published studies on epistatic effects of interacting QTL have focused on plants and laboratory animals rather than livestock species  which is a paradox since it seems obvious that the variance of a complex trait in livestock animals cannot be explained by additive genetic effects alone []. In plants  investigations into epistatic effects concern mainly rice hybrids for traits such as grain yield  plant height and heating date [  ]  but epistatic effects have also been identified in maize  oat and []. Most epistatic QTL studies related to mammals analyze data from laboratory animals. Brockmann et al. [] have shown that in a mouse intercross used to select for body weight and fat accumulation  epistatic effects contributed 33% and 36% of the total phenotypic variation  respectively  whereas epistatic effects contributed only 21% of the variation. Kim et al. [] have investigated non-insulin-dependent diabetes in two backcross populations of mice i.e. B6 and CAST crosses. They have detected five interacting QTL in the B6 cross but none in the CAST cross. Shimomura et al. [] have detected ten epistatic QTL connected to circadian behavior in mice. Sugiyama et al. [] have found six single QTL associated with blood pressure in rats but 36% of this trait's phenotypic variance could be explained by a single two-dimensional epistatic factor. Koller et al. [] have examined the mineral density of bones in a reciprocal cross in rats and found epistatic effects between known and novel QTL and between pairs of completely unknown QTL. In livestock species  epistatic effects have been detected in chicken and swine. In chickens  Carlborg et al. [  ] have identified epistatic effects on growth traits  which accounted for up to 80% of the genetic variation. In swine  ten QTL pairs for eight muscle fiber traits in an intercross between Iberian and Landrace breeds [] and interacting genomic regions for carcass composition traits and intramuscular fat content in F crosses between Pietrain and three other commercial lines[] have been reported. Additional studies have revealed epistatic relationships influencing meat color  fatty acid composition and reproductive traits such as teat number or litter size [–]. In this work  we have evaluated the importance of epistatic effects in pig breeding by identifying epistatic QTL effects for carcass composition and meat quality in an F cross composed of commercial pig lines. In this study  we used 585 F pigs from 31 full-sib families that were the product of a reciprocal cross of the Duroc and Pietrain (DuPi) breeds. The F generation was the product of crosses between Duroc boars and Pietrain sows and between Pietrain boars and Duroc sows. All animals were kept at the Frankenforst experimental research farm of the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University in Bonn. The phenotypes of all the F animals were recorded in a commercial abattoir  according to the rules of German performance stations []. In total  13 traits related to carcass composition and 13 traits related to meat quality were analyzed. Table  contains an overview and definitions of all the carcass composition and meat quality traits that were analyzed. Intramuscular fat content (IMF) was determined by the Soxhlet extraction method with petroleum ether []. More detailed information about the carcass composition and meat quality traits can be found in Liu et al. []. One hundred and twenty five microsatellites and six SNP markers were used to genotype animals of the parental (P)  F and F generations. Genetic markers were equally spaced on the 18 pig autosomes and covered 89% of these. In comparison to Liu et al. []  who analyzed the data with a single QTL model  18 genetic markers (microsatellites and SNP) were added to the data set. The CRI-MAP 2.4 software was used with the options \"build\"  \"twopoint\" and \"fixed\" to recalculate the sex-average linkage map []. Additional information regarding the markers  i.e. genetic position (in Kosambi cM)  number of identified alleles and polymorphism information content are given in Additional file  (see Additional file ). To identify significant environmental effects  the data were analyzed by linear models including a relevant fixed effects model (model 0) as in Liu et al. []. All the models contained a polygenic effect (u)  which is distributed as N(0  As)  where A reflects the numerator relationship matrix and e the residual effect: For carcass composition and intramuscular fat content (IMF)  the season/year of birth and the sex were included in the model as fixed effects (F) and carcass weight and age at slaughter as covariates (ßcov). For traits like pH  conductivity and meat color  factors including sex  slaughter season  carcass weight and age at slaughter were used. Family  sex  carcass weight and age at slaughter were included in the analyses of drip loss  thawing loss  cooking loss and shear force. Liu et al. [] had analyzed the data set by the Haley-Knott regression []  which was extended in this study for the pH decline and IMF traits. Interactions between two QTL were detected by the series of model comparisons suggested by Estelle et al. []. The statistical analysis can be subdivided into the following two steps  which were performed using the statistical package Qxpak 4.0 []. Additive and dominance effects of individual QTL were excluded from the first step of the analysis. To characterize distinguishable genome regions  all chromosomes were separated into 5 cM intervals because of computational limitations. Model 1 includes all the possible genetic interactions between pairs of chromosomal segments (I  I  I and I) but does not include the main genetic effects themselves. The regression coefficients c  c  c and c were calculated according to Cockerham's suggestions for epistatic interaction []: The definitions of these interaction terms follow the rules of Varona et al. []. P and P refer to the probability of a QTL at locations 1 and 2  P(QQ) the probability of the grandparental line (Duroc) being homozygous  P(qq) the probability of the other grandparental line (Pietrain) being homozygous and P(Qq) the probability of being heterozygous. These equations imply unlinked interacting loci []. The IBD probabilities were computed by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with 10000 iterations []. Model 1 was tested against model 0 with likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to assess the significance of the effects of interacting QTL. Nominal P-values were calculated assuming chi-squared distribution of the LRT with four degrees of freedom. Interacting QTL pairs with a nominal P-value < 0.001 were selected to be further analyzed in step 2. However  the results of this model comparison cannot be directly used for the detection of epistasis because the two regions might interact solely in an additive way. The exclusion of the main genetic effects and the definition of widely-spaced 5 cM pseudo-loci are justified by the long computing time necessary for this unsaturated genetic model. In addition to interactions between regions on different chromosomes  intrachromosomal interactions were investigated. To avoid large  overlapping confidence intervals  interacting QTL positions were selected when the genome regions involved were larger than 30 cM. If the two regions are closer than 30 cM  there is a high risk that an interaction might be observed  which can be explained in reality by a single QTL. Purely epistatic effects were quantified by model 2  which covers all possible genetic main effects and interaction effects. A 1-cM scan was performed within 40 intervals of preselected genome regions identified in step 1. The regression coefficients for the main effects of the two individual QTL were defined as: Factor \"a\" in model 2 is defined as the individual additive effect and \"c\" is the regression coefficient for the differences in probabilities of being homozygous for alleles of the Duroc grandparental line (QQ) and for alleles of the Pietrain line (qq). A positive additive genetic value would indicate that alleles originating from the Duroc line show a greater effect than alleles from the other parental line and vice versa. The dominance effect \"d\" is described as a deviation of heterozygous animals from the mean of both types of homozygous individuals. In the case of a positive dominance value  an increase in the trait of interest is the result of a heterozygous genotype. Finally  the statistical contrast between models 2 and 3 for evidence of epistasis was carried out using an LRT with four degrees of freedom in the numerator. As discussed in Mercade et al. []  permutation techniques cannot be applied here because an infinitesimal genetic value is included. A randomization of the data would destroy the family structure. Nevertheless  it is necessary to prove the reliability of epistatic QTL pairs. For this purpose  a Bonferroni correction assuming statistical independence every 40 cM was used as in Noguera et al. []. The genome-wide critical values of LRT for the significance levels associated with type I errors where a = 0.05  0.01 or 0.001 were 18.00  20.45 and 26.21  respectively. To verify the importance of each epistatic interaction effect involved (a × a  a × d  d × a and d × d; a for additive and d for dominance)  the simple heuristic method of Estelle et al. [] was used. This method judges an epistatic effect as relevant (significant) if the effect size exceeds two residual SD of model 0. The proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the genetic components was calculated by the differences between the residual variances of the compared models. The number of significant QTL pairs identified in step 1 varied from three to 34 for different traits. In general  low numbers were detected for traits that are known to have high measurement errors due to environmental effects (drip loss  cooking loss and thawing loss) or to the error-prone measurement technique (side fat). In this step  all QTL identified as significant in the single-QTL analysis [] were also found to be significant in combination with other QTL in the bi-dimensional analysis of step 1. The significant QTL regions identified in step 1 are interesting candidates for epistasis  but the results of this scan cannot be used as final proof for such effects because the main and interactive genetic effects are not separated. For a final validation of epistatic effects  a fully saturated model including genetic main effects and interaction effects is needed  which leads directly to step 2. In the final step  the epistatic relationship between two QTL was estimated using model 2. Table  gives detailed information on all the significant epistatic QTL pairs according to position  the LR-statistics and the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the particular pairs of loci. In general  the number of true epistatic QTL pairs was less than the number of preselected pairs of QTL regions. Fifty-six epistatic QTL pairs were identified across the 18 autosomes for 19 different traits. Intrachromosomal epistatic QTL were located on porcine chromosomes SSC5 ( chromosome 5)  8 and 17 for IMF  fat area and loin eye area  respectively. Overall  19 a × a  11 a × d  13 d × a and 29 d × d significant interactions were observed. For 16 epistatic QTL pairs  it was not possible to detect any more relevant effects (see additional file ). Although the general epistatic interaction term was significant for 16 QTL pairs  the effect size of the involved single epistatic effects did not exceed two residual SD (model 2). The proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the particular interaction term ranged from 2.5% to 8.5%. The proportion of epistatic variance relative to the entire QTL variance exceeded 50% in most cases (Table ). Seventeen epistatic QTL pairs were detected for seven carcass composition traits. These were located on all autosomes except 1  4  11 and 14. The epistatic loci were classified into two highly significant (P < 0.001)  nine significant (P < 0.01) and six suggestive (P < 0.05) QTL relationships (Table ). Chromosomal loci of interest were located on SSC2  SSC4  SSC7  SSC8 and SSC10  where multiple epistatic QTL pairs were detected (Figure ). Regions located on SSC8 (58 to 62 cM) and SSC10 (70 to 80 cM) showed a significant epistatic interaction for the fat:muscle ratio  the loin eye area and ECLC. The relationship between these two QTL loci explained 3% to 4% of the phenotypic variance of these traits. . Lines represent the epistatic relationship among two loci; different type of lines displays different traits Furthermore  high d × d interaction effects were observed for ECLC for one QTL on SSC2 (125 to 135 cM)  which interacted with one locus on SSC4 (96 to 98 cM) and another locus on SSC7 (1 cM). Additionally  epistatic QTL pairs were detected for the same loci on SSC2 (135 cM) and SSC4 (96 to 98 cM) related to the loin eye area and also along SSC2 (125 cM) and SSC7 (1 cM) for the fat:muscle ratio. In general  these interacting genomic areas showed the highest d × d interactions in comparison to other single epistatic effects  except the loci on SSC2 and SSC7  where the d × a interaction was the most prevalent. Two to 6% of the phenotypic variance was explained by the relationships between SSC2 and SSC4 and between SSC2 and SSC7 for these carcass composition traits. No epistatic effects were identified for carcass length  shoulder BFT  mean BFT  side fat and estimated lean belly content. A total of 14 suggestive (P < 0.05)  18 significant (P < 0.01) and seven highly significant (P < 0.001) QTL were identified for all meat quality traits except drip loss (Table ). With regard to the number of epistatic QTL pairs  the cooking loss trait involved eight interacting QTL pairs and the pH decline six  which were the highest numbers of epistatic loci for all meat quality traits. Close relationships were found between SSC8 (1 to 6 cM) and SSC15 (71 to 77 cM) and between SSC12 (45 to 48 cM) and SSC16 (1 cM) for pH 1 h loin and pH decline (Figure ). For these epistatic effects  a × a and d × d interactions exceeded two SD and were generally more prevalent than a × d or d × a (see Additional file ). The highest explained proportion of the phenotypic variance was 6.85% for an epistatic QTL pair located on SSC4 (14 cM) and SSC11 (16 cM) related to pH 24 h in loin. The proportion of the phenotypic variance of meat quality traits explained by epistasis ranged from 2.27% to 4.51%. For the measurements of conductivity in loin and ham  four epistatic relationships between seven QTL loci were observed. Within the group of meat quality traits examined  16 epistatic relationships among loci were identified (Table ). For cooking loss  a locus on SSC7 (40 to 50 cM) showed a × d  d × a and d × d interactions with regions on SSC13 (13 cM)  SSC16 (108 cM) and SSC17 (60 cM). Additionally  a relationship was identified between the epistatic QTL on SSC16 (102 cM) and one locus on SSC4 (43 cM)  but none of the epistatic effects exceeded two SD. The identified loci on SSC4 and SSC7 in combination had no significant effect on cooking loss. In addition  the epistatic locus on SSC16 (102 to 106 cM) did not only affect cooking loss. Influences on shear force were also detectable within an interaction between SSC2 (145 cM) and SSC16 (102 cM). The highest explained proportion of the phenotypic variance was 8.2% for IMF between SSC1 (263 cM) and SSC6 (101 cM) and 8.5% for an intrachromosomal epistatic QTL pair on SSC5. Most QTL studies in pigs involve additive and dominance effects but epistasis is often ignored. To our knowledge  seven studies using epistatic models in pigs have been published [–  ]. In general  the use of epistatic models makes it possible to identify QTL  which interact with other QTL not only in an additive way but also via a × a  a × d  d × a and d × d interactions. In comparison to single- or double-QTL analyses  the main benefit of including epistatic QTL effects is the detection of novel QTL that affect a quantitative trait through epistatic interactions with another locus []. The identification of a considerable number of novel QTL in our study underlines this advantage. However  analyzing epistatic effects between two loci is computationally demanding because all pairwise combinations must be investigated [  ]. In addition  the use of microsatellite information renders the distinction between two loci on the same or different chromosomes approximate. In this study  56 epistatic QTL pairs involving 104 interacting QTL positions were identified across all the autosomes for porcine carcass composition and meat quality traits. As shown in Tables  and Additional file  (see Additional file )  12 of these epistatic QTL positions were detected both in the single-QTL analysis of Liu et al. [  ] and as novel epistatic QTL in our study. Six regions were related to carcass composition and six to meat quality traits. It can be assumed that these epistatic QTL play an important role in the expression of these phenotypes. In regard to carcass composition (ECLC and fat muscle ratio)  one epistatic QTL position located on SSC2 (125 to 135 cM) interacts with two other QTL regions on SSC4 (98 cM) and SSC7 (1 cM)  respectively. This SSC2 locus was previously reported by Liu et al. [] as a single QTL and by Lee et al. []  who analyzed a Meishan × Pietrain cross. The same position was also detected for the loin eye area trait by Estelle et al. []. The epistatic relationships between SSC2 (125 to 135 cM) and regions on SSC4 (98 cM) and SSC7 (1 cM) explain 2.9% of the phenotypic variance for ECLC. The corresponding entire QTL variances (sum of epistatic and individual QTL variances) at these positions are 4.5% and 5% respectively  for the interactions between SSC2 (135 cM) and SSC4 (98 cM) and SSC2 (125 cM) and SSC7 (1 cM). It can be assumed that the 2% difference between epistatic and entire QTL variances is due to the individual QTL effect of the locus on SSC2  which was reported by Liu et al. []. It follows from this that the effects of the individual QTL loci on SSC4 and SSC7 are presumably small and difficult to detect in a single-QTL analysis.  () and  () located on SSC2 between 125 and 135 cM are potential candidate genes for ECLC [  ]. The locus on SSC4 (98 cM) is related to backfat and loin eye area traits [–]and carries the candidate gene  () []. In conclusion  all three genes play roles in skeletal  muscle and tissue development. The locus on SSC2 (125 cM) is also influenced by a region on SSC7 (1 cM) where Ponsuksili et al. [] have identified a QTL for several backfat traits in a Duroc × Berlin Miniature pig F cross. Additionally  we observed an interacting QTL pair between SSC8 (58 to 62 cM) and SSC10 (70 to 80 cM) that influences the loin eye area  ECLC and fat:muscle ratio traits. The involvement of the SSC8 locus had already been detected by a single-QTL analysis of these three traits []. For the fat:muscle ratio  the proportion of phenotypic variance was completely explained by epistatic effects. There was a 2% difference between epistatic variance and the sum of epistatic and individual QTL variances for the ECLC and loin eye area traits. Considering the single QTL variances presented by Liu et al. []  we conclude that the SSC8 locus (58 to 62 cM) has important single QTL and epistatic QTL effects  whereas the SSC10 locus (70 to 80 cM) has only epistatic effects. This assumption is partially contradicted by Thomsen et al. []  who has reported a single QTL at the same position on SSC10 that only affects the loin eye area trait. In regard to the fat area trait  a region on the p arm of SSC6 (73 cM) interacts with SSC13 (11 cM)  and a region on the q arm of SSC6 (113 cM) interacts with SSC12 (32 cM). The locus on the p arm of SSC6 has been previously detected by Liu et al. [] and the locus on the q arm by Mohrmann et al. [] in a resource family of Pietrain and crossbred dams (created from Large White  Landrace and Leicoma breeds).  ()  which is involved in neonatal growth and development []  is a candidate gene for the region on the SSC6 q arm. A significant epistatic relationship was detected between SSC16 (80 cM) and SSC18 (21 cM) for BFT-13/14 rib. As shown by the QTL variance ratios in Table   this effect between both positions is mainly epistatic. However  Liu et al. [] had identified the QTL region on SSC16 not for BFT-13/14 rib but for other backfat traits in the DuPi population. The locus on SSC18 was detected in the DuPi population by Edwards et al. [] and in a cross of Berkshire and Yorkshire breeds []. Both studies included imprinting effects in the single-QTL models. Although Liu et al. [] had applied a similar imprinting model  they did not identify an effect on SSC18 for backfat traits. In this study  BFT thickness is influenced by an epistatic QTL pair on SSC7 (138 cM) and SSC13 (61 cM). The QTL position on SSC7 has not been identified as a single QTL in our population but it has already been reported in two studies [  ]. Ponsuksili et al. [] have shown that the region surrounding the locus on SSC7 is involved in the hepatic metabolic pathway. Five epistatic QTL pairs involving ten loci were identified for pH 24 h in ham. Three QTL  located on SSC1 (108 cM)  SSC2 (179 cM) and SSC15 (61 cM)  have been previously detected by Liu et al. [] in a single-QTL analysis and the QTL on SSC1 (108 cM) was shown to interact with a region on SSC5 (126 cM). Twelve percent of the phenotypic variance has been explained by this QTL pair  with 4% going back to the epistatic term and 8% to the single QTL on SSC1 reported by Liu et al. []. In addition to the work of Liu et al. []  we analyzed the IMF and pH decline traits with a single-QTL model. No single QTL was found for IMF  whereas SSC15 (69 cM)  which is comparable to the position detected for pH 24 h mentioned above  and SSC1 (119 cM) were identified for pH decline. Furthermore  all these regions have been shown to carry several candidate genes involved in muscle development  composition and metabolism []  e.g.   () and  (ATP5A1) related to the region on SSC1; and  () and  () related to SSC5 [  ]. A position on SSC2 (145 to 166 cM) related to shear force is significant for individual and epistatic QTL effects [] and has been identified in a Berkshire × Duroc intercross []. This region interacts with loci on SSC7  SSC13 and SSC16. The SSC7 and SSC13 loci have been described as single QTL in other studies [    ]. A particularly large number of candidate genes has been identified for the epistatic relationship between SSC2 (166 cM) and SSC7 (87 cM). The SSC2 locus contains genes such as  () and  () [  ]  whereas SSC7 carries the  () and  () genes []. The biological functions of these genes are primarily related to muscle composition. Until now  we have only discussed epistatic QTL pairs with at least one locus previously detected as a single QTL in the DuPi population analyzed by Liu et al. []. We have identified many other epistatic loci that do not have a corresponding result in the single-QTL analysis. Of the 104 QTL positions involved in the 56 epistatic QTL  12 have been reported by Liu et al. [] and are detected by our single-QTL analysis  30 have been reported in the literature and 62 are presumably novel positions. In general  the effects of these QTL pairs can be explained by purely epistatic effects  in which the single QTL of each involved position is of minor importance. The significance of the epistatic effects can be inferred from the difference between the epistastic variance and the sum of epistatic and individual QTL variances  which is frequently close to zero (Table ). Similar results have been reported by Duthie et al. []  who also detect novel QTL based on an epistatic QTL analysis. Although many QTL have been reported in the literature (Table )  we did not detect any single QTL for the IMF trait. Of particular relevance to this trait are the two epistatic QTL studies of Ovilio et al. [] and Duthie et al. []  which have revealed two epistatic QTL pairs related to loci on SSC1 and SSC4 and on SSC6 and SSC9. Here we identified four epistatic QTL loci on SSC1 (263 cM)  SSC5 (87 cM) and SSC6 (101 cM). The QTL region detected on SSC1 was comparable to the identified epistatic QTL locus described by Duthie et al. [] and to the individual QTL in other studies on this trait [  ]. In other single-QTL studies  loci on SSC5 (87 cM) and SSC6 (101 cM) have been identified as influencing IMF [  ]. Significant epistatic relationships can be observed between QTL positions on SSC7  SSC13 and SSC16  which mainly influence the expression of cooking loss and shear force. A QTL locus on SSC7 (40 to 50 cM) for cooking loss has been reported by de Koning et al. [] in an F cross of Meishan and commercial Dutch pigs and this region carries the  genes  which are potential candidate genes []. Other single-QTL analyses have revealed epistatic loci on SSC13 (13 cM) and SSC16 (108 cM) [  ]. The epistatic QTL position on SSC16 (102 to 108 cM) also interacts with loci on SSC4 (43 cM  cooking loss) and SSC2 (145 to 160 cM  shear force). Though a novel QTL  SSC16 may play an important role in tenderness traits. Three epistatic QTL pairs not yet mentioned are involved in the expression of loin pH 24 h. All the QTL positions involved have been reported in the literature and are relevant for meat quality [      ]. Moreover  four QTL pairs involving eight epistatic QTL loci are relevant for loin pH 1 h. Although all the positions for this trait have not been published yet  many other loci are well known. The high number of epistatic interactions shows the complexity of postmortem metabolic processes in meat  which need further clarification []. As an example of this complexity  Figure  depicts all the epistatic loci for pH traits. Most QTL pairs have an impact on more than one trait  and the number of QTL positions that epistatically influence a single trait ranges from three to eight. Pleiotropy and co-regulation are important factors of genetic control to compensate for up- and down-regulation of correlated traits by gene interactions [  ]. Epistasis appears to be an important contributor to genetic variation in carcass composition and meat quality traits. Subdividing epistatic effects into the structural types (a × a  a × d  d × a and d × d) allows a deeper insight into the genetic mechanisms behind the expression of these phenotypes. As shown in Additional file  (see Additional file )  all types of structural epistasis can be found across all traits. Often  more than one component is significant  indicating complex genetic structures  particularly for meat quality traits. On average  d × d interactions are the most prevalent. Twenty-nine pairs exhibit d × d  19 a × a  11 a × d and 13 d × a epistatic effects. Moreover  the importance of dominance becomes more obvious by summing up the three epistatic effects (a × d  d × a and d × d) that comprise dominance. With respect to all traits  we observed this composite effect for 33 of 40 cases  which makes it more important than a × a effects. Epistatic dominance contributes to heterosis  and it has been widely shown that heterosis plays an important role in the genetics of carcass composition and meat quality []. For seven QTL pairs  a × a effects were more prevalent in the expression of traits (e.g.  epistasis among SSC3 and SSC14 for conductivity 1 h loin) than were other interaction effects containing dominance. According to Carlborg and Haley []  a × a effects are indicators of co-adaptive epistasis and occur when the homozygous alleles of the two loci that originate from the same parental line show enhanced performance. This type of gene interaction is particularly interesting  since the loci have no significant individual effects []. This might be the reason why some of our novel epistatic QTL positions have not been not found in a single-QTL analysis. Selection strategies among the parental lines might lead to fixation of different alleles at the relevant loci  regulating the expression of a specific phenotype in a way that makes statistical epistasis unapparent in either population []. In the present study  a bi-dimensional scan identified a large number of epistatic QTL pairs involved in the expression of carcass composition and meat quality traits. These results show that the genetic architecture of carcass composition and meat quality is mainly composed of a complex network of interacting genes rather than of the sum of individual QTL effects. Combining epistatic QTL experiments with subsequent gene expression profiling can be a promising strategy to clarify the underlying biological processes of muscle development and metabolism.

Therefore  in animal half-sib designs  modelling linkage disequilibrium evolution using a Wright-Fisher model does not significantly improve the accuracy of the QTL location when compared to a simpler method assuming complete and constant linkage between the QTL and the marker alleles. Finally  given the high marker density available nowadays  the simpler method should be preferred as it gives accurate results in a reasonable computing time. For several decades  detection and mapping of loci affecting quantitative traits of agricultural interest (Quantitative Trait Loci or QTL) using genetic markers have been based only on pedigree or family information  especially in plant and animal populations where the structure of these experimental designs can be easily controlled. However  the accuracy of gene locations using these methods was limited  due to the small number of meioses occurring in a few generations. Recent advances in technology  such as SNP genotyping  leading to dense genetic maps have boosted research in QTL detection and fine-mapping. Nowadays  methods for fine-mapping rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) information rather than simply on linkage data. Linkage disequilibrium  the non-uniform association of alleles at two loci  has been successfully employed for mapping both Mendelian disease genes [–] and QTL [–]. Interested readers can also refer to reviews by [–]. For all chromosomal loci  including those that are physically unlinked  linkage disequilibrium can be generated or influenced by various evolutionary forces such as mutation  natural or artificial selection  genetic drift  population admixture  changes in population size (exponential growth or bottleneck  for instance). Most methods using the linkage disequilibrium concept for QTL fine-mapping are based on the genetic history of the population. Whichever method is used to include population genetics concepts (calculation of Identity By Descent (IBD) probabilities under given assumptions about population history []  Wright-Fisher based allele frequency model []  backward inferences through the coalescent tree [])  computation is always time consuming. Furthermore  since mapping accuracy depends on the length of the haplotype used in the study [–]  this computational time could become prohibitive when many markers are being considered. Therefore  with new technologies such as SNP genotyping and the amount of data they generate  it is interesting to evaluate the improvement in accuracy produced by these time consuming methods opposed to using simpler methods. In this study  we focused on animal populations of agricultural interest. Generally  these populations have a small effective size  and are composed of a few families with about a hundred descendants. We considered that a dense genetic map was available. Our main objective was to compare the QTL prediction accuracy of two methods in the half-sib family design. These two methods differed in the way they modelled the evolution of linkage disequilibrium between a QTL and its flanking markers  through the probability of bearing the favourable QTL allele given the marker observations. The first method  HaploMax  was a haplotype-based association analysis  very similar to the one developed by Blott et al. []. In this method  there was no specific modelling of linkage disequilibrium evolution: linkage disequilibrium was complete at time 0 on the mutated haplotype and remained complete during the following generations. Therefore  the probability of bearing the favourable QTL allele given the mutated haplotype is always equal to one during the generations. This is why we mentioned the deterministic evolution of linkage disequilibrium. The second method  HAPimLDL  was a maximum likelihood approach [] and it used probabilistic modelling of the temporal evolution of linkage disequilibrium based on a Wright-Fisher model. This probabilistic modelling of the temporal evolution of linkage disequilibrium made it possible to vary the probability of bearing the favourable QTL allele given the marker informations during generations. Our hypothesis was that  in these animal populations with a small effective size and having evolved over a few generations  a rough model based on the deterministic evolution of linkage disequilibrium was as accurate as a probabilistic-based model and should therefore be preferred from a computational point of view. Both methods assumed a single QTL effect for all the families. Both allow any number of flanking markers to be considered using a sliding window across a previously identified QTL region. Both methods have been implemented in an R-package freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN  ). In this paper  we have considered only half-sib family designs. In this framework  we used simulations to compare the performance of these two fine-mapping methods. We investigated the effect of various scenarios on the performance of the methods: allelic effect of the QTL  marker density  population size  mutation age  family structure  selection rate  mutation rate and number and size of the families. For each of these scenarios  we investigated the improvement produced by probabilistic modelling of linkage disequilibrium evolution. The genetic model used in this paper was described by []. The population was considered as a set of independent sire families  all dams being unrelated to each other and to the sires. We considered a bi-allelic QTL with additive effect only and a single QTL effect for all the families. We assumed the same phase across families. We will only briefly describe the HaploMax method  as it is a standard method. The HAPimLDL method  which has been developed for this work  is presented in detail. HaploMax is a marker-haplotype-regression method adapted to the following two hypotheses: the QTL is bi-allelic  and QTL alleles and marker alleles are in complete linkage. In each marker interval  and for each flanking marker haplotype  we performed a haplotype-based association analysis with a sire effect and a dose haplotype effect (0 for absence of the haplotype  1 for one copy of the haplotype  2 for homozygosity). We tested each haplotype in turn against all the others [] and the HaploMax value was given by the haplotype maximising the F-test values. The HaploMax method is therefore perfectly suited to demonstrate the effect of a causal bi-allelic mutation. In HaploMax  there was no probabilistic modelling of linkage disequilibrium evolution. Linkage disequilibrium was complete at time 0 and remained complete during the following generations. This likelihood-based method is detailed in the following sub-sections. It combines family information with probabilistic modelling of linkage disequilibrium evolution (LDL stands for Linkage and Linkage Disequilibrium). For clarity purposes  some of the longer calculations are presented in the Appendix. A bi-allelic QTL is assumed with alleles  and . Let  ( = 1  ...   ) be the identification of a family. Let  ( = 1  ...  ) be the index of a mate of sire  ( = 1  ...   ) and  ( = 1  ...  ) denote the progeny of dam . When considering strictly half-sib families  only one progeny is measured per dam (= 1) (in the case of bovine populations  for instance)  and the  index can be omitted. Assuming that the available information consists of the phenotypic value of each progeny and a set of haplotypes of observed markers aligned on a genetic map  we can establish the following notations:   marker haplotypes of sire .  (respectively ) is the set of marker alleles carried by the first (respectively second) chromosome of the sire     marker haplotypes of progeny  transmitted respectively by its father and mother    phenotype of progeny . If  denotes a putative bi-allelic QTL locus on the genome:   the sire diplotype at locus   where  and  denote the QTL allele at locus  carried respectively by the two homologous chromosomes. Note that there are three genotypes but four diplotypes since there are two heterozygous diplotypes ( and ).   marker and locus  haplotypes of sire . This is the extended marker haplotype of sire  including the alleles at the QTL locus  .   the allele at the QTL locus  transmitted by the dam  to her single progeny    the allele at the QTL locus  transmitted by the sire  to his progeny . The population was considered as a set of independent sire families  all dams being unrelated both to each other and to the sires. The likelihood is constructed as follows: a Gaussian mixture models the phenotypes as a function of QTL states. These are unknown  but their probability depends on the surrounding markers through LD  which is modelled by the Wright-Fisher model. Further  if the chromosome has been received from a sire  the probability of descent of each paternal chromosome is considered. Let <U+039B> () denote the individual  likelihood. where  = 1  2  3 and 4 stands for  and  respectively   = 1 and 2 for  and   is the  mean within the sire family   and  the residual variance  (·;    ) is  Gaussian probability density function with mean  and variance  for  = 1 and 2  the and parameters  subject to the constraint of their sum being equal to 0  are the effects of the diplotypes at locus . The constraint = = 0 leads to an additive model the symbol \" <U+2190>\" in the quantities  means \"comes from\". In this likelihood  the probabilities due to linkage that are contained in the transmission probabilities  for  = 1  2 were computed using QTLMAP subroutines that implement the approximate method described in []. The expression above considers QTL effects  probabilities of transmission of QTL alleles from sires to offspring  and probabilities of QTL states in the founders. The linkage disequilibrium signal comes from the quantities ( () = | ) and  which are the probabilities of QTL alleles in the parents conditional on the surrounding marker haplotypes. QTL diplotype probabilities given marker information  contained in ( () = | )  were computed assuming the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Thus  QTL allelic probabilities given marker information for both sire and dam were computed under the linkage disequilibrium model described in the next section. The probability terms   and  ( = 1  2)  involving sire QTL allele given sire QTL diplotype  are either 0 or 1. QTL allelic probabilities given marker information for the parents are terms that are modelled through the evolution of linkage disequilibrium across generations. These terms depend on the frequencies of marker haplotypes and on the frequencies of QTL allele and marker extended haplotypes. Under traditional models of population genetics  these haplotype frequencies are stochastic. Thus  the likelihood function cannot be easily calculated and must be approximated. Following []  we used the likelihood given the expected value of haplotype frequencies to approximate the overall expected value of the likelihood and we limited marker haplotypes to a small number of markers surrounding the putative QTL locus (in our study  we considered either two flanking markers or four flanking markers). This led to the following approximations for  = 1  2 and  = 1  2: where  denotes the haplotypic pair limited to markers surrounding the locus  carried by sire  at time  and   the frequency of the haplotype mentioned.  is the frequency of sire  haplotypes carrying both the  allele at the  locus and the haplotype  at the flanking markers at time .  denotes the progeny  haplotype at time  + 1 transmitted by its mother and limited to markers surrounding the  locus.  is the corresponding frequency   is the frequency of progeny  haplotypes carrying both the  allele at the  locus and the haplotype  at the flanking markers at time  + 1. These haplotype frequencies at time  could be expressed as functions of marker frequencies  digenic  trigenic... disequilibria at time []. Moreover  under the hypotheses of a Wright-Fisher model  no interference and a large population size  the expected values of marker frequencies and disequilibria at time  could be derived from the same quantities at time 0 and the recombination rates between the QTL locus and the markers [  ]. Therefore  we generalised the formula obtained by [] in order to take into account any number of surrounding markers. These calculations are detailed in the Appendix. Finally  we had to model the haplotype frequencies at time 0. Following []  we assumed an initial creation of linkage disequilibrium that was due to mutation or migration. Generally speaking  assuming that the  allele at time 0 appeared on a haplotype denoted *  then the time zero model was where the parameter  represents the proportion of new copies of allele  introduced at time 0   is the Kronecker delta operator (equal to 1 if  =  and 0 otherwise)  <U+03A0>  (0) and <U+03A0>  (0) are the frequencies of the haplotypes (  ) and  at time 0  and <U+03A0>  is the frequency of haplotype . In our specific study  we simplified the time 0 model assuming that there was no pre-existing copy of the  allele and we set  equal to 1. From a computational point of view  the HAPimLDL likelihood calculation was divided into two parts. In the first part  devoted to the calculation of transmission probabilities and the reconstruction of sire and progeny chromosomes  we used a modified version of the software QTLMAP written in Fortran 95 []. The second part aimed at calculating and maximizing the likelihood in the half-sib design. It was developed using the R free software environment for statistical computing []. An R package named \"HAPim\" was implemented and is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN  ). Simulations were carried out in order to compare these methods in the specific design of half-sib families. For each simulation  500 replicates were performed. The populations were simulated using the LDSO (Linkage Disequilibrium with Several Options) program developed in Fortran 90 by [] and based on the gene-dropping method []. There was no constraint on the QTL frequency  but we discarded simulations for which there was no heterozygous sire. Evolution of the founder population was modelled through two parameters: the effective size (i.e. the number of founders) and the time of evolution. We studied two extreme scenarios for the founder population. In the first  at time 0  we assumed complete linkage disequilibrium of QTL-markers (by introducing a mutation in a single haplotype) and linkage equilibrium between markers. In the second scenario  the QTL and the markers were at equilibrium. Evolution time was 50 generations in almost all simulations  except a 200 generation evolution time in one case of the \"disequilibrium scenario\" and a 100 generation evolution time in one case of the \"equilibrium scenario\". We considered three effective population size values: 100  200 and 400. In most simulations we did not assume selection  mutation  or bottleneck. However  to investigate the robustness of the methods  three simulations were also performed to study the effect of selection and one to study the influence of mutation. We simulated a set of half-sib families. Two parameters- the number of sires (equal to 10  20  25  50 or 100) and the number of progeny per sire (equal to 10  20  25 50 or 100)- were varied to address the problem of how to choose between many small families and a few large families. All simulations were compared both to each other and to the reference simulation. In the reference simulation  we considered a 10 cM chromosomal area with 40 evenly spaced bi-allelic markers and a population size of 100 evolving over 50 generations. We simulated a set of 20 sires  each having 100 progeny. A single QTL with a substitution effect of 0.25 was simulated at a position of 3.35 cM. We then varied the different parameters with respect to this reference simulation in order to assess their respective influence. We considered three different values of map density (0.125 cM  0.25 cM and 0.5 cM). The phenotypic values were simulated with a fixed dose-response model at the QTL position (i.e. regression model as a function of the number of Q alleles) and a residual variance of 1. In the first set of simulations  presented in Tables  and   we analyzed only three-locus haplotypes (composed of the QTL and its two flanking markers). In Table   we also conducted simulations where the haplotype length was equal to 5 (the QTL and two flanking markers on both sides of the QTL). In the following tables  we present square roots of the mean square error (MSE) of the QTL position. The MSE value is given by the following formula where  is the estimated QTL position in replicate    is the true QTL position and 500 is the total number of replicates. We also computed the mean absolute error criterion and found a clear linear dependency between these two criteria (data not shown). We compared the two methods  HaploMax and HAPimLDL  with a t-test on the MSE values and found no significant difference between them for any of the scenarios studied. In this set of simulations we simulated the scenario for which there were complete linkage disequilibrium QTL-markers and linkage equilibrium between markers in the founder population. Here we describe the sensitivity of the two methods to the following parameters: QTL allelic effect value  marker density  population's effective size of population  number of generations  mutation and selection. However  despite the fact that our goal was the accuracy of location  we computed some power values for both methods  the 5% thresholds being obtained by permutation. For the reference simulation  the power value was equal to 63% for Haplomax and to 56% for HAPimLDL. The highest power values were obtained for the QTL value equal to 0.5 and were around 90% for both methods. The lowest power values were obtained when  was equal to 400 and  equal to 50  and were around 15%. Table  summarises the simulation results. It is not surprising to see that the bigger the QTL allelic effect  the more accurate the method. The marker density had only a very slight influence on the MSE value. HaploMax presented an erratic trend with the marker density. HAPimLDL showed a clear decrease in the MSE values with increasing marker density. With regard to the design parameters  we noticed that the precision of the QTL position decreased as the sample size (i.e. number of sires × number of progeny per sire) decreased  regardless of the family structure. For a fixed number of generations  the MSE values increased as the effective size of the population increased. However  when both effective size and number of generations varied  provided that their ratio remained constant  MSE values were not modified  which is completely consistent with traditional theory in population genetics. When we allowed all SNP markers to mutate at a mutation rate equal to 10  we found a loss of accuracy of about 20-25% for HaploMax and about 50% for HAPimLDL (data not shown). In this case  the power value was equal to 59% for HaploMax and to 49% for HAPimLDL. The influence of phenotypic selection is presented in Table . We considered two values for the additive QTL effect and two selection strengths (light and strong). The QTL effect had no influence on the accuracy of location. However  selection led to a loss of accuracy of about 50% with light selection and 60% with strong selection. On the one hand  the selection causes a hitchhiking effect which amplifies the signal from the region where the QTL is located but  on the other hand  it widens this region  leading to a loss of accuracy (higher MSE values). For example  a possible outcome of selection is that just a few different haplotypes are carriers of the  allele. This loss of accuracy had already been pointed out by []. It was concluded that selection increased MSE values  leading to large confidence intervals of the QTL position  and therefore to additional difficulties in locating the mutation. Moreover  the power values collapsed in this situation (around 4% for both methods with strong selection and around 13% for both methods with light selection). In Table   we studied the influence of haplotype length on the accuracy of the QTL location. It is clear that there is a significant gain when using four markers instead of two. All the previous conclusions remained valid when using four markers. If four markers were used in the model  increasing the sample size seemed to be the only way to decrease the MSE. The influence of the population structure itself is also investigated in Table . Since we noted that haplotypes containing four markers led to the best results  we have focused the discussion only on this type of haplotype. Through this set of simulations  we have tried to resolve the issue of whether it is better to study many small families or a few large families. The results are in favour of having many founders  which increases the power value. However  this is only clear when both the sample size and the number of markers are large. In this section  we simulated a scenario where the QTL and the markers were at equilibrium in the founder population. We only varied the effective size (50 or 100) and the number of generations (50 or 100) with respect to the reference simulation. Results are presented in Table . We noted that MSE values in Table  are lower than the corresponding MSE values in Table . This was not surprising since  in the situation where the QTL and the markers were at equilibrium  there were more sires carrying the favourable QTL allele than in the \"complete disequilibrium\" case studied in Table . Moreover  the HaploMax method again gave MSE values slightly below those given by the HAPimLDL method. Finally  we noticed that MSE increased when the effective size decreased or the number of generations increased. This is also completely coherent since  in this situation  allelic frequencies have moved towards fixation. Within a dense genetic map framework  we have compared two QTL mapping methods aiming at locating one QTL on a chromosome in half-sib family designs. On the one hand  in the HaploMax method there was no specific modelling of linkage disequilibrium evolution and the probability of bearing the favourable QTL allele given the mutated haplotype was always equal to one during the generations. On the other hand  in the HAPimLDL method we used a probabilistic modelling of the temporal evolution of linkage disequilibrium. In this latter method  the probabilistic modelling allowed a temporal evolution of the conditional probability of bearing the favourable QTL allele given the marker observations. Our simulated scenarios mimicked animal populations shortly after creation of the breed (i.e. small populations with a short evolution time). We compared our results with those of []  leading to conclusions very similar to theirs: very slight influence of marker density on the mapping accuracy  mapping accuracy increasing with sample size  QTL effect  number of generations since mutation occurrence  and effective size. However  although we achieved results of the same order of magnitude  slight differences in MSE values were observed mainly due to the following three reasons: we did not study exactly the same type of population; [] assumed that haplotypes were known  but we reconstructed them; and  finally  we did not consider the same value for the number of generations parameter. It has been established that the evolution time parameter has a great influence on the accuracy of the location [[]  table five]. Despite these differences  and despite the fact that one of our methods took into account the transmission from sires to sibs  both studies showed the same tendencies with regard to the mapping accuracy. We found a gain in mapping accuracy when using a 4-SNP haplotype instead of a 2-SNP one. However  this result is valid with a fixed density marker (the one we used in our simulation study). With a very high density marker  a 1-SNP haplotype will probably lead to the best results. Finally  we demonstrated that neither method was robust to selection. The simulations showed that both methods led to similar results concerning QTL position accuracy. The simplest method  HaploMax  performed as well as HAPimLDL. This is in agreement with recent findings. In []  it has also been concluded that a three-marker-haplotype-based association analysis (deterministic complete LD modelling) could be as efficient as the IBD method of []. The conclusion of our study is that the probabilistic modelling of the linkage disequilibrium evolution using a Wright-Fisher model did not improve the accuracy of the QTL location when compared to a simple method using deterministic modelling that assumed complete and constant linkage between the QTL and the marker alleles. The deterministic model  which is a rough model  was efficient enough in our simulated scenarios  which mimicked animal populations shortly after the creation of the breed (i.e. small populations with a short evolution time). The conclusion might then be to use HaploMax for animal populations with a small effective size and having evolved over a few generations. In fact  the forward method associated with causal mutation  used in our simulation study  reflected exactly the theoretical evolution model used to compute the LD dynamics in the likelihood function  thus favouring the HAPimLDL method as against the HaploMax method. Therefore  we can conclude that the HAPimLDL method did not perform significantly better than simpler methods within our evolution scenarios. When dealing with populations with large effective sizes or with very old mutations  combining linkage with probabilistic modelling of linkage disequilibrium evolution should produce the greatest accuracy. Actually  in these populations  a huge number of recombination events would occur  leading to a small extent of the linkage disequilibrium signal. Therefore  deterministic complete linkage disequilibrium modelling would be less appropriate in this case. To derive haplotype frequencies at time  as functions of haplotype frequencies at time 0  we used the Bennett decomposition of haplotype frequencies [] and the work of []. Let  denote a set of  alleles at  different loci   = {    ...   }. Let  (   ) be the n-loci linkage disequilibrium of  alleles at time  defined by [] such that  in an infinitely large population  under random mating and meiosis where { } is the probability of no recombination across loci belonging to  . Assuming no interference between loci leads to where  is the recombination rate between loci  and . Let  () be the frequency of the haplotype carrying the alleles in  at time . Then by definition where the coefficients  are constants obtained by recursion []  and  = {  =  } denotes a partition of  . For example  for  = 3 there are 5 partitions namely {    }  {{  }{}}  {{  }{}}  {{  }{}} and {{}{}{}}. When  equals two and three  [] proved that the  are all equal to one. But when  = 4  some  are not equal to one even if we assume no interference between loci. For example  for the partition {{  }{  }} with four loci  [] proved that which does not reduce to unity  except for unlinked loci. This means that  for  = 4  the Bennett disequilibria are different from disequilibria defined by [–] since these authors imposed  = 1 in formula (2). However  the Bennett disequilibria are the only multilocus linkage disequilibrium measures that decay geometrically with time. Let  be odd and composed of ( - 1)/2 left and right markers surrounding a putative causal locus. Assume that at time 0 all the Bennett disequilibria between markers are null  i.e. markers were in equilibrium when the causal mutation appeared. Formula (1) states that marker disequilibria are null throughout the population history. Moreover  all the terms not equal to zero in the formula (2)  applied to the frequency of markers and the mutated locus haplotypes  have a  constant equal to one. Partitions that do not involve marker disequilibria are such that where the causal locus is in the set  and  = 0 means  =  . Since those partitions are composed of singletons and a single subset of     = 1 (formula 4.14 in [])  then we get where #denotes the cardinal of set . We finish the calculation by using the reverse formula of (  0) as a function of haplotype frequencies at time 0  which in this case can be obtained easily using recursion based on the following equation In a finite population  formulae developed in an infinite population  can be transformed using the expectation of multi-locus disequilibria and haplotype frequencies  and taking only the first order development of these expectations as the population size extends to infinity. We then get where  means asymptotically equivalent. Equalities of first order developments are based on the fact that products of expectations are asymptotically equal to expectations of products. These equalities can also be found using the work of [].

Accurate genomic evaluation of the broader bull and cow population can be achieved with a single genotyping assays containing ~ 3 000 to 5 000 evenly spaced SNP. In genomic selection (GS)  selection decisions are made on genomic breeding values predicted from high-density single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers. In dairy cattle  GS has the potential to double the rate of genetic gain to that of traditional breeding schemes due to a substantial reduction in generation intervals and increased selection intensities [  ]. Significant additional gains in GS schemes could be made if cows to breed sires and cows to breed cows were selected on genomic breeding values []. Another benefit of genotyping cows may be lower rates of inbreeding: according to Daetwyler et al. []  the use of GS can be expected to decrease the rate of inbreeding relative to conventional selection using BLUP breeding values  this effect will be greatest when larger numbers of both cows and potential sires are genotyped []. At the current price  high-density SNP genotyping assays are limited to applications involving elite sires and dams. An alternative is to use a more cost-effective low-density assay for genotyping more animals from the population. As shown for a single trait by Weigel et al. []  a low-density assay comprising selected SNP can deliver a substantial portion of the gain of a high-density assay  possibly for a fraction of the price. However  the use of such a low-density array may still be limited if multiple traits require so many SNP that their genotyping cost is similar to the cost of a high-density chip. The utility of low-density arrays will depend in part on the genetic architecture of the target trait. In GS  prediction equations are derived from a training set  where animals are phenotyped and genotyped to predict breeding values based only on the genotype information of evaluation animals. This requires that the markers are in sufficient LD with the QTL and simulation studies have shown that accuracy of genomic predictions increases as LD increases [–]. In the ideal case where every QTL is in perfect LD with a single marker and where a limited number of QTL with large effects account for the genetic variation  the maximum accuracy could be obtained with very few markers. However  there is increasing evidence that most complex traits are affected by very many QTL with a small effect (e.g. height in humans  [–]). This would imply that the training population would need to be genotyped with a high-density SNP panel in order to capture the effects of all QTL. Selecting individual SNP from high-density genotype data is complicated because the multicollinearity between SNP  i.e. two or more SNP in high but not complete LD  makes it difficult to identify 'important' SNP  as each SNP masks a part of the effect of other SNP and a single marker might be in LD with several QTL. Utility of SNP subsets will also be affected by the relationship of the selection candidates to the training set. Although genomic predictions rely on LD between SNP and QTL  this LD can operate or be interpreted at a number of levels. In addition to population level LD  simulation studies and empirical data have demonstrated that the accuracy of prediction depends on the relatedness between animals in the training and evaluation populations [    ]. At the extreme  even in the absence of LD between markers and QTL  markers can predict family relationships between animals. If animals in the training and evaluation data share DNA segments from a small number of ancestors  relatively few markers are required to trace the segments shared between related animals separated by only a few generations. A low-density assay of evenly spaced SNP might then provide sufficient accuracies of prediction of evaluation animals  as long as the information content of the subset of SNP is sufficient to estimate effects of distinct haplotypes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of low-density SNP genotyping assays to predict the direct genomic value (DGV) of bulls and cows for commercially important traits in Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle. The impact of two analysis methods  the number of SNP needed for accurate DGV prediction  as well as strategies for SNP selection were explored. Phenotype and genotype data were available on 2 144 Holstein-Friesian bulls and 510 Holstein-Friesian cows. The traits analysed included milk production traits (milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat percentage and protein percentage)  an overall confirmation trait (overall type)  survival index  Australian Profit Ranking (APR) and Australian Selection index (ASI). The ASI is an index given by (3.8 × protein ABV) + (0.9 × fat ABV) - (0.048 × milk ABV)  APR is given by (3.8 × protein ABV) + (0.9 × fat ABV) - (0.048 × milk ABV) + (1.2 × milking speed ABV) + (2.0 × temperament ABV) + (3.9 × survival ABV) + (0.34 × cell count ABV) - (0.26 × live weight ABV) + (3.0 × daughter fertility)  whereas survival is given by (0.5 × likeability) + (1.8 × overall type) + (3.0 × udder depth) + (2.2 × pin set). Phenotype information was provided by the Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (ADHIS  ). The phenotypes used were deregressed breeding values (DRBV) for protein percentage  fat percentage  ASI  APR and survival  and daughter trait deviations (DTD) for protein yield  fat yield  milk yield and overall type. The deregression procedure removed the contribution of relatives other than daughters to the breeding values  as detailed in []. For cows  trait deviations (TD) were available for protein yield  fat yield  milk yield and overall type  but no DRBV information was available for the other traits. SNP genotypes were derived from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  USA). After quality control [] and omitting SNP located on the sex chromosomes a total of 42 576 markers remained for the analysis. The 2 144 bulls were divided in a training data set of 1 847 bulls born between 1955 and 2004 and a validation set of 297 young bulls born between 2001 and 2004  which represented progeny test teams for 2007  2008 and 2009. A second validation set included 510 cows born between 1992 and 2004. Table  gives the number of animals in training and test sets and the number of records contributing to the phenotypes per animal. Of the 297 young bulls in the bull validation set  240 (80.8%) were sired by bulls in the training set  whereas 473 (92.7%) of the cows had their sire in the training set. The correlation coefficient between predicted DGV and realized DRBV  DTD or TD was used as the measure of accuracy of DGV prediction. The distribution of traits in the training and validation set is shown in Figure . . Prediction equations for each trait were derived from the training set by either ridge regression [  ] or partial least squares regression [    ] and then combined with the genotype data to predict DGV for the validation animals: where DGV is the vector of direct genomic values estimated with the marker genotypes   is an incidence matrix that relates genotypes to individuals  and  is the vector of SNP effects which is estimated by either one of the two methods described below. Regression coefficients are obtained from the solution of the mixed model equations where  is the number of training animals   is a vector of phenotypes   is an unknown constant   is a ( × ) matrix of genotypes encoded as 0 (homozygote)  1 (heterozygote) or 2 (other homozygote)   is a vector of SNP effects  and  is a  ×  identity matrix. The penalty term   which is the same for all SNP  overcomes the problem of ill-conditioning when multicollinearity among columns in  causes  to be singular  or nearly so. The system of equations was solved iteratively by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method []. The 10-fold cross-validation procedure described in Moser et al. []  with golden segment search []  was used to locate the optimal  within a given range. RR is equivalent to the BLUP method of Meuwissen et al. [] and Habier et al. []  which assumes that regression coefficients are independent random draws from a common normal distribution. Under the BLUP model   = s  s    where s  is the residual variance and s  the genetic variance. In RR  the contribution of each bull can be weighted according to the number of daughters contributing to the phenotype. However  reliabilities of the phenotypes expressed as 'equivalent daughter contributions' were uniformly high  with small differences between the majority of training bulls  and weighting the contributions of bulls had no impact on the accuracy of DGV for method RR (results not shown). The main idea of PLSR is to build orthogonal components (called 'latent components') from the original genotype matrix . A PLSR component  =   is a linear combination of the SNP that have maximal covariance with the response vector  under the additional assumption that components are mutually orthogonal []. Subsequently   is regressed on the linear combinations of markers. Different algorithms to extract the latent components and to obtain regression coefficients  exist. We implemented PLSR using an algorithm described in []. The optimal model complexity (i.e. number of latent components)  was estimated by ten fold cross-validation []. Note that the PLSR regression coefficients differ from the ordinary least squares regression coefficients and the RR regression coefficients. The magnitude of the PLSR regression coefficients can be used to determine the relative influence of each SNP on the model and to select relevant SNP []. The absolute magnitude of the regression coefficients was used to determine which SNP are most influential in the training data set. To select subsets of markers  all 42 576 SNP were ranked by their absolute value of . The ranking of SNP was derived using a backward elimination procedure. The process started with a model including the complete set of 42 576 SNP. Subsequently in each step  a fraction of SNP with the smallest absolute value of the regression coefficients was dropped from the SNP list and the regression coefficients were recomputed. This re-computation is important as the regression coefficient of an individual SNP can strongly depend on other SNP that are in LD with the SNP of interest. The optimal model complexity (i.e. number of latent components) for PLSR and the value of  for RR was estimated at each step by cross-validation. In detail  we first fitted models including all 42 576 SNP. In the first iteration 40 000 SNP with the highest absolute value of the regression coefficient were retained in the SNP list. The number of SNP subsequently dropped in each iteration was 2 000 for subsets of up to 10 000 SNP  500 SNP for subsets of up to 1 000 SNP  100 SNP for subsets of up to 300 SNP and 20 SNP for subsets of up to 100 SNP. Four alternative strategies of SNP subset selection were compared. Under strategy 1  separate subsets including the highest ranked SNP for each individual trait were created. Strategies 2-4 used a single subset of evenly spaced SNP. To select a subset of  evenly spaced SNP  we divided the total length of the autosomes into  intervals flanked by two markers to give segments of approximately equal length. Chromosome lengths and SNP positions were based on the physical map of cattle genome assembly Btau 4.0. Subsequently  the highest ranked SNP for ASI (strategy 2)  APR (strategy 3) or the SNP with the highest minor allele frequency (MAF  strategy 4) in each segment  was added to the subset. Using the same subset of SNP  a model was then fitted for each trait to derive the prediction equations. Subsets of evenly spaced SNP were generated for sets including between 100 and 5 000 SNP. The accuracy of DGV obtained using a subset of SNP was compared to the accuracy from the analysis of all 42 576 SNP. Accuracy of DGV predictions in validation sets of young bulls and cows using all 42 576 SNP and subsets including the highest ranked SNP for each trait are shown in Figure . Accuracy of DGV was computed as the correlation between DGV and the phenotype. Accuracy of prediction for protein percentage  fat percentage  ASI  APR and survival could not be computed for cows  because phenotypes for these traits were not available. Accuracy of DGV prediction from the analysis of all 42 576 SNP ranged from 0.15 to 0.64 for RR and 0.20 to 0.64 for PLSR in the validation set of bulls  and from 0.22 to 0.57 for RR and from 0.21 to 0.54 for PLSR in the validation set of cows (Figure ). The largest difference between the bull and cow validation sets was obtained for the overall type trait  with the accuracy of DGV for cows being approximately half that of bulls  whereas for protein and milk yield the accuracies of DGV prediction between bulls and cows were almost identical (Figure ). . Overall  predictions by RR were slightly more accurate for larger SNP subsets but less accurate for smaller SNP subsets compared to PLSR. As shown in Table   the differences in accuracy between both methods  with respect to the highest correlation obtained for an individual trait  were negligible. The highest accuracy for PLSR was obtained with models that contained considerably fewer SNP than the high-density assay  whereas the RR model with the highest accuracy included almost all SNP  with the exception of survival and fat percentage. In the case of PLSR  the highest accuracy for cows was achieved with models containing more SNP compared to bulls (Table ). Depending on the trait  accuracies of PLSR were 2 to 12% higher than those for RR for subsets including 5 000 or less SNP [see Additional file ]. The panels in Figures  are ordered from high to low heritable traits (left-right  top-bottom) based on reported heritability estimates [  ]. Heritability of APR and ASI was assumed to be intermediate between production traits and survival. Figure  shows a strong relationship between the accuracy of prediction of DGV and the heritability of the trait. Predictions of production traits with a higher heritability  such as protein percentage (h = 0.56)  fat percentage (h = 0.52)  and milk yield (h = 0.28)  were more accurate than predictions of traits with a lower heritability  such as overall type (h = 0.18) and survival (h = 0.03). Figure  shows a consistent trend in the accuracy of DGV when the SNP density decreased from 42 576 to approximately 1 000 SNP using trait-depended subsets of SNP. When SNP density exceeded 1 000 SNP the accuracy of DGV reached a plateau  and increases in accuracy with increasing number of SNP were marginal or fluctuated around the maximum accuracy (Table. ). This plateau in accuracy of DGV was consistent in both bulls and cows (Figure ). At densities below 1 000 SNP accuracies declined relatively rapidly  subsets of 100 SNP consistently showed the lowest accuracy within the range examined here (Figure ). Results showing the accuracy of DGV using subsets of SNP selected by each of the four strategies are restricted to the analyses of subsets of 100  300  500  1 000  3 000 and 5 000 SNP. To limit redundancy  results from the analyses using RR are not presented in detail  but RR performed very similar to PLSR as shown in Figure . Relative accuracies of prediction are expressed as percentage of the accuracies obtained with 42 467 SNP and are shown in Figure  for bulls and Figure  for cows. . Accuracy of prediction is shown as percentage of the accuracy obtained with 42 576 SNP for subsets including the highest ranked SNP (Trait)  subsets of evenly spaced SNP including the highest ranked SNP for ASI (ASI)  APR (APR) or SNP with highest minor allele frequency (MAF) obtained by PLSR . Accuracy of prediction is shown as percentage of the accuracy obtained with 42 576 SNP for subsets including the highest ranked SNP (Trait)  subsets of evenly spaced SNP including the highest ranked SNP for ASI (ASI)  APR (APR) or SNP with highest minor allele frequency (MAF) obtained by PLSR When the number of SNP in the subset was 1 000 or larger  using trait-specific subsets gave higher accuracies than using a common subset of SNP in both validation sets  with the exception of overall type for both bulls and cows (Figure  and ). In addition  the rate of decrease in accuracy  with respect to the size of the subset  was much more rapid for evenly spaced SNP than for trait-dependent SNP. The rate of decrease in accuracy tended to be lower for production traits  which have a higher heritability than traits related to fitness. Predictions based on at least 1 000 or 3 000 SNP appeared to be very robust to how SNP were selected  but were very sensitive when the subset included fewer SNP. For the overall type trait  subsets including more than 1 000 of the highest ranked SNP for the trait gave lower accuracies than evenly spaced SNP selected for ASI and APR  which might be due the smaller number of training records available for this trait. All subsets containing less than 500 SNP performed poorly for survival  which has a low heritability (h = 0.03)  particularly subsets of SNP selected for APR and ASI. The relative accuracy of prediction using low-density assays across the nine traits available for bulls and the four traits available for cows is given in Table . Higher relative accuracies were found for cows compared to bulls  which is partly due to the fact that production traits with higher DGV accuracies contributed more to the average of cows. Subsets including the highest ranked SNP for each trait outperformed a single subset of common SNP  which is expected as a common SNP subset of the same size will not include the highest ranked SNP for each trait  with exceptions for bulls for subsets of 3 000 or 5 000 SNP selected for the index APR or of 3 000 SNP selected for the index ASI. However  the gain in accuracy using subsets of the highest ranked SNP over a common set of SNP was small when at least 3 000 SNP were used. A subset containing 5 000 evenly spaced SNP selected for APR captured 92% of the accuracy of the high-density assay in both bulls and cows  compared to average relative accuracies of 89% in bulls and 98% in cows  when using trait-specific subsets with the highest ranked SNP for each trait. Irrespective of the method of SNP selection  subsets containing 3 000 SNP provided more than 90% of the accuracy that could be achieved with a high-density assay for cows  and 80% for young bulls. Figure  shows the percentage of SNP that were shared between combinations of traits  with the number of traits ranging from two to nine. The average number of SNP shared between any two traits was 35% for subsets of 10 000 SNP and dropped to under 10% for subsets of 500 SNP. As the number of traits increased  the number of SNP in common between traits decreased rapidly. Only 0.13% of the 10 000 highest ranked were in common among all nine traits  and no SNP was in common for all traits for subsets of 5 000 SNP. In general  a larger proportion of SNP was shared between index traits and the traits included in the index (results not shown). For example  approximately 60% of the 5 000 highest ranked SNP for ASI were also included in the subset for APR  but less than 20% of those SNP were included in the subsets for fat percentage and protein percentage. . Percentage of SNP that are shared between all combinations of sets of traits for subsets including 500  1 000  5 000 or 10 000 SNP Accuracies of DGV predictions of validation animals whose sires were or were not included in the training set were computed from SNP effect estimates obtained by PLSR. As shown in Figure   the distribution of additive-genetic relationship differed substantially between validation animals whose sires were or were not represented in the training set. When validation sets were broken up into groups of animals with or without sire in the training data  there was substantial variation in the accuracy of prediction between groups and between bulls and cows (Figure  and ). The number of animals in the group without sire in the training data was small  ranging from 16 to 57 for bulls and from 15 to 37 for cows  depending on the trait. Using the high-density assay  the accuracy of prediction of validation bulls with sire in the training data was not consistently higher than for validation bulls without sire in the training data for all traits (Figure ). For fat percentage  milk and protein yield  accuracy of prediction when using fewer SNP was consistent between the two groups of bulls  and accuracies varied more for the other traits. However  for cows  the accuracy of DGV for the group whose sire was included in the training data was substantially higher compared to cows without sire in the training data  irrespective of the number of SNP (Figure ). . Additive-genetic relationships calculated from pedigree are shown between training and validation animals (ALL) and between training animals and validation animals whose sires were included (Sire) or were not included (No Sire) in the training data . Accuracy of prediction is shown for groups of bulls whose sires were included (Sire) or whose sires were not included (No Sire) in the training set using trait-specific SNP subsets obtained by PLSR . Accuracy of prediction is shown for groups of cows whose sires were included (Sire) or whose sires were not included (No Sire) in the training set using trait-specific SNP subsets obtained by PLSR The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of low-density SNP assays for genomic selection of dairy cattle. As also shown by Weigel et al. [] for a single trait  the accuracy of DGV decreased with decreasing number of SNP in the subsets. However  a low-density assay comprising selected SNP can deliver a substantial portion of the gain of a high-density assay  even if a common set of SNP is used across traits. Our results show small differences between RR and PLSR when using high-density assays  but differences between the two methods become more evident for subsets containing fewer SNP. Recently  a number of studies have reported on the accuracy of DGV for dairy traits [–    –]. These have shown that the accuracy of DGV depends on the size of the training data  SNP density  heritability and the genetic relationships between animals in the training and validation data. Although it is difficult to compare accuracies between studies  accuracies estimated in the current study are within the range of those reported previously. There was a strong relationship between the accuracy of prediction and the heritability of the trait  with the prediction for production traits  which had with a higher heritability  being more accurate than that for traits with a low heritability. The generally low accuracies of DGV for survival are perhaps in part due to its low heritability (h = 0.03  []) and the low number of effective records contributing to the DRBV for young bulls (Table ). For a trait with a low heritability  achieving an accuracy similar to that obtained for production traits requires more records [    ]. Results for the overall type trait were less consistent across the various analyses  with larger differences between bulls and cows and between subset selection strategies compared to other traits. The differences between cows and bulls for overall type can be partly attributed to the fact that the cow's phenotype is derived from a single observation  and the smaller number of animals in the training and validation sets may be responsible for some of the variation between methods of SNP selection. In general  the estimated accuracies reported herein most likely underestimate the correlation between DGV and true breeding value  as the phenotypes (DRBV  DTD and TD) are not perfectly predicting the true breeding value. Both  RR and PLSR performed very similar in predicting DGV and differences were generally small. However  the highest accuracy of prediction of PLSR was obtained with subsets including considerably fewer SNP than the high-density assay and fewer SNP than the best subset for RR. This might indicate that using PLSR is less appropriate when analysing very large numbers of SNP  although the differences between the maximum accuracy of DGV and the accuracy obtained with 42 576 SNP was small. A similar result has been found by Solberg et al. [] who have compared PLSR and BayesB for different maker densities in simulated data and found that BayesB gives higher accuracies than PLSR and that the largest difference is obtained with high marker densities. In other simulation studies  Meuwissen et al. [] and Habier et al. [] have found higher accuracies for BayesB compared to RR. In all three simulation studies  a limited number of QTL with large effects accounts for most of the genetic variance. This situation is similar to the distribution of QTL effects for fat percentage  where a mutation in the gene DGAT1 [] is segregating which accounts for 30% of the genetic variance in our population. Of the 300 highest ranked SNP for fat percentage  11 were located on BTA14 in the region of DGAT1  with the SNP with rank 1 closest to the known mutation. The highest accuracy for fat percentage was obtained with subsets including substantially less SNP than the high-density assay and this suggests that part of the advantage of BayesB over PLSR and RR in the simulations stems from the fact that it simultaneously performs shrinkage of marker coefficients and marker selection []. Comparisons of accuracies across traits between validation sets of cows and bulls were constrained by the fact that for cows the accuracy of DGV prediction  computed as the correlation between DGV and DRBV  could not be calculated for five out of the nine traits  as DRBV information was not available for cows. A possible remedy would be to use the correlation between DGV and estimated breeding value  r(DGV  EBV)  as a measure of accuracy instead. When we computed r(DGV  EBV) in bulls and cows (results not shown) we found higher values of r(DGV  EBV) in cows than in bulls  and using r(DGV  EBV) would considerably overestimate the accuracy of genomic selection of cows. The higher correlation between DGV and EBV in cows is probably due to a larger contribution of shared information to the EBV through pedigree relationships. Pedigree relationships between training and validation animals might also have contributed to the accuracy of DGV in cows  with 473 (92.7%) of cows having their sire in the training set compared to 80.8% of the young bulls  and the training set containing more sires of cows (N = 164) than sires of young bulls (N = 30). This could partly explain why for protein  fat and milk yield  the r(DGV  TD) of cows was similar in size as the r(DGV  DTD) for bulls  although the phenotypes of bulls are derived from many more daughter records than the cow phenotypes. Furthermore  the records of cows are included in the sire phenotype. However  the effect of cows contributing information to the sire phenotype is expected to be small  with bulls in the training set which sired a cow in the validation set having on average 5 259 phenotyped daughters. A larger variance of the phenotypes for cows compared to the pre-selected bull teams (Figure ) has also positively contributed to the correlation between DGV and phenotypes for cows. In addition  the cows were selected from a repository of animals which have been well recorded  so the heritabilities in this subset are most likely higher than in the wider industry. Habier et al. [] have demonstrated that the maximum of the additive-genetic relationships between training and validation animals is a good indicator for the accuracy of DGV. The additive-genetic relationship did differ for bulls and cows whose sires were or were not represented in the training set  as shown in Figure . As part of the genetic relationship can be captured by SNP []  one would expect higher accuracies for animals whose sire is included in the training set [  ]. Our results are less conclusive  as accuracies of DGV for bulls whose sire was included in the training set was not higher than those for bulls whose sire was not included in the training set for all traits. A partial explanation might be the relatively small number of bulls whose sire was not genotyped  resulting in a large sampling error of the correlation between DGV and phenotype. However  an important observation is that the differences in accuracies between the two groups appear to be independent of the number of SNP and the method of SNP selection [see Additional files  and ]  with the exception of survival and overall type and possible reasons for this are discussed above. In practise  whilst an attractive application of genotyping using low-density assays is the selection of replacement heifers  for reasons given above  the accuracy is expected to be smaller than reported here for cows. However  the accuracy of genomic selection will be increased if DGV predictions are combined with information from pedigree [    ]. Few SNP were in common between the trait-specific subsets (Figure ) and  given that at least 1 000 SNP are required to obtain accurate DGV predictions for most traits  combining the highest ranked SNP for each trait onto a single chip or developing multiple low-density assays might not provide adequate reductions in genotyping costs. Irrespective of the method of SNP selection  subsets of 3 000 evenly spaced SNP provided more than 90% of the accuracy that can be achieved with a high-density assay in genomic selection of cows and 80% of the high-density assay in young bulls. Furthermore  the rate of increase in accuracy with increasing size of the subset was more rapid for evenly spaced SNP  so that the additional gain from using trait-specific assays or SNP related to a single index such as ASI or APR was small for subsets with a larger number of SNP. Predictions using subsets including 3 000 of the highest ranked SNP were only 1.06 times more accurate in bulls and 1.03 times more accurate in cows than a common subset of evenly spaced SNP of the same size selected based on MAF. This suggests that the distribution of true effects is more or less spread among many loci across the genome and that 3 000 evenly spaced SNP largely capture the level of LD present in the population. While accuracies based on at least ~1 000 or 3 000 SNP appear to be very robust to the method used to select those SNP  accuracies are very sensitive when fewer than 1 000 SNP are used (Figure  and ). However  without re-estimation of effects  accuracy when using evenly spaced low-density assays is expected to decrease steadily and faster over generations compared to accuracy from a high-density assay or from subsets including SNP with large effects  but this loss could be limited by genotyping the parents used for breeding with the high-density assay and retraining []. Dense genotyping of some parents might not be necessary if the genotype information of the high-density assay can be imputed from a low-density SNP panel [  ]. Weigel et al. [] have also assessed the ability to predict DGV using subsets of SNP with largest effects and subsets of evenly spaced SNP for the trait lifetime net merit in dairy cattle. Although it is difficult to compare accuracies between studies due to differences in the methods used to calculate DGV  the size of the training data and the number of SNP of the high-density assay  both studies agree well in that a trait-specific subset including 2 000 of the highest ranked SNP captured most of the gain achieved with a high-density assay. However  for subsets of evenly spaced SNP  the rate in loss of accuracy with decreasing SNP numbers was lower in our study compared to []. Here  selection of SNP was performed by choosing the highest ranked SNP within segments of approximately equal size  whereas in [] spacing of SNP was only informed by the position of the SNP. Using the latter approach  one would expect a larger number of low ranked SNP to be selected in the assay. Indeed  when compared to subsets including evenly spaced SNP selected for APR  we found that selecting SNP only on their position reduced the relative accuracy between 5% and 17% depending on the size of the subset and the trait analysed (results not shown). Although ranking of SNP was based on the magnitude of the estimated SNP effects  SNP selected on their rank had a higher average minor allele frequency () than all SNP on the high-density assay. For example  subsets containing 300 evenly spaced SNP selected for ASI by PLSR had a mean  = 0.33 compared to  = 0.30 for SNP selected by RR and  = 0.27 for SNP selected on only their location. This suggests that selection of SNP should be based on their expected contributions to the genetic variance  which is a function of the allele frequency in the training set. This also implies that accuracy of prediction will be lower for a validation set where the distribution of allele frequencies does not resemble that of the training set and why prediction equations derived in one breed do not predict accurate DGV when applied to other breeds  as shown by Hayes et al. []. Arguably  the major advantage of a low cost SNP assay will be that training sets will become much larger  as relatively more animals are genotyped and hence accuracy of DGV will increase (e.g.[]). The current reference populations predominantly consist of elite progeny tested sires and to significantly increase the size of the training data will require the genotyping of cows. Genomic selection has become a routine in dairy cattle breeding programs worldwide. The current cost of whole-genome selection based on dense SNP genotypes has limited the application to the selection of elite males and females that are likely to become parents of the next generation. Results of our study indicate that accurate genomic evaluation of the broader bull and cow population can be achieved with genotyping assays containing ~ 3 000 to 5 000 SNP. A chip containing 3 000 evenly spaced markers can provide approximately 90% of the accuracy achieved with a high-density SNP assay for genomic selection of bulls and cows combined across traits. Possible applications include the selection of replacement heifers and the pre-screening of young bulls and potential bull dams. Assays with evenly spaced markers are preferable as they can be used across traits and possibly across populations. It also allows for a high volume generic chip to be produced  which will lower assay cost per individual and will limit heterogeneity of genomic information compared to using multiple assays for different traits. Evenly spaced low-density assays might also permit the reconstruction of the genotype information of high-density assays through imputation  which is important in situations where  for example  high-density genotyping is limited to nucleus breeding herds. Increasing the proportion of animals genotyped will further increase the accuracy of genomic selection as the training data grows over time  particularly through genotyping of cows.

The assembly demonstrated QTL with effects on carcass composition in homologous regions on OAR1  2  6 and 21. Sheep production is a major contributor to global food production and sheep are one of the few sources of meat with little cultural and religious restriction in consumption. Body composition traits in sheep  primarily muscle mass and fatness  are economically important to the sheep meat industry. There are numerous methods to predict body composition in sheep. Much of the variation that exists in sheep body composition is expressed as between- and within-breed differences. In order to understand the genetic architecture of these economically important traits it is essential to accurately define the phenotypes which describe carcass composition []. Live-weight is considered as a standard measurement of body mass  but is a poor indicator of body composition due to the inability to distinguish between different stages of physiological maturity. Body weight may be used as indicator of body composition in animals of similar genetic backgrounds and at the same physiological maturity  however  at different maturity stages the accuracy is greatly reduced [  ]. Improved predictions of carcass composition can be determined by using ultrasound. Such scans provide a basis to estimate breeding values for eye muscle area and subcutaneous fat depth [–]. Increased accuracy and prediction of full body carcass characteristics can be achieved using computed tomography (CT) [  ] but this is not routinely implemented due to cost constraints. In addition to the difficulties in obtaining accurate carcass measurements  generation intervals are large  time to assessment is long and therefore the response to selection is slow. Therefore  the use of marker assisted selection or MAS is seen as an attractive aid to increase the efficiency of selection for these traits expensive to measure. Linkage studies indicate the presence of one or a few major genes for increased muscling and fatness in different sheep populations [–]. Two full and 12 partial genome scans have reported QTL for carcass composition including bone density on chromosomes 1-6  8  18  20  21  and 24 in populations of Coopworth  Scottish Blackface  British Texel  Charollais  Suffolk  Texel and different cross-breed sheep populations [  –]. At present two DNA tests (LoinMax and MyoMax;  []) are commercially available  which test for genetic variants in the Carwell and Myostatin genes [        –]. This study uses CT imaging to accurately determine body composition  in relation to body weight at two different stages of maturity. For the first time  a full genome scan was conducted to identify genomic regions associated with CT-derived parameters in an ovine backcross resource population. A resource population from crosses between fat-tail Awassi (A) and small-framed Merino (M) sheep was established. Further details of the development of the resource population can be found in Raadsma et al. [  ]. In the QTL study reported here  only phenotypic and genotypic information from the second generation male backcross (AMM) progeny from one of four F sires was analysed in full. The backcross progeny were weighed approximately bi-monthly until 83 weeks of age. Weights were recorded as non-fasted body weights immediately off pasture on the same day. At 83 weeks of age  male animals were randomly allocated to two management cohorts. Cohort 1 ( = 86) was lot fed for 90 days after which time all animals were CT scanned prior to slaughter at two years of age. Cohort 2 ( = 79) were grazed under paddock conditions for a further 18 months and then lot fed for 90 days followed by CT scanning and slaughter at 3.5 years of age. Both cohorts were fed  on a grain and lucerne pelleted ratio with a metabolisable energy content of 12.1 MJ/kg during the feedlot period. The two cohorts were created to capture the differences in fat deposition due to changes in maturity. At the end of the  phase and three days prior slaughter  CT scanning was used to estimate lean  fat and bone quantities for individual sheep. Animals were fasted overnight  body weights were recorded and animals were scanned using a Hitachi CT-W400 scanner located in the Meat Science Group at the University of New England  Armidale. Animals were restrained in the supine position using three adjustable belts over the abdomen  chest and neck during the scans at 120 kV tube voltages and 150 mA current. Cross-section images were collected every 40 mm starting proximal to the  (rear knee joint) and finishing at the first cervical vertebra. Between 24 and 28 images were collected from each animal depending on their length. The carcass weight was estimated from the CT images. Three sets of data (images) were derived from each image by cropping restraining equipment  internal organs and hooves  distal portion of leg  internal fat and kidney  using AUTOCAT []. These images provided an estimate of total body composition including hooves  internal organs and abdominal fat (first set)  internal fat - comprising kidney  pelvic  mesenteric and heart fat (second set minus third set) and typical carcass components including total lean  carcass lean and total amount of bone (third set). Furthermore AUTOCAT was used to calculate the area  mean pixel value and variance of each tissue group for each animal from the three sets of images. Subcutaneous fat depth was measured over the eye muscle at the first lumbar two thirds ventral to the vertebrae. The area of fat surrounding the eye muscle () was termed the subcutaneous fat area. The eye muscle area was estimated by averaging the area of muscle at the closest image to the first lumbar and the next caudal image. Percentages of lean  fat and bone were calculated as a percentage of the carcass weight estimated by CT (i.e. the sum of individual components estimated by CT). A list of all traits used in this study is provided in Table . A linear model was fitted using SAS (version 9.2) to adjust the scanning results for final body weight and cohort. For some of the traits  a scatter plot of the trait versus final body weight revealed a linear association for the first cohort but a nonlinear association for the second cohort. To allow for this nonlinearity  a quadratic term was included for the second cohort only. The full model allowing for this takes the form where Trait is the measurement to be adjusted for  Cohort2 is a 0-1 indicator variable taking the value 1 for the second cohort  FBW is the final body weight of the sheep  and e is the random error. Non-significant terms from the above model were dropped  with quadratic terms retained for all traits except dressing percentage  carcass bone  percentage fat in carcass  percentage lean in carcass. Carcass weight and final body weight were adjusted only for cohort effects (Additional file ). Residuals from the fitted models were obtained  and these were treated as the adjusted traits for subsequent QTL mapping. A genome scan using 189 polymorphic microsatellite markers covering all 26 sheep autosomes was conducted in 510 backcross animals. For the linkage analysis  genotypic and phenotypic information from the CT scan of 165 animals was used. The procedure of DNA extraction  genotyping  allele calling and map positions has been outlined previously []. QTL analyses were performed for all traits using two methods. Based on a type I error of 0.05  the design ( = 160 animals) had a predicted power of 0.88 to detect QTL with 0.5 SD effect []. Solutions were obtained using the QTL-MLE procedure for normally distributed traits in 'R' []. As described in previous papers [  ]  when using QTL-MLE  a QTL with LOD = 3.0 was deemed highly significant  significant if LOD = 2.0  and suggestive for QTL with 1.75 = LOD < 2.0. The second method involved regression analysis for a half-sib design implemented using the web-based program QTL Express []. QTL with chromosome-wide significance ( < 0.05) were described as suggestive QTL  whereas QTL exceeding the  < 0.01 chromosome-wide levels and  < 0.05 experiment-wide levels were labelled as significant and highly significant QTL  respectively. A two-QTL model was also fitted to the data using a full two-dimensional scan of each chromosome in QTL Express []. A meta-assembly of QTL identified in this study was conducted by collating all known QTL from public sources for matched traits based on individual QTL locations and meta-scores as described previously []. The positions and confidence intervals of ovine and bovine QTL and blocks of conserved synteny across both species were identified and aligned to the genomes of both species. The individual QTL locations and their scores  and meta-score profiles can be browsed at . In addition to the lactation traits  QTL profiles for growth  body weight and carcass composition can now be browsed on this website. Growth and body weight meta-scores from the first paper of this series [] were also loaded into the website. The carcass composition traits were summarised into four trait classes: bone (percentage bone  bone weight  bone yield)  fat (fat yield  back fat  fat depth  marbling  fat thickness  subcutaneous fat thickness)  muscle (longissimus muscle area  rib eye area  carcass yield  retail product yield  shear force  lean meat yield) and weight (hot and cold carcass weight  yearling  weaning and slaughter weight). Single and aggregated bars  heat maps and plots can be selected for sheep and cattle as well as meta-scores for both species. Hyperlinks to the original manuscript reference are given. The summary statistics for each phenotype are shown in Table . For the second cohort  carcass weight and predicted carcass weight from the scan were highly correlated ( = 0.90   < 0.01) and both traits were also highly correlated with final body weight ( = 0.92 and 0.89  for both cohorts respectively   < 0.01) (Additional file ). Across both cohorts  the average body weight at scanning was 51 kg  with an average carcass weight of 28 kg (dressing percentage 55%). Animals from cohort 2 were significantly ( < 0.01) heavier  with a higher mass of total bone  fat and lean compared to cohort 1. However  they had a significantly ( < 0.01) lower percentage bone in the carcass (Additional file ). Within tissue groups  lean  fat (except internal fat and subcutaneous fat depth) and bone parameters were significantly correlated ( = 0.27 to 0.81  all  < 0.01) (Additional file ). Significant correlations ( < 0.05) were also detected between many traits among fat and lean tissue groups  with the highest correlation between percentage lean and fat ( = -0.97   < 0.01). No significant correlations were detected between carcass bone  total bone and eye muscle area and most of the other traits (Additional file ). In total  three highly significant (LOD = 3.0)  15 significant (LOD = 2.0) and 12 suggestive (1.7 < LOD < 2.0) QTL were detected on chromosomes 1 to 3  6  7  9-11  14  16 and 23 across the 13 traits using QTL-MLE. A summary of the suggestive and significant QTL positions  effect sizes  and 1-LOD support intervals is shown in Table . The genome-wide LOD score profiles for all traits are shown in Figures      and . With the exception of one suggestive QTL on chromosome 6  all QTL detected by QTL-MLE were confirmed by the QTL regression analysis of QTL Express. A total of five highly significant (experiment-wide  < 0.05)  six significant (chromosome-wide  < 0.01) and 34 suggestive (chromosome-wide  < 0.05) QTL were identified on chromosomes 1-3  6  7  9  10  11  14  16  19  23 and 26 using QTL Express (Additional file ). Among these  two significant (chromosome-wide  < 0.01) and 16 suggestive (chromosome-wide  < 0.05) QTL on chromosomes 6  8-14  16  23 and 26 were not detected using QTL-MLE. Confidence intervals and 1-LOD support intervals for QTL locations extended across a large proportion of each of the chromosomes (Table   additional file ). . . . . Common QTL for body and carcass weight were identified on chromosomes 2  6 and 11 using both QTL analysis methods  in addition to the QTL for body weight on chromosome 16 and for dressing percentage on chromosome 14. For muscle traits  eight QTL were detected on seven chromosomes  for fat traits ten QTL on seven chromosomes and for bone traits only two QTL. There were no QTL which solely contributed to traits related to a single tissue i.e. QTL just for muscle  fat or bone. For chromosomes 1  6  10  14  16 and 23  the QTL for different tissue groups acted pleiotropically  with the same QTL describing traits for different tissue groups. Among the six QTL identified on chromosome 6  two were for weight and three for fat parameters  although the peak positions of the QTL for these two traits groups differed. Similarly  the QTL regions for final body weight  percent lean and subcutaneous fat area were all on chromosome 16  but the peak positions varied. The effect sizes of the QTL ranged from 0.73 to 0.99 SD (Table ) and accounted for 3.8 to 9.4% of the phenotypic variance (Additional file ). Three of the QTL identified here were deemed cryptic QTL  with an effect opposite to what was expected based on breed of origin. The two-QTL model implemented in QTL Express showed four pairs of QTL which were separated by at least one marker; carcass lean (OAR1)  percent bone (OAR1)  percent fat (OAR18) and internal fat (OAR19). QTL for carcass lean on chromosome 1 were in coupling phase  whereas all other QTL pairs were in repulsion phase. The QTL in repulsion phase were not identified using the single QTL model since the opposite sign of the QTL effects may have prevented detection under the single QTL model. Details describing QTL positions and effect sizes  and comparisons with single and no QTL models are in Table . Published QTL reports for carcass traits in sheep  comprising four genome-wide linkage studies [  –] and 13 partial genome scans [    –  –] were used for the meta-assembly. QTL for a wide range of carcass traits  including traits not measured in our study (muscle growth  muscle depth  and meat colour)  were reported on chromosomes 1-6  8  11  18  20  21  23  24 and 26 in various sheep populations [    –  –    ]. For two of the studies  the locations of the QTL were not given [  ]. No QTL were reported on chromosomes 7  9  10  12-17  19  22  and 25  but these results might be biased due to partial genome scans  favouring chromosomes with known QTL or candidate genes. The meta-scores showed consistency on six regions of interest across multiple studies for fat  muscle and weight traits  specifically for fat on OAR2 (BTA2) and OAR6 (BTA6)  for muscle QTL on OAR2 (BTA2) and for weight on OAR1 (BTA1)  6 (BTA6) and 21 (BTA29) (Figure ). . The results of the ovine and bovine meta-assembly are shown as a comparative meta-score plot against the ovine genome in Figure  and are visualised on the ovine genome browser . The very broad range of traits describing carcass and body composition in cattle resulted in QTL being reported on all chromosomes. Furthermore  in contrast to studies in sheep  the majority of studies in cattle reviewed here refer to genome-wide genome scans ( = 14) [–]. In addition  eight partial genome scans or candidate gene analyses in cattle were included here [–]. This study is interesting in that it is the fourth full genome scan for mapping QTL in sheep with respect to carcass traits  and the first where carcass traits were determined from data derived by CT scan which can provide highly accurate profiles of tissue distribution. CT scanning was first developed for medical applications and has been extended to animal applications since the 1980s  firstly in pigs and subsequently in sheep []. Experiments in sheep and lambs showed that the correlation between CT measures of carcass composition and those derived from manual dissection is very high  but CT or virtual dissection is more precise and reliable []. Our study confirmed the high correlation between carcass weight and estimates of carcass weight from scanning []. Compared to ultrasound  the standard errors of the predicted values are lower [  ]. Vester-Christensen et al. [] and Young et al. [] have proposed that CT scanning should be an essential reference tool for body and carcass composition. The use of the more precise phenotypes derived from CT measures will also lead to better phenotypes for genetic analysis. Heritabilities for CT-derived traits have been found to be moderate to high [    ]. Theoretical predictions of the genetic progress by incorporating CT traits into selection indices suggest increases in response by 50% or even 100% when combining different measurement methods []. The sheep in our study were managed as two cohorts. These cohorts differed significantly in carcass weight and stage of maturity and were considerably heavier than animals in studies published previously []. Animals investigated here were taken to a greater stage of maturity to measure specific effects on fat and fat distribution. Sheep from cohort 1 had similar muscle/carcass lean weights compared to meat sheep [] and Norwegian lambs []. However  for both these studies  the proportion of muscle was higher than in our study  largely due to differences in fatness and stage of development (age  maturity). For the same reasons  the proportion of bone in the carcass was lower in our study than in studies presented by Young et al. [] and Kongsro et al. []. The main focus of our project was the study of fat characteristics in the carcass. Therefore  older and consequently more mature sheep were used. Adjusting body composition traits for body weight at the time of scanning was considered the best method to accurately measure tissue groups independently of their body mass. Animals from the second cohort had higher fat content and total percent fat compared to animals from cohort 1. There were significant correlations between the major tissue groups (lean  fat and bone). Fat traits tended to be significantly and negatively correlated with lean traits  as reported by Lambe et al. []. Without adjusting for body weight  the correlations would have been strongly positive [  ]  as was also the case here (results not shown). The importance of adjustment for body weight is that properties of body tissue can be investigated free from the effects of body mass. The differences in stage of maturity resulted in different adjustments for body weight  namely a linear effect for cohort 1 and a curvilinear effect for cohort 2  suggesting a plateau of growth had been reached and animals were in the mature fattening phase of development. Genome-wise error rates were controlled by adjustment of -values through the use of a chromosome- and experiment-wide permutation test in the case of QTL Express  therefore the number of false positive QTL was assumed to be minimal. For the maximum-likelihood analysis we chose thresholds for a LOD statistic which was deemed to be conservative at LOD of 2 ( ˜ 0.01) and LOD of 3 ( ˜ 0.001). The close agreement between the number of QTL detected in each method suggests that the likelihood of random false positives is expected to be small. For body and carcass weight  QTL were identified on chromosomes 2  6  11 and 16. The QTL on chromosomes 6 and 11 were consistent with those reported in the same study population at earlier time points []. The QTL for final and carcass weight on chromosome 2 was the only one that corresponded to a QTL for live weight in Scottish Blackface and Suffolk  Texel sheep [  ]. A total of eight QTL across seven chromosomal regions were identified for muscle. QTL on chromosomes 1 and 6 were consistent with other studies in Suffolk and Texel populations [    ]  whereas QTL on chromosomes 7  9  10  16 and 23 can be considered novel. QTL for fat have previously been reported on OAR 1-4  18 and 20 in different sheep populations [          ]. Within the confidence interval of our QTL  we confirmed QTL on chromosome 1 and 3  and novel QTL were identified on OAR 6  10  14  16 and 23. QTL for fatness have consistently been reported on chromosomes 2  3 and 18 [    ]  but the QTL on OAR18 was only identified using the two-QTL model and no QTL on OAR2 was detected in the current study despite the emphasis on fat traits. Few reports are available for bone-related traits in sheep  and no QTL study on bone yield in the carcass has been reported. Previous QTL studies have analysed bone density and cross sectional area in Scottish Blackface and Coopworth sheep [    ]. The two QTL detected here for bone yield suggest that the QTL landscape is rather featureless for this trait. In summary  the first interesting discovery of this paper was the identification of novel QTL with small to moderate effects on body composition and body weight on chromosomes 1  6  7  9  10  14  16 and 23. This may in part be due to an increase in accuracy of phenotyping using CT image analysis. A notable finding of this study was that there were no QTL which exclusively affected multiple measures of the same tissue group  i.e. fat  lean or bone. The effect of measuring fat at individual or a limited number of sites was discussed by Thompson []  who proposed that individual depots may not reflect total body fat in the animal. This is seen in the correlations of non-unity between traits indicative of fatness at different sites (Table ). This suggests that different measures of the same tissue reflect different traits with different QTL. This may have implications for QTL detection and application. For instance  QTL used to reduce subcutaneous fat content may not necessarily result in a reduction of total carcass fat. Despite many QTL reports and a significant association on chromosome 18  we could not confirm the effects of the important loci such as the Carwell and Callipyge genes with known effects on muscle lean in sheep [    ]. These and other genes on the same chromosomal region are known to be imprinted with paternally expressed protein-coding genes  as well as several maternally expressed non-coding RNA genes []  which may have prevented their detection in our study  which used only one paternal half-sib family. Single-marker association analyses revealed significant associations for markers close these genes (results not shown) but this requires more detailed analysis. In future studies  the use of multi-sire families and linkage disequilibrium among maternal alleles should focus on the identification of these imprinting effects. We considered an interdependency of QTL for body weight on OAR11 and 16. These chromosomes contain the growth hormone (GH) and growth hormone receptor (GHR) genes  with known effects on body weight and carcass composition across species [–]. Even though we identified QTL for final body weight on both chromosomes  we could not detect an interaction between these two QTL and assume that the genes underlying these two QTL act in a simple additive fashion. Although we examined the likely importance of two QTL for all traits and report on five cases with significant support for QTL pairs  the interpretation of the results warrant caution  especially where the QTL are closely located or no corresponding QTL were detected under the single QTL model. A meta-assembly of QTL identified for carcass traits was conducted by collating all known ovine QTL from public sources for matched traits  as previously described []. Additionally  studies in cattle were summarised using the same methodology. A summary of the carcass meta-scores from cattle and sheep that is incorporated into the ovine genome browser  is shown in Figure . Furthermore  due to the lack of studies based on CT-derived phenotypes  and the different methods  models  and population types used across studies  we considered them to be the same carcass trait if they described the same carcass characteristic. Despite the large number of QTL detected in cattle  relatively few QTL in sheep were found in comparative locations. However  for some traits  especially for muscle and fat  loci were mapped to homologous regions; these QTL may possibly describe the same gene. Among the 11 studies summarised using the meta-assembly in cattle  four reported QTL for body weight on chromosome 14 [      ]  but no QTL was found in sheep in the homologous position. The highest ovine meta-scores for body weight were derived for chromosomes 1 [    ]  6 [] and 21 [  ]. QTL were reported for body weight in cattle on the homologous chromosomes 1 [    ]  6 [    ] and 29 [    ]. Amongst the six ovine and 13 bovine QTL studies reporting linkage regions for muscle related traits  we found one region in common between sheep and cattle  namely OAR2 and BTA2 for carcass weight  eye muscle area and retail product yield [    –      ] (Figure ). High meta-scores for fat QTL were derived for sheep and cattle on homologous chromosomes OAR2/BTA2 and OAR6/BTA6 [              ]. However  no QTL for fat traits were identified in sheep  which align to bovine chromosome 14  where the highest meta-score was calculated for corresponding traits in cattle [        ]. No homologous regions were found between sheep and cattle for bone traits. This is likely due to the limited number of studies conducted and QTL reported for these traits in either species. This is the first study using CT-derived carcass measures for a full-genome scan in sheep. To our knowledge this is the only study with a focus on carcass fat characteristics in mature sheep. We present evidence for a significant number of new QTL for muscle  fat and bone traits in sheep. We also confirm and support the presence of previously published QTL in breeds other than those studied here. Finally  homology in QTL regions between sheep and cattle for muscle  bone  fat and body weight was demonstrated.

This dynamic led to higher long-term gain while mitigating losses in short-term gain. Weighted GS also increased the maintenance of marker polymorphism  ensuring that QTL-marker linkage disequilibrium was higher than in unweighted GS. Losing favorable alleles that are in weak linkage disequilibrium with markers is perhaps inevitable when using GS. Placing additional weight on low-frequency favorable alleles  however  may reduce the rate of loss of such alleles to below that of phenotypic selection. Applying such weights at the beginning of GS implementation is important. Simulation studies and some empirical studies of \"genomic selection\" (GS) [] or \"genome-wide selection\" [] show that prediction accuracies from GS are high enough to enable rapid gains from selection [–]. These studies focus  however  on what would be the first one or two cycles of selection. Thus  while we may have confidence that GS can accelerate short-term gain  no such confidence is justified for long-term gain. Ideally  experimental tests of long-term gain should be performed empirically in model systems but the necessary replicated tests would be expensive and  even in rapid-cycling organisms  would not be completed in a near future. Stochastic simulation remains perhaps the only viable option to test hypotheses concerning the impact of selection methods on long-term gain []. Beyond the first cycles of selection  mechanisms the effects of which are difficult to predict analytically begin to operate. Among others  marker and QTL alleles will recombine  and their frequencies will shift  changing linkage disequilibrium (LD) between them and therefore the predictive ability of the markers. Inbreeding and loss of polymorphism will also occur. In a simulation looking at several generations  Muir [] has shown that the accuracy of genomic prediction declines much more rapidly if used for selection than if followed by random mating. This result and the putative mechanisms outlined suggest that a careful look at long-term selection using GS is needed to identify mechanisms having an important impact on its performance and to give research directions to improve GS. There is also a practical need since both crop and animal breeding programs are now initiating GS. Therefore  insight into the long-term consequences of GS deployment would be beneficial. Considering the constraints of breeding cycles over several generations also brings into focus practical aspects of GS that have a bearing on its potential for success. In particular  Heffner et al. [] have proposed that GS separates the breeding process into two cycles: the selection cycle and a model training cycle. They have proposed that these two cycles operate synchronously  although this is not necessarily the case. The model training cycle is much more constrained than the selection cycle because it requires adequate phenotyping. Thus  regardless of the species  it appears likely that the frequency of model updating will be lower than that of selection cycles. This limitation raises the questions of how accurate GS can be in selection cycles when it has not been updated  and to what extent long-term selection will be adversely affected. Another constraint for GS is the necessity of assembling the initial training population (TP) for the model. In simulations using population-wide LD  rather large TP have been used i.e. 500 to 2000 individuals [    ]. In GS on bi-parental cross populations  much smaller populations have been effective [  ]  though these populations have never been proposed for long-term selection. Therefore the question arises of the effectiveness of GS if cost prohibits assembling a large TP and GS is initiated on the basis of a small TP. Finally  different GS prediction models have been proposed the impacts of which may differ on the short and long terms. In simulations of generations immediately after the TP  models that assume all marker effects are distributed with equal variance (i.e. ridge regression)  have been found to be as or more accurate than models that assume some markers do not explain any variance (e.g. BayesB) []. However  the accuracy of the former decays more rapidly over generations than that of the latter []. How this dynamic may affect the performance of these models over long-term selection is unknown. To explore the questions of long-term success of GS  impact of initial training population size  timing of additions of new phenotypes to the training population  and on GS analysis method  long-term selection for a quantitative trait using GS was simulated. Gains from GS were compared to those of phenotypic selection (PS). Genomic selection was performed on lines with or without phenotypes  and assuming cases where phenotyping (and therefore model updating) could occur every or only every other selection cycle. Gains using an initial TP of 1000 vs. 200 individuals were compared. Ridge regression was contrasted to a Bayesian model for GS prediction  and marker effects weighted by a function of favorable allele frequencies were compared to unweighted effects. Finally  to understand the mechanisms leading to GS success or failure  population variables were analyzed including the maintained genetic variance  realized accuracies  LD and distance between QTL and markers remaining polymorphic  inbreeding over generations and the fixation of QTL and marker alleles. To perform selection simulations on marker data that incorporate the real short- and long-range LD structure existing in a barley breeding program  empirical genotypes from 192 inbred lines from the University of Minnesota six-row spring barley breeding program (genotyped in the first two years of the Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project) were used. These marker data may be obtained at . Missing marker data were imputed using methods described by Jannink et al. [] on the basis of the SNP genetic map given by Close et al. []. Markers were considered redundant if they had the same map position and identical alleles across all lines. Only one of a set of redundant markers was retained. This procedure left 983 polymorphic markers among the Minnesota lines. Some sets of markers mapped to the same position  most likely because of insufficient resolution of bi-parental maps rather than because of actual identical positions []. Markers in such sets were distributed at 0.1 cM intervals and in arbitrary order. The resulting map spanned 1 092 cM. An additive genetic model was imposed on these marker data by randomly picking 100 markers to become causal QTL. These markers were removed from the dataset for GS analyses. The genetic variance generated by each QTL was made equal by scaling the QTL substitution effect to the inverse of the standard deviation of the QTL allelic state (+1 for one and -1 for the other allele). Thus  QTL with low minor allele frequencies (MAF) had larger substitution effects than QTL with high MAF. This constraint of equal variance across QTL was chosen to maximize the effective QTL number [] while minimizing the number of markers that had be dropped from the analysis. Empirical genomic selection results suggest that many traits are more polygenic than what was simulated previously []. One QTL allele was arbitrarily chosen to have a positive  and the other a negative effect. The genotypic value of an individual was calculated by summing effects of the QTL alleles it carried. The phenotype of an individual was determined by adding its genotypic value to a normally distributed error  with variance calculated as follows. The genotypic variance of the base population was calculated and an error variance determined so that the initial trait heritability was either 0.2 or 0.5. Error variance was held constant through a simulation irrespective of changes in the genetic variance  such that heritability changed over the course of generations of selection. For all simulated breeding methods  each cycle of breeding consisted of three steps: (1) crossing of selected parents and inbred progeny generation  (2) phenotyping and (3) data analysis and selection criterion estimation. For all methods  step 1 was the same: out of 200 candidates  the 20 with the highest selection criterion were randomly mated to produce 200 F progeny. Inbred selection candidates were generated as doubled haploids (DH) from the F generation. Random mating is not a realistic assumption for breeding but it provides a simple baseline model to interpret results. While inbreeding is not needed for genomic selection  it is needed in crop breeding for phenotypic evaluation. For simplicity  inbreeding was performed prior to selection for all schemes. Each DH was formed from a haploid gamete simulated using the Mendelian laws of segregation  with recombination occurring according to the known map positions of the barley markers []  assuming no crossover interference. For all methods  the base population was formed by randomly mating the 192 founders to generate 200 DH candidates that were phenotyped  as described above. For GS with a \"small\" TP  this base population served as the TP. For GS with a \"large\" TP  an additional 800 individuals were generated and phenotyped in the same way. While these individuals provided information to the GS model  they were not selection candidates. Thus  the training population size factor was not confounded with a change in selection intensity. Phenotypic selection and three GS breeding schemes were simulated. Time was somewhat arbitrarily broken up into \"seasons\" with PS requiring two seasons  one for crossing and inbred candidate generation  and one for phenotypic evaluation and selection (Figure ). In the first GS scheme  all candidates were phenotyped and genotyped so that the model had both sources of information available. This \"genomic and phenotypic selection\" (GPS) scheme followed the time schedule of PS (Figure ). In the two GS schemes  selection occurred solely on marker data immediately after  and in the same season as  inbreeding (Figure ). In the \"phenotype every season\" GS scheme  candidates were then phenotyped in the following season to supplement the TP. In the \"phenotype every other season\" GS scheme  it was assumed that only odd-numbered seasons allowed phenotyping in the target environment (Figure ). Therefore  only selection candidates from even-numbered seasons had to be phenotyped to supplement the TP. To ensure that all GS methods involved the same amount of phenotyping  only 50% of \"phenotype every season\" candidates were phenotyped (since phenotyping occurred in twice as many seasons). The 50% chosen for phenotyping were those that had the highest selection criterion of their cohort. Thus the parents selected to perpetuate the breeding cycle were always phenotyped. . Under phenotypic selection  one season is used for crossing and inbreeding and the next for evaluation and selection; under GS  selection can be performed prior to evaluation so that selection occurs every season rather than every other season; for \"every season phenotyping \" the evaluation is assumed to represent the target environment in any season; for \"every other season phenotyping \" only odd-numbered seasons represent the target environment and even-numbered seasons are greenhouse or off-season nurseries; for all methods  the black cycle (C0) is phenotyped; for GS  this cycle contributes to the training population (TP)  as indicated by the colored line under the word \"Select\" in Season 1; in Season 2  candidates of the blue cycle (C1) are produced  and selection is possible under GS  but using the same TP as for Season 1 (insufficient time for new phenotyping has elapsed); in Season 3  candidates of the green cycle (C2) are produced  evaluation of C1 candidates occurs and can contribute to the TP used to select C2 candidates; similar events occur in Season 4 except that for every other season phenotyping  evaluations are not performed because they would not be representative of the target environment Two prediction models were used  ridge regression i.e. RR [  ] and \"BayesC\" (RL Fernando  personal communication  June 2009). Both RR and BayesC use the linear model where is the phenotype of individual   is the allelic state at marker  in individual   is the effect associated with marker   is a 1 or 0 indicator variable for the inclusion or exclusion of marker  in the estimation of breeding values  and is a residual. In RR  = 1 and  for all markers. The marker variance    is estimated by maximum likelihood. BayesC implements two changes relative to BayesB developed by []. As in BayesB  in BayesC  = 0 with probability   but  itself is estimated assuming a uniform prior distribution between 0 and 1. In addition  BayesC assumes that the prior variance for the effects of all markers for which = 1 is equal. That is  the effect is zero when = 0 or  when = 1. In turn  the method estimates  jointly over all non-zero markers []. Grouping markers in this way gives the data added weight over the prior in estimating  []. Details of the estimation of  are in Kizilkaya et al. []. The model provides an estimate of marker effects as where  is the number of Markov chain iterations and and are the values for those parameters in iteration . Here  1500 iterations were run  with the first 500 discarded as burn-in. Using these models  genomic prediction in a given breeding cycle was performed by analyzing the marker states of all individuals with phenotypes to estimate marker effects. These effects were then applied to the genotypes of selection candidates to predict their breeding values: Finally  a weighted GS model was used  following Goddard [] and clarified in Hayes et al. [] so that markers for which the favorable allele had a low frequency should be weighted more heavily to avoid losing such alleles. For weighted GS  the estimation procedure was as described above. Then  for each marker   the frequency of the favorable allele among selection candidates    was calculated. The selection criterion was Using  as a weight for locus  is a simplification with the following justification. Using Goddard's optimization []  assuming sufficient long-term selection to fix all favorable alleles  the selection criterion should be: This criterion includes only the sign (positive or negative) of the locus effect  because it is assumed that the favorable allele should be fixed regardless of the magnitude of its effect.  is closely proportional to  over a range of allele frequencies. In addition  an estimate of the allelic effect was included in the criterion to reduce the importance of small-effect loci for which it could not be determined with any certainty which allele was favorable. In summary  48 different GS schemes were tested: a factorial of two heritabilities (0.2 or 0.5)  two initial TP sizes (200 or 1000)  three breeding schemes (with phenotyping prior to selection  phenotyping after selection every season  or every other season)  two prediction models (RR or BayesC)  and unweighted or weighted allele effects. In addition  simple phenotypic mass selection was simulated at heritabilities of 0.2 or 0.5. All settings were replicated 100 times. Replications differed in the base population of 200 individuals generated by randomly mating the 192 founder lines and in the 100 markers chosen to be QTL and removed from the marker dataset. Twenty seasons were simulated. For phenotypic selection (PS) and genomic and phenotypic selection (GPS) schemes  ten breeding cycles could be accomplished  while for the two GS cycles  19 could be accomplished (one in the first two seasons and then one per season for the remaining 18 seasons). All simulations were performed in R  version 2.10 []. For each simulation  gains from selection were standardized by dividing by the maximal genotypic value possible for the genetic model. Therefore for all replications  genotypic values are expressed on a -1 to +1 scale. Besides the mean genotypic values of selected populations  other tracked variables were additive genetic standard deviations  rates of inbreeding calculated on the basis of pedigree (<U+0394>F; in a pedigree with DHs  the standard tabular method for calculating coancestries can be used  save that all diagonal elements are set to one)  Bulmer effects (calculated as the ratio of the additive genetic standard deviation to the expected additive genetic standard deviation under linkage equilibrium between QTL)  and the realized accuracies in each generation of selection  which was calculated as where G(t) is the mean genotypic value in generation   () is the additive genetic standard deviation in generation   and 1.755 is the mean of the upper 10% tail of a standard normal distribution []. Several variables were tracked to examine mechanisms causing the observed responses: the number of favorable QTL alleles lost or fixed  the mean across polymorphic QTL of each QTL's LD with that marker with which it was in highest LD (LD was calculated here as the correlation between QTL and marker)  the mean across polymorphic QTL of each QTL's recombination frequency with the closest polymorphic marker  and the ratio between the rate of inbreeding calculated on the basis of markers (<U+0394>F) and <U+0394>F. The rate of inbreeding on the basis of markers was calculated as the proportion of markers polymorphic in generation  - 1 that were fixed in generation . Analysis of variance was performed on cumulative gain from selection after four seasons (two PS or GPS and three GS cycles  Figure ) and after twenty seasons (ten PS or GPS and 19 GS cycles). Because 100 replications of each setting were performed  the power to identify \"significant\" interactions among simulation factors was very high. Therefore only interactions for which the mean square was at least one tenth that of the mean square for replications are discussed. Under the simulated conditions  differences in both initial and final gain from GS using RR versus BayesC were extremely small  though BayesC tended to generate higher initial gains and lower final gains than RR (data not shown). Under GS  the difference between phenotyping half of the selection candidates every season versus all candidates every other season were minimal. Because these two factors (GS prediction method and every vs. every other season phenotyping) had effects that were small relative to between-replication variation  the discussion hereafter will focus on simulations using RR and phenotyping all candidates every other season. Looking first at unweighted GS (UGS; left-hand graphs of Figure )  several points are apparent. First  performing selection every season (i.e.  by selecting prior to phenotypic evaluation) always increased initial gain relative to waiting for evaluation results (i.e.  using PS or GPS with selection only every other season). Second  phenotyping prior to selection increased long-term gain: after 20 seasons  rate of gain from PS and GPS was higher than that from GS. In fact  regardless of a high or low heritability  small or large TP  after about 12 cycles  GS reached a plateau beyond which gains were minimal (Figure ). At a high heritability  genotypic information used by GPS hardly improved gain over PS. Besides  greater initial gains were obtained under a high than a low heritability for GS  leading to a significant GS vs. GPS by heritability interaction. Finally  having a large TP increased gain both for GS and GPS  but more so for the former  again leading to a significant interaction. Weighted GS (WGS; right-hand graphs of Figure ) increased final gain from selection. Less apparent but no less important  weighting hardly changed initial gain  showing little tradeoff between long- and short-term gains. Weighting was more important in the absence of phenotyping prior to selection: it improved GS gains more than GPS gains. Weighting also produced greater gains with the large than with the small TP. Finally  weighting increased gains more at a high heritability than at a low one. . Phenotypic selection (PS  closed symbols  continuous lines)  genomic selection with phenotyping prior to selection (GPS  closed symbols  dashed lines)  and genomic selection (GS  open symbols  dashed lines)  using ridge regression to estimate genomic breeding values. Weighted and unweighted methods were used for GS and GPS  on the right- and left-hand graphs  respectively; small and large training populations were of 200 and 1000 individuals  on the upper and lower graphs  respectively; triangles: h = 0.5; Circles: h = 0.2; to avoid cluttered graphs  simulations with h = 0.2 were offset to the right by four seasons; note that PS curves are identical across the four graphs; maximum standard errors observed were less than half the height of plot symbols so no error bars are given From these results  two observations bear further scrutiny. First  why did gains from selection reach a plateau so early under UGS  regardless of TP size and heritability? Loss of genetic variance and/or loss of LD between markers and QTL could be responsible. Second  what mechanisms contributed most to the performance of WGS? Here  QTL and/or marker polymorphism could be important. The most immediate cause of the plateau reached by UGS is the loss of genetic variance in UGS populations (Figure ). This loss was more pronounced for the small than for the large initial TP but in either case was much stronger for UGS than for WGS. Increased weight on rare favorable marker alleles led to more rapid gains in the frequency of rare favorable QTL alleles with which only those markers could be in high LD. That impact on the QTL then strongly increased genetic standard deviation in the first cycles (Figure ). The proportional increase in gain explains why little short-term gain from selection was lost under WGS (Figure ). The loss of variance came primarily from inbreeding (Figure ). The per cycle rate of inbreeding from UGS was generally higher than that of PS  while that of WGS was similar (Figure ). More importantly  GS went through twice as many cycles as PS  so that the per season rate of inbreeding was much higher. Two other observations on inbreeding rates bear note. First  in seasons when the prediction model was updated (odd-numbered seasons  Figure )  <U+0394>F is consistently lower than in seasons when the model is not updated  leading to the zigzag pattern in <U+0394>F over selection cycles (Figure ). This zigzag pattern is counter-cyclical to that observed in the realized accuracies (Figure ) in the sense that when realized accuracy is up  <U+0394>F is down  and vice-versa. Second  for both WGS and UGS  there is a trend upward in <U+0394>F over time. This trend also corresponds to a general downward trend in realized accuracies (Figure ). Estimates of the Bulmer effect were noisier (Figure ). A zigzag pattern was also present: the Bulmer effect was stronger in the generation after model updating  that is  after realized accuracy was the strongest. For both UGS and WGS  the Bulmer effect diminished (leading to ratios closer to 1) when genetic variance diminished. Despite lower accuracies for GS than PS (Figure )  the Bulmer effect appeared stronger for the former than the latter. .

This decay began for UGS after about the eighth season and then strongly accelerated after that (Figure ). In contrast  for WGS  the decay in QTL - marker LD did not start until several seasons later and remained mild. Decay might arise because markers close to QTL become fixed such that the distance between the nearest polymorphic marker to a polymorphic QTL increases  and recombination more rapidly reduces accuracy. That mechanism indeed occurred (Figure )  again  much more strongly for UGS than WGS. Figure  also shows that marker fixation per season is more rapid under GS (both weighted and unweighted) than under PS: because GS selects on markers  it is more likely to cause markers to go to fixation than PS. Mechanistically  however  it is instructive to look at the rate of marker fixation relative to the rate of inbreeding. Figure  contrasts the proportion of polymorphic markers becoming fixed in each generation to the rate of inbreeding based on pedigree. Phenotypic selection provides an expectation for how much marker fixation to expect for a given increase in coancestry. Marker fixation occurs more rapidly than increase in identity by descent because a marker can become \"fixed\" when all its alleles are identical in state  which may occur before they are all identical by descent. Thus the equilibrium of the ratio of the rate of marker fixation to the rate of inbreeding is greater than one. In the case simulated here  that equilibrium for PS was about 1.7. For UGS  marker fixation clearly occurred more rapidly than might be expected on the basis of increasing coancestry (Figure ). In contrast  for WGS  marker fixation appeared to occur more slowly than expected on the basis of coancestry  at least in the later seasons. Thus  WGS might keep markers \"in play\" by selecting more strongly on low frequency alleles if they are associated with favorable QTL alleles. The bottom line of selection is to avoid the loss of favorable alleles  so that they may ultimately become fixed. A large loss in the number of favorable QTL alleles occurred in the first generation (Figure )  but that loss was smaller for WGS than for either UGS or PS. In the two subsequent seasons  per-season loss of favorable alleles was higher for both UGS and WGS than for PS. Thereafter  that higher rate of loss continued for UGS but slowed for WGS such that the rate of loss was lower for WGS than PS. Before discussing results in detail  we should consider aspects of the simulation that lack realism and the impact those aspects might have on results. One strength of the marker data used here is that they reproduce levels of LD and a structure that occur within a real breeding program. However  true QTL were unobserved and simulating them using marker data is likely unrealistic for several reasons. First  this approach forces the QTL to be bi-allelic. Evidence is lacking in inbred crops with a small effective population size (N) but in maize  an outcrosser with a large global N  a recent study has shown that multi-allelic QTL are the norm []. It seems probable that multi-allelic QTL would be in lower LD than bi-allelic QTL with bi-allelic markers. Lower LD would in turn reduce the performance of GS relative to PS  though it is unclear how it would affect the relative performances of different GS schemes. Second  the approach means that the QTL have the same allele frequency spectrum as the markers  and the same distribution over the genome. Again  these limitations mean that the simulated QTL are probably in higher LD with the markers than the true QTL would be  with the same consequence of favoring GS over PS  but not obviously one GS scheme over another. The present simulations were conducted without regard to the fact that the base population for any real GS will have been under phenotypic selection for some time. By virtue of the Bulmer effect  such selection will generate repulsion-phase linkage disequilibria between QTL  reducing the genetic variance and increasing the difficulty of QTL detection. Furthermore  no mutation model was applied to the simulations  and results relate strictly to standing variation at the start of selection. Phenotypic selection benefits from mutational variation (reviewed in [])  but it is not clear how GS might  considering that new mutant effects will not immediately be present in the training population. Finally  on a simple note  the breeding schemes used here assumed that GS reduced breeding cycle times only by half. In practice  for crops [  ] and livestock [] the reduction is likely to be much greater than that  favoring GS over PS more than predicted here. Given so many caveats  the value of these simulations is clearly not to accurately predict relative responses of different breeding schemes over long-term selection but to ask whether GS can work over the long-term  to raise hypotheses relative to its success or failure  and to point to possible solutions to be tested empirically. In those regards  the stochastic simulations provide three primary observations and a number of insights into the mechanisms causing them. The observations are: 1) by selecting prior to phenotyping  GS allows a more rapid initial gain than is possible under PS or GPS; 2) while these gains are occurring  UGS is also rapidly losing favorable QTL alleles such that UGS reaches a selection plateau early on; 3) long-term gain can be increased  with little sacrifice on short-term gain  by selecting on a criterion that weights more heavily favorable marker alleles at low frequency. There is nothing surprising about observation 1. This result has been anticipated since the invention of GS [] and has been the cause of much excitement since GS became practically feasible [  ]. The second observation is more problematic and had not been anticipated by deterministic simulations of GS []. Habier et al. [] have shown that GS captures not just marker - QTL associations but also genetic relationships via marker information [see also [] and []]. Thus  GS is prone to the selection of close relatives that occurs in standard animal-model BLUP []. The theory has predicted that GS should reduce rates of inbreeding compared to selection on breeding value BLUP []. This claim is not disputed here  since no simulation of BLUP selection was performed. The theory is based on the extent to which the selection criterion is able to predict the Mendelian sampling term (i.e.  within-family effects). In the absence of phenotyping prior to selection  animal model BLUP estimation provides no prediction of the term whereas GS does. In fact  as the GS model becomes more accurate  it can better predict the term  its reliance on genetic relationship information decreases  and inbreeding under GS decreases. Confirmation of that dynamic is apparent in the opposing trends of Figures  and : when the model has just been updated with newly-measured phenotypes  it is more accurate (Figure ) and the rate of inbreeding is decreased (Figure ); conversely  during selection in off-seasons without model updating  the rate of inbreeding is increased. Likewise  but over a period of many seasons  as the accuracy of GS gradually decreases  the rate of inbreeding under GS gradually increases. The opposite effect would be expected under phenotypic selection: as genetic variance is depleted and heritability declines  PS accuracy would decline and selection would become random. In that case  the rate of inbreeding should converge toward 0.05 per generation  as would be expected under random-mating with 20 gametes (or completely inbred diploids) selected in each generation. There is  nevertheless  disagreement between the present finding of increasing rate of inbreeding under GS with decreasing GS accuracy and the prediction from selection index theory that rate of inbreeding should be insensitive to accuracy []. Presumably  this disagreement has to do with the use of genetic relationship information by GS that is not accounted for by the theory. But the meaning of \"use of genetic relationship information\" is not particularly clear. This mechanism may occur: allele effect estimates used in GS are influenced by the regression of family means on within-family allele frequency. These estimates would contribute to accuracy by improving predictions of family means  but would contribute nothing to the estimation of Mendelian sampling terms. Thus they increase between-family but not within-family variance of predictions. Finally  as the overall accuracy of GS decreases  the importance of this family-mean prediction component increases  and with it the correlation between GS predictions for relatives. When applying index selection theory to GS  however  the analysis assumes that the variance of the GS prediction is split equally between within- and between-family effects  regardless of accuracy. The fact that a very simple weighting scheme can greatly increase long-term gain with little loss in short-term gain is probably the most exciting observation made here. Goddard [] have proposed and Hayes et al. [] have clarified differentially weighting markers to increase weight on favorable low-frequency alleles. All other things equal  UGS should be more accurate than WGS. This higher accuracy can be seen in the very first selection cycle  because initial conditions are the same for all methods (Figure ). Rapidly thereafter  however  WGS catches up because strong selection on low frequency favorable alleles boosts genetic variance (Figure )  leading to proportional increases in gain. This observation causes concern as to the generality of the benefit of the weighting scheme across different genetic models. In the model used here  each QTL generated equal variance so allele substitution effects were inversely related to the square root of the variance of QTL allelic states. In other words  QTL with low minor allele frequencies had large allele substitution effects. This genetic model may not be unrealistic for a population under stabilizing selection []. For a population under directional selection  deleterious alleles with large substitution effects would be expected to be at low frequencies. In addition  breeders should be most concerned with capturing new favorable mutations when they are at a low frequency []. But clearly  this genetic model is also ideal for the weighting scheme outlined here: low frequency marker alleles that are heavily weighted will more often be associated with large substitution QTL that will generate large gain. To test the impact of the genetic model  the simulations shown in Figure  were also run using a genetic model where the QTL allele substitution effect was sampled at random (ignoring QTL allele frequency) from a standard normal distribution. Under the random model  the weighting scheme was still beneficial over the long term  increasing final gain by 10% to 15% (14% average) over UGS  depending on heritability  TP size  and phenotyping scheme. In comparison  under the original equal-variances model  the range of improvement was 14% to 28% (22% average). In other respects  the progression of genetic gain was remarkably similar across genetic models (Additional file   Figure S1). Thus  the advantage of WGS observed does not depend on an inverse relationship between QTL allele frequency and effect size  though its robustness to other aspects of the genetic model is still subject to research. Finally  to further diminish the small loss of initial gain under WGS relative to UGS  it would be possible to choose one set of lines for potential variety release using UGS while selecting a different set to become parents of the next generation of progeny candidates using WGS [  ]. In some sense  UGS reflects the current genetic value of a line while WGS reflects its potential for long-term contribution to the breeding program. The mechanism of WGS is manifest in three other ways. First  the rate of inbreeding on the basis of pedigree was lower for WGS than UGS (Figure ). This lower rate of inbreeding was not caused by a greater accuracy of WGS than UGS: for about the first half of the seasons simulated  WGS had a lower accuracy than UGS. It is difficult to see why weighting low-frequency favorable alleles would differentially affect the between-family versus within-family variances of the predictor. Rather  the higher genetic variance present under WGS than under UGS would simply lead to more accurate allele effect estimates generally  which would in turn affect those variances. Second  WGS fixes markers more slowly than UGS (Figure ). Consequently  markers close to QTL remain polymorphic for much longer in WGS than in UGS (Figure )  and WGS retains markers in higher LD with the QTL than does UGS (Figure ). This causal sequence presumably also plays a role in lifting the accuracy of WGS above that of UGS in the second half of the seasons simulated (Figure ). Naturally  the greater genetic variance generated and preserved by WGS than UGS would increase the heritability of observations in the TP  also improving model accuracy. Third  and perhaps most importantly  WGS loses fewer favorable alleles than UGS (Figure ). The rare marker alleles that WGS weights more heavily are in higher LD with rare QTL alleles than other markers. The risk of losing the QTL alleles is therefore indirectly reduced by this weighting. Note that these reasonings concerning WGS assume a simple situation with one marker in LD with one QTL. In reality  the effect of a QTL may be absorbed by several markers in partial LD with it. Nevertheless  those markers are likely to have similar allele frequencies as the QTL such that the essential mechanism remains valid. What occurs initially upon adoption of GS should matter most to current plant and animal breeders  because that is what is happening in breeding programs now. Even assuming optimistic breeding cycle times  the long-term predictions presented here are about 20 years away  at which point breeding technologies will no doubt have changed dramatically. But even in the first cycles  the benefits of a large TP and of WGS are evident in the form of the reduction of favorable alleles lost from the breeding population (Figure ). Some of these alleles will inevitably be lost because they are in low LD with any marker. Indeed  Figure  shows a slight increase in the mean QTL-marker LD after the first generation of selection. That increase is due to the fact that some low-frequency  low LD alleles are lost immediately and they therefore no longer enter the mean. Retaining those alleles would be difficult and would likely cause unwarranted losses of selection gain. Nevertheless  it appears that WGS goes some way in the right direction  and further research on its optimization is warranted. In general  loss of genetic diversity will rise in tandem with the greater number of selection cycles made possible by GS  suggesting that methods that balance selection gain with the maintenance of diversity [] should be a priority.

With the increasing resolution at which genomes can be examined has come the recognition that variation in genome structure is common and affects more nucleotides per genome than the sequence variation found in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) [–]. Copy number variation (CNV) in DNA  defined as insertions  deletions and duplications larger than 1 kb  is an important component of this structural variation. Recent publications document the contribution of CNV to genetic diversity in humans [  –] and human disease [–]. CNV has been shown to contribute to phenotype in model organisms [–] and to important production and disease traits in domesticated livestock species [–]. Current technologies to assay a CNV genotype (genome copy number) and its corresponding alleles have limitations [  ]. Distinguishing among genomes that have multiple DNA copies (> 4-5 copies) is imprecise while SNP that might 'tag' copy number alleles through linkage disequilibrium are usually only found for relatively simple diallelic CNV [        ]. Typically  assays attempt to quantify the total number of copies in diploid DNA and cannot discriminate between  for example  an individual homozygous for a two-copy allele and a heterozygous individual carrying one- and three-copy alleles. In many cases  this is not an important limitation as copy number alleles have additive dosage effects  but in other cases it is important  for example when only one copy number allele is associated with disease. To resolve individual alleles  data on related individuals can be analyzed concurrently. Pedigree information applies Mendelian constraints to the allowable sets of copy number alleles in related individuals. These constraints have been exploited using Bayesian graphical models [] to infer copy number alleles  and hidden Markov model based methods [  ] to find  CNV and infer copy number alleles. The Mendelian constraints underlying analyses such as those noted above have been well studied in the area of segregation analysis. Originally the term \"segregation analysis\" referred to the determination of the mode of inheritance of a phenotype but in recent decades it has come to include the inference of genotypic probabilities in pedigreed populations. The peeling algorithm of Elston and Stewart [] is applicable in both cases. In small pedigrees  and in those without inbreeding loops  this algorithm produces unbiased estimates of allelic probabilities. A number of approaches have been described that are computationally feasible for larger pedigrees with inbreeding loops  including iterative peeling [  ]  cutting loops [] and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [  ]. MCMC methods remain an active area of research (e.g. []). The data required for single locus segregation analysis are four-fold: 1) a pedigree relating individuals to each other; 2) phenotypes on some individuals in the population; 3) a penetrance function expressing the probabilities of phenotype based on genotype; and 4) estimates of the frequencies of the genotype alleles in the population. Probabilities of mutation can also be incorporated. Assays that return estimates of the number of copies in diploid DNA can be thought of as a phenotypic measurement  and if assumptions are made about the distribution of the variation around the expected value of the assay then it is relatively straightforward to derive the appropriate penetrance function. Software to perform computations for segregation analysis is available and may include options to estimate penetrance functions as well as to estimate allelic probabilities (e.g. []). In this paper  we demonstrate that segregation analysis is an old solution to a new problem  by applying a segregation analysis method to simulated data to explore the inference of copy number alleles at the Agouti locus in sheep. The recessive self-colour black condition in domestic sheep has been studied for many years  with allele   responsible for white fleece  known to be dominant to allele [  ]  responsible for the dark fibre colour. It has been confirmed that the association is due to variation in the agouti region [] and recently Norris and Whan [] have shown that a tandem gene duplication/deletion is responsible. Allele is a number of different alleles  having two or more copies of a 190 kb DNA segment including the agouti signalling protein (ASIP) coding region  while allele has a single copy of the region with a non-functional ASIP promoter. Furthermore  Norris and Whan [] have described an asymmetric competitive PCR copy number assay for the number of copies in diploid DNA. We will use   ... to refer to alleles with one copy  two copies and so on  with allele being equivalent to our allele and allele being replaced by our alleles (    ...). In this study  we demonstrate that segregation analysis methods are well suited to the inference of copy number alleles  and that if knowledge on the actual allele configurations is sufficiently important then the utility of a quantitative assay can be greatly improved through the incorporation of relationship data. On small datasets  our methods can be implemented in readily available software such as Mendel []  accounting for the uncertainty in the individual assay results through the penetrance function. With minor modifications  existing software for large datasets could also be used. While we restrict our analyses to half-sib families  our approach is general and could be applied to any data set with both pedigree and quantitative copy number assay components. The characteristics of the assay are reported in Norris and Whan []. In an asymmetric competitive PCR assay  DNA amplified from the junctions between copies is compared to the DNA amplified from the junctions and from the 5' breakpoint region. For diploid DNA with a copy number count   the expected value of the assay is the ratio   as there are  - 2 junctions and two copies of the 5' breakpoint. As diploid DNA has at least two copies (at least one on each chromosome) this ratio takes values from the series (0/2  1/3  2/4  3/5 ...) which asymptotically approaches unity. It is important to note that since the assay is quantitative  variation occurs around the expected ratios. The magnitude of the variation can differ among laboratories  and even among batches of samples in one laboratory  so we have treated it as unknown and conducted analyses for a range of values. As a lower limit  we chose a CV of 3% (which equates to a standard deviation of 0.01 for the class with an expected ratio of 1/3). This figure is a little smaller than that derived empirically from ranking 111 assay samples and estimating the mean and standard deviation for the 35 samples that were extremely unlikely to be from a class other than that with an expected ratio of 1/3  the most easily distinguished class. The CV of 3% was used as the lower limit since it is achievable with real data  but we also conducted analyses assuming CV values of 6% and 9%. The expected ratios and standard deviations considered are summarized in Table . From the expected ratios and standard deviations  and assuming a distribution for the variation around the expected value  the probability of each copy number count can be estimated for each observed assay value. We assumed a normal distribution and estimated copy number count probabilities for a population of 87 phenotypically white Merino ewes coming from commercial sale yards. These are summarized in Table . To estimate the allele frequencies that produced this distribution of copy number counts we minimized the X statistic obtained by comparing the vector of copy number count frequencies with the frequencies expected given a vector of frequencies for alleles segregating in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Black Merino sheep in wool flocks are commonly culled soon after birth and thus are never presented in a commercial sale yard  so to avoid ascertainment bias we excluded the /class when calculating the X statistic. Table  contains the estimated allele frequencies. For black sheep  the genotype is known to be /with certainty and conversely  for sheep with genotype /the phenotype is known to be black wool with certainty. The assay is not relevant for these animals. For white sheep  the penetrance function relates to the assay rather than to the phenotype. That is  the penetrance function is the probability of returning a particular assay value given the genotype. Again under the assumption of normality  this is proportional to the height of the normal distribution relevant to the underlying genotype. Table  contains an example of the mapping of an assay ratio of 0.675 onto a grid representing the penetrance function for an individual  using standard deviations for a CV of 3%. As the stud Merino sheep industry is likely to use a test for the genotype at the Agouti locus  small  highly selected and relatively closed flocks were simulated. In each replicate  10 studs were simulated  each mating five rams to 200 ewes each year. Selection was on a trait uncorrelated to Agouti  except for the last generation when no homozygous /animal was selected. In the absence of evidence to the contrary  we assumed that the genotype at the Agouti locus had no effect on fitness other than through artificial selection. The simulation was run for 20 years. In the founder populations  allele frequencies at the Agouti locus were as in Table . There was limited exchange of genetics between studs  with one outside ram and four home-bred rams used by each stud each year. The intention behind this relatively complicated structure was to simulate populations in which cohorts of ewes were related  with variations in the frequencies of the various Agouti alleles between studs. Parents and progeny of the last generation were assumed to be available for assay. Using the known simulated copy number count  an assay value was simulated using the means and standard deviations described above. The whole simulation was repeated 20 times  producing 1 000 half-sib families (20 replicates × 10 studs × 5 rams) for analysis. The distributions of allele frequencies in the final generations of the simulated populations are displayed in Table . In our simulation study  we performed the assay on half-sib groups of animals and their parents  ignoring relationships between parents. This is equivalent to \"cutting\" inbreeding loops in a relatively naive but systematic way  rather than the more sophisticated approaches such as in []. We chose this simple approach for a number of reasons  but primarily because we performed many analyses on replicated datasets and therefore needed a fast execution time. However  we believe that the design is justified. In commercial and stud sheep flocks  large half-sib families are usual and although deeper pedigree data is usually available (especially on the male side)  it may not be without errors. In half-sib families  most of the power in the method comes from the confidence with which the sire's genotype can be estimated  which then adds confidence to estimates for progeny. Genotype probabilities were estimated using a restricted implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm []  restricted in that it operated only on half-sib families. This restriction allowed a very fast execution time enabling the investigation of a wide range of scenarios. The software was validated by comparing the estimated probabilities for test half-sib families to probabilities estimated using the software package Mendel []. The allele frequencies assumed for the parents are those shown in Table   that is  in the analysis we used the frequencies that were used in the simulation. Each dataset was evaluated six times  with one of the three formulas for the standard deviation of the assay (CV = 3%  6%  9%) used to simulate the assay values  and either the correct CV or one half of the correct CV used for the analysis. From the final generation of the simulated populations  families of 1  2  4  8  16 or 32 half-sib progeny were chosen. Assay results were made available for either progeny only  progeny and sire  or progeny  sire and dams. Genotype probabilities were estimated and compared to the simulated copy number alleles. Table  contains the results for a lamb analyzed without pedigree data. This is not quite the same as relying on assay results alone to estimate the genotype  as population allele frequencies are still used in the analysis. Without these there is no power at all to declare an animal non-carrier. In all cases  when a lamb was declared to be a carrier with greater than 95% certainty it had the genotype /and in all cases when a lamb had the genotype /it was declared to be a carrier with over 99.9% certainty. The effect of jointly analyzing half-sib families of varying size is displayed in Table . The analyses correspond to a situation where the sire and his half-sib progeny are assayed  and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the assay output is 3%. The most important application of a test in an industrial genetic improvement program is the identification of sheep that are non-carriers. We found that with a family size of one  only 46% of non-carriers were identified as non-carriers with a 99% probability. However  this value is almost twice that achieved without genotyping the sire  as in Table . Increasing the family size improved the power  and with family sizes of 16  75% of non-carriers can be declared clear with a 99% probability. Increasing the family size beyond 16 has only a small effect on power  unless the goal is to achieve 99.9% probabilities of being clear. False positives (declaring non-carriers to be carriers) are absent and false negatives (declaring carriers to be non-carriers) are less frequent as family size increases. This is an important result since in industrial applications  this second form of error has a much greater adverse impact. The fact that we do not find proportions of type II errors in accordance with appropriate p-value threshold (for example  5% of type II errors in the case of a P > 0.95 threshold) is not unexpected  just as we do not expect to identify 95% of carriers with a 95% probability. Table  displays results obtained when exploring the effect of assaying progeny only  or progeny and the sire  or progeny  sire and dam. A family size of 16 half-sibs and a CV of 3% for the assay were used. Even if the sire is not assayed  in 62% of replicates a carrier sire is identified with greater than 99% probability. This improves when the sire is assayed  and if the dams are also assayed almost all the carrier sires are detected. The results are more or less symmetrical  in that the probabilities of declaring a non-carrier sire to be a non-carrier are similar to the probabilities of declaring a carrier sire to be a carrier. For the progeny  the power to detect carriers and non-carriers is lower than for sires and even lower for dams  and if the dam is not assayed there is no power at all to declare her a non-carrier. In Table   the effect of the precision of the assay is examined  for family sizes of 16 half-sibs assayed along with their sire. Considering first the situation where the CV used in the analysis is the same as the CV used in the simulation  and again focusing on non-carriers  increasing the CV of the assay decreases the power to declare non-carriers to be clear. This is particularly true if the goal is to achieve a less than 0.1% probability of being a carrier. When an underestimate of the CV is used in the analyses it is not unexpected that the power to declare non-carriers to be clear is improved. This is because reducing the CV reduces the proportion of individuals with ambiguous results  and as most individuals are non-carriers  in most cases overconfidence in the precision of the assay does not result in an error. However  for individuals that are carriers  underestimating the CV results in an increased probability of being declared clear by error. At the Agouti locus in sheep  colour phenotype is affected by a recessive  single copy allele  which cannot always be uniquely identified using the available assay. Furthermore  the assay has almost no power to determine that an animal is free of the undesirable single copy allele. Exploiting the family structures common in sheep flocks  across the scenarios examined  the joint analysis of half-sib families resulted in a modest increase in the power to declare individuals as carriers of the undesirable allele. More importantly in a selective breeding environment  including family data resulted in a large increase in the power to declare individuals as non-carriers of the allele. The improvement is dramatic: from 7% of non-carrier lambs being identified as clear at the 99.9% level when a lamb is assayed and analyzed alone (last row  Table )  to as many as 80% of non-carrier lambs being declared clear at the same threshold when the sire  dams and lambs for a half-sib family of 16 are assayed and analyzed together (4 last row  Table ). This is achieved at a cost of assaying 33 related individuals  and looks a better strategy than assaying 32 half-sib lambs and their sire but not their dams (last row  Table )  especially as ewes are generally used over a number of years and would not need to be re-assayed. Provided that the precision of the assay is not overestimated (i.e. the CV underestimated) in formulating the penetrance function  the joint analysis of half-sib families does not increase the proportion of false negatives. On the contrary  it reduces the proportion  from 7% at a 5% threshold for lambs analyzed alone  to as few as 1% if 16 half-sibs are analyzed together. As noted earlier  the assignment of a non-carrier status to carriers is most undesirable in industrial applications of the assay. A ram  sold as a non-carrier  that subsequently produces progeny exhibiting the self colour black condition  can adversely affect the reputation of the stud selling the ram  and the reputation of the assay. Furthermore  if the ram is used only in flocks that are clear of the allele  then the undesirable allele can become established in the ewe population. Thus it might take several generations before this is detected when another carrier ram is used. In this paper  we have focused on an example from livestock  the self colour black condition in sheep which means we have assumed large half-sib families and restricted ourselves to analyzing these in isolation. These analyses are very quick and the analysis of high-throughput quantitative CNV assay data for half-sib families would be feasible using this method. However  a half-sib family structure is not a requirement for a segregation analysis  and even for family sizes of one or two half-sibs with the sire being also assayed  power was increased to a higher value than when analyzing an individual alone. Readily available segregation analysis software makes optimal use of all pedigree links in estimating allele probabilities  and is suitable for copy number allele calling in human pedigrees and other pedigrees with smaller family sizes. In our simulation study  we assumed that parameters relating to penetrance function were known. Specifically  we assumed allele frequencies and parameters for a normal distribution for the error associated with the quantitative assay. These were estimated from a sample of unrelated sheep  but could be estimated from the population of interest. This aspect of segregation analysis was not applied in this study  but software such as Mendel [] can be used for this purpose. In our study  we also investigated an already known copy number variant  identified from an experimental population designed to uncover the cause of the recessive black condition in Merino sheep. In most cases an experimental population will not be available. Using segregation analysis to search for  CNV affecting quantitative traits would be similar to using hidden Markov model based approaches [  ]  but from a different statistical perspective. To apply segregation analysis software for general pedigrees to high-density genomic data would likely be computationally prohibitive but software such as that used here for half-sib families might be feasible. The precision of copy number allele estimates from quantitative assay data in pedigreed populations is greatly increased if the pedigree information is used in the estimation  and segregation analysis methods based on the peeling algorithm are well suited to this application. In the case of the Agouti locus and the recessive self-colour black condition  where the purpose of the test is to identify animals to use as parents  the proportion of lambs correctly identified (at the 99.9% level) as non-carriers increased from 7% when the lambs were analysed alone to 80% when the lambs were analysed in families. Any segregation analysis software can be used provided that the appropriate penetrance function is specified. Feuk L  Carson AR  Scherer SW: Structural variation in the human genome.

Four strategies of selection  carried out during five generations  were compared by simulation techniques.

In the second (GSA)  they were selected based on the prediction generated by the Bayes A method of whole-genome evaluation under an additive model.

These three scenarios used random mating to construct future generations  whereas in the fourth one (GSD + MA)  matings were optimized by simulated annealing. The advantage of GSD over GSA ranges from 9 to 14% of the expected response and  in addition  using mate allocation (GSD + MA) provides an additional response ranging from 6% to 22%. However  mate selection can improve the expected genetic response over random mating only in the first generation of selection. Furthermore  the efficiency of genomic selection is eroded after a few generations of selection  thus  a continued collection of phenotypic data and re-evaluation will be required."

In the second (GSA)  they were selected based on the prediction generated by the Bayes A method of whole-genome evaluation under an additive model. In the third (GSD)  the model was expanded to include dominance effects. These three scenarios used random mating to construct future generations  whereas in the fourth one (GSD + MA)  matings were optimized by simulated annealing. The advantage of GSD over GSA ranges from 9 to 14% of the expected response and  in addition  using mate allocation (GSD + MA) provides an additional response ranging from 6% to 22%. However  mate selection can improve the expected genetic response over random mating only in the first generation of selection. Furthermore  the efficiency of genomic selection is eroded after a few generations of selection  thus  a continued collection of phenotypic data and re-evaluation will be required. Estimation of non-additive genetic effects in animal breeding is important because ignoring these effects will produce less accurate estimates of breeding values and will have an effect on ranking breeding values. As a consequence  including these effects will produce a more accurate prediction and  therefore  more genetic response. This potential increase of genetic response is about 10% for traits with a low heritability  high proportion of dominance variance  low selection intensity and high percentage (>20%) of full-sibs []. However  dominance effects have rarely been included in genetic evaluations. The reasons  that can be argued  are the greater computational complexity and the inaccuracy in the estimation of variance components (it is commonly believed that 20 to 100 times more data are required including a high proportion of full-sibs []). It has also been claimed that there is little evidence of non-additive genetic variance in the literature (see for example []). However  although estimates are scarce  dominance variance usually amounts to about 10% of the phenotypic variance []. Furthermore  in an extensive review []  estimates of the ratio of additive to dominance variance have been reported in wild species i.e. about 1.17 for life-history traits  1.06 for physiological traits and 0.19 for morphological traits. In the same study  the estimate of this ratio for domestic species was 0.80. Moreover  mating plans (or mating allocations) have been used in animal breeding for several reasons: a) to control inbreeding; b) in situations where economic merit is not linear; c) when there is an intermediate optimum (or restricted traits); d) to increase connection among herds and  finally  e) to profit from dominance genetic effects. With respect to the last point  it is well known that every methodology pretending to use non-additive effects [–] must contemplate two types of mating: a) matings from which the population will be propagated; b) matings to obtain commercial animals. Among all the methodologies aimed at profiting from dominance  mating allocation could be the easiest option. Optimal mating allocation relies on the idea that although selection should be carried out on estimated additive breeding values  animals used for commercial production should be the product of planned mating which maximizes the overall (additive plus dominance effects) genetic merit of the offspring. Mating allocation profits from dominance when the commercial population is constructed  but for the next generation only additive effects are transmitted. Although not considered here  other ideas could be used to exploit dominance in later generations. The key idea is that selection should be applied not only to individuals and should be extended to mating. Although it is usually thought that application of the above ideas requires two separate lines as in the classical crossbreeding programmes or in the so-called reciprocal recurrent selection  it can be carried out in a single population [  ]. Furthermore  a 'super-breed' model can be implemented to exploit both across- and within-breed dominance variances []. With the recent availability of very dense SNP panels and the advent of genomic selection [] it seems natural that methods using dominance variation should be revisited. The aim of this study was to quantify the efficiency of mating allocation under a whole-genome evaluation scenario in terms of genetic response to selection in the first and subsequent generations. A population was simulated for 1000 generations at an effective size of 100. After 1000 generations  the actual size of the population increased up to 1000 (500 per sex) and remained at 1000 for three discrete and consecutive generations. During the whole process  all individuals were generated with one gamete from a random father and one from a random mother. Therefore the data set for the estimation of the marker effects consisted of the 3000 individuals from the last three generations. These 3000 (generation 1001  1002 and 1003) individuals were genotyped and phenotyped and then used as training population to estimate additive and dominance effects of SNP. The genome was assumed to consist of 10 chromosomes each 100 cM long and 1000 loci/chromosome (i.e. a total of 9000 SNP plus 1000 QTL) were located at random map positions. Both SNP and QTL were biallelic. Mutations were generated at a rate of 2.5 × 10 per locus per generation at the marker loci and at a rate of 2.5 × 10 at the QTL loci. These mutation rates  taken from [] are unrealistic but they seem to provide a reasonable level of segregation after only 1000 generations. Both the additive and the dominance effects were sampled from a standard normal distribution and scaled to obtain the desired values of h (V/V) and d (V/V) where V  V and V the additive  dominance and phenotypic variances as defined in  for example []. The simulation of additive and dominance effects was a bit simplistic because it is known that the distribution of additive effects is leptokurtic and the distribution of dominance effects is dependent on additive effects []. In generation 1  about half of the loci were fixed for allele 1 and the other half were fixed for allele 2. For simplicity  estimation of marker effects was carried out using a Bayes A method [] with two alternative models: The first model assumed that the phenotypic value of individual j (j = 1  ... N) is  where p is the number of SNP and x are indicator functions that take the values 1  0  -1 for the SNP genotypes AA  Aa and aa at each loci  respectively. The assumed distributions for each additive a component and residual component (e) were: The prior distribution of the variances was the scaled inverted chi-square distribution: where  is a scale parameter and  is the number of degrees of freedom. The values of  = 4.012 and  = 0.0020 were taken from []. The second model also assumed  in addition  that dominance effects were included for each SNP:  where w are indicator functions that take the values 0 1  0 for the SNP genotypes AA  Aa and aa  respectively. The assumed distributions for each dominance effect (d) was: The prior distribution of the variances of the dominance effects was the scaled inverted chi-square distribution where  is a scale parameter and  is the number of degrees of freedom. As before  the values of  = 4.012 and  = 0.0020 were assumed. Gibbs sampling based on posterior distributions conditional on other effects was implemented for estimation by averaging the samples from 10 000 cycles  after discarding the first 1 000. From the estimates of additive and dominance effects  breeding values (u) were calculated  according to []  for each individual in both models: where w is an indicator function of the genotype of the  marker of the  individual that takes the values 1  0  -1 when the genotypes are AA  Aa or aa  respectively. Moreover  p and q are the allelic frequencies (A or a) for the jth marker in the training population and a is the average effect of substitution for the jth marker calculated as = under model a) and = + (- ) under model b). The prediction of performance of future mating (G) between the  and  individual is performed by: where ()  () and () are the probabilities of the genotypes AA  Aa and aa for the combination of the  and  individual and the  marker. Generation 1004 was formed from 25 sires and 250 dams selected from generation 1003. Two strategies of selection  carried out during five generations  were compared. In the first strategy  25 males and 250 females were selected from 500 males and 500 females based on the prediction of breeding values from the estimation of markers effect under model a) and b)  denoted and GSA and GSD  respectively. Afterwards they were mated randomly (10 dams per sire) and four sibs were obtained from each mating; the true genotypic values of the offspring were calculated. In the second (GSD + MA)  from the 6250 (25 × 250) possible matings  we chose the best 250 based on the prediction of the mating (G)  and we generated four new individuals for each mating mate. The true genotypic values of the offspring were also calculated. The algorithm of searching used was the simulated annealing. Finally  phenotypic selection was also carried out as a control  and we replicated the selection strategies by considering the true QTL as markers and the simulated effects of the additive and dominance effects of the QTL as known. Fifty replicates of each method and strategy were performed. In generation 1003  around 8000 SNP markers and 65 QTL were segregating. The average linkage disequilibrium between adjacent polymorphisms was 0.1097. In addition  the linkage disequilibrium among the polymorphic loci (QTL and SNP) in generation 1003 measured as the square of the correlation (r) is represented in Figure  as a function of the map distance. Besides  we have also represented in Figure  the r values between QTL and SNP. Furthermore  the observed distribution of the number of SNP with different degrees of linkage disequilibrium with its nearest QTL is presented in Table . Thus  in generation 1003  an average of 1.39 SNP has an r greater than 0.5 with its nearest QTL. This fact indicates that there was enough LD with QTL for selection purposes based on SNP information. Finally  the r value among the QTL themselves attains the very low value of 0.0014. . The results of the first generation of selection are presented in Table  for all the studied situations: MS (mass selection)  GSA (genomic selection without dominance)  GSD (genomic selection with dominance)  and GSD + MA (genomic selection with dominance and mate allocation). Apart from the clear superiority of genomic selection over mass selection (MS)  introduction of dominance effects in the model of evaluation (GSD) results in a clear advantage over genomic selection with an additive model (GSA). The advantage ranges from 9 to 14% of the expected response (i.e. 0.527 vs. 0.471 for h = 0.20 and d = 0.05). These results of the expected response are confirmed with the results of the accuracy of breeding value prediction that are also presented in Table . In addition  the use of mate allocation (GSD + MA) provides an additional response ranging from 6% (h = 0.40  d = 0.05) to 22% (h = 0.20  d = 0.10). In general  the superiority of GSD + MA increases as the ratio of dominance variance increases and as the heritability decreases. Both advantages are similar to those reported when dominance is included in the classical polygenic model [  ]. Furthermore  it must be mentioned that the use of a model including dominance does not give worse results even when the true simulated model is purely additive. For just one generation  the selection responses with and without dominance in the evaluation model were 0.4724 vs. 0.4670 (h = 0.20) and 0.7832 vs. 0.7728 (h = 0.40)  respectively. Unfortunately  the results in subsequent generations are rather discouraging for both genomic selection and mating allocation procedures. Medium term genetic responses to selection for each case of simulation are presented in Figures  and . As observed  the advantage of GSD and GSD + MA over MS presented in the previous table disappears in subsequent generations although it must be noted that MS would require extra-cost and time to record the phenotypes of candidates to selection at each generation. . Mass selection (MS); Genomic selection (GSD); Genomic selection and optimal mate allocation (GSD + MA)  measured in phenotypic standard deviations . Mass selection (MS); Genomic selection (GSD); Genomic selection and optimal mate allocation (GSD + MA)  measured in phenotypic standard deviations In addition  it is notable that the increase of response due to GSD + MA over GSD is observed only in the first generation  the responses being similar from generation two to five. Thus  the advantage in terms of selection response obtained in the first generation is only maintained in the subsequent ones. However  a single generation of random mating eliminates this superiority  as shown in Figure   where two generations of accumulated response of the selected population are shown for four alternative selection strategies: a) GSD (1 generation) - GSD (2 generation)  b) GSD (1) - GSD+MA (2)  c) GSD + MA (1) - GSD (2) and d) GSD + MA (1) - GSD + MA (2). . Genomic selection (GSD) and Genomic selection and optimal mate allocation (GSD + MA). Mating allocation applied in one of the generations  in both or in any of them The loss of efficiency of GS after the first generation can be attributed to the reduction of genetic variance caused by the reduced population size of the selected population and by the increase of linkage disequilibrium among the QTL as a consequence of selection  the so-called Bulmer effect []. In fact  the LD among QTL increases from an r value of 0.0014 in generation 1003 to a value of 0.0032 in generation 1004. Furthermore  additional reduction of the expected response is explained by the loss of linkage disequilibrium between the SNP and the QTL due to recombination. In order to gain some insight in this loss of efficiency observed in Figures  and   we studied the response when GSD and GSD + MA are carried out after 0  1  2 and 3 previous generations with random mating and no selection in order to evaluate the consequences of reduction of linkage disequilibrium between SNP and QTL in a no selection scenario. The results are presented in Table . The observed selection response is eroded  but at much lower degree than in the cases where selection was carried out in previous generations. To illustrate this fact  we calculated the linkage disequilibrium between QTL and SNP markers in generation 1003 and in generation 1004 with and without selection. Figure  represents the relationship between the correlation (r) in generations 1003 and 1004  between every pair of QTL and SNP with r >0.10 in generation 1003 when selection was carried out. On the contrary  Figure  and  show the same relationship in cases where individual selection or no selection occurs between generations 1003 and 1004  respectively. The LD between QTL and SNP is more conserved when selection is not carried out and when selection is performed using only phenotypic records irrespective of the distance (results not shown). Thus  the efficiency of selection by SNP markers is reduced when a previous step of genomic selection is performed. . In addition  we compared the results of GSD in two other different scenarios. First  we assumed that the QTL genotypes were known and we used them as markers in a Bayes A algorithm (Scenario A) and  second  we assumed the true effects of the QTL known and used them (Scenario B)  the latter representing the maximum achievable response. Results are presented in Table . As in the previous simulations  the advantage of GSD + MA over GSD is only observed in the first generation  independently of the information used for mating prediction. If we examine the increase of response due to MA in the first generation  in Scenario A (QTL genotypes known) it ranges from 19% (h = 0.40 and d = 0.05) to 45% (h = 0.20 and d = 0.10) and in Scenario B (QTL genotypes and effects known) from 17% (h = 0.40 and d = 0.05) to 38% (h = 0.20 and d = 0.10). Although the percentage of increase over GSD is greater in Scenario A  the absolute value of extra response due to MA is bigger in Scenario B  as expected when maximum information is available. Success of MA is due to the possibility of predicting the genotype of future offspring and of estimating the additive and dominance effects. The first challenge is accomplished even in Scenario A  which shows a higher relative superiority than Scenario B. In addition  these extra genetic responses are greater than the ones shown in Table   when SNP genotypes are used to predict additive and dominance effects. Furthermore  a strong reduction in the genetic response is observed between the first and the second generations for every scenario. However  the response is maintained at a higher degree when QTL effects are known than when SNP or QTL effects are estimated. As expected  the scenario in which QTL genotypes are known but their effects need to be estimated  provides an intermediate response. Introduction of dominance effects in genetic evaluation is easier to achieve in the whole-genome evaluation scenario than in the classical polygenic model  where potential parental combinations have to be defined and evaluated. Introduction of dominance effects in models of whole-genome evaluation provides two main results. First  it increases the accuracy of prediction of breeding values and second  it makes it possible to obtain an extra response by the appropriate design of future matings using mate allocation techniques. Thus  mate allocation is recommended in the genetic management of populations under selection by whole-genome evaluation procedures  although the potential extra response is achieved only in the first generation and then maintained afterwards. Our results also show that in most scenarios of genomic selection a continued collection of phenotypic data and re-evaluation of the additive and dominance effects of markers will be required  because the ability of predicting breeding values is greatly reduced when selection is carried out.

Hitchhiking due to tight linkage with alleles at candidate genes  e.g. the  gene  is a possible explanation for this pattern. The potential impact of selective breeding by man on cattle populations is discussed in the context of selection effects. Our results also suggest that a practical approach to detect loci under selection is to simultaneously apply multiple neutrality tests based on different assumptions and estimations. Expectation of neutrality regarding the mutation-drift equilibrium for microsatellite variation is not always valid due to demographic changes  including genetic bottlenecks and admixture (e.g. [  ])  and selection at linked sites (e.g. [  ]). In contrast to demographic processes  which affect the entire genome  selection operates at specific sites associated with phenotypic traits  such as important quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and candidate genes. Selection leaves its signature in the chromosomal regions surrounding the sites  where significantly reduced or elevated levels of genetic variation can be maintained at linked neutral loci. Thus  selection not only affects the selected sites but also linked neutral loci and the footprints of selection acting on specific functional loci can be detected by genotyping polymorphic microsatellites in the adjacent non-coding regions []. Different statistical methods have been developed to identify outlier loci under the influence of selection [–] and adaptations have been attempted to improve the original methods of Lewontin and Krakauer []  which have been criticized because of their sensitivity to population structure and history (e.g. []). Nevertheless  recent studies have shown somewhat inconsistent results obtained by applying the above statistical tests to the same data (e.g. [      ]). The Lewontin- Krakauer test [] is the oldest of these multilocus-comparison methods. Broadly speaking  these methods are derived by using one of the two general approaches detailed below. The first approach is to develop methods with Lewontin and Krakauers' original idea and to use the distribution of estimates of genetic differentiation coefficient  and diversity parameters from individual genetic loci to detect the effects of selection  hereafter termed the -based approach  such as the FDIST program-based method []  Bayesian regression []  and population-specific [] methods. Schlötterer and colleagues have proposed alternative multilocus simulation-based tests that use summary statistics other than   such as the ln RV []  the ln RH []  and the ln R<U+03B8>' [] tests. These tests involve considering the idea of a 'selective sweep' that arises from natural and artificial selection  and recent genetic exchanges driven by the selective sweep leave a record or \"genetic signature\" in the genome covering the selected sites and their linked neutral loci. Given that microsatellite loci associated with a recent selective sweep differ from the remainder of the genome  they are expected to fall outside the distribution of neutral estimates of ln RV  ln RH or ln R<U+03B8>' values. As reviewed by [–]  all the methods have potential advantages and drawbacks  which can be due to different underlying assumptions regarding the demographic and mutational models on which they are based  as well as on uncertainty associated with the robustness of the approaches. The recent increased availability of large genomic data sets and the identification of a few genes or loci as the targets of domestication or subsequent genetic improvement in cattle have renewed the investigation of the genomic effects of selection. Candidate genes and QTL have been described on both BTA1 [–] and BTA 20 []. On BTA1  the  gene  characterized by two alleles:  (polled) dominant over  (horn)  is responsible for the polled (i.e. hornless) and horn phenotypes in cattle and has been subjected to both natural and artificial selection. Georges et al. [] have demonstrated genetic linkage between the  gene and two microsatellites   and . These loci are syntenic to the highly conserved gene for superoxide dismutase 1 (). In addition  in various breeds the  gene has been found to be linked to the microsatellites      and   located in the centromeric region of BTA1 close to the  locus [    ]. To date  on BTA20 several QTL and candidate genes have been reported e.g. growth hormone and prolactin receptor genes [] affecting conformation and milk production traits  such as body depth (e.g. [])  udder (e.g. [])  udder attachment (e.g. [])  milk yield (e.g. [])  fat percentage (e.g. [])  and especially protein content (e.g. [–]). In this study on   we present microsatellite data using a relatively larger number of loci than previously reported  which mainly included the 30 microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG)/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) working group (e.g. [  ]; but see also []). Among the 51 microsatellites genotyped on 10 representative cattle populations of different origins (native and modern commercial) and horn statuses (polled and horned) in the northern territory of the Eurasian subcontinent  seven were on BTA1 and 16 on BTA20. We applied four tests to detect molecular signatures of selection  ranging from tests for loci across populations and the recently proposed pairwise population tests using a dynamically adjusted number of linked microsatellites []. We compared the consistency of the different neutrality tests available to identify loci under selection in the north Eurasian cattle populations investigated here. Microsatellite data from 10 different cattle () populations including 366 individuals were analyzed. Finnish populations were represented by Finnish Ayrshire (modern commercial  horned   = 40)  Finnish Holstein-Friesian (modern commercial  horned   = 40)  Eastern Finncattle (native  mostly polled   = 31)  Western Finncattle (native  mostly polled   = 37)  and Northern Finncattle (native  mostly polled   = 26). We were able to inference the heterozygotic status at the  locus in 19 phenotypically polled cattle of the three Finnish native populations  on the basis of their offspring/parent phenotypes. In addition  there were 19 animals horned (recessive homozygotic) in the Finnish native populations. Istoben (native  horned   = 40)  Yakutian (native  horned   = 51)  and Kholmogory (native  horned   = 32) cattle were sampled in Russia. Ukrainian Grey (native  horned   = 30) and Danish Jersey (modern commercial  horned   = 39) were sampled in Ukraine and Denmark  respectively. During sample collection  the pedigree information and the herdsman's knowledge were used to ensure the animals were unrelated. Additional information on these populations has been reported in previous publications [  ]. Genotypes of the 51 microsatellites were used (for details on the microsatellites  see [–]) among which data of the 30 markers from the panel of loci recommended for genetic diversity studies in cattle  were taken from the literature []. The 23 microsatellites (21 new ones and two from the recommended panel) on BTA1 and BTA20 were chosen on the basis of their vicinity to genes and QTL  which could be considered as candidate loci for selection because of their assumed involvement in the polled/horned phenotype [] and in milk yield and body composition []. Details of the primers and microsatellite analysis protocols can be found in CaDBase  and []. In this study  GHRJA.UP  5'-GGTTCGTTATGGAGGCAATG-3'  and GHRJA.DN  5'-GTCACCGCTGGCAGTAGAT-3' primers were designed based on the sequence of the promoter region of the growth hormone receptor gene [] containing microsatellite GHRJA. Danish Jersey animals were analyzed only at 41 loci (see Table ). A full list of the loci studied and their chromosomal and genomic locations  as well as population and basic statistics  are available in Table . Microsatellite variability  expected heterozygosity ()  allelic richness ()  and Weir and Cockerham's []  were estimated with the FSTAT program  version 2.9.3.2 []. The ' metric used to estimate the LD was calculated using Multiallelic Interallelic Disequilibrium Analysis Software (MIDAS; []). Values of ' were calculated for all syntenic marker pairs on BTA1 and BTA20 across the populations. A more detailed description of the estimation of ' can be found in []. The statistical significance of the observed association between pairs of alleles under the null hypothesis of random allelic assortment was tested using a Monte-Carlo approximation of Fisher's exact test as implemented in the software ARLEQUIN [] using a Markov chain extension to Fisher's exact test for  ×  contingency tables []. A total of 100 000 alternative tables were explored with the Markov chain and probabilities were typically estimated with a standard error of < 0.001. Estimation of the ' metric for LD and tests for their significance were conducted only in three Finnish native breeds  i.e. Northern Finncattle  Eastern Finncattle and Western Finncattle. The graphic summary of the significance of LD determinations was displayed using the HaploView program  version 4.0 []. Fisher's exact tests in the GENEPOP v 4.0 [] were applied to assess LD determinations between all locus pairs across the sample. Possible departures from the standard neutral model of molecular evolution - potentially revealing demographic events or the existence of selective effects at certain loci - were examined for each locus using the Ewens-Watterson test [  ] and the Beaumont and Nichols's modified frequentist method []  as well as a more robust Bayesian test []. The Ewens-Watterson test of neutrality was performed with the ARLEQUIN program [] assuming an infinite allele mutation model. To obtain sufficient precision with this test  the probability was recorded as the mean of 20 independent repeats of 1 000 simulations. The frequentist method used was that proposed by []  further developed by []  and implemented in the FDIST2 program   a currently distributed version of the original FDIST program as described by []. FDIST2 calculates   Weir & Cockerham's [] estimator of diversity for each locus in the sample. Coalescent simulations are then performed to generate data sets with a distribution of  centered on the empirical estimates. Then  the quantiles of the simulated  within which the observed 's fell and the -values for each locus were determined. Initially an island model of population differentiation was used and the procedure repeated 50 000 times to generate 95% confidence intervals for neutral differentiation and to estimate -values for departure of the loci from these expectations. Simulation parameters were under an infinite allele mutation model for 100 demes  10 sample populations  sample sizes of 100  and a weighted  similar to the trimmed mean  calculated from the empirical distribution. Computed by removing the 30% highest and lowest  values observed in the empirical data set  the trimmed mean  is an estimate of the average \"neutral\"  value uninfluenced by outlier loci (see []). This method provides evidence for selection by looking for outliers with higher/lower observed  -values  controlling for -values []. The approach is fairly robust regarding variation in mutation rate between loci  sample size  and whether populations are at equilibrium or not []. Beaumont & Balding's [] hierarchical-Bayesian method was performed using the BAYESFST program  package  which generates 2 000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulated loci on the basis of the distribution of  given the data. The method combines information over loci and populations in order to simultaneously estimate  at the  locus and the  population  (  )  for all  loci and  populations. A hierarchical model is implemented for (  ) as where a  ß and <U+03B3> are locus  population and locus-by-population parameters  respectively []. In this study  the interpretations of the potential outliers are based on the locus effect (). Outliers from our data set were identified on the basis of the distribution following []. Rather than a fixed  as assumed in the above frequentist method of []  this BAYESFST test uses more information from the raw data and does not assume the same  for each population [  ]. To test for additional evidence of selection  we used the combination of statistics lnRH  lnRV and lnR<U+03B8>' in the population pairwise comparisons. The principle behind these tests is that variability at a neutral microsatellite locus is given by <U+03B8> = 4   where  is the effective population size and  is the mutation rate. A locus linked to a beneficial mutation will have a smaller effective population size and consequently a reduction in variability below neutral expectations. The relative variance in variability  lnR<U+03B8>  can be assessed instead by estimating the relative variance in repeat number  lnRV  or heterozygosity  lnRH  for loci between populations. The lnRV was calculated using the equation lnRV = ln (/) where  and  are the variance in repeat number for population 1 and population 2  respectively []. The lnRH test is based on the calculation of the logarithm of the ratio of  for each locus for a pair of populations as follows where  denotes expected heterozygosity (see equation  in []). In addition  we attempted to calculate ln R<U+03B8> by estimating <U+03B8> directly using a coalescence-based Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation approach employing the MSVAR program []. The tests have been shown to be relatively insensitive to mutation rate  deviation from the stepwise mutation model  demographic history of population and sample size []. As suggested by []  to detect the most recent and strong selective sweeps  the combination of lnRH and lnRV statistics is as powerful as lnRV alone  but using both statistics together lowers the rate of false positives by a factor of 3 because the variance in repeat number and the heterozygosity of a population measure different aspects of the variation at a locus. Thus  combinations of any two of the three tests were implemented here and significance of lnRH  lnRV and lnR<U+03B8>' for each comparison was calculated according to standard methods [    ]. These statistics are generally normally distributed  and simulations have confirmed that outliers (e.g. more than 1.96/2.58 standard deviations from the mean for 95%/99% confidence intervals  respectively) are likely to be caused by selection []. The tests were implemented for every pairwise comparison involving native populations from different trait categories (Eastern Finncattle  Western Finncattle and Northern Finncattle vs. Yakutian  Istoben  Kholmogory and Ukrianian Grey)  i.e. 12 population pairs for the horn (polled/horned) trait. The coalescence simulation approach using the DetSel 1.0 program [] was used to detect outlier loci within the Finnish native populations (Eastern Finncattle  Western Finncattle and Northern Finncattle). It has the advantage of being able to take into account a wide range of potential parameters simultaneously and giving results that are robust regarding the starting assumptions. For each pair of populations (  )  and for all loci  we calculated  and  ( and  are the population-specific divergence; for details see [  ]) and generated the expected joint distribution of  and  by performing 10 000 coalescent simulations. Thus  every locus falling outside the resulting confidence envelope can be seen as potentially under selection. The following nuisance parameters were used to generate null distributions with similar numbers of allelic stages as in the observed data set: mutation rates (infinite allele model)  = 1 × 10  1 × 10  and 1 × 10; ancestor population size  = 500  5 000  and 50 000; times since an assumed bottleneck event  = 50  500  and 5 000 generations; time since divergence  = 50 and 500; and population size before the split  = 50 and 500. In order to detect outlier loci potentially selected for the polled trait within the three Finnish native cattle populations  the DetSel program was run for comparison between the two subpopulations representing the definitely polled ( = 19) and horned ( = 19) animals  respectively. A complete list of loci and their variability in the 10 cattle populations are shown in Table . The overall genetic differentiation across loci was 0.117 ( = 0.117  95% CI 0.108 - 0.125).  values for an individual locus varied from 0.017 (SD = 0.011) at  on BTA1 to 0.180 (SD = 0.057) at  on BTA20. Mean population differentiations for loci on BTA1 and BTA20 were 0.126 ( = 0.126  95% CI 0.103 - 0.143) and 0.118 ( = 0.118  95% CI 0.100 - 0.139)  respectively. Neither of the values indicated significant difference from the average for loci on other chromosomes ( = 0.114  95% CI 0.104 - 0.124). Levels of variation across populations  including allelic richness () and expected heterozygosity ()  were in similar ranges as for microsatellites on BTA1  BTA20 and other autosomes  with the smallest variations observed at  ( = 1.37   = 0.08). The highest  of 0.79 was observed at  (BTA2) and the highest  of 11.36 at  (BTA21). Most  values were positive and for some loci significantly positive. Of the 13 negative  values  seven occurred for loci on BTA20  and two for loci on BTA1. Loci on BTA1 and BTA20 did not show a significant reduction or increase in mean  compared with the loci on other autosomes (other bovine autosomes  mean  = 0.038; BTA1  mean  = 0.053  Mann-Whitney test  = 118   = 0.409; BTA20  mean  = 0.011  Mann-Whitney test  = 273.5   = 0.227). Given the range of observations of  at an individual locus  there were no marked difference among the three classes of loci (BTA1  -0.083 - 0.190; BTA20  -0.074 - 0.113; other BTAs  -0.052 - 0.391). The strength of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers was estimated and the average ' value of pairwise syntenic markers was 0.32 across BTA1 and 0.28 across BTA20  both of which are significantly ( < 0.05) higher than for non-syntenic markers (0.15; only the ' > 0.3 are shown in Figure ). Figure  also shows matrices of LD significance levels for all possible locus combinations of the loci on BTA1 or BTA20 in their chromosomal order. Of the 120 pairwise comparisons of the 16 loci on BTA20  a total of 22 (22/120  18.3%) tests showed  values below 0.05. Likewise  LD between markers on BTA1 provided seven (7/21  33.3%) significant observations. However  a substantially smaller proportion (34/1124  3.0%) of significant ( < 0.05) pairs was found between non-syntenic markers. In general  significantly higher levels of LD were observed for syntenic markers on BTA1 and BTA20 than that for non-syntenic markers. There was no evidence of LD blocks on either of the chromosomes. . Numbers in the blocks indicate the percentage of the LD metric ' values > 0.3; shadings indicate Fisher's exact test significance levels: white   > 0.05; light shading   < 0.05. The Ewens-Watterson test enables detection of deviations from a neutral-equilibrium model as either a deficit or an excess of genetic diversity relative to the number of alleles at a locus (see []). When applying the tests for all the microsatellites  we detected 13 loci (                        and ) on 10 different chromosomes exhibiting significant probabilities for the Ewens-Watterson test based on both homozygosity () and Fisher's exact test () (see Table ). Of the 13 loci  one () exhibited a significant ( < 0.05) deficit of heterozygosity and all the other 12 loci exhibited a significant ( < 0.05) excess in genetic diversity relative to the expected values; these patterns are consistent with directional and balancing selection  respectively. The 12 loci generated average  values significantly (Student's  test:  = 0.020   = -5.65   < 0.0001;  = 0.014   = -5.69   < 0.0001) below than the expected median value of 0.5. However  average  values of 0.313 for  ( = -4.63   > 0.1) and 0.232 for  ( = -8.69   > 0.1) were observed in the remaining 38 loci which were not under selection. The observation provided further evidence that selection affected genetic diversity at the microsatellites under selection. The results of the analyses with the FDIST2 program are presented in Table  and Figure . This summary-statistic method  based on simulated and observed  values  identified four loci (     and ) as outliers showing footprints of selection in the analyses  including all 10 populations  at the 5% significance level. Of the four significant loci  three (   and ) with higher  values indicated a sign of directional selection and one locus () appearing in the lower tail of the  distribution suggested a signature potentially affected by balancing selection (Figure ). In the Bayesian -test (Figure )  which was based on a hierarchical regression model  three loci (   and ) were detected as being directionally selected and two ( and ) as under balancing selection. Overall  across all the populations  two loci   and   exhibited the strongest evidence of selection with all three statistical approaches  which provided good support to their status as outliers due to selection. Two loci ( and ) exhibited significant departure from the neutral expectations in two out of the three selection tests. Furthermore  12 loci (                 and ) can be regarded as candidates affected by selection  but were revealed only in one of the three tests. Interestingly  according to ENSEMBL cow genome  the significant locus  under balancing selection was about 1.78 cM upstream from the candidate locus for   whereas locus  under directing selection was located about 3.87 cM downstream from the candidate locus. It should be noted that the -based tests of selection are prone to false positives because of sensitivity to demographic history []  heterozygosity among loci in mutation rate [] and locus-specific phenomena not related to selection []. Nevertheless  we expect the set of loci identified by -based tests to be enriched for the true positives in further tests. . The solid lines indicate the critical cutoff for the -value at the 0.05 level. Since each of the five tests used above relies on somewhat different assumptions  loci that are repeatedly found to be outside the range expected for neutrality are extremely good candidates for markers under selection. Moreover  LD is known to be extremely high for the six BTA1 microsatellites near the candidate gene affecting the presence or absence of horns in   thus the region under selection is likely to be quite wide. Despite the possible presence of a few false positives  the full set of seven loci (           and ) was used for further analyses. The lnR<U+03B8> methods (lnRH  lnRV and lnR<U+03B8>') use heterozygosity or variance difference  rather than population divergence  to test for selection. Significant results for the lnR<U+03B8> tests for selective sweeps involve the two loci ( and ) detected by the Ewens-Watterson test and the -based tests for pairwise combinations ( = 12) of three native Finnish cattle populations and four old native populations from Russia and Ukraine (Table ). Significant results for selective sweeps at loci  and  were obtained for 12 pairwise population comparisons for each of the three different measures of lnR<U+03B8> (Table ). Of the pairwise comparisons  a total of 28 and 26 significant ( < 0.05) or very significant ( < 0.01) results were observed at  and   respectively  in the three tests. Both loci ( and ) appeared in all three different measures of lnR<U+03B8> for eight or more comparisons (Table )  that is  lnR<U+03B8> (lnRH  lnRV and lnR<U+03B8>') values deviating by more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. Accordingly  the pairwise comparisons between either of Eastern Finncattle and Western Finncattle and populations of Yakutian  Kholmogory and Ukrainian Grey were significant for all three estimators. All the comparisons between populations yielded at least two significant results for the three estimators. In total  54 (75% 54/72) significant comparisons involved  or  in the comparisons between Finnish native populations (Northern Finncattle  Eastern Finncattle and Western Finncattle) vs. the native populations from Russia and Ukraine (Istoben  Ukrainian Grey  Kholmogory and Yakutian Cattle)  which suggested that selective sweeps had taken place in the Finnish native populations. The coalescent simulation  which was based on a population split model []  was performed with the DetSel program within the Finnish native populations with very similar demographical backgrounds (Eastern Finncattle  Northern Finncattle and Western Finncattle). Among the six BTA1 microsatellites around the candidate loci  all are polymorphic in the three populations involved in the pairwise-subpopulation comparison. In the pairwise comparison between definitely polled ( = 19) and horned ( = 19) cattle  loci  and  were significantly outside the 99% confidence interval (Figure )  while locus  fell slightly outside the 95% confidence envelope in the three comparisons  which are thus considered as false positives  i.e.  the locus was detected as an outlier because of the 5% type I error. The outlier behavior for loci  and  was deemed to be the result of strong local effects of hitchhiking selection. . The test was at the 95% confidence envelope: plot of  against  estimates for the subpopulation pair polled vs. horned. In this study  besides 28 microsatellites on other cattle autosomes used as a reference set of markers  seven microsatellites on BTA1 and 16 on BTA20 around candidate loci were screened for the footprints of selection among 10 cattle populations with divergent horn or production traits. Across different statistical analyses  a highly divergent pattern of genetic differentiation and large differences in levels of variability were revealed at the loci  and  among populations  which was inconsistent with neutral expectations. The results indicated divergent 'selective sweeps' at  and   probably caused by selection of the closely-linked candidate loci for the horned/polled trait  e.g. the  gene. Because revealing outlier loci in genome scans currently depends on statistical tests  one of the main concerns is to highlight truly significant loci while minimizing the detection of false positives []. Using a multilocus scan of differentiation based on microsatellite data  we compared three different methods that aimed at detecting outliers from simulated neutral expectations: 1) the Ewens-Watterson method [  ]  2) the FDIST2 method []  and 3) a BAYESFST method []. Outliers were identified for 15 loci using a 5% threshold  which was robust across methods for two loci ( and ). The locus  presented a higher differentiation ( value) than expected  suggesting that it could have been affected by the action of diversifying selection among homogeneous gene pools and populations. In contrast  the locus  presented a lower genetic differentiation than expected  which could represent signatures of homogenizing selection among populations and/or balancing selection within populations. All three methods identified loci  and  as good candidates for selection on the polled trait. However  several significant loci were detected only by one or two of the tests and thus could not be accepted as reliable outliers with the remaining tests. The results obtained by the three methods are not totally consistent  probably because of the difference in statistical power using multiple measures of variability  each of which measures different parameters and relies on different assumptions  e.g. heterozygosity and variance in allele size []  as detailed in e.g. [–]. Besides the global analyses  detection of outlier loci was also done using pairwise analyses. This helped to reveal loci with a major overall effect as well as loci responding with different strengths to artificial selection on the individual populations. Among the population chosen for the pairwise analyses  the lnR<U+03B8> (lnRV  lnRH and lnR<U+03B8>') tests yielded a high number of significant ( < 0.05) results at  and  according to the three estimators of lnR<U+03B8> (Table ). This finding conforms well to the previous results of selective sweeps associated with hitchhiking selection with one or more genes with locally beneficial mutations. Although there is difference in the statistical power to detect selection  as discussed in [    ]  the three estimators of lnR<U+03B8> provide additional robust evaluation of potential selective sweeps for the pairwise population comparisons. Neutrality tests for microsatellites focus mainly on unlinked loci and are based on either population differentiation () or reduced variability (lnR<U+03B8>). Our proposed tests consider lnR<U+03B8> of several linked loci for the inference of selection. While the single-locus lnR<U+03B8>-test is largely independent of the demographical past  the additional power of linked loci is balanced by the cost of an increasing dependence of the demographic past due to the fact that LD is extremely sensitive to the demographic history. Thus  pairwise analyses between sub-populations may decrease the demographic effects in accounting for the selection. As indicated in Figure   the great majority of loci always fall in the confidence region of the conditional pairwise-subpopulation distributions of branch length estimates  while some loci do not. Overall  we identified two loci ( and ) that were probably subject to selection in the three Finnish native populations. Thus  we concluded that the distribution of variability at these loci could have been shaped by forces other than demographic effects e.g. genetic drift. Although the locus  was located on the edge or fell just outside the high probability region of the expected conditional distribution in the Finnish native populations  we must be cautious about the locus because the estimation of  parameters is discontinuous as a result of the discrete nature of the data  i.e. the allele counts (e.g. []). However  it is worth noting that not all significant loci detected by other methods could be accepted as trustworthy outliers with DetSel due to technical constraints  which means that if a locus is monomorphic in one population of the pair analyses with DetSel are not possible. Tests to detect outlier loci that deviate from neutral expectation cannot identify false positives (type I errors). Thus  we conducted the three different neutrality tests (the Ewens-Watterson test  the FDIST test and the BAYESFST test)  setting a 95%  level criterion to identify loci under selection pressure  at which the expected number of false positive loci is 51 × 0.05 = 2.55. We still found 13  four and five outlier loci  respectively  indicating that at least some of the outlier loci are unlikely to be false positives. As suggested by []  a practical approach to strengthen the candidate status of identified outlier loci is to apply two or more neutrality tests simultaneously based on different assumptions and parameter estimation and only consider outlier loci that are supported by several methods for subsequent validation steps. Thus  the fact that some loci are identified by one neutrality test  but not by others  suggests that their status as candidate loci under selection must be regarded with considerable caution. However  significant deviations from neutrality expectation using multiple tests do not necessarily mean that a particular locus has been affected by hitchhiking selection. In this case  we applied three different pairwise population neutrality tests in 12 separate comparisons using two loci (across the populations: 3 × 12 × 2 = 72 separate tests). This is expected to result in approximately four false positives at the 95%  level. The fact that we observed as many as 54 deviations (Table ) at the 95%  level indicates that it is unlikely that all the outliers identified by pairwise analyses are due to type I errors. Moreover  no locus showed only one significant deviation in one pairwise population comparison (see Table ). Therefore  it can be considered that the approach was quite robust and conservative in the detection of the effects of hitchhiking selection  particularly when additional pairwise analyses were applied. Actually microsatellites are unlikely to be the target of selection  but are merely tightly linked to the candidate genes. Since the microsatellites used are located close to some functional candidate genes (or QTLs) on the same chromosome  this indicates a high probability that one or several good candidate genes (or QTLs) is/are tightly linked to some of the microsatellites. In many of the cases examined to date  selective sweeps have affected only a very small region  potentially containing only one or a few genes  except in the case of extremely strong selection (see []). Empirical studies indicate that the negligible LD between a hitchhiking locus and a candidate gene underlying selection varied from tens of bp (e.g. []) to tens or even hundreds of kb (see [  ])  which depends on a variety of factors such as the genomic regions (e.g. sex chromosome vs. autosome) and populations (e.g. domesticated vs. wild) investigated  and the type of markers (e.g. EST- or MHC-microsatellites vs. microsatellites) used. It has also been suggested that the LD between loci and candidate genes affected by selection is determined mainly by the strength of selection  local recombination rate  population history  and the age of the beneficial allele []. Whatever the reason  significant LD was detected with inter-marker genomic distances between .1100 kb and .10300 kb in this study (see Figure )  a considerably wider interval than reported previously. We detected two microsatellite loci ( and ) probably linked to the candidate gene for the polled trait in the populations investigated. The polled trait is an autosomal dominant trait in cattle and to date the genes controlling this trait have not been specifically identified. However  the gene causing the absence of horns is known to be at the centromeric end of BTA1. Several factors have potentially driven evolution of the functionally important candidate locus including artificial selection and mating system. In Finnish native cattle populations  polled animals were particularly favored during selective breeding. However  we did not detect any locus under selection on BTA20 despite that the fact that several microsatellites including GHRJA surround the growth hormone receptor gene. Growth hormone receptor belongs to the large superfamily of class 1 cytokine receptors. It has various roles in growth  lactation and reproduction in cattle and has been identified as a candidate gene affecting a few key quantitative traits. Therefore  it is not specific to dairy traits but to traits related with growth  lactation and reproduction. Among the cattle populations investigated here  no contrasting differences in growth  lactation or reproduction was observed. In addition  a recent study on the evolution of the cytoplasmic domains of the growth hormone receptor gene in Artiodactyla (see []) has suggested that possible effects of selective sweeps on growth hormone receptor gene in bovine occurred before domestication and not among the domestic breeds. Unfortunately  due to the lack of information on the mutation and recombination rates  as well as the effective population size for these data  estimation of the selection coefficient is not possible here (see []). Given that the genomic interval of significant LD is comparable with the findings of hitchhiking around two anti-malarial resistance genes in humans [] and microsatellite hitchhiking mapping in the three-spined stickleback []  the hitchhiking selection in this genomic region might be fairly strong. Moreover  the availability of genomic resources (e.g. NCBI Bovine Genome Resources; )in bovine makes it possible to develop more precise approaches with other much more frequent markers such as SNP. Genotyping an additional set of high density SNP between  and  markers in the populations investigated will definitely give more precise information on selection and LD in the region. Because the populations studied here are not experimental  they differ for many characteristics other than the polled and horned traits. Thus  some of the genetic differentiation could have been due to other selective forces  e.g. pathogens. In addition  since our data violate at least partly the model assumptions of equal population size and migration rates between populations for the FDIST2 test  the outliers from the test alone should be considered with caution although the multiple neutrality tests based on different assumptions and parameter estimation can minimize the possibility of false positives. Moreover  selection is not the only possibility for changes in the distribution of variation to occur at particular loci  reduced variation or increased differentiation can result from chance alone  e.g. genetic drift  bottlenecks or founder events []. To obtain clear evidence for selection of these markers  we must analyze nucleotide variations between polled and horned populations. Our microsatellite data from northern Eurasian cattle populations empirically indicate a practical approach for identifying the best candidate loci under hitchhiking selection by simultaneously applying multiple neutrality tests based on different assumptions and parameter estimations. By analyzing microsatellite markers adjacent to functional genes  we identified two loci ( and ) that are \"selection candidate\" targets associated with the horned/polled trait in cattle. This result could be further confirmed by using a more densely spaced set of markers. It would also be of great interest to see if similar patterns of selection around the  gene are observed in commercial beef breeds such as Australian Brangus  Angus and Hereford breeds  where dehorning and breeding practices for polled cattle have been an accepted part of cattle management for generations. Another future challenge is to verify the signal of artificial selection on the  gene  possibly using the next generation sequencing technology to detect the nucleotide variation of the gene between polled and horned cattle. In addition  the approach we have taken in this paper can be easily extended to other cases and marker types. For example  diversity among cattle has been directed by man towards different goals (e.g. draft  milk  meat  fatness  size  color  horn characteristics  behavior  and other characteristics) during many generations of selection. Each of these selection events has potentially left a signature of selection on the genes and their neighboring loci that could be detected by using tests such as we have applied here. As a marker technology  SNP would offer the advantage of higher throughput when scanning the genome for evidence of hitchhiking selection.

However  activity of specific enzymes  protein content and cell structure in fat tissue probably depend on a smaller number of genes than traits related to fat content in carcass. Thus  in this work traits related to metabolic and cytological features of back fat tissue and fat related performance traits were investigated in a genome-wide QTL analysis. QTL similarities and differences were examined between three F crosses  and between male and female animals.MethodsA total of 966 F animals originating from crosses between Meishan (M)  Pietrain (P) and European wild boar (W) were analysed for traits related to fat performance (11)  enzymatic activity (9) and number and volume of fat cells (20). Per cross  216 (M × P)  169 (W × P) and 195 (W × M) genome-wide distributed marker loci were genotyped. QTL mapping was performed separately for each cross in steps of 1 cM and steps were reduced when the distance between loci was shorter. The additive and dominant components of QTL positions were detected stepwise by using a multiple position model.ResultsA total of 147 genome-wide significant QTL (76 at P < 0.05 and 71 at P < 0.01) were detected for the three crosses. Most of the QTL were identified on SSC1 (between 76-78 and 87-90 cM)  SSC7 (predominantly in the MHC region) and SSCX (in the vicinity of the gene ). Additional genome-wide significant QTL were found on SSC8  12  13  14  16  and 18. In many cases  the QTL are mainly additive and differ between F crosses. Many of the QTL profiles possess multiple peaks especially in regions with a high marker density. Sex specific analyses  performed for example on SSC6  SSC7 and SSCX  show that for some traits the positions differ between male and female animals. For the selected traits  the additive and dominant components that were analysed for QTL positions on different chromosomes  explain in combination up to 23% of the total trait variance.ConclusionsOur results reveal specific and partly new QTL positions across genetically diverse pig crosses. For some of the traits associated with specific enzymes  protein content and cell structure in fat tissue  it is the first time that they are included in a QTL analysis.

They provide large-scale information to analyse causative genes and useful data for the pig industry. Reduced fatness improves carcass value  and therefore numerous studies on QTL mapping in pig concern fat deposition related traits (see reviews [  ]). More recently  the results have been compiled in the database PigQTLdb ([  ]; ). As shown in several studies  QTL profiles depend largely on genetic resources  trait definition and statistical models. Taken together  these studies have detected major QTL affecting fat traits on porcine chromosomes SSC1  2  4  6  7 and X. Traits like volume of adipose tissue and fat metabolism are influenced by lipogenesis and lipolysis rates  relationship between lipogenesis and lipolysis  energy intake and adipocyte differentiation. In pig  fat accretion is related to the activity of NADPH-generating enzymes in adipose tissue []. Strutz [] has reported genetic correlations of about -0.4 to -0.6 between carcass fat content and activity of NADPH-generating enzymes. The content of soluble proteins in porcine fat tissue is an indicator of metabolic activity and has been reported to be genetically correlated (about -0.5) with fat content in carcass []. Furthermore  data on the diameter and number of porcine fat cells and on cell size differences between lean and obese pigs have been reported [  ]. Activity of specific enzymes  protein content and cell structure in fat tissue probably depend on a smaller number of genes than production traits related to fat content in carcass. Thus  we have measured metabolic and cytological features for back fat tissue together with performance traits related to carcass fat deposition and used these traits in a genome-wide QTL analysis. The positions of the QTL were compared among three F porcine crosses as well as between male and female animals. For some traits  we analysed the combined influence of QTL positioned on different chromosomes on the trait variance. We detected a total of 76 QTL (P < 0.05) and 71 QTL (P < 0.01) with genome-wide significant effects for the three crosses  but numerous QTL were observed only in one or two of the crosses. A total of 966 F pigs were generated with founder animals from the Meishan and Pietrain breeds and the European wild boar (Table ). All pigs were maintained under standardized housing in one experimental station. Generation of animals for the three F crosses and conditions of feeding are described elsewhere [  ]. Blood samples were collected from founders  F and F animals. Blood was taken from the  of living animals or during stunning and separated into plasma  erythrocytes and leucocytes. DNA was isolated from the leukocyte fraction by chloroform-phenol extraction according to standard protocols. Adipose tissue of the back fat area between the skin and  at 13/14 rib was collected from the F animals directly after stunning. For each animal  a piece of back fat tissue was sampled and stored immediately in liquid nitrogen. After thawing the subcutaneous adipose tissue at the connective tissue border was separated into an inner and outer layer sample. For both samples  connective tissue and blood vessels were removed and the adipose tissue used immediately. As shown in Table   40 traits were recorded  including 11 performance traits associated with fat deposition (Table ). Six other traits related to enzyme activities and three to protein content were measured in fat tissue (Table ). The relative numbers or volumes of fat cells were determined using different parameters defining 20 traits (Table ). Traits related to protein content  enzyme activities and fat cells are described in the following sections. Each fat tissue sample was cut into small pieces (about 1 mm thick) and then homogenized at 0°C in a 0.15 M KCl solution. The homogenate was centrifuged (20 min  20000 g  +4°C) and the supernatant filtered (Filter No. 11303  pore diameter 1.2 µm  Sartorius  Göttingen  Germany). The filtrate was kept at +4°C and immediately used to measure protein content and enzyme activities. Protein contents were estimated according to []. For each fat tissue sample  protein content was measured three times and averaged. To measure each enzyme activity  0.1 mL of the filtrate was mixed: for isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH): with 1.0 mL of 0.075 M glycyl-glycine buffer (pH 7.4)  0.1 mL of 0.05 M MnCl-4HO  0.2 mL of 0.002 M NADP  1.5 mL HO  and 0.1 mL of 0.06 M 1.5 DL-isocitrate; for malate dehydrogenase (MDH): with 2.0 mL of 0.3 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5)  0.6 mL of 0.01 M MnSO-HO  0.6 mL of 0.002 M NADP  2.1 mL HO  and 0.6 mL of 1 M malate; for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH): with 0.5 mL of 0.25 M glycyl-glycine buffer (pH 8.0)  0.5 mL of 0.2 M MgCl-6HO  0.2 mL of 0.0075 M NADP  0.8 mL HO  0.3 mL of 0.01 M 6-phosphogluconate (6PG)  and 0.01 M glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). The mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 30°C  and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm with a photometer (Perkin Elmer  Wellesley  MA  USA) for 5 min. The activity was calculated in IU per g of tissue. For each fat tissue sample  enzyme activities were measured twice and averaged. For further details on protein and enzyme traits see Table . According to the methods described in [–]  each fat tissue sample was cut up with minimal pressure into slices about 1 mm thick. One g of tissue was suspended in 3 mL KRB buffer (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 5 mM glucose and 25 mM HEPES  pH 7.4) containing 3 mg/mL collagenase and slowly stirred at 37°C for 1 h. The prepared cell suspension was filtered (PP filter  1000 µm  Sartorius  Göttingen  Germany)  collected in 3 mL KRB buffer  sedimented and again suspended in 3 mL KRB buffer. Then  500 µL cell suspension were incubated with 5 mL collidine-HCl buffer (1 M 2 4 6-trimethylpyridine  0.1 M HCl  0.26 M NaCl  pH 7.4) and 3 mL OsO solution (3% w/v OsO in collidine-HCl buffer) for 24 h at room temperature. The number of suspended cells was measured with a Coulter-Counter (Model TA II  Beckman  Krefeld  Germany) in different size fractions. In practise  the particle counter measured the changes of resistance caused by individual particles passing the opening of a capillary wall with electrodes on both sides. Using an automatic coincidence correction guarantied that particles passing simultaneously were counted separately. Assuming spherical particles  the particle numbers and volumes were calculated for size classes with cell diameters of 23  29  36  41  57  73  92  114  146  183  and 228 µm. Marker loci were selected to be informative  evenly distributed over the chromosomes  and nearly the same for the three crosses. Only when the information content of a selected locus within a cross was low  was an alternative flanking locus chosen for that cross. For regions with previously detected QTL for performance traits [] on SSC2  SSC4 and SSCX  high marker density maps were built. Per cross  216 (M × P)  169 (W × P) and 195 (W × M) polymorphic markers were genotyped (Table ). Marker loci parameters (map position  number of alleles  observed informative meioses etc.) and polymorphism types are provided in Additional file . Linkage mapping was performed using the CriMap software  version 2.4 [  ]. The information content of each locus for mapping was assessed by the number of informative meioses (Additional file ). The number of informative meioses averaged across all loci was 558 (702) for the M × P cross  520 (722) for the W × P cross and 623 (732) for the W × M cross  the number in brackets being the maximum number of informative meioses for a locus. The frequencies of the observed informative meioses per cross were 0.79 (M × P)  0.72 (W × P) and 0.85 (W × M). Additional file  contains the numbers of observations  phenotypic means  standard deviations and determination coefficients of the traits for the F animals of each cross. The least square method was applied for QTL mapping [] and was performed separately for each of the three crosses in steps of 1 cM; the steps were reduced when the distance between marker loci was shorter. As described for the autosomes in [] and for chromosome X in []  the conditional probabilities for the transfer of an allele from the founder to the F individual were calculated for any position of the linkage array by considering all marker loci of a linkage group simultaneously and stored as additive and dominant components. From these linear components  the additive and dominant effects were calculated for each trait in a generalized linear model procedure (GLM) including the continuous (age at slaughter) and discontinuous (two-month classes of seasonal influence  sex  litter number) independent variables. Only 91 W × M F animals were measured for fat cell traits  which were not adjusted for the effects of season and litter number in our models because of insufficient connectedness of these independent variables. The mean square estimates of the additive and dominant components in relation to the error variance was calculated from the complete model  and the position on a chromosome with the highest  ratio value was considered as the most likely QTL position. Genome-wide (P < 0.05) significant QTL maxima (major peaks) were determined for all traits (Table ). Additional genome-wide significant minor peaks were registered per trait and chromosome with P < 0.01 for performance traits (Table ) and P < 0.05 for the other traits (Table  and ) when they were more than 20 cM away from the major peak and from the already considered minor peaks. For chromosomes SSC6  7 and X  we performed separate calculations for female and male animals in order to test sex-specific differences in QTL positions and genetic effects. The model for these data sets includes all independent variables  with the exception of sex. Threshold values of the test statistic were derived by permutation tests []  using 1000 repetitions. All permutations were calculated for different traits in data sets for crosses and chromosomes separately. Applying a Bonferroni correction []  the P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 genome-wide thresholds were calculated for chromosomes 7  16 and × and then averaged across the chromosomes and crosses  since the thresholds between the crosses and traits showed only slight differences (Additional file ). Testing multifactorial influences on selected traits  the additive and dominant components of significant QTL positions detected across all the chromosomes were included stepwise by using a multiple position model which included the environmental variables. Components with a significant proportion of the explained variance remained in the final model (see results in Table ). Within each cross  we identified QTL which explain more than about 4.3% of the error variance (VF) with a P < 0.05 genome-wide significance level (threshold with  ratio > 8.5). As shown in Table   a total of 147 genome-wide QTL were found (76 at P < 0.05  and 71 at P < 0.01) for the three crosses. The numbers of significant QTL were 30 at P < 0.05 and 33 at P < 0.01 for M × P  22 at P < 0.05 and 25 at P < 0.01 for W × P  and 24 at P < 0.05 and 13 at P < 0.01 for W × M. However  since we tested three populations and 40 traits in 120 genome scans  about six false positive QTL may occur at a genome-wide 5% significance. The numbers of QTL detected per trait were about three times higher for the performance traits (Table ) than for the other groups of traits (protein  enzyme  fat cell traits  Table  and ). This finding can be explained by the fact that performance traits are likely to be influenced by a higher number of genes than protein  enzyme and fat cell traits. In Table   the QTL positions and the flanking marker loci for the Hohenheim maps are indicated together with the corresponding USDA MARC map positions. Figure  shows the genome-wide QTL distribution for the three crosses. For performance traits  if only the major QTL and adjusted positions on USDA MARC map are considered  the following results can be emphasized: . The distribution of the QTL detected in the Hohenheim crosses (M: Meishan; P: Pietrain; W: European wild boar) and with F ratio values above the genome-wide thresholds P = 0.05 is shown on the pig chromosomes (SSC); for each cross  the sex-averaged map in Kosambi morgan (M) is adjusted to the length calculated for the Hohenheim M × P cross; results for SSCX were obtained from female animals; the different symbols for the three trait groups represent major QTL peaks (black) and minor QTL peaks (red) that show distances > 20 cM to the major peak and to other minor peak observed for the same trait. An accumulation of QTL for fat deposition traits (performance traits) was observed on . For the W × P cross  QTL were mainly located at positions 76-78 and 87-90 cM. QTL at positions 89-91 and 105-108 cM were detected in the W × M cross  besides two other QTL at positions 57 cM and 113 cM. QTL at 114 and 136 cM were observed in the M × P cross. A QTL for enzyme activity was found with a 5% significance level in the W × P cross  and several QTL were detected in W × P and W × M crosses for fat cell parameters at about 91  104 and 111-113 cM  three of them near   where [] has detected QTL for fat cell traits. On   only QTL related to performance traits were found in the W × P cross (at 57 cM and 73 cM) in spite of the fact that in the Pietrain breed  the allele  responsible for a paternally expressed QTL at the proximal end (0.6 cM) of SSC2 affecting muscle growth and fat deposition is nearly fixed  while in wild boar and the Meishan breed only the wild allele - is detected []. Therefore  F males from W × P and M × P crosses should be  heterozygous and about half of the F animals should possess the allele . The  locus was not tested in the crosses as no suitable assay was available. However  its location corresponds to the interval between the markers  and   in which no QTL for performance traits was observed in this study. Two QTL (P < 0.01) were detected on   one related to performance traits (37 cM  M × P cross) and one to fat cell traits (74 cM  W × P cross). Another QTL for fat cell traits was found at position 53-55 cM (W × P cross). Several QTL for performance traits were also found on  in the M × P cross between the markers  and  at around 76 cM. The QTL for both traits on SSC6 in the W × P cross were located in the same interval. Whereas Bidanel et al. [] have confirmed this QTL position  other authors [  ] have mapped a QTL for back fat thickness on SSC6 in the vicinity of  corresponding to position 121 cM. All 20 QTL (P < 0.01) on  were found in the major histocompatibility complex ()  of which 19 were located approximately 10 cM around the genes  and . These 19 QTL seem to be distributed in three clusters  one slightly proximal to marker   one slightly distal to / and one about 6 cM distal to /. The remaining QTL (performance trait AFW  M × P cross) was detected about 9 cM distal to /. A total of 18 QTL was observed in the M × P cross for performance (4)  enzyme activity (5) and fat cell traits (9)  and only two QTL were detected in the W × M cross (one for performance and one for enzyme activity traits). These differences of QTL between crosses might be affected by the information content of marker loci. The QTL for back fat thickness located near  have also been reported by [–] and Miller [] has located QTL for fat cell traits at the same position. On  and   several QTL for traits related to protein content and fat cells were observed  three of them with P < 0.01. Amongst these  two concerning fat cell traits were found on  for the W × M cross at 108 cM (calculated from 91 observations only)  and one QTL detected on  for another fat cell trait was located between the markers  and  in the W × P cross. QTL for protein content were detected on  for the W × M cross at 80-81 cM in the immediate vicinity of . QTL related to enzyme activities were found on SSCX in the M × P cross at positions 29  57 and 112-114 cM. Another QTL for fat cell traits was found at about 56 cM  at the same position where [] described a QTL for backfat thickness. As shown in Figure  and Table   most of the QTL were observed within a few chromosome regions only  and the QTL were often specific to one or two of the three F crosses. For example  QTL on SSCX occur mainly in the crosses M × P and W × M and with a cross-specific distribution. The QTL detected in similar chromosomal intervals in two of the three crosses indicate that alleles transmitted from one of the resource groups are different from the alleles in the two other resources. High allelic effects caused by a distinct founder breed were observed  for example  on SSC4 (near )  SSC6 (near ) and SSC7 (between  and ). The relevant SSC7 interval includes the MHC region where Meishan cryptic alleles are responsible for a decrease in fat deposition and enzyme activity traits and an increase in the proportion of small fat cells' numbers and volumes (observed in the F M × P and W × M crosses). The same effects of Meishan alleles on SSC7 have been reported for fat deposition as well as for numbers and volumes of adipocytes in a Large White × Meishan backcross []. On the contrary  Meishan alleles that increase fat deposition were located in the M × P and W × M crosses on SSC1 between  and . Moreover  Pietrain alleles in the crosses with Meishan as well as with wild boar on SSC6 at  had negative effects on obesity. None of the regions with significant effects on fat deposition traits was common to all three crosses  except the one for fat cell traits between  and  on SSC7 at about 55 to 90 cM referring to the USDA MARC map. Figure  demonstrates the cross-specific QTL profiles for SSC1  SSC7 and SSCX. The QTL for protein content on SSCX at  (mapped at 81 cM on USDA MARC map  [  ]) was observed only in the W × M cross. Numerous QTL profiles on SSC1 and SSC7 were similar between the M × P and W × M crosses indicating that allele effects in Meishan were highly different to those in Pietrain and wild boar. However  SSC7 QTL were similar among all three crosses for an interval between about 50 and 100 cM (which contains the MHC  see Figure )  revealing that major QTL effects are caused by alleles that segregate in all the crosses. . The solid line indicates the P = 0.01  the dashed line the P = 0.05 genome-wide thresholds  and the dotted line the P = 0.05 chromosome-wide threshold for F ratio values; traits are defined in Table 2; positions of markers are given in Kosambi centimorgan (cM) on the linkage maps of Hohenheim crosses; results for SSCX were obtained from female animals; markers are described in Additional file ; data sets for the two sexes are shown with the averaged linkage map distances whereas for SSCX the female map distances are used; M: Meishan; P: Pietrain; W: European wild boar. Several of the  ratio profiles reveal multiple peaks per chromosome (Figure   Table ). This might be caused by pleiotropic effects of the involved genes. However  multiple peaks in the  ratio profile of a trait per chromosome may also result from linkage disequilibria among alleles of linked loci in F animals  whereby the linkage disequilibrium increases while the distances between the considered loci decrease. Significances of QTL peaks can be influenced by different information contents of the marker loci used in the flanking regions of a QTL. Thus  more markers and multipoint regression analyses may help to determine the contribution of single QTL peaks to the total genetic variance of the trait considered. Examples of multiple and cross-specific QTL peaks per chromosome are also shown in Figure  for SSC7. In the M × P and W × M crosses  the major QTL profiles on SSC7 span from about 55 to 90 cM (including the genes )  and in the W × P cross the major QTL were found at about 105 cM (between  and ). The 30 cM interval covering the largest QTL on SSC7 contains the MHC known to include numerous functional genes in man and mouse. In this interval  genome-wide significant QTL were detected especially in both Meishan crosses. Concerning fat deposition traits  this could be due mainly to a smaller difference between the purebred estimates for wild boar and Pietrain compared to that between these two breeds and the Meishan breed []. For instance  the difference in average back fat depth (ABFD) between Pietrain and wild boar was 2.13 mm  whereas it was 7.77 mm between Pietrain and Meishan and 9.90 mm between wild boar and Meishan. A further example of effects of crosses on the patterns and positions of QTL was observed for SSC6 in the region of the loci  and  (USDA MARC map 75 to 80 cM  Table ). Important QTL were detected in this region for both M × P and W × P crosses. The additive effects for the grand-paternal inheritance indicate a negative influence of distinct Pietrain founder alleles on performance traits associated with fatness. QTL analyses for female and male F offspring are shown for example on SSC6  SSC7 and SSCX and use averaged linkage map distances for the autosomes and the female map distances for SSCX. Figure  shows QTL effects for the traits FVCM  FMR and PCOI  which differ between female and male F animals. For example  the trait FVCM in females of the M × P cross are highly influenced by a QTL at 75 cM on SSC7 whereas the  ratio value for males shows non-significance at that position. Males of the W × P cross show a QTL for the trait FMR on SSC6 at a position near 125 cM  which is located about 40 cM distal to the position found for all (female and male) animals. The trait PCOI represents an example of sex specific QTL positions on SSCX (QTL at 94 and 104 cM for females and males  respectively  W × M cross). . For further explanations see Figure 2. Sex specific QTL positions have also been reported on SSCX for muscle  fatness and growth related traits in the W × M cross []. Sex specific and fat related QTL have been described on chromosome 5 in chicken [] and on several chromosomes in mouse []. Gene expression studies in male and female F mice have shown a large degree of sexually dimorphic gene expression in several tissues [  ]. An expression QTL (eQTL) study [] has shown that most of the eQTL were cis eQTL (mapping to the location of the gene) and sex-shared. Genetic mechanisms possibly underlying sex-specific expression  like sex linkage  sex-specific allelic effects or genomic imprinting  are discussed in []. Across all the pig chromosomes and for selected traits  we have carried out a combined analysis of the additive and dominant components of significant QTL positions. Taking each trait separately  the components of those positions were included step by step in a multiple position model. In the final model  only components with significant variance proportions were included. Examples of the results are shown in Table  and elucidate why the explained phenotypic variance in the F generations increased markedly up to about 23%  and the determination coefficients (r) of the initial model (analyses without genetic independent variables) were more or less doubled. For each trait  several QTL positions  partially located on the same chromosome  remained significant in the combined analysis. This means that the combined analysis indicates a predominant contribution of a few QTL regions to the genetic variance of a trait. Therefore  multiple testing elucidates chromosome intervals which can be significant for breeding programmes. As demonstrated in this report  in pig  fat related traits correspond to numerous specific QTL positions across the genome. For some of the traits associated with specific enzymes  protein content and cell structure in fat tissue  it is the first time that they are included in a QTL analysis. We have found that QTL positions differ between F crosses  and differ partly for their additive and dominant effects. Some of these QTL show sex specific effects. Many of the QTL profiles possess multiple peaks especially in regions with a high marker density  and confidence intervals mostly exceed 10 cM []. Therefore  QTL intervals are rarely narrowed down to a sufficiently small number of candidate loci to be able to suggest one as the most probable causative gene. Nevertheless  porcine chromosome regions  which contain QTL  can be aligned with loci of expressed genes  as well as with orthologous genes in man and mouse using data from PigQTLdb ([]; ). Today  QTL intervals can be compared with the pig genome sequence data (Sscrofa9  Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute 2009  ) to investigate the action of single genes and their variants. The selection of putative causative genes may consider groups of genes that are regulated in parallel and are members of the same metabolic pathway. Thus  the results of genome-wide QTL mapping are important for subsequent analyses of specific genes as well as for selecting DNA markers for breeding purposes.

Somatic cell count (SCC)  and therefore somatic cell score (SCS) have been widely promoted as an indirect method of predicting mammary infections [] and as a selection criterion to improve mastitis resistance []. It has been demonstrated that mastitis is associated with an increase in SCC in small ruminants [  ] and cattle [  ]. Hence  milk with an elevated SCC is usually considered an indication of the occurrence of infection in the udder; and selection for decreased SCC could lead to reduced susceptibility to mastitis []. However  one difficulty in using SCC to find animals most resistant to mastitis is that factors known to influence SCC have different magnitude in healthy and infected animals []  and SCC in healthy and in infected animals may even be considered as different traits. Indeed  it has been shown that cells in the milk from a healthy udder are mainly mammary gland epithelium and drain canal cells; whereas polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the major cell population during early inflammation  playing a protective role against infectious diseases in the mammary gland [  ]. Therefore  in principle SCC from healthy and infected animals should be analyzed separately. However  because the intramammary infection status is generally unknown  one model is usually applied indifferently to SCC obtained from all animals  irrespective of whether they are infected or not. Test-day SCC may  therefore  be regarded as a mixture of observations from animals with unknown health status []. We are in the fortunate position of having a dataset of SCC in dairy sheep for which bacteriological data are also available  indicating whether an animal was infected at the time of sampling. Therefore  instead of using mixture models to determine the infection status [  ]  we were able to analyze SCC  and therefore SCS  separately in apparently healthy and infected animals. Fundamental to any diagnostic test are the concepts of sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity (Se) measures the proportion of actual positives (i.e. diseased animals) which are correctly identified as such by the diagnostic test; whereas specificity (Sp) measures the proportion of negatives (i.e. healthy animals) which are correctly identified by the diagnostic test. If the diagnostic test is perfect  both  and  are equal to unity. However  if the diagnostic test is imperfect  i.e.  and  are less than unity   and  will influence classification of animals and potentially impact on estimable variance components and inferences drawn from the data.  and  for the bacteriological assessments are unknown in our dataset  but it is likely that they were less than unity due to intermittent shedding of bacteria after infection and the possibility of contamination during sampling. The aims of this study  therefore  were: (1) to estimate the heritability of SCS  according to whether the animals were healthy or infected  as assessed by our bacteriological data  along with the heritability of the infection status; (2) to estimate the phenotypic and genetic correlations between the bacteria negative SCS (i.e. apparently healthy animals) and the bacteria positive SCS (i.e. infected animals)  and the genetic correlation between the bacteria negative SCS and the infection status; and (3) to evaluate the impact of imperfect diagnostic  and  on variance component estimates for the traits of interest. The data consisted of 9 306 test-day records from 2 058 lactations of 1 125 ewes. Data for SCC were collected at approximately 1-month intervals  following an A4 recording scheme []  by the University of Palermo in four Valle del Belice flocks between 2004 and 2007. At the same time  milk samples were collected aseptically from each animal for bacteriological analyses  which were performed by conventional techniques  on 5% sheep blood agar plates  incubated at 37°C  and examined after 10-24 h and 36-48 h incubation. The bacteriological colonies observed were mainly:   coagulase negative staphylococci   and other staphylococci;        and other streptococci;  spp.   spp.  and  spp. (Table ). Ewes were considered infected if more than five colony forming units (CFU) per 10 µl of milk of one species of bacteria were isolated  and the data used in this study were the apparent presence or absence of infection for each milk sample. All test-day records used in the analysis were required to have information regarding SCC and bacteriological status. After editing  the data comprised 8 843 test-day records from 2 047 lactations of 1 120 ewes. The pedigree file included 1 603 animals. In addition to the 1 120 animals with records  84 sires and 399 dams without phenotypes were included in the pedigree. On average  the sires served at least two of the four flocks under study and they had 13.33 daughters on average. For analyses investigating the properties of SCC in ewes with either positive or negative bacteriological status  we divided the data in two sub-datasets: one sub-dataset comprising test-day records with the presence of infection (bacteria positive) and the accompanying SCC information (2 866 test-day records from 1 263 lactations of 805 ewes)  and the other one comprising test-day records with the absence of infection (bacteria negative) and the accompanying SCC information (5 977 test-day records from 1 805 lactations of 1 062 ewes). Because the dataset was divided by test-day records  the same animals could appear in both sub-datasets and they could even appear in both datasets in the same lactation. Of the 1 120 ewes from the original data  744 were included in both sub-datasets. The test-day traits analyzed as response variables were SCS and the infection status. SCS were obtained after log-transformation of test-day SCC  using a base 2 logarithmic function: SCS = log (SCC/100) + 3 []  in order to get an approximated normal distribution for this trait. An infection status trait was created  based on the presence/absence of pathogens  indicating whether ewes were infected (1) or apparently healthy (0) at each test-day. Variance components and genetic parameters for SCS (whole dataset as well as bacteria negative and positive subsets) were estimated using ASReml []. The following repeatability test-day animal model as described by Riggio et al. [] was used to analyze the data: where was the SCS test-day measurement;  was the population mean; was the random effect of flock by test-day interaction  (91 levels); was the fixed effect of year by season of lambing interaction  (6 levels)  where the season of lambing was coded as 1 if a ewe gave birth in the period January through June  otherwise it was coded as 2 []; was the fixed effect of the parity (3 levels); was the fixed effect of litter size class  (2 levels  single or multiple born lambs); and exp(-0.05* ) were two covariates used to model the shape of lactation curves []; was the random additive genetic effect of the individual  (1 603 levels); was the general random permanent environmental effect of ewe  across lactations (1 120 levels); was the random permanent environmental effect on the individual  within parity class  (2 047 levels); was the random residual effect. The same model was used for the analysis of the two sub-datasets. Variance components and heritability for the infection status were first estimated using an animal linear model accounting for the same effects included in the model used for SCS. Then  a threshold animal model was fitted  assuming a probit link function. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between SCS in the bacteria negative and positive subsets were estimated using bivariate analyses  fitting the same fixed and random effects as previously described. Given the data structure  i.e. non-contemporaneous bacteria negative and positive SCS observations for any individual  the environmental covariance between the two traits was assumed to be zero and not estimated when the genetic correlation was estimated. However  covariances were fitted for the additive genetic term and for the permanent environmental effects of the ewe both across and within lactations. To estimate an approximated phenotypic correlation  the data were restructured and reduced to adjacent pairs of bacteria negative and positive SCS data  i.e. the bacteria negative and positive SCS observations closest within one lactation were used. It should be noted that this approach does create a unique subset of SCS samples  as the bacteria negative SCS samples are from ewes either immediately prior to or post infection; conversely the bacteria positive SCS sample are from recovering or newly infected ewes. The same fixed effects  as previously described  were fitted but the random effects model was simplified with (co)variance terms estimated only for additive genetic and residual effects. The genetic correlation between the bacteria negative SCS and the infection status was estimated using TM (Threshold Model) program (available upon request to the author andres.legarra@toulouse.inra.fr)  using a Bayesian analysis and performing numerical integration through the Gibbs sampler. The TM program does not handle covariates  so in this case the model was simplified and the two covariates of DIM were excluded. Flat priors were used both for fixed effects and variance components. A chain of 100 000 iterations was used  discarding the first 30 000 samples and saving a sample every 10 iterations. The mean of the estimated marginal posterior density has been used as point estimate of the genetic parameters of interest. Genetic parameters for infection status  bacteria negative SCS  and bacteria positive SCS are potentially affected by imperfect  and   which were both implicitly assumed to be unity in the variance component estimation analyses. Additional file  shows the principles of the calculations used to show how imperfect  and  can influence the interpretations of these data. Using the observed variance components  likely impacts of imperfect  and  on estimated mastitis prevalence  predicted differences between SCS in bacteria negative and positive animals  and variance components were explored. Arithmetic means  standard deviations and range of SCC and SCS test-day traits are given in Table . The geometric mean SCC was 403 (× 10 cells/mL) for the whole data  253 for the bacteria negative  and 1 082 for the bacteria positive. Although ranges of SCC for uninfected and infected animals were similar  the arithmetic mean SCC for infected animals was approximately 3-fold higher than that for uninfected animals. This result suggests that although the distributions of bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS partially overlap  they are substantially different as shown in Figure . The difference between bacteria positive and bacteria negative SCC may have been higher if SCC and infection status had been considered per udder half. However  we had only information at the animal level (summarizing the whole udder); therefore a dilution effect due to the mixing of milk with high SCC coming from infected glands and milk with low SCC from a healthy gland has to be considered. . Distribution of bacteria negative (i.e. healthy) and bacteria positive (i.e. infected) SCS for the observed prevalence of bacteria positive milk samples (p' = 0.32). Phenotypic  genetic  and environmental variances after adjustment for fixed effects  heritabilities and repeatabilities within and across lactations for SCS traits are given in Table . The heritability estimate for SCS was 0.09. However  estimates for bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS were respectively 0.10 and 0.03. This difference could be due in part to the different sub-datasets (i.e. different animals and different number of records) used for the analysis. Therefore  an analysis was carried out in which only the animals present in both sub-datasets were considered. However  this had little effect on the estimated heritabilities and did not change the interpretation of the results. The observed phenotypic variance was 5.57 for infected animals and 2.23 for bacteria negative animals; whereas the observed genetic variance was 0.16 for infected animals and 0.22 for bacteria-negative animals. Repeatability estimates within lactations ranged between 0.20 and 0.29  whereas repeatability estimates across lactations ranged between 0.30 and 0.33  and were higher than the within lactation values. Table  shows the heritabilities of the infection status  estimated by considering the infection status both as a binary and continuous trait on the underlying scale  i.e. liability to infection  and the expected value on the underlying scale calculated from the binary scale using the approximation of Dempster and Lerner []. The heritability estimate obtained with the probit model was 0.09. As expected  the heritability estimate from the normal analysis was somewhat lower  and it can be seen that the assumption of the trait being continuous with normally distributed residuals is violated. However  the expected value on the underlying scale derived from the heritability estimate obtained with the normal analysis was the same as that from the binary trait analysis  confirming that the impact of departures from normality is predictable. The phenotypic and genetic correlations between bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS  and the genetic correlation between bacteria negative SCS and the infection status are presented in Table . The phenotypic correlation between bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS was 0.19 (s.e. 0.02); whereas the genetic correlation was 0.62 (s.e. 0.12)  indicating that whilst there is a moderate positive correlation between these traits it may be more appropriate to consider them as different traits. The genetic correlation between bacteria negative SCS and the infection status was 0.51  suggesting that animals with lower SCS  assessed when apparently not infected  are genetically less likely to be infected (across all time points). For completeness we also estimated the genetic correlation between SCS in bacteria positive animals and liability to infection. The estimated correlation was 0.81 but its biological interpretation is not obvious to us. All analyses so far were done assuming the  =  = 1. This may not be the case; although we have no data on the accuracy of the diagnoses  they are unlikely to be perfect. The impacts of imperfect diagnoses can be tabulated from formulae derived in Additional file . The impact of imperfect  or  on the true prevalence  given the observed prevalence  is shown in Figure . If the  is less than unity  then the true prevalence will have been underestimated  whereas if  is less than perfect then the true prevalence will have been overestimated. Not only does the true prevalence of infection changes as  or  change  but the estimated true difference in SCS between healthy and infected animals also changes  as shown in Figure . Less than perfect  has little impact on the true difference between healthy and infected animals  whereas if  is less than perfect then the true difference between healthy and infected animals will have been underestimated. Moreover  once  drops below ~ 0.8 the estimated differences between the two populations becomes improbably large. . Trend of the true prevalence of infection depending on imperfect specificity ( = 1) or imperfect sensitivity ( = 1) for the observed prevalence of bacteria positive milk samples (p' = 0.32). . Trend of the true difference (Delta) between SCS in healthy and infected populations depending on imperfect specificity ( = 1) or imperfect sensitivity ( = 1). Phenotypic and genetic correlations between SCS in infected and healthy populations also change as  or  change  as shown in Figures  and . If both  and  are less than unity  the true phenotypic correlation will have been slightly underestimated. However  imperfect  has a larger effect  as the true phenotypic correlation drops more rapidly. A different trend is reported for the true genetic correlation (Figure )  which will have been underestimated  if  is less than unity; whereas if  is less than perfect then true genetic correlation will have been overestimated. Although  and  are unknown in these data  the improbable expected results when either or both values are low suggest that both parameters are likely to be somewhat higher than 0.8. .

Trend of the true genetic correlation between SCS in healthy and infected populations depending on imperfect specificity ( = 1) or imperfect sensitivity ( = 1). This paper demonstrates that SCC  and therefore SCS  of apparently uninfected and infected animals are most likely two different traits with different heritabilities. We have shown that bacteria negative SCS has a slightly higher heritability than the infection status (i.e. likely mastitis) and that bacteria negative SCS (i.e. from apparently uninfected animals) is positively genetically correlated with both bacteria positive SCS (i.e. from infected animals) and infection status. Finally  we have explored the implications of less than perfect  and  on our estimates. Possibly the greatest impact of less than perfect diagnosis is on the heritability of liability to mastitis  which is likely to be somewhat underestimated if the diagnostic test is poor. This is likely to decrease potential genetic progress for improved resistance. Evidence has been published that healthy ewes normally have higher SCC than healthy cows [–]. Bufano et al. [] have shown that high SCC (> 1 million/mL) do occur in healthy sheep's milk  especially towards the end of lactation. Therefore  whereas in cattle SCC is widely recognized as indicator of mastitis  results on the efficiency of SCC as an indicator trait are inconsistent in dairy sheep studies. However  Ariznabarreta et al. [] and Gonzalo et al. [] have demonstrated that for around 70% of mammary pathogens isolated from ewes with subclinical mastitis  their presence in ewe milk is associated with high SCC. Therefore  published evidence exists that mastitis does accompany an increase in SCC in sheep []. Moreover  Leitner et al. [] have suggested that because sheep have only two mammary glands  dilution effects due to the mixing of milk with high SCC from an infected gland  and milk with low SCC from a healthy gland  will be relatively small at the animal level. Besides  in dairy cows  subclinical mastitis  with a frequency ranging from 20-50% [  ] may be less apparent because the increase in SCC in an infected gland is modest (about 300-500 × 10 cells/mL) and the mixing with the milk from uninfected quarters is sufficient in most cases to appreciably lower the effect of SCC at the cow level []. The mean SCS for bacteria negative animals was similar to the value of 4.86 reported by Ariznabarreta et al. [] and 5.15 reported by Leitner et al. []; whereas the mean SCS for infected animal was similar to the value of 6.32 reported by Leitner et al. [] in Israeli-Assaf and Awassi sheep. The observed difference between the bacteria positive and negative populations was 2.08  i.e. suggesting a four-fold difference in SCC between typical diseased and healthy individuals. However  if only one half of the udder was infected  then due to the dilution this would equate to an eight-fold difference between healthy and infected halves  assuming independence (i.e. infection in one half  which results in an increase in SCC  does not increase SCC in the other half). If  was in fact less than perfect  this would only have slightly influenced the true difference (delta) between the two populations; whereas if  was less than perfect (i.e. healthy animals wrongly classified as being infected) then the difference between the two populations would have been considerably underestimated. The heritability estimates for overall SCS and SCS in apparently healthy animals were generally in the range reported in the literature for repeatability test-day models i.e. 0.04 to 0.16 [    ]. Other studies have reported higher heritability estimates for the average SCS during lactation  from 0.11 to 0.18 [–]. However  the heritability for SCS in infected ewes (0.03) was at the low end of published values. It is important to highlight that the similarity between the heritability for bacteria negative SCS and that usually observed for SCS is probably due to the fact that the former refers to a mix of repeatable healthy animals  animals that have recovered from infection  and infected animals with incorrect diagnosis. On the contrary  SCS in infected animals are mostly truly positive samples  and the low heritability actually reflects that most of the variation in these samples is non-genetic. The high environmental variance for the bacteria positive SCS is possibly due to the nature of the pathogens (i.e. hosts may respond differently to infection by a pathogen or another) and the sinusoidal variation of SCC after infection  both of which would increase variation in the dataset. Estimated repeatabilities were similar for the two sub-datasets. Repeatability estimates within lactations ranged between 0.20 and 0.29  and were in the range reported in the literature for sheep i.e. 0.22 to 0.38 [    ]. However  repeatability estimates across lactations ranged between 0.30 and 0.33  and were higher than the value of 0.13 reported by Serrano et al. [] for the Manchega breed. The estimated genetic correlation between bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS (0.62) is positive and moderate  but significantly less than unity. Therefore  our results suggest that bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS may be partially independent traits  possibly with different heritabilities. It might be hypothesized that ewes with high bacteria negative SCS also have a higher reaction  in terms of increase in SCS  in response to an infection. It has to be taken into account that the genetic correlation might partially reflect the fact that the dataset of bacteria negative SCS animals also includes previously infected animals. However  a somewhat different interpretation is possible. The bacteria positive SCS actually consists of the bacteria negative SCS (i.e. the SCS ewes would have had in the absence of infection) along with the true response to infection. Therefore  it is likely that the positive genetic correlation is picking up the baseline that is contributing to both measures  with the true response (i.e. the extra) SCS possibly being uncorrelated. The sum of the two results in a trait that is genetically correlated with bacteria negative SCS  but has a low phenotypic correlation (0.19). The exploration of sensitivity and specificity suggests that imperfect diagnosis of the infection has only minor impacts on the correlation  with the impacts becoming large only when the diagnostic tests are very poor. Very few data on intramammary infection assessed by bacteriological analyses are found in the literature  and published studies refer more directly and exhaustively to udder health status. In cattle  heritabilities for intramammary infection varied from 0.02 to 0.04 as reported by Weller et al. []  and were somewhat higher (0.10 to 0.20) in Detilleux et al. [] and Wanner et al. []. Our value of 0.09 falls into the mid range of published values. However  an important result we found was that with imperfect  and  particularly    the heritability of liability is likely to be substantially underestimated. In other words  there may truly be more genetic variation for liability to mastitis than the field data suggest. No estimates  however  are reported for the genetic correlation between bacteria negative SCS and the infection status. Our results  perhaps surprisingly  suggest a positive genetic correlation between bacteria negative SCS and liability  suggesting that animals with higher bacteria negative SCS are more liable to have mastitis. This is a result that requires independent validation but it does suggest that the approach of selecting animals for decreased SCS  even in the absence of knowledge about infection status  is correct and will help to reduce the prevalence of mastitis. The choice of diagnosis criteria is important  as it affects the probability that healthy animals are truly diagnosed as healthy and that infected animals are classified as such. Therefore  as our results have shown  biases may be quite large when diagnostic criteria are not sensitive or specific enough. Our results show that the imperfect diagnosis of infection has an impact on estimated genetic parameters  particularly the heritability of liability  and some of the inferences drawn from the data. Bacteriological examination is often considered to be the 'golden standard' for routine detection and identification of major mastitis pathogens  and is usually assumed to be perfect  i.e.  =  = 1. However  even good quality bacteriological or clinical mastitis data will most likely have true  and  values somewhat less than one. Some cases will be missed  others may be mis-diagnosed. Hence  the answers we get may not be quite what we think they are  and we may well be underestimating the impacts of mastitis and the potential for selecting animals for enhanced resistance. Our results suggest that bacteria negative and bacteria positive SCS may be partially independent traits  confirming that SCC from healthy and infected animals should be analyzed separately. Moreover  a positive genetic correlation between bacteria negative SCS and liability to mastitis was found  suggesting that the approach of selecting animals for decreased SCS will help to reduce the prevalence of mastitis. However  our results show that the imperfect diagnosis of infection has an impact on estimated genetic parameters. Hence  the impacts of mastitis and the potential for selecting animals for enhanced resistance may well be underestimated.

Furthermore  the new algorithm showed much faster Markov chain mixing properties for genetic parameters (similar to the sire-dam model). The new algorithm to estimate genetic parameters via Gibbs sampling solves the bias problems typically occurring in animal threshold model analysis of binary traits with one observation per animal. Furthermore  the method considerably speeds up mixing properties of the Gibbs sampler with respect to genetic parameters  which would be an advantage of any linear or non-linear animal model. Animal models are the most widely used for the genetic evaluation of Gaussian traits. An animal model can account for non-random mating and complex data structures including phenotypes of both parents and offspring  which is likely to cause bias in sire- or sire-dam models. Furthermore  in practical selection  animal models are necessary for optimal selection among individuals with their own phenotypic information  and the animal model is thus the most relevant from an animal breeding perspective []. However  animal threshold models applied to cross-sectional binary data (one observation per individual) have been shown to give a biased estimation of genetic parameters  particularly in the presence of numerous fixed effect classes [–]  and genetic variance has been shown to \"blow up\" to unreasonably high values when using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (e.g.  the Gibbs sampler). Treating contemporary groups and other relevant effects as \"random\" or increasing the number of observations per subclass may to some extent overcome these problems  but is not optimal and cannot be considered as an universal solution []. Instead  binary data are often modeled through sire or sire-dam threshold models  but  as stated above  this is not appropriate for all data structures  as parents with individual records may cause bias in estimating genetic parameters. Another widely used option is to use linear models  even though this is statistically inappropriate for binary data. Still  predicted breeding values from linear and threshold models have shown good agreement in a number of studies [e.g.  [–]]. The bias typically associated with animal threshold models should not be confused with general extreme-category problems (when all observations within a fixed category belong to one of the binary classes)  as the latter may cause bias for threshold models in general. The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm to estimate genetic (co)variance components using Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling that solves the estimation problems commonly seen in cross-sectional animal threshold models. The proposed method is also applicable in other types of statistical models  and is generally expected to improve Markov chain mixing properties of the genetic parameters. In a standard threshold (probit) model  the observed binary records () are assumed fully determined by an underlying liability ()  such that: i.e.  the threshold value is set to zero. In matrix notation the threshold animal model can be written as: where:  = vector of all    = vector of \"fixed\" effects   = vector of random additive genetic effects of all individuals   = vector of random residuals  and  and  are the appropriate incidence matrices.  and   where  is the additive genetic relationship matrix of all individuals  is an identity matrix with dimension equal to number of records  and  and  are the additive genetic and residual variances  respectively. As usual for probit threshold models   is restricted to be 1. In the following  the vector  will be split in two sub-vectors:   where includes breeding values of all parents (informative)  while includes breeding values of non-parents (non-informative). The breeding values of non-parent animals can also be written as: = ½+   where is an incidence matrix assigning parents to each individual and  (in the absence of inbreeding) is a vector of Mendelian sampling deviations. The prior density of breeding values can be expressed as: where is the additive relationship matrix for sires and dams. As Mendelian sampling deviations of non-parents are independent of the mid-parent means  they can only be inferred from the phenotype(s) on the animal itself. For cross-sectional binary data  both the corresponding residual and the Mendelian sampling deviation are inferred from a single liability only  and are thus not identifiable (on the likelihood level) and completely confounded. Hence  these two parameters can be combined as in a reduced animal model: where . Furthermore as  and  are not identifiable on the likelihood level  the corresponding variances (and thus also the variances of  and ) cannot be identified either. In threshold models  it is common to restrict  to be 1  and similar restrictions may also be imposed on the variance of   which can be restricted to  (half the current sample of the genetic variance). In the new algorithm  breeding values of all individuals (conditional on covariance components and liabilities) are sampled as in a standard animal model. However  the method differs from the standard animal model with respect to sampling of genetic covariance components. In a standard model  genetic variance is sampled conditional on all breeding values (both and ). Assuming an univariate model  the fully conditional density of the genetic variance is: which is in the form of a scale inverted chi-square distribution with  (dimension of ) degrees of freedom and scale parameter ()  where . However  as stated above  the breeding values included in are not informative with respect to additive genetic variance. In the new algorithm  sampling of genetic (co)variance components is therefore solely based on parental breeding values ()  i.e.  between-family variation  and the fully conditional density of genetic variance is thus: which is in the form of a scale inverted chi-square distribution with  (number of parents) degrees of freedom and scale parameter   where  = is a vector of parent breeding values (which has identifiable variance)   is the appropriate (r × q) design matrix (identifying \"informative\" individuals)  and is the additive relationship matrix for the individuals included in (parents). Note also that the fully conditional density of the new algorithm is proportional to the fully conditional density of additive genetic (sire-dam) variance under a sire-dam model: where  and  is a vector of additive genetic sire and dam effects (transmitting abilities). Although shown in a univariate setting  the proposed algorithm can easily be extended to a multivariate model. A total of 10 replicate data sets were generated. Each data set consisted of 2000 individuals with one binary observation each. Animals with data were the offspring of 100 sires and 200 dams  i.e.  each sire was mated with two dams and each dam was mated with one sire (typical design for aquaculture breeding schemes)  and full-sib families consisted of 10 offspring. For simplicity  sires and dams were assumed unrelated. Underlying liabilities were sampled following standard assumptions (i.e.  residual variance was set to 1 and the threshold value set to zero)  assuming a heritability of 0.20 (i.e.  additive genetic variance was  = 0.25). The expected incidence rate was 50% (i.e.  overall mean on the liability scale was zero). Ideally  the effect of the new algorithm should be investigated in datasets where estimation problems are likely to occur  e.g.  in datasets having a high number of fixed effect classes. Since the simulated fixed structure was rather simple (including an overall mean only)  more complex fixed structures were imposed in the subsequent analysis by randomly assigning observations to 80 different fixed effect dummy classes (25 observations per class). Hence  numerous fixed effects were estimated in the subsequent analysis  although no real difference existed between them. To avoid creating additional extreme-category problems  the generated fixed effect structure of each replicate was checked to ensure that both binary categories were represented within each fixed class. The MATLAB software was used to generate and analyze data. All models included a Gibbs sampling chain of 25 000 rounds (5000 burn-in and 20 000 sampling rounds). Sire-dam models are widely used and considered appropriate to analyze such data (as no parents had individual records). Therefore  for comparison purposes the data sets were analyzed using two animal threshold models (standard and new algorithm) and a sire-dam threshold model. with parameters as described above. Here  the vector  had 80 subclasses. Two different Gibbs sampling schemes were used: : A standard Gibbs sampling scheme  using common algorithms for all parameters (including the genetic variance). For each round of the Gibbs sampler  heritability was calculated as: . : Same model as AnimA  except that additive genetic variance was sampled using the new algorithm as described above. Heritability was calculated as in model AnimA. where  is a vector of additive genetic effects of sires and dams (transmitting abilities)  is an appropriate incidence matrix for parents and the other parameters are as described above. Here  . Figure  shows a trace plot of heritability samples from a standard animal model (AnimA) applied to a simulated dataset (replicate 1). The plot clearly illustrates poor mixing  and a Gibbs sampler that never \"converges\". Heritability samples approach unity towards the end of the sampling period  i.e.  genetic variance approaches infinity. Figure  shows the corresponding trace plot of heritability samples obtained for the same dataset using an identical animal model  but where the genetic variance was sampled using the new algorithm (AnimB). Here  mixing was much faster  and the samples were within a reasonable parameter space  given an input heritability of 0.20. Finally  the same dataset was analyzed using a standard sire-dam model (SireDam)  and very similar results (Figure ) as AnimB were obtained (after appropriate rescaling). . All samples from a Gibbs sampling chain (replicate 1) consisting of 25 000 iterations are shown; genetic variance is sampled based on the standard algorithm . All samples from a Gibbs sampling chain (replicate 1) consisting of 25 000 iterations are shown; genetic variance is sampled based on the new algorithm . All samples from a Gibbs sampling chain (replicate 1) consisting of 25 000 iterations are shown; genetic variance is sampled based on the standard algorithm Averaged over the 10 replicates  posterior means of the heritability (Table ) for AnimB and SireDam were both 0.25 (ranging from 0.17 to 0.37). Within each replicate  the two models gave almost identical posterior means of heritability (mean absolute difference was 3 * 10). Still  some replicates of both AnimB and SireDam showed a tendency towards overestimated heritability. However  as the same results were obtained with both the SireDam and the AnimB models  this bias was not related to the new algorithm  but more likely resulted from problems with the data structure (e.g.  number of records and fixed effect structure). In contrast  the standard animal model (AnimA) resulted in severely overestimated heritabilities  as genetic variance drifted towards infinity for all replicates (as exemplified in Figure ). The AnimA model was also analyzed with a Metropolis-Hastings random walk algorithm to estimate genetic variance  where breeding values were integrated out of the likelihood. However  the latter method gave essentially the same result as previously seen for AnimA with genetic variance drifting towards infinity (results not shown). Although similar posterior means of heritability were obtained using the AnimB and SireDam models  posterior standard deviations of the heritability were generally slightly higher for the SireDam model (Table ). However  a preliminary analysis showed that this discrepancy was largely removed if residual variance of the SireDam model was restricted to   rather than  = 1 (results not shown). Severe bias was observed for a cross-sectional standard animal threshold model (AnimA) when applied to small data sets with unfavorable fixed effect structures (deliberately chosen to create estimation problems). For all 10 replicates  the AnimA model resulted in genetic variance drifting towards infinity (both using standard Gibbs sampling and a random walk algorithm). However  the problems associated with animal models were solved by employing the new algorithm to sample additive genetic variance (AnimB)  resulting in essentially identical heritability estimates as an appropriate sire-dam threshold model (SireDam). Both AnimB and SireDam models showed a tendency towards overestimated heritabilities in some replicates  which may be explained by the small and unfavorably structured datasets. Consequently  apparent differences between the fixed effect classes may be incorrectly accounted for by the model  resulting in overestimated heritability. Nevertheless  this problem was equally expressed in the AnimB and SireDam models  and thus it is not a result of the new algorithm. The bias typically seen in animal threshold models (AnimA) may be explained by an interaction between the random and fixed effects of the model  i.e.  preliminary analyses revealed that all models were seemingly appropriate for a simple fixed effect structure (overall mean only). Hence  the problem has some similarities with classical extreme-category problems (ECP)  which occur when all observations within a fixed class belong to the same binary category (which was not the case here). Typically  ECP are avoided by defining the relevant effects as random. In a cross-sectional threshold model  the animal classes are defined as random  but the classes are always extreme (one observation per animal). Hence  our hypothesis is that  given unknown genetic variance  classical animal models may still cause ECP in some cases. For increasing genetic variance  the random animal effects will increasingly resemble fixed effects  potentially resulting in ECP at some point during the Markov chain. The risk of this is likely to increase with the number of fixed effect classes in the data (as this would increase uncertainty of genetic parameters). As observed in this study  the sampled genetic variance in the AnimA model varies substantially until it eventually reaches such large values that the chain seemingly enters an absorbing state (Figure ). Furthermore  the putative genetic variance has different impacts on parental and non-parental breeding values  which may explain the better results obtained with AnimB (and SireDam). Given high putative genetic variance  non-parental breeding values would be increasingly confounded with the associated (and extreme) liabilities  while parental breeding values would be based on the liabilities of multiple offspring (normally on both sides of the threshold)  making the latter less extreme (and closer to the true values). Hence  based on AnimB and SireDam  sampled genetic variance is likely to quickly stabilize at appropriate values. The results indicate that the AnimB model gives slightly lower posterior standard deviations for the heritability compared with the SireDam model. This may be explained by differences in the definition of phenotypic variance of liability in the two models. For an animal threshold model  the phenotypic variance is:   and the heritability is thus  while for a sire-dam threshold model  the phenotypic variance is:   and the heritability is . Hence  a proportional change in the genetic (sire-dam) variance of the two models will have a larger effect on the heritability in a sire-dam model. However  we do know that the residual variance of a sire-dam model (in the absence of inbreeding) necessarily includes half the additive genetic variance   and the residual variance may thus be restricted to:   with the corresponding heritability being:   which is analogous to the heritability of an animal model. As expected  preliminary analyses showed that the latter type of restriction largely removed the discrepancies between posterior standard deviations of heritability for the SireDam and AnimB models. The proposed algorithm is not only relevant in threshold model analyses of cross-sectional binary data (one observation per individual)  it is also of particular relevance in the analysis of time-until-event and sequential binary data. In the latter type of data  repeated records may exist for each individual  but one of the binary categories (e.g.  dead) terminates the recording period. In the presence of time-dependent or stage-specific fixed effects  variances of individual random effects (e.g.  permanent environment and Mendelian sampling terms) are non-identifiable for such traits []  which may lead to bias in animal-  sire- or sire-dam models  either as a result of biased estimates of additive genetic variance components (animal model) and/or as a result of lacking ability to account for covariance among observations on the same individual (sire- and sire-dam models). Given that genetic (co)variance components can be accurately estimated  an animal model will properly account for genetic covariance between repeated observations on the same individual. However  in sequential binary data  an animal model (including AnimB) will be unable to identify covariance structures explained by individual permanent environmental effects. Across traits  Mendelian sampling deviations of non-parents are  in most cases  completely confounded with either residuals (cross-sectional data) or permanent environmental effects (longitudinal data). Thus  non-parent individuals can usually be regarded as \"non-informative\" under sampling of additive genetic variance without any loss of information. In preliminary analyses  we also applied the AnimA and AnimB models to data sets with repeated (non-sequential) binary records for each individual  assuming the existence of permanent environmental effects. As expected  both models gave essentially identical results  but the AnimB model showed better Markov chain mixing properties (results not shown). Hence  even in cases where a standard animal model is expected to give unbiased results (e.g.  Gaussian traits  or repeated  non-sequential binary data)  applying the new algorithm is expected to improve mixing of additive genetic parameters (being similar to a sire-dam model). In this study  all parents had multiple offspring with data and were therefore considered \"informative\" with respect to additive genetic (co)variance components. However  this would not be true for parents/ancestors having only a single descendant with data. Therefore  if present  such individuals should be defined as \"non-informative\" in sampling of additive genetic (co)variance components. The new algorithm to estimate genetic (co)variance components is now implemented as an option in the Gibbs sampling module of the DMU statistical software package []  where it is adapted to handle multivariate genetic analyses including binary  ordered categorical and Gaussian traits. The new Gibbs sampling algorithm (AnimB) allows appropriate estimation of genetic (co)variance components for animal threshold models. In contrast  a standard animal threshold model (AnimA) applied to the same data sets resulted in samples of genetic variance drifting towards infinity. Given that the data sets could be appropriately analyzed (no parental phenotypes) with a sire-dam threshold model (SireDam)  the SireDam and AnimB models yielded essentially identical results. Furthermore  AnimB is also expected to improve Markov chain mixing properties of animal models in general  and may therefore be advantageous in all types of animal models using Gibbs sampling. The new algorithm is now implemented as an option in the Gibbs sampling module of the DMU software package for multivariate genetic analysis.

The approach suggested here based on the use of Yakutian cryo-bank semen can be easily extended to cryo-bank materials of other animals in future breeding programs. Yakutian cattle are the last remaining native cattle breed of the East Asian 'Turano-Mongolian' type of  in Siberia. They are distributed in the north-eastern region of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation [–]. These cattle possess a number of traits  such as solid trunk  short strong legs and long thick winter coat  which make them adapted to the extreme sub-arctic conditions. Moreover  efficient thermoregulation  quick formation of subcutaneous fatty tissue and low metabolic rates at low temperatures (even down to -60°C) allow them to survive in harsh environments under poor feed conditions (e.g. []). Ancestors of Yakutian cattle can be traced back to indigenous cattle in Siberia  which migrated with the Yakuts . 1 000 years ago from the southern Baikal region to the northern regions of the Lena and Yana rivers. Yakutian cattle were purebred until 1929 and  from then on  were subjected to extensive crossbreeding with productive breeds []. Consequently  only . 1200 purebred Yakutian cattle individuals remain in three villages in the district of Eveno-Bytantaisky  one village of Uluu-Syhyy and four different farms close to Yakutsk City []. Currently the population comprises only 525 breeding cows and 28 breeding bulls. Yakutian cattle are classified as an endangered breed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) []. However  recent studies in a continental context have suggested that this breed is highly interesting for the conservation of cattle genetic diversity [  ]. There is a need to conserve the breed for future cattle breeding actions as well as for scientific and cultural purposes. Maintaining genetic variability and avoiding inbreeding are of great importance in the management of small animal populations. Inbreeding has a negative effect on fitness  productivity and several other phenotypic traits []. Meanwhile  a reduction in gene and allele diversity might reduce a population's response to environmental changes or artificial selection in the future [  ]. Thus   banking of embryos  oocytes and semen plays a fundamental role in the conservation and management of small farm animal breeds []. Storage of genetic material represents a reservoir of a breed's genetic diversity and could be used to re-establish a breed  if needed. The only genetic material stored  for Yakutian cattle is the semen from six bulls collected between 1980 and 1986. However  because of the traditional free herding style of these cattle in summer pastures  where several bulls mate randomly within a herd  pedigree records of these six bulls are not available and  thus  the traditional pedigree-based control of inbreeding is impossible in a meaningful way. In the absence of pedigree records  molecular data from autosomal  maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or from paternally inherited Y-chromosomal markers can be used to estimate relatedness between animals [–]. The widely applied statistical approaches to infer relatedness among individuals can be classified into two categories: one involves the explicit pedigree reconstruction among all individuals in the sample; and the other is based on the best pairwise relationship between two individuals at a time based on either relatedness estimation [–] or likelihood techniques [  ]. The weakness of the pairwise methods is that they do not take into account information from the reference population and the difficulty in distinguishing among relationships with similar patterns of alleles (e.g. []). However  pedigree reconstruction methods have been applied mainly to the reconstruction of full-sib families []. Survival of the last native cattle breed in Siberia  Yakutian cattle  is important for the local human community as a source of food and income []  but also because it presents extreme adaptive potentials of the cattle species in general. However  due to the small census size  Yakutian cattle require a careful management strategy. Long-term cryo-conservation of embryos and semen should be considered seriously as they represent a resource for ongoing breeding activities and a secure way of preserving genetic diversity within the breed  should the living population encounter problems. Although molecular measures of genetic relatedness do not necessarily agree exactly with the true relatedness coefficients calculated from the pedigree records (but see [])  they are the best relatedness indicators in the absence of recorded pedigree information (e.g. []). Therefore  the specific goals of the current study were to estimate genetic relatedness among the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls using pairwise and pedigree reconstruction methods based on the analysis of autosomal microsatellites and mtDNA sequences. We have also assessed how much genetic variation such a limited  bank could add to the contemporary population of Yakutian cattle. Our aim was to solve a practical conservation problem in a highly valued cattle breed and to see how helpful basic population genetics analyses are in solving such a breed management question. Our results also provide recommendations for future conservation and use of the six cryo-bank semen. Genomic DNA was extracted from the frozen semen samples of six Yakutian cattle cryo-bank bulls (named Keskil  Moxsogol  Radzu  Erel  Sarial and Alii)  whose semen had been stored for more than 20 years  according to the method described by []. For the genetic diversity comparison  a reference population consisting of 54 randomly sampled Yakutian cattle individuals from the State farm in the village of Kustur (17 individuals) and from private farms in the villages of Batagai-Alyta (17)  Kustur (4) and Uluu-Syhyy (16) in the Sakha Republic were also included in the analysis []. The reference population included samples of 37 cows and 17 bulls  referred hereafter to as 'the cow subpopulation' and 'the bull subpopulation'  respectively. Genotypes of the reference population using the same set of 30 autosomal microsatellites were obtained from a previous study by Li et al. []. To determine the levels of mtDNA variability  DNA samples of the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls were sequenced for a 375-nucleotide fragment of the mtDNA control region using the primers published in []. The sequenced fragment covers bases 15 960 to 16 334 as compared to the complete cattle mtDNA sequence (NC006853). Standard double-stranded sequencing was performed with DYEnamic ET Terminator Kit (Amersham Biosciences) using the primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 10 µL of purified PCR-product on a MegaBACE™ 500 DNA Sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Complementary sequences were combined using the SEQUENCHER v4.6 software (Gene Codes Co  Ann Arbor  MI  USA). In addition  sequences of 24 random individuals from the reference population (accession numbers FJ014247-FJ014270) were obtained from a recent study []. The six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls and international reference animals were genotyped for the same set of 30 microsatellites (Table ) as described in []. Information on primers and PCR conditions can be found in the Cattle Diversity Database . To characterise the maternal lineages  multiple alignments of mtDNA sequences were performed using ClustalX version 1.81 []. The size of the aligned mtDNA control region fragment was 255 nucleotides between bases 16 021 and 16 275 compared to the complete cattle mtDNA sequence (NC006853). The number of haplotypes was estimated and pairwise genetic distances between haplotypes were calculated based on the number of nucleotide differences using MEGA version 3.1 []. Genetic variability of the autosomal microsatellite loci in the whole Yakutian cattle sample (60 individuals) was quantified by the observed number of alleles () and polymorphism information content (PIC) per locus using the program Microsatellite TOOLKIT []. Locus-wise tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) due to heterozygote deficiency were performed with 10 000 Monte Carlo randomisations [] and the 'U' statistic test [] as implemented in the programs GENEPOP version 4.0 [] and ML-Relate []  respectively. The program GENEPOP was also used in the Fisher's exact tests for genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD) between all pairs of microsatellites with a Markov chain method of 50 000 iterations and 100 batches. Relationships among the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls were estimated with the pairwise relatedness estimators   [] and  []  using the program SPAGeDi version 1.2 []. The calculation was based on autosomal microsatellite genotypes in all 60 individuals. Furthermore  pairwise relationships between the bulls were calculated with the maximum-likelihood estimator  using the program ML-Relate []. Performances of     and  were evaluated using a simulation approach as implemented in PEDAGOG []. Allele frequencies of the 30 microsatellites obtained from all 60 individuals were used as input data. Distribution of pairwise relatedness () estimates for each of the four simulated relationship categories [unrelated (UR)  half-sibs (HS)  full-sibs (FS)  and parent-offspring (PO)] was based on the simulated genotypes from 1000 individual-pairs each. The sampling variance was calculated as the standard deviation of the mean  estimate for each simulation category separately. The bias among estimators was tested by comparing the mean and the expected  values (UR 0.0; HS 0.25; FS and PO 0.5). Two-tailed -tests were used to evaluate the significance of potential bias. Critical significance values were adjusted for multiple tests with sequential Bonferroni correction. Pedigree reconstruction among all individuals in the sample was performed using PARENTAGE version 1.0 []. Two chains with burn-in of 200 iterations  thinning of 400 and 2000 samples were applied. A Dirichlet prior for the allele frequencies was used and the prior for the distribution of offspring between males and females was set to be gamma (1  2). Influence of the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls on the genetic variability of the reference population and the bull subpopulation were investigated by calculating basic statistics such as gene and allelic diversities. Molecular coancestry is similar to the genealogical coancestry coefficient [] but is defined as the probability that two alleles taken at random  one from each individual  are identical by state. To test if the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls were less related to the cow subpopulation (37 cows) than the bull subpopulation (17 bulls)  we used the program MOL_COANC version 1.0 [] to calculate the mean molecular coancestry for the whole Yakutian cattle population (60 individuals)  for the all the bulls (23 bulls comprising the six cryo-bank bulls and the 17 reference bulls)  for the 17 reference bulls  for six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls and for each of the 23 bulls separately. Mean molecular coancestry [] between each bull and every cow was also calculated. The difference between the bull subpopulation (17 reference bulls) and the group of six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls was tested using a two-sample permutation test by the Hothorn and Hornik exactRankTests version 0.8-12 package for the  language. Screening of the 255 nt fragment of the mtDNA control region identified 11 haplotypes defined by 17 variable sites that belong to the taurine mtDNA sub-haplogroups T2  T3 and T4 (Additional file ) [  ]. Six haplotypes were individual-specific  three haplotypes were shared by two samples  one haplotype was shared by four samples and the most common haplotype was shared by 14 individuals. MtDNA sequences of the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls (accession numbers FJ014464-FJ014469) were characterized by six different haplotypes  four of which were not observed in the contemporary samples (Additional file ). The average number of pairwise nucleotide differences among all 11 haplotypes was 3.78  ranging from 1 to 8 among pairs of comparison. The number of pairwise nucleotide differences among the six haplotypes observed in the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls varied from 2 to 7 with an average number of 4.53. We did not find any mtDNA haplotype shared by all six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls  which indicates that these bulls cannot be full-sibs or maternal half-sibs. One hundred and fifty alleles were detected in the 60 Yakutian cattle individuals across the 30 microsatellites. The number of observed alleles varied from 2 to 10 per locus (Table ). The average PIC across the loci for the complete sample was 0.532  with the lowest PIC observed at  (0.176) and the highest at  (0.685). No significant ( < 0.05) deviations from LE were observed in the pairwise microsatellite comparisons after sequential Bonferroni correction was applied. Significant ( < 0.05) heterozygote deficiency was detected only at  (Table )  which is probably due to the presence of non-amplifying alleles (e.g. []). It is also possible that the locus  is near a gene or within a genomic region under directional selection and this would be interesting to investigate further. We calculated pairwise relatedness estimates between the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls with and without the locus . These calculations of relatedness were further adjusted to accommodate non-amplifying alleles by the option as implemented in the ML-Relate program. Neither the exclusion of the locus nor the inclusion of the non-amplifying alleles had a significant effect on the relatedness estimates (not shown). Therefore  the results presented in the study are based on the full set of 30 microsatellites (Additional file ). Mean  and  estimates and their standard deviations calculated for four simulated relatedness distributions are presented in Additional file . Performances of both pairwise relatedness estimators were similar to each other with only minor differences in variance estimates.  had a slightly smaller (by 0.004) sampling variance for the distribution of UR individuals  while  performed better in the remaining categories (HS by 0.002  FS by 0.01 and PO by 0.015). In three out of eight cases  mean  deviated significantly from the expected value ( < 0.013 after sequential Bonferroni correction). The bias for  for UN pairs was downwards  while that for  and  in the category of PO was upwards (Additional file ). The performance of  was very similar to that of  (results not shown) apart from negative values being converted to zero relatedness. Ten out of 15 pairwise -estimates between the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls approached zero or fell below it. The remaining five bull-pairs exhibited -values ranging from 0.124 to 0.276 for  and from 0.180 to 0.295 for  (Additional file ). All pairwise  values were plotted on the distribution of four simulated relatedness categories (Figure ). When the  estimator was used  one pair (Radzu:Sarial   = 0.276) fell outside the 95% confidence interval for simulated UR individuals (the 95 upper quantile = 0.252) and was considered to be related (Figure ). Two other pairs were identified as related when the  estimator was applied (Keskil:Moxsogol   = 0.295; Radzu:Erel   = 0.255; the 95 upper quantile = 0.242) (Figure ). The ML-Relate program uses simulation to determine which relationships are consistent with genotype data and to compare putative relationships with alternatives. In order to identify possible misclassified individuals  a maximum-likelihood estimator  estimated by ML-Relate was applied. Besides the three bull-pairs mentioned above  the Erel:Sarial pair ( = 0.205;  = 0.180) had the highest likelihood of being a half-sib (Additional file ). The same four pairs of Yakutian cryo-bank bulls were also identified as potential half-sibs in the parentage analysis performed using the pedigree reconstruction method among all individuals in the sample (Additional file ). . Values are calculated using   and (  relatedness estimators plotted on a distribution of four simulated relationship categories: unrelated  half-sibs  full-sibs and parent-offspring; the vertical line represents the 95 percentile for simulated unrelated individuals; the position of pairwise values in regards to the Y-axis was designed based on the estimates from the  relatedness estimator and was calculated as 3 divided by the cases when the log likelihood of  for the second closest relationship is smaller than the most likely relationship; abbreviations for Yakutian cryo-bank bulls are: K-Keskil  M-Moxsogol  R-Radzu  E-Erel  S-Sarial  A-Alii. Y-axis denotes the distribution of posterior probability density based on the simulations of the four relationship categories using the two relatedness estimators  and   respectively. Inclusion of the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls in the calculation increases the within-population genetic variability relative to that in the contemporary reference population (Table ). For example  the six cryo-bank samples made it possible to add two new alleles at the locus  and their frequency in the cryo-bank samples is 0.083. Therefore  compared to the three alleles detected in the 54 contemporary samples from the reference population  a 67% gain in allelic variation was observed when including the six cryo-bank samples. With the six cryo-bank bulls  the average allelic diversity of the total Yakutian population increased by 3%  while the average allelic diversity of the bulls increased by 13%. Frequencies of alleles specific for the cryo-bank bulls ranged from 0.083 to 0.250. Three Yakutian cryo-bank bulls  Keskil  Radzu and Alii  carried alleles not detected in the contemporary Yakutian population. Furthermore  all six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls possessed microsatellite alleles that were not found in the contemporary bull subpopulation. The gene diversity would increase by 3.5% if the six cryo-bank bulls represented the total bull subpopulation in the next generation together with the contemporary cows. The increase in gene diversity would be 1.2% by adding cryo-bank bulls to the contemporary bull subpopulation in the calculation. The mean molecular coancestry was 0.416 for pairwise comparisons among all 60 Yakutian cattle individuals (Table ). The average molecular coancestry calculated between each Yakutian bull and the cows ranged from 0.344 to 0.465. Compared with the living contemporary bull subpopulation  the group of six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls showed a significantly lower (0.395 . 0.418; a permutation test between the two mean values   = 0.035) mean coancestry with the living contemporary cow subpopulation (Table ). This indicates that the cryo-bank bulls are good candidates as sires in a breeding program aimed at avoiding inbreeding. Knowledge on pairwise relatedness is crucial to draft recommendations for further use of cryo-bank bull semen in conservation and breeding programs of domestic animals. In this study  we have estimated pairwise relatedness among the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls with different estimators based on autosomal and mtDNA genetic variation. Our study has shown that molecular data provide a useful tool to estimate relatedness among individuals when pedigree data are unavailable. Moreover  the results clearly demonstrate the importance of  cryo-banking of genetic material in the conservation of rare domestic animal breeds. Our microsatellite analysis suggests that five of the 15 pairwise relatedness comparisons for the Yakutian cryo-bank bulls exhibited coefficients of relatedness () close to the theoretical expectations for half-sibs ( = 25%) and cousins ( = 12.5%). However  the two pairwise relatedness estimators identified different Yakutian bull-pairs as clear outliers compared to the simulated distribution of random individuals (Figure ). Relatedness estimates for simulated unrelated pairs have a very wide distribution: the 95th percentiles ( = 0.242 and  = 0.252) are very near or above the theoretical expectation for half-sibs ( = 0.25). This indicates that the 30 microsatellite markers used here are insufficient for an unequivocal separation of related and unrelated individuals. The number and genetic variability of markers as well as population structure might affect the robustness of different methods in the calculation of relatedness between individuals. It has been also demonstrated that there is no single best-performing estimation method to distinguish between all possible types of relatedness [–]. In this study   worked better for the simulated categories of related individuals that are important in solving relatedness questions among Yakutian cryo-bank bulls. The approach by [] is robust for a small sample size and in the cases when the reference population includes unidentified relatives. These assumptions match closely the situation of the Yakutian population studied and therefore could explain the better performance of the estimator. Thirty markers seems to be sufficient to identify PO's or FS's  but fails to separate HS's or more distant relatedness categories unequivocally. Additional simulations have demonstrated that a set of as many as 500 microsatellites would be needed for much more accurate estimates of  with lower standard deviations (results not presented). Our results agree with previous suggestions that a large number of microsatellite loci are needed for unequivocal clarification of pedigrees []. Alternatively  using advanced SNP-microchips with thousands of SNP could provide a solution (e.g. []). MtDNA sequence analysis has shown that the Yakutian cryo-bank bulls do not share any mtDNA haplotype. Nucleotide substitutions accumulate approximately 5 to 10 times faster in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA [] and cases of mtDNA mutation fixation within one generation have been described in Holstein cattle []. However  the smallest pairwise differences between haplotypes observed in Yakutian cryo-bank bulls were two nucleotides. As a result of heteroplasmy  the sons of a dam can have different mtDNA haplotypes. However  no heteroplasmy was detected in the present study. The mtDNA sequence analysis suggests that there are no full-sibs or maternal half-sibs among the Yakutian cryo-bank bulls. Although four Y chromosome-specific microsatellites (     and ; see []) are monomorphic in the population []  the mean relatedness based on the autosomal microsatellites shows that there are four potential half-sib pairs among the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls. The six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls appear to represent an important source of additional allelic variation and gene diversity for the Yakutian bull subpopulation as well as for the total Yakutian population. A high level of genetic diversity would determine the fitness of individuals and would affect the potential response of a population to immediate natural or artificial selection []. In a small population  misclassifying related individuals as unrelated (type II error) will result in underestimating relatedness within the population and  thus  represents a risk of increased inbreeding rate in subsequent generations. Therefore  we are more concerned about minimizing the occurrence of type II errors rather than the presence of type I errors  where unrelated individuals are identified as related. In the conservation program for the Yakutian cattle  we recommend that four Yakutian cryo-bank bull-pairs  Keskil:Moxsogol  Radzu:Sarial  Erel:Sarial and also Radzu:Erel  are treated as half-sibs or individuals otherwise having relatedness up to 25%. In an endangered population  choosing optimal individuals for mating and designing an appropriate mating scheme can help to monitor the genetic variation and the average relatedness among individuals. It has been shown that mating individuals with minimal average coancestries will maximize the population's genetic diversity in terms of expected heterozygosity [  ]. In our study  23 Yakutian bulls are candidate sires for the subsequent generation. However  as compared with the contemporary 17 bulls  the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls show significantly lower average molecular coancestries with the cow population. Using the six cryo-bank semen in artificial insemination would help to control the rate of inbreeding in following generations. The choice of the mating system is complicated because of the time scale of interest. From a short-term perspective  a simple breeding scheme could be suggested  whereby a population is subdivided into several groups and rotation mating among these groups is performed []. In the rotation mating scheme  breeding cows are from the same group as the sire  while breeding bulls are from a different group. Although this scheme will not reduce the degree of inbreeding in the long-run  a more even distribution of inbreeding among individuals would be achieved. Furthermore  it would guarantee that each line produces progeny that will be used for breeding in the next generation. On the basis of the pairwise relatedness among the six Yakutian cryo-bank bulls  we suggest to split them into three separate groups in the rotation mating  with Alii alone in another group  Keskil and Moxogol in one group  and Radzu  Erel and Sarial in a third group. With the Yakutian cattle as an example  our results indicate that even a limited number of semen samples selected for the long-term cryo-banking can represent a considerable potential to maintain within-population genetic variability. Therefore  we recommend enrichment of the cryo-bank by adding semen of unrelated bulls with new genetic variability from the current living population. We have shown that when pedigree documentation is unavailable  even a limited number of molecular markers can help to make effective breeding mating schemes  though a larger set of markers would be desirable. We conclude that the present strategy with the help of molecular data can be applied to other animal species or even plants where the reduction of inbreeding and the preservation of genetic variation are important concerns.

"Genetic parameters for social effects on survival in cannibalistic layers: Combining survival analysis and a linear animal model"	"Authors: Esther D Ellen  Vincent Ducrocq  Bart J Ducro  Roel F Veerkamp and Piter Bijma"	"Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre  Wageningen University  Marijkeweg 40  6709PG  Wageningen  The NetherlandsEsther D Ellen  Bart J Ducro & Piter Bijma UMR 1313 GABI  INRA  78352  Jouy-en-Josas  FranceVincent Ducrocq Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre  Wageningen UR Livestock Research  8200AB  Lelystad  The NetherlandsRoel F Veerkamp"	"No Co-Author"	"7 July 2010"	"BackgroundMortality due to cannibalism in laying hens is a difficult trait to improve genetically  because censoring is high (animals still alive at the end of the testing period) and it may depend on both the individual itself and the behaviour of its group members  so-called associative effects (social interactions). To analyse survival data  survival analysis can be used. However  it is not possible to include associative effects in the current software for survival analysis. A solution could be to combine survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects. This paper presents a two-step approach (2STEP)  combining survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects (LAM).MethodsData of three purebred White Leghorn layer lines from Institut de Sélection Animale B.V.  a Hendrix Genetics company  were used in this study. For the statistical analysis  survival data on 16 780 hens kept in four-bird cages with intact beaks were used. Genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time were estimated using 2STEP. Cross validation was used to compare 2STEP with LAM. LAM was applied directly to estimate genetic parameters for social effects on observed survival days.ResultsUsing 2STEP  total heritable variance  including both direct and associative genetic effects  expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance  ranged from 32% to 64%. These results were substantially larger than when using LAM. However  cross validation showed that 2STEP gave approximately the same survival curves and rank correlations as LAM. Furthermore  cross validation showed that selection based on both direct and associative genetic effects  using either 2STEP or LAM  gave the best prediction of survival time.ConclusionIt can be concluded that 2STEP can be used to estimate genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time in laying hens.

To analyse survival data  survival analysis can be used. However  it is not possible to include associative effects in the current software for survival analysis. A solution could be to combine survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects. This paper presents a two-step approach (2STEP)  combining survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects (LAM). Data of three purebred White Leghorn layer lines from Institut de Sélection Animale B.V.  a Hendrix Genetics company  were used in this study. For the statistical analysis  survival data on 16 780 hens kept in four-bird cages with intact beaks were used. Genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time were estimated using 2STEP. Cross validation was used to compare 2STEP with LAM. LAM was applied directly to estimate genetic parameters for social effects on observed survival days. Using 2STEP  total heritable variance  including both direct and associative genetic effects  expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance  ranged from 32% to 64%. These results were substantially larger than when using LAM. However  cross validation showed that 2STEP gave approximately the same survival curves and rank correlations as LAM. Furthermore  cross validation showed that selection based on both direct and associative genetic effects  using either 2STEP or LAM  gave the best prediction of survival time. It can be concluded that 2STEP can be used to estimate genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time in laying hens. Using 2STEP increased the heritable variance in survival time. Cross validation showed that social genetic effects contribute to a large difference in survival days between two extreme groups. Genetic selection targeting both direct and associative effects is expected to reduce mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens. Mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens is a worldwide economic  health  and welfare problem  occurring in all types of commercial poultry housing systems []. Due to the likely prohibition of beak-trimming in the European Union in the near future  this problem will increase if no further actions are taken  and  therefore  needs to be solved urgently. One of the possibilities is to use genetic selection [  ]. However  selection for lower mortality has not been very effective in most cases []. First  heritabilities of mortality are low  ranging between 3.2% and 9.9%  leading to low accuracy [–]. Second  censoring is high (animals still alive at the end of the testing period have no record on survival time) []  leading to low accuracy as well. Third  traditional methods for selection against mortality can lead to unfavourable response to selection  because these methods ignore the social effect an individual has on it's group members (so-called social interactions) [  –]. Heritabilities for survival traits are often estimated using a linear animal model [  ]. However  a linear animal model does not take into account the fact that some animals are still alive at the end of the testing period (so-called censored records)  for these animals the true survival days is unknown. Furthermore  linear models do not properly account for the nature of survival data  because survival data are usually heavily skewed []. Survival analysis [] appropriately accounts for both censoring and non-normality in the data. Survival analysis is used to examine either the length of time an individual survives or the length of time until an event occurs. Models for survival analysis can be built from a hazard function  which measures the risk of an event to occur  given that the individual has survived up to time [  ]. Social interactions occur when individuals are kept together in a group. Wolf [] has mentioned that the environment provided by group members is often the most important component of the environment experienced by an individual in that group. There is clear evidence that social interactions contribute to the heritable variation in traits [      –]. For instance  social interactions have a substantial genetic effect on mortality due to cannibalism [        –]. Bijma et al. [] and Ellen et al. [] have found that / to / of the heritable variation in survival days is due to social interactions. To reduce mortality due to cannibalism  the classical model for a given genotype must be extended to consider not only the individuals' direct effect of its own genes  but also the associative genetic effect of the individual on the phenotypes of its group members []. Muir [] has clearly shown that selection methods targeting both direct and associative genetic effects (group selection) results in a decrease in mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens  whereas selection based on only the direct genetic effect (individual selection) results in an increase in mortality []. Furthermore  Muir [] has found that  in Japanese quail  group selection results in decreased mortality and increased bodyweight. However  so far associative genetic effects have not been implemented in existing software for survival analysis. To analyse data on mortality due to cannibalism  a solution might be to combine survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects. Ducrocq et al. [] have proposed a two-step approach for multiple trait evaluation of longevity and production traits in dairy cattle  which faces similar problems. The two-step approach is a combination of survival analysis and a linear animal model. In the first step  survival analysis is performed to compute the so-called pseudo-records and their associated weights. Pseudo-records can be regarded as the result in the data of a linearization of the model. When analysed with a simple linear animal model  pseudo-records weighted appropriately lead to the same estimated genetic values as the initial survival model used to compute them. In the second step  genetic parameters on pseudo-records with their associated weights are estimated using a linear animal model. In this paper  we apply a similar two-step approach to estimate genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time in laying hens. In the second step  we will use the linear animal model including associative effects to estimate genetic parameters [    ]. For the remaining part of the paper  we will refer to the linear animal model including associative effects as LAM and to the two-step approach as 2STEP. Cross validation will be used to compare 2STEP with LAM [  ]. LAM was applied directly to estimate genetic parameters for social effects on observed survival days. For the cross validation  the predicted hazard rate will be estimated using 2STEP and the predicted phenotype will be estimated using LAM. To judge the performance of both methods  predicted phenotypes or hazard rates will be compared with the observed phenotype. For this study  the same data were used as described in Ellen et al. []. The main characteristics are summarized below and further details are in []. Data of three purebred White Leghorn layer lines from Institut de Sélection Animale B.V.  a Hendrix Genetics company  were used in this study. The three lines were coded: W1  WB  and WF. For each line  observations on survival time of a single generation were used. Chickens of each line were hatched in two batches  each batch consisting of four age groups  differing by two weeks each. All chickens had intact beaks. When the hens were on average 17 weeks old  they were transported to two laying houses with traditional four-bird-battery cages. Each batch was placed in another laying house. In both laying houses  the 17-week-old hens were allocated to laying cages  with four birds of the same line and age in a cage. The individuals making up a cage were combined at random. In both laying houses  cages were grouped into eight double rows. Each row consisted of three levels (top  close to the light; middle; and bottom). A feeding trough was in front of the cages  and each pair of back-to-back cages shared two drinking nipples. Sires used for both laying houses were largely the same while dams were different. For all three lines  sires and dams were mated at random. Each sire was mated to approximately eight dams  and each dam contributed on average 12.3 female offspring. Five generations of pedigree were included in the calculation of the relationship matrix (). To avoid pedigree errors  hens with unknown identification or double identification were coded as having an unknown pedigree ( = 101). The observations on these hens were included in the analysis to better estimate fixed effects. All hens were observed daily. Dead hens were removed from the cages and not replaced  and wing band number and cage number were recorded. The study was ended when hens were on average 75 weeks old. For each hen  information was collected on survival and number of survival days. Survival was defined as alive or dead (0/1) at the end of the study. From these data  the survival rate was calculated as the percentage of laying hens still alive at the end of the study. Survival days were defined as the number of days from the start of the study (day of transport to laying houses) till either death or the end of the study. Hens that died before the end of the study were referred to as a failure (event = 1)  whereas hens still alive at the end of the study were referred to as censored (event = 0). In total  196 hens were removed from the study  due to reasons other than mortality. These hens were referred to as censored (event = 0). For the statistical analysis  6 276 records were used for line W1; 6 916 for line WB; and 3 588 for line WF. Data were analysed separately for each line. Two methods to estimate genetic parameters were compared: 1) LAM  a linear animal model including direct and associative effects applied directly to the observed survival days; this procedure is described in detail in []  and 2) 2STEP  a two-step approach []. In the first step of 2STEP  data were analysed using survival analysis as implemented in the survival kit V5 []  to produce pseudo-records as defined below. Survival analysis allows the combination of information from hens still alive at the end of the study (censored records) as well as hens that died (uncensored records). In the second step  genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on pseudo-records were estimated using a linear animal model [  ]  implemented in ASReml []. Data were analysed using the Cox animal model []. The Cox model can deal with non-linearity  censoring  and non-normal residuals. The model included a fixed effect for each combination of laying house  row  and level  and for average survival days in the back cage to account for a possible effect of the back neighbours []. Age was fully confounded with laying house and row and  therefore  not included as a fixed effect. All the fixed effects were significant. Using survival analysis results in a breeding value ( ) and an associated weight ( ) for each hen . It can be shown that  is the estimated cumulative risk of animal  from time 0 to censoring time or death  and is therefore a function of the (possibly censored) length of life of hen   her censoring code ( = 0/1)  and the fixed effects in the model []. The pseudo-record for survival time of animal  was []: where  is the censoring code of individual  ( = 1 if animal  is uncensored;  = 0 if animal  is censored);  is the estimated direct breeding value of individual ; and  is the associated weight of individual . Pseudo-records are functions of the data and of the effects estimated in the survival model  such that when a straightforward BLUP animal genetic evaluation is applied on these pseudo-records  the same estimated breeding values are obtained as in the initial survival model. To verify 2STEP  pseudo-records with appropriate weights were analysed to estimate breeding values with a univariate BLUP animal model  with a heterogeneous residual variance  for animal . The correlation between the estimated breeding values of 2STEP and the estimated breeding values of the survival analysis was calculated []. As expected  this correlation was one and the estimated breeding values were the same. Thus the computation of pseudo-records in 2STEP was correct. To estimate variances and covariances for direct and associative effects  using the pseudo-records and associated weights from step 1  the model of Muir [] and Bijma et al. [] was used: where  is a vector of the pseudo-records ;  is a vector of direct breeding values  with incidence matrix  linking observations on individuals to their direct breeding value;  is a vector of associative breeding values  with incidence matrix  linking observations on individuals to the associative breeding values of their group members (i.e.  individuals in the same cage); and  is a vector of residuals  where . A weighted analysis was performed using the associated weight ( ) and the !WT statement in ASReml [] and fixing  to one []. The covariance structure of genetic terms is   where   in which  is the direct genetic variance   is the associative genetic variance  and  is the direct-associative genetic covariance. Bijma et al. [] have shown that residuals of group members are correlated due to non-genetic associative effects. The covariance structure of the residual term    is given by   where  = 1 when  =    =  when  and  are in the same group ( <U+2260> )  and  is zero otherwise. The value of  was estimated in the analysis  using a CORU statement in the residual variance structure in ASReml []. When social interactions exist among individuals  each individual interacts with  - 1 group members. In this study   = 4. The total heritable impact of an individual on the population  referred to as its total breeding value (TBV)  equals the sum of its direct breeding value and  - 1 times its associative breeding value: TBV  = A   + ( - 1) A[]. The total heritable variation equals the variance of the TBV among individuals  [  ]. With unrelated group members  the phenotypic variance equals . The total heritable variance expressed relative to the phenotypic variance equals . The  expresses the total heritable variance relative to the phenotypic variance and is  therefore  a generalisation of the conventional  to account for social interactions. We compared 2STEP to LAM using cross validation []. With cross validation  known phenotypes are set to missing and their value is predicted and compared with their observed phenotype. Validation was applied separately to each of the three lines. For this purpose  a random number was allocated to each cage within a fixed effect class. For each line  phenotypes of animals from 20% of the cages from each fixed effect class were set to missing  which resulted in five subsets  each containing 80% of the data. In this way  each cage was once removed from the total dataset  and each fixed effect class was present in all five subsets. The phenotypes set to missing were predicted using a combination of the direct breeding value of the individual itself and the associative breeding values of its group members  of either 2STEP or LAM. Comparing the predicted phenotypes of both methods is difficult for two reasons. First  a scale difference exists between estimated breeding values (EBV) of 2STEP and EBV of LAM. EBV of LAM are on the observed scale for survival days  whereas EBV of 2STEP are on the hazard rate scale. Transforming EBV of 2STEP into survival days is somewhat difficult  because the transformation is non-linear. Therefore  the predicted phenotypes using 2STEP are on the hazard rate scale  whereas the predicted phenotypes using LAM are on the observed scale for survival days. Second  in our dataset approximately 50-70% of the data were censored (animals that were still alive at the end of the testing period). These animals do not have an observed phenotype. In other words  a large proportion of the \"observed\" phenotypes is censored  and cannot be compared directly to their prediction. However  we know that their observed phenotypes are larger than those of animals that are not censored  which is highly relevant information. To deal with these two difficulties  we used two approaches to evaluate both methods. The first approach is based on using groups of animals rather than single individuals. In this approach  for each subset and method  25% of the animals with the best predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the best groups (best refers to animals with the highest predicted phenotypes using LAM or lowest predicted hazard rates using 2STEP)  and 25% of the animals with the worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the worst groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curve was plotted for the best and worst groups based on the observed phenotypes. It was expected that the best groups would yield the best Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curve  whereas the worst groups would yield the worst one. Moreover  for both methods the mean observed survival days were calculated for the best and worst groups. From these  the difference in survival days between the best and worst group was calculated. For the best groups the percentage of overlapping animals  between 2STEP and LAM  was calculated. To quantify the contribution of social effects to the predicted phenotype  phenotypes or hazard rates were predicted using different EBV: 1) classical BV (CBV); 2) direct BV of the individual itself (DBV =  ); associative BV of the group members () and a combination of the direct BV of the individual itself and the associative BV of its group members  CBV were estimated using a classical linear animal model given in [] or using survival analysis (first step of 2STEP). DBV  SBV and DSBV were estimated using LAM or 2STEP. The second approach is based on using ranks of individuals rather than their observed phenotypes. In this approach  the rank correlation between the observed phenotype and predicted phenotype or hazard rate and between predicted phenotype and predicted hazard rate was calculated. Due to the scale difference and censoring  Pearson correlations cannot be used. However  in both methods animals with the highest predicted phenotype (LAM) or lowest predicted hazard rate (2STEP) have the highest expected value for observed survival days. Therefore  the rank correlation between predicted and observed values can be used for both methods. Hence  the use of rank rather than Pearson correlation solves the scale issue. The remaining problem is animals with censored records  which have an unknown rank for the observed phenotype. However  the fact that animals were censored  represents an important information because those animals had the highest observed survival days. Animals with known phenotypes have a rank 1 through   whereas censored animals have rank  1 through   but with an unknown order. For the censored animals  we assumed that their ranks are in random order between  1 and   so that the rank among the censored animals does not contribute to the estimated rank correlation. In this case  the rank correlation can be calculated by giving censored animals the average rank of all the censored animals [see Additional file ]. In this way  we use the information that animals were censored  but make as little assumptions as possible about their order. Before calculating rank correlations  observed phenotypes were corrected for the fixed effects []  . Next  for the 20% missing data  the correlation was calculated between the rank of the observed phenotypes corrected for the fixed effects  accounting for censoring as described above  and the rank of the predicted phenotypes or hazard rate: . In this expression   denotes the predicted phenotype in case of LAM and the predicted hazard rate times -1 in case of 2STEP. Note  the  of individual  is the sum of the estimated direct breeding value (or hazard rate) of hen  and the estimated associative breeding values (or hazard rates) of its group members . Furthermore  to quantify similarity of both methods  the rank correlation between the  of 2STEP and the  of LAM was calculated. The rank correlation between predicted and observed phenotypes depends not only on the accuracy of the estimated breeding values underlying the predictions  but is also affected by non-genetic components of the observed phenotype. If breeding values underlying predicted phenotypes were estimated with full accuracy  the correlation between predicted and observed phenotypes would be equal to the square root of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by breeding values  . For any accuracy of predicted breeding values ()  the expected correlation between predicted and observed phenotypes would be equal to  (Figure )  where  is the accuracy of . Because animal breeders are interested in predicting breeding values rather than phenotypes  we calculated an approximate accuracy as . Hence   represents the approximate accuracy with which the genetic components underlying the observed phenotype    were predicted. This accuracy is only approximate because it refers to the ranks rather than the phenotypes  and because the prediction from 2STEP refers to the scale of the hazard rate rather than the observed phenotype. For line W1 = 0.32  for line WB  = 0.37  and for line WF  = 0.17  when using the genetic parameters (see Table ) given in Ellen et al. []. . The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function [] was plotted for the survival of the three layer lines (Figure ). The survival function represents the proportion of laying hens that survived up to time . The survival rate differed significantly between lines in both laying houses (p < 0.01). Line WF showed the highest survival rate i.e. 74.6%  whereas line WB showed the lowest survival rate i.e. 52.9%. . Survival curve is shown for the three lines W1  WB  and WF housed in laying house 1 (a) and laying house 2 (b). The estimated genetic parameters for direct and associative effects using 2STEP are given in Table . For all three lines  both the direct genetic variance  and the associative genetic variance  were significantly different from zero. The was lowest in line WF and highest in line W1  ranging from 0.12 through 0.31  whereas the  was lowest in line WB and highest in line WF  ranging from 0.028 through 0.049. The total heritable variance  ranged from 0.44 (WB) through 0.81 (WF) and was significantly different from zero. Line WB showed the lowest total heritable variance in survival days expressed relative to the phenotypic variance ( )  whereas line WF showed the highest    ranging from 32% through 64%. The estimated genetic correlation between direct breeding value and associative breeding value ( ) was positive but not significantly different from zero in line W1 (0.13) and  line WF (0.55)  and negative and not significantly different from zero in line WB (- 0.20). Table  shows also the genetic parameters using LAM []. Figure  shows the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curves for the groups with the best and worst predicted phenotypes  using either 2STEP or LAM. As expected  for all three layer lines  groups with the best predicted phenotypes or hazard rates yielded the best observed survival curves  whereas groups with the worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates yielded the worst observed survival curves. Both line W1 and WB showed a large difference in survival curves between the best and worst groups  whereas this difference was smaller in line WF. For all three lines  there was hardly any difference in survival curves between 2STEP and LAM. Meaning that both predicted phenotypes or hazard rates are good indicators for observed survival days. Table  shows the average survival days of the best and worst group for both methods and each line. Again  there was hardly any difference in average survival days between 2STEP and LAM. Furthermore  Table  shows the difference in survival days between the best and worst group. The difference was largest in line WB (67 days  for both methods) and smallest in line WF (16 days  for both methods). These results are in accordance with the difference in survival curves (Figure ). . Kaplan-Meier non-parametric estimate of the observed survival curve of two extreme groups  based on the predicted phenotypes (LAM) or predicted hazard rates (2STEP). For each subset and method  phenotypes or hazard rates were predicted based on DSBV. 25% of the animals with best predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the best groups (best refers to animals with the highest predicted phenotypes using LAM or lowest predicted hazard rates using 2STEP)  and 25% of the animals with the worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the worst groups. Black solid line: best group using 2STEP; black dotted line: best group using LAM; gray solid line: worst group using 2STEP; gray dotted line: worst group using LAM. Results are averages of five subsets  each containing 20% of the data. Figures represent line W1 (a)  WB (b)  and WF (c). To quantify the contribution of social effects to the predicted phenotype or hazard rate  the phenotype or hazard rate is predicted using different breeding values  CBV  DBV  SBV and DSBV. Again  for each of the three lines  25% of the animals with best predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the best group  and 25% of the animals with the worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the worst group. Table  shows the difference in survival days between the best and worst groups for both methods and each line. Besides  the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curves for the groups with the best and worst predicted phenotypes based on CBV  using the two methods  is given in Figure . For both lines WB and W1  animals selected on predicted phenotypes or hazard rates using DSBV gave the largest difference in survival days between the best and worst group. Furthermore  for both lines  using CBV to predict the phenotype or hazard rate gave similar difference in survival days as the DBV (approximately 45 days for line W1 and 58 days for line WB). For line WF  the difference in survival days depends on the method used. For 2STEP  the difference was largest when CBV was used  whereas for LAM the difference was largest when DSBV was used. Furthermore  for each layer line  the overlap of animals in the best group between 2STEP and LAM was calculated. The average overlap was 85% for both lines W1 and WB  and 74% for line WF. These results show that a large proportion of the animals selected for the best group  using either 2STEP or LAM  are the same. . Kaplan-Meier non-parametric estimate of the observed survival curve of two extreme groups  based on the predicted phenotypes (classical linear animal model) or predicted hazard rates (survival analysis). For each subset and method  phenotypes or hazard rates were predicted based on CBV. 25% of the animals with best predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the best groups (best refers to animals with the highest predicted phenotypes using classical linear animal model or lowest predicted hazard rates using survival analysis)  and 25% of the animals with the worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates were selected as the worst groups. Black solid line: best group using survival analysis; black dotted line: best group using classical linear animal model; gray solid line: worst group using survival analysis; gray dotted line: worst group using classical linear animal model. Results are averages of five subsets  each containing 20% of the data. Figures represent line W1 (a)  WB (b)  and WF (c). The rank correlations between the observed phenotype  adjusted for fixed effects and censoring  and the predicted phenotype    are given in Table . The rank correlations were low and approximately the same for both methods. For line W1 (0.149 vs. 0.144) and WB (0.174 vs. 0.170)  they were slightly  but not significantly  better for 2STEP  whereas for line WF (0.039 vs. 0.042) it was slightly  but not significantly  better for LAM. The rank correlations between the predicted phenotype using 2STEP and LAM were high and ranged from 0.879 (line WF) through 0.962 (line WB). These results are in line with the survival curves (Figure ). Furthermore  approximate accuracies were calculated (Table ) and were moderate  and approximately the same for both methods. We have estimated genetic parameters for direct and associative effects using 2STEP  combining survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects. Using 2STEP  the total heritable variance  including both direct and associative genetic effects  expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance ( )  ranged from 32% (line WB) through 64% (line WF). Using 2STEP   is substantially larger than using LAM. However  results of the cross validation do not show any difference between the two methods. Using cross validation  we showed that the difference in survival days between two extreme groups is largest when selecting on DSBV. Furthermore  we showed that social genetic effects contribute substantially to the difference in survival days (Table ). These results indicate that there could be quite some gain in survival days when selecting on the combination of the direct breeding value and the associative breeding values of the group members (DSBV). Comparing genetic parameters of 2STEP and LAM is not straightforward. For 2STEP  genetic parameters are given on the hazard rate scale  the probability that an animal has a failure at a given time   whereas genetic parameters of LAM are on the observed scale for survival days. The difference in genetic parameters between 2STEP and LAM originates from the fact that there is a scale difference  just like the difference in heritabilities for a 0/1-trait between linear and threshold models []. Using 2STEP  the total heritable variance is 1.5 to 7-fold greater than the classical direct genetic variance using survival analysis. For both lines W1 and WB  this increase in total heritable variance is comparable with results found using LAM [  ] (1.5 to 3-fold). For line WF  the increase is much larger using 2STEP (7-fold) than using LAM (3-fold)  which could be due to the fact that censoring is higher in line WF and 2STEP takes this better into account. Theoretically  2STEP would be a better method to analyse survival data  based on fewer assumptions known to be incorrect. We used two approaches to compare the two methods; selection of animals with the best and worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates and the rank correlation between the predicted phenotypes or hazard rates and observed phenotypes. Both approaches show that there is hardly any difference between 2STEP and LAM. This applies to all three lines. At first glance  the difference in  between both methods might suggest that using 2STEP would yield greater genetic improvement than using LAM []. However  as explained above  this difference arises from a difference in scale. The cross validation clearly demonstrates that both methods yield very similar rates of genetic improvement. Note that the rank correlation is low for all three lines  whereas the approximate accuracy is moderate for lines W1 and WB and low to moderate for line WF. Even though the approximate accuracy seems low  it is in accordance with the accuracy for methods that contain only half- or full-sib information (at least for lines W1 and WB) [  ]. Furthermore  a high rank correlation was found between the predicted hazard rates of 2STEP and the predicted phenotypes of LAM. Using selection of the best and worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates  approximately 80% of the animals selected for the best predicted phenotypes were overlapping between 2STEP and LAM. Based on the high overlap of animals between 2STEP and LAM and the similar rank correlation  it implies that  for both methods  a similar genetic progress will be achieved. We made a number of assumptions in the cross validation  when using the rank correlation  that may have affected the results. First  observed phenotypes were corrected for fixed effects using LAM  which may have favoured LAM compared to 2STEP. Second  when calculating the rank correlation  we assumed that ranks of censored records were in random order. This will probably not be true if censored animals were given the opportunity to actually produce a record. Alternatively  we could have used the ranks of the uncensored records only. However  in that case we would have ignored the information that the censored records are actually the \"best records\". For all three layer lines  censoring occurred at the same time  at the end of the study. It could be that when censoring occurs at different times during the study period  differences may occur between the two methods. To investigate this  50% of the censored records of line W1 were censored half way the study period (at 200 days). Again cross validation was used to compare the two methods. For both methods  the difference in survival days between the group with best predicted phenotypes or hazard rates and the group with the worst predicted phenotypes or hazard rates was calculated. For 2STEP the difference was 25.9 days  whereas for LAM the difference was 15.7 days. This indicates that  when the censoring times differ between individuals  2STEP can better identify the genetically superior individuals than LAM. Thus both methods are practically equivalent when all animals are censored at the same survival time; with variation in censoring time  the 2STEP is superior. This study shows that it is possible to use 2STEP  a combination of survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects  to estimate genetic parameters for the direct and associative effects on survival time in laying hens. We used cross validation to compare 2STEP with LAM. Based on the results in this paper  we can conclude that both 2STEP and LAM are practically equivalent when all animals are censored at the same survival time. Cross validation showed that selecting on a combination of the direct BV and the associative BV of the group members (DSBV) gave the largest difference in survival days between two extreme groups. Furthermore  this study showed that social genetic effects contribute substantial to the difference in survival days between two extreme groups  which means that social genetic effects do exist. two-step approach linear animal model including direct and associative effects classical breeding value direct breeding value: SBV: associative breeding value combination of the direct breeding value of the individual itself and the associative breeding value of its group members.

Heavy-tailed and normal models resulted in different estimates of direct and maternal heritabilities  and different sire rankings. Heavy-tailed models may be more appropriate for reliable estimation of genetic parameters from field data. Animal breeding applications commonly involve the fitting of linear mixed models in order to estimate genetic and phenotypic variation or to predict the genetic merit of selection candidates. Measurement errors and other sources of random non-genetic variation comprise the residual term  the effects of which are often assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and common variance. These assumptions may make inferences vulnerable to the presence of outliers [  ]. Heavy-tailed densities (such as Student's- distribution) are viable alternatives to the normal distribution  and provide robustness against unusual or outlying observations when used to model the densities of residual effects. In the event that the degrees of freedom are estimated to be large  i.e. in excess of 30  these methods converge to normally distributed residuals []. Mixed effects linear models with Student's- distributed error effects have been applied to mute the impact of residual outliers  for example in a situation where preferential treatment of some individuals was suspected []. Von Rohr and Hoeschele [] have demonstrated the application of a Student's- sampling model under four different error distributions in statistical mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL). They have determined that additive and dominance QTL and residual variance estimates are much closer to the simulated true values when the data itself is heavy-tailed and the analysis is performed with the skewed Student's- model rather than with a normal model. Rosa et al. [] have analyzed birth weight in a reproductive toxicology study and compared normal as well as robust mixed linear models based on Student's- distribution  Slash or contaminated normal error distributions. Marginal posterior densities of degrees of freedom for the Student's- and Slash error distributions are concentrated about single digit values  suggesting the inadequacy of the normal distribution for modelling residual effects. The heavy-tailed distributions result in significantly better fit than a normal distribution. Kizilkaya et al. [] have applied threshold models with normal or Student's- link functions for the genetic analysis of calving ease scores and they have shown that predictive log-likelihoods strongly favour a Student's- model with low degrees of freedom in comparison with a normal distribution. Cardoso et al. [] have used heavy-tailed distributions to study residual heteroskedasticity in beef cattle and have found that a Student's- model significantly improves predictive log-likelihood value. Chang et al. [] have compared multivariate heavy-tailed and probit threshold models in the analysis of clinical mastitis in first lactation cows  and have shown that a model comparison strongly supports the multivariate Slash and Student's- models with low degrees of freedom over the probit model. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine by simulation if Bayesian inference under a bivariate Student's- distribution of residuals can accommodate models with either light-tailed or heavy-tailed residuals  and 2) investigate the practical implications of fitting a Student's- distribution with unknown degrees of freedom for the residuals in bivariate field data. In both cases  results were compared to those from the conventional approach of assuming bivariate normal (BN) residuals. We first present the theory and methods for multiple traits that are applicable to both the simulation and the analysis of field data on gestation length and birth weight using a model that accommodates heavy-tailed residuals. A linear mixed model for animal  is where = (... )' is a vector of phenotypic values of animal  for  traits   is a vector of fixed effects   is a vector of random genetic effects   is a vector of uncorrelated random effects such as herd effects    and   are design matrices for animal   corresponding to the vectors of the fixed effects ()  random genetic effects ()  and uncorrelated random effects (). Conventional analyses might assume the vector <U+03F5>in equation () is multivariate normally distributed ((  ))  where In contrast  we assume <U+03F5>in (1) is multivariate heavy- or light-tailed by expressing the residual in the usual manner but divided by a scalar random variable that varies for each animal  but is consistent across the traits. That is  where in equation () is a positive random variable []. Values of approaching 0 produce heavy-tailed residuals for both traits  whereas values exceeding 1 would produce light-tails. The marginal density of <U+03F5>is a multivariate Student's- density with scale parameter and df   such that the marginal residual variance becomes  [4 7 9]. A flat prior was assumed for the fixed effects (). Genetic effects () were assumed to be distributed as multivariate normal  with null mean vector and (co)variance matrix   where  is the numerator relationship matrix and  denotes the Kronecker product []. Uncorrelated random effects and residuals were assumed to follow multivariate normal distributions with null means and (co)variance matrices   and   where  is the identity matrix. Flat prior distributions were assigned to   and . The multivariate normal distribution requires no distributional specification of in equation ()  because = 1 for all  = 1  2 ... . The distribution of in equation () for multivariate Student's- is a (/2  /2) distribution with density function Where > 0  G(.) is the standard  function   = 1  2 ...  and  > 0. A prior of  for  > 0 was assigned to  []. Inferences on parameters of interest can be made from the posterior distributions constructed using MCMC methods such as Gibbs sampling or Metropolis-Hastings [–]. The fully conditional posterior distributions of each of the unknown parameters are used to generate proposal samples from the target distribution (the joint posterior). The fully conditional posterior distributions of fixed ()  genetic () and uncorrelated random () effects are multivariate normal with mean  and covariance matrix   where  are solutions to Henderson's mixed model equations constructed with heterogeneous residual variances   and  is the inverse of this mixed-model coefficient matrix []. The (co)variance matrices   and have inverse Wishart conditional posterior distributions  which can also be constructed from  where  is solution for []. The fully conditional posterior distributions of for the multivariate Student's- model is where  = -  -  - . The fully conditional posterior distribution of df  for the multivariate Student's- model does not have a standard form  and so a sampling strategy for nonstandard distributions is required. A random-walk Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm was used to draw samples for  []. In the MH algorithm  a normal density with expectation equal to the parameter value from the previous MCMC cycle was used as the proposal density. The MH acceptance ratio was tuned to intermediate rates (40-50%) during the MCMC burn-in period to optimize MCMC mixing []. Sampled values of  < 2 were truncated to 2 so that covariance matrix    for the residuals of (1) is defined. A simulation study was carried out to validate Bayesian inference on the bivariate Student's- models  and assess the ability of model choice criterion (predictive log-likelihood) to correctly choose the model with better fit. For this purpose  the simulation study was undertaken using three sire models to simulate the bivariate data  these models varying in the nature of the simulated residual effects. We refer to the model used to simulate the data as the true model. These three models were the bivariate normal which effectively has infinite  (BN-8) and the bivariate Student's- model with  = 4 or 12 (BS-4  BS-12). Ten replicated data sets were generated for each of the three true models. Phenotypes of 50 progeny from each of 50 unrelated sires for two traits  = ()' were simulated using equation (). The vector of fixed effects  only included a gender effect with  = (11 90)' for trait 1 and  = (38 32)' for trait 2. The random genetic effects () and uncorrelated random effects () included 50 sires and 100 herds  respectively  assuming: where  is the sire (co)variance matrix  and  is the herd (co)variance matrix Residuals were assumed ~  (  )  where Heritabilities of simulated traits were  and   respectively. For each animal   was 1 for BN-8 or generated from (/2  /2) for BS -  with  = 4  12. Offspring were assigned to herd and gender groups by random sampling from a uniform distribution. Gestation length (GL) up until first calving and the resultant calf birth weight (BW) data were recorded on the national population of Italian Piemontese cattle from January 1989 to July 1998 by Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Bovini di Razza Piemontese (ANABORAPI)  Strada Trinità 32a  12061 Carrù  Italy. Only herds represented by at least 100 records over that period were considered in the study []  providing a total of 7 883 animals from 677 sires and 747 MGS. Table  summarizes the statistics for GL and BW. BS and BN models given in equation () were used to analyze GL and BW data. The fixed effects () of dam age in months  sex of the calf  and their interaction were considered by combining eight different first-calf age group classes (20 to 23  23 to 25  25 to 27  27 to 29  29 to 31  31 to 33  33 to 35  and 35 to 38 months) with sex of calf for a total of 16 nominal age-sex subclasses. A total of 1 186 herd-year-season (HYS) subclasses were created from combinations of herd  year  and two different seasons (from November to April and from May to October) as in Carnier et al. [] and Kizilkaya et al.  [] and treated as uncorrelated random effects () []. The range for number of observations in HYS subclasses was between 1 and 33  and average number of records for HYS effect was 7. The random genetic effects () included 1 929 sires () and MGS () from the pedigree file. While the number of observations ranged from 1 to 406  average observations for each sire in data file was 12. We also assumed: where  is the sire-MGS (co)variance matrix  and  is the HYS (co)variance matrix  Residual scale parameters () in heavy-tailed models cannot be directly compared with the residual (co)variance () in the normal model  nor used in estimation of heritabilities  residual or phenotypic correlations. The scale parameters must be appropriately transformed into marginal residual (co)variance parameters  for BN and BS models  using =  and  where  > 2  respectively  given by Stranden and Gianola [] and Cardoso et al. []. Heritabilities and genetic correlations are of interest from the perspective of direct and maternal effects in an animal model  but the fitted models for GL and BW included genetic effects for sire and MGS  and some fractions of the genetic effects were included in the residual terms. Transformations were applied to convert the sire-MGS parameters and estimates to their animal model equivalent. The additive genetic (co)variance matrix including direct () and maternal () genetic variances from sire-MGS model was obtained as = ' [] where is an additive genetic (co)variance matrix  and  is an appropriate transformation matrix  Direct and maternal () heritability  and genetic correlation () estimates were obtained from estimates of variance and covariance components according to: and Where  and  =  or    and  for the trait of GL or BW and  for the model of BN or BS. Kendall rank correlations between posterior means of sire genetic effects obtained from the BN and BS models were used to compare the ordering of the genetic evaluations of the sires for GL and BW []. Comparisons were also made between rank orders of the top 100 selection candidates from 1 929 animals in the pedigree file for the BN model. Model comparisons in the simulation study  and for the analysis of field data  were carried out using predictive log-likelihoods (PLL) from BN and BS models. The PLL over all observations () under Model ( = BN or BS) was obtained as: where  is the harmonic mean of (|  ) across  MCMC samples []. A PLL difference exceeding 2.5 was used as indication of an important difference in model fit  following Raftery []. In the simulation study  the impact of alternative models was quantified by computing the correlations (r) between the simulated true () and predicted () sire effects in each of the three fitted models. Further  the prediction error variance (PEV) V( - )) of the sire effects was calculated to provide an informative comparative assessment of model prediction performance. Higher correlations and lower prediction error variances will be associated with fitted models that are better at predicting breeding values than models with low correlations and high prediction error variance. Some fitted models might be significantly better than others from a likelihood framework  yet have little impact on selection response if they do not markedly change correlations. Minimizing the prediction error variances is important when investment decisions depend upon the magnitude of the sire predictions  not just the ranking of the sires. Graphical inspection (time series traces) of the chains along with Heidelberger and Welch Diagnostic [] for the Gibbs output using CODA (Convergence Diagnostics and Output Analysis package in R) [] were used to determine a common length of burn-in period. A burn-in period of 50 000 for simulated and field data analysis was defined as the number of cycles discarded at the start of the MCMC chain to ensure sampling from the correct marginal distributions. A further 50 000 post burn-in MCMC cycles in the simulated and field data analysis were generated for each of the BS and BN models. Every successive post burn-in sample was retained  so that 50 000 samples were used to infer posterior distributions of unknown parameters. Posterior means of the parameters were obtained from their respective marginal posterior densities. Interval estimates were determined as posterior probability intervals (PPI) obtained from the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of each posterior density to provide 95% PPI. The effective number of independent samples (ESS) for each parameter was determined using the initial positive sequence estimator of Geyer [] as adapted by Sorensen et al. []. The predictive log-likelihood values in Table  were computed for BS and BN models fitted to the simulated heavy-tailed and normal datasets. When the true model had residuals with heavy-tails  the fitted models with heavy-tails (BS) were significantly better than the normal model (BN). When the true model had normally distributed residuals  all the fitted models performed equally well. The difference in PLL between the fitted models with heavy-tails and the normal model was inversely related to the degrees of freedom of the simulated residuals. Note that normally distributed residuals can be thought of as having infinite degrees of freedom  and in this case there were no differences between the fitted models. Inference on  based on BS model analysis of BS-4  BS-12 and BN-8 data sets is given in Table . Posterior means of  seems sharp and unbiased  and the 95% posterior probability intervals for  concentrated on low values for BS-4 and BS-12 data sets. Conversely  inference on  for BN-8 data was larger than 100  consistent with what was expected  and the 95% posterior probability interval was wider by concentrating on values higher than 30  indicating strong evidence of normally distributed data. Furthermore  relatively larger ESS of  were obtained from BS-4 and BS-12 data sets when compared with that from BN-8 data sets []  indicating more samples would be needed to attain a minimum of 100 as advocated by Bink et al. [] and Uimari et al. []. Tables    and  summarize inferences on sire  herd and marginal error variances based on the replicated datasets from the three different populations  comparing BS and BN fitted models. Large ESS were attained for sire  herd and marginal error variances  indicating stable MCMC inference. The 95% posterior probability intervals for sire and herd variance components from the three fitted models widely overlapped and included the true parameter values. Furthermore  the posterior means from the three fitted models were almost identical. When the true model was BS-4 or BN-8  inferences on marginal error (co)variance components using the BS and BN fitted models were similar  found to be sharp and seemingly unbiased  and true parameter values were covered by 95% equal-tailed PPI of parameters (Table ). Average correlations between true and estimated sire effects and average PEV from two replicates using BS and BN fitted models are presented in Table  and . When the true model was BS  both the correlation and PEV indicate that the heavy-tailed fitted models were superior  especially when the true value of  = 4. When the true model was BN  all fitted models performed identically. In general  the accuracy and PEV results from BSt and BN models suggest that heavy-tailed fitted models can improve accuracy and PEV when the true model is heavy-tailed  but a robust Bayesian analysis using heavy-tailed models does not deteriorate accuracy and PEV if the true model is normal. The analyses produced PLL values for BS and BN models of -47 006 and -48 006 respectively. The log-scale differences between model PLL values for BS versus BN models were 1 000  which greatly exceeds 2.5 and decisively indicates the inadequacy of the normality assumption for the distribution of error terms. These results are in agreement with Chang et al. [] and Cardoso et al. []  who found that the Student's- distribution was a better fit to the clinical mastitis data and postweaning gain data  respectively  compared to Slash and normal distributions. The estimated ESS for  is 1 227 and those for variance components are given in Tables    and . The ESS for these parameters ranged from 323 to 15 789  indicating sufficient MCMC mixing. These values were found to be considerably higher than 100  which has been suggested as the minimum ESS for reliable statistical inference [  ]. The posterior distribution of  from the BS model  and its posterior mean (M) and 95% PPI corresponding to the 2.5 (L) and 97.5 (U) percentiles of the posterior distribution are in Figure . The posterior mean of  for the BS model was 3.70  with 95% PPI of (3.44  3.97). This density  characterized by small values of  for BS model confirms that the assumption of normally distributed residuals is not adequate for the analysis of Piemontese GL and BW data.     . M represents posterior mean  L represents the 2.5percentiles of the posterior density  U represent 97.5percentiles of the posterior density. Posterior inferences on sire-MGS and HYS (co)variances for GL and BW are summarized in Tables  and   using posterior means and 95% PPIs from BS and BN models. Posterior distributions of (co)variances were nearly symmetric in BS and BN models. Posterior means of sire-MGS (co)variances were similar across models  and 95% PPI widely overlapped. Posterior means of sire-MGS (co)variances from BN model  however  were lower than that from BSt model for GL  and were larger than that from BS model for BW. Covariances from BN model  including sire or MGS effect for BW with sire or MGS effect for GL were higher than those from BS and BS models. Posterior means of HYS variances from BS and BN models were similar and ranged from 4 to 4.25 for GL  and 2.43 to 2.56 for BW from the two models. Posterior inference for the marginal residual (co)variances based on BS and BN models are presented in Table . The marginal residual variance for GL  and covariance between GL and BW from BS model seemed to agree with those from the BN model; however  the posterior mean of marginal residual variance for BW from the BS model was significantly higher than that of the BN model. Posterior densities of direct and maternal heritabilities  and genetic correlations from BS and BN models for GL and BW are shown in Figures  and . Posterior means of direct (0.47) and maternal (0.29) heritabilities from BS and BN models were similar for GL. However  posterior means of direct (0.28) and maternal (0.23) heritabilities from BN models were higher than those (0.23 and 0.18) from the heavy-tailed model for BW (Figure ). In contrast to our findings  Cardoso et al. [] and Chang et al. [] have found no real difference in posterior means for heritabilities whether using Student's-  Slash or normal models. Posterior means of direct heritabilities from BS and BN models for GL and BW traits were lower; however  those of maternal heritabilities were higher than the values reported by Ibi et al. [] and Crews []. Posterior means (-0.87  -0.86) of genetic correlations between D and M effects of GL  and those (-0.73  -0.71) of BW from BS and BN models in Figure  were significantly negative and very similar with overlapping posterior densities. They were higher than those reported in literature [  ]  and the negative posterior mean of the genetic correlation implies an antagonistic relationship between D and M effects. The posterior densities of genetic correlations between D effects on one trait and M effects on another included zero  indicating non-significant correlations.     . hD and hM represent direct and maternal heritabilities.     . The posterior means of in the BS model can be used to assess the extent to which any particular pair of records presents an outlier for either trait in comparison to a normal error assumption. Low values of (i.e. closer to zero) indicate at least one deviant record among the two traits  whereas values of close to 1 show that the corresponding pair of records match the normal model []. The ranges of posterior means of obtained for different animals from the BS models varied between 0.09 and 1.75. The values of are plotted against estimated values of residuals for BW and GL in Figure . The distributions of posterior means of less than 0.3 (left figure) or less than 0.2 (right figure) are given in Figure . The figure on the right plots posterior mean values of less than 0.2  representing outliers 3 or more standard deviations (SD) from the mean for GL or BW. When the posterior mean values of are close to unity  the estimated values of residuals approach normally distributed residuals  indicating adequate model fit.    . Distribution of posterior mean values of less than 0.3 on the left. Distribution of posterior mean values of less than 0.2 on the right. In general  random effects contributing to bivariate traits may be correlated positively  negatively or uncorrelated. Accordingly  it is reasonable that effects may vary in their distribution and that residuals for one trait might conceptually be heavy-tailed while others may be light-tailed. Further  it is conceivable that individual animals could exhibit trait specific lambda values. However  in the context of the traits considered in this experiment  it is not unreasonable to imagine that the lambda values could be consistent across the traits because gestation length and birth weight are positively correlated  at phenotypic  genetic and residual levels  and that non-genetic effects that produce residual outliers for one trait such as gestation length might similarly effect birth weight. In fact  single-trait analyses of GL and BW indicate that both traits are heavy-tailed with 2.91 (GL) and 3.66 (BW) for posterior means of . A more general model that assumes a bivariate distribution for trait-specific  values is more technically demanding than the model used in this paper  but warrants further research. Sire ranking based on posterior means of the sire effects from BS and BN models for GL and BW compared using Kendall rank correlations are in Figure . The rank correlation between BN and BS models was 0.77 for GL  and 0.81 for BW  indicating re-ranking of sires among models.     . Considering only sires ranked in the top 100 for GL and BW using the BN model  82% and 75% of them were found to be same for GL and BW in the top 100 animals by BS model. The rank correlations between BN and BS models decreased considerably to about 0.6 for GL and about 0.5 for BW (Figure ). Cardoso et al. [] have found similar results in a multibreed genetic evaluation of postweaning gain in Nelore-Hereford cattle and have suggested that a low rank correlation among the top sires may have greater implications for genetic evaluations and selection decisions than the correlation results involving all sires. Figure  shows that posterior means of sire effects from BN model shrank to a greater extent under the BS model. Substantial re-ranking of sires was observed due to the greater shrinkage of the posterior mean of sire effects in BS model  and this re-ranking was more pronounced in BW than in GL. Stranden and Gianola [] have pointed out that animals that are phenotypic outliers will exhibit more extreme predictions of genetic merit under the BN model compared to the heavy-tailed models that mute the effects of the large residuals. Bayesian techniques are capable of fitting models where residuals have a heavy-tailed distribution with unknown degrees of freedom. Model comparisons  using PLL  in the simulation study typically favoured the BS models over the BN-8 model when the true models were heavy-tailed. Further  there was no difference in PLL between BS and BN-8 models and there were no disadvantages of fitting a BS model when the true model was normal. Bivariate residual distributions can be assumed normal  or Student's- in the analysis of field data. Predictive log-likelihood values used as model choice criteria in the bivariate analysis of GL and BW data indicated that the BS model with low degrees of freedom fitted better than the BN model. Posterior means of direct and maternal heritabilities from the BN model were similar or higher than those from the BS model. Appreciable differences were observed in sire ranking overall and specifically in the top 100 sires based on rank correlations between BS and BN model sire effects. These results indicate that genetic evaluation and selection strategies will be sensitive to the assumed model. Animals whose values were close to zero in BS model were identified as having one or more outlying records. An interesting extension for future studies would be that of allowing different scale parameter specification for each trait in the BS model.

The heritability estimate of FCR was 0.49 and 0.41 for days 28-35 and days 35-42  respectively. Selection for FCR will improve efficiency of feed utilization but because of the genetic dependence of FCR and its components  selection based on FCR will reduce FI and increase growth rate. However  the correlated responses in both FI and BWG cannot be predicted accurately because of the inherent problem of FCR being a ratio trait. Feed cost constitutes about 70% of the total cost of live production  but the efficiency of feed utilization has not kept up the growth potential of today's broilers. Improvement in feed efficiency will reduce the amount of feed required for growth  the production cost and the amount of nitrogenous waste []. Efficiency in feed intake (FI) is more difficult to quantify than growth  and as a result different measures of feed efficiency have been developed  each of which reflects different mathematical and biological aspects of efficiency. In broiler chickens  feed efficiency is usually expressed as the amount of FI per body weight gain (BWG) referred to as feed conversion ratio (FCR). However  Chambers and Lin [] have shown that a large proportion of the variation in FI and age constant FCR among broilers are due to body weight (BW) and efficiency of nutrient utilization. Also  variability in maintenance requirement  a major contributing factor to FI  is not accounted for in FCR. Statistically  FCR is a ratio trait and is not normally distributed  with no real mean and variance  and according to Atchley et al. [] the non-normality of a ratio trait is increased when the magnitude of coefficient of variation of the denominator is increased. Pearson [] has derived formulae to approximate the variance of a ratio and phenotypic correlation between two ratios but the lack of genetic independence of FCR from FI and BWG makes it difficult to improve without direct effect on growth. Koch et al. [] have introduced the concept of residual feed intake (RFI) that accounts for both maintenance requirements and growth. Residual FI represents the amount of FI not accounted for by maintenance BW and BWG. Selection on RFI has been proposed to improve feed efficiency because of its phenotypic independence of maintenance BW and BWG. The phenotypic independence of RFI from its estimating components is the direct result of the distributing properties of the regression procedure []. Kennedy et al. [] have shown that genetic variability in RFI is not independent of metabolic BW and BWG. Luiting [] have demonstrated that feeding behavior  nutrient digestibility  maintenance requirements  and energy homeostasis and partitioning affect RFI in laying hens. Aggrey et al. [] have demonstrated that the proportion of protein energy retained is associated with feed efficiency. Jorgensen et al. [] have also shown that variability in apparent metabolizable energy requirements affects feed efficiency in meat-type birds. Therefore  RFI may reflect more the variability in maintenance BW than differences in BWG. Genetic variability in RFI has been investigated in beef cattle [  –] and pigs [–]. To date  there are only a few studies on RFI in broilers with heritabilities ranging from 0.21-0.49 [  ]. Estimates on genetic correlation between RFI and BWG have ranged from almost zero [  ] to positive values []. These differences may be due to sample size or statistical methods of estimation. The true genetic relationship between RFI and its components or lack thereof would allow for an accurate predictive correlated response to selecting for RFI. The aim of the current study was to estimate genetic parameters pertaining to RFI and FCR of a growing broiler control population at two time periods and to ascertain the genetic relationships among the parameters that contribute to feed efficiency. A pedigreed population was established from the Arkansas random bred population. Twenty-four males were pedigree mated to 72 females to produce 2 400 chicks in eight hatches. Chicks were sexed at hatching and placed in pens (0.074 m/bird) with litter and fed a starter ration containing 225 g/kg protein  52.8 g/kg fat  25.3 g/kg fiber  12.90 MJ ME/kg  9.5 g/kg calcium (Ca)  and 7.2 g/kg total phosphorus (P) (4.5 g/kg available P) until 18 days of age. Hereafter  they were fed a grower ration of 205 g/kg protein  57.6 g/kg fat  25.0 g/kg fiber  13.20 MJ ME/kg  9.0 g/kg Ca and 6.7 g/kg total P (4.1 g/kg available P). At 28 days  birds were fasted for 12 hours and transferred to individual metabolic cages (width = 20.32 cm; length = 60.96 cm; height = 30.48 cm) until 42 days of age. The birds were kept on an 20L:4D light regimen. BW was measured on days 28  35 and 42. FI was measured at days 28-35 and 35-42. The metabolic body weights (BW) at days 28 and 35 (MBW and MBW) FI at days 28-35 and 35-42 (FI and FI)  FCR (FCR and FCR) and residual RFI (RFI and RFI) at days 28-35 and 35-42 were calculated. RFI was calculated as: where a is the intercept and b and b are of partial regression coefficients of FI on BW and BWG  respectively. Residual feed intake values were generated using regression procedure of SAS []. Experimental protocols were in accordance with the procedures of the University of Georgia institutional animal care and use committee. After data editing  there were 2 289 animals with complete records and 104 (including eight grandsires) with no records. The animal model used to calculate heritability and genetic correlations of the traits is: where Y is the record of the k chicken from the i hatch and j sex; Hatch = fixed effect of hatch (i = 1 ... 8); Sex = fixed effect of sex (j = 1  2-male/female); a = random direct additive genetic effect of individual k  and e = random residual error. Analyses were performed using the GIBBS2F90 program based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We assumed flat priors for systematic and random effects. The marginal posterior distribution of the trait of interest was obtained using Gibbs sampling. A single chain of 250 000-cycles length was generated. A burn-in period of 150 000 iterations was used as well as a 10-cycle lag to reduce autocorrelation among samples. A total of 10 000 samples were kept for post Gibbs analysis using the POSTGIBBSF90 program (with graph) [] to compute the posterior means (point estimate for traits)  and the 95% highest posterior regions (HPD95%) of heritability and genetic correlations of the traits. Convergence was ascertained by employing the algorithm of Raftery and Lewis []. Bivariate analyses were performed to compute genetic correlations between combinations of traits. The means  standard deviations (SD) and heritabilities of the studied traits are presented in Table  and estimates of genetic correlation among feed efficiency parameters in Table . The heritability estimates of FCR and RFI were 0.49 and 0.45  respectively. Similarly  the heritability estimates for FCR and RFI at day 35 were 0.41 and 0.42  respectively. Whereas the genetic correlation between FCR and RFI was 0.31  the estimate between FCR and RFI was 0.84. The heritability estimates for MBW  BWG and FI for both periods were moderate ranging from 0.42 to 0.51. The genetic correlations between RFI and its components (MBW  BWG and FI) were all positive ranging from 0.29 to 0.56. However  the genetic correlation between RFI was 0.45 and 0.33 for MBW and FI  respectively  but almost zero (0.06) for BWG. The genetic correlations between the two RFI and FCR were 0.59 and 0.55  respectively. The RFI parameters were all moderately correlated (0.44-0.51) with RFI  but the genetic relationship between BWG and RFI was almost zero (-0.05). The genetic correlation between FCR and MBW was moderately positive at both ages  and between FCR and BWG was slightly negative also at both ages. Feed efficiency parameters at days 28-35 were all positively correlated with FCR  but the genetic correlation between BWG and FCR was almost zero (0.04). The genetic correlation between FCR and FCR was 0.55. The heritability estimates for both FCR and RFI for both periods were higher than the estimate of Van Bebber and Mercer []  however  they were within the limits of published data in beef cattle and pigs [      ]. Based on the genetic parameter estimates  selection for low RFI will improve feed efficiency with an expected correlated response in reduced FI. This will also favor birds with lower maintenance energy requirements based on the genetic correlation between RFI and MBW. However  there is a genetic dependency between RFI and BWG. The positive genetic correlation between RFI and BWG suggests that fast growing chickens have greater appetite and consume more feed than needed for growth. This dependency does not exist at days 35-42. Therefore  selection at days 35-42 may be more attractive than at days 28-35. Feed efficiency is a compound trait affected by both feed- and growth-related factors  and these factors vary with age. Therefore the genetic relationships among feed efficiency parameters are also expected to vary with age. In the current study  the genetic interrelationships among the feed efficiency parameters were different at days 28-35 and days 35-42. The lack of genetic correlation between RFI and BWG was similar to that reported in cattle and pigs [        ]. However  Cai et al. [] and Hogue et al. [] have also reported a positive genetic correlation between RFI and average daily gain (ADG) in pigs selected for low RFI  which is similar to the genetic correlation between RFI and BWG obtained in this study. The change in genetic correlation between RFI and BWG with age could be due to differences in body composition during the two periods when RFI was determined. Jensen et al. [] have also obtained genetic correlations between RFI and ADG of 0.32 and -0.24 at two different ages. In pigs  RFI is negatively correlated to dressing percentage and positively correlated with backfat thickness []. The body composition of broiler chickens at days 28-35 is different from that of at days 35-42  therefore it is possible that the internal allocation of resources above maintenance into protein accretion and fat deposition among others could contribute towards the different inter-relationships between factors that affect RFI at these two time periods. Feed efficiency measured over a long period of time is possibly an aggregate efficiency over different developmental processes which can vary from species to species as well as the management practices under which animals are raised. In meat-type birds  feather development  feeding behavior  skeletal growth  tissue accretion and fat deposition are different developmental processes all of which or combinations of which can affect heritability of RFI and also the genetic correlations among RFI parameters. In the literature on broilers while data on RFI is scant  information on FCR is abundant possibly due to its ease of computation and to the producers' direct association of cost and profits to quantities of feed. The heritability estimate of FCR was 0.49 and 0.41 for days 28-35 and days 35-42  respectively. FCR is a ratio trait that is not normally distributed [] and is subject to skewness and kurtosis as a result of the changes in BWG (denominator) coefficient of variation and subsequently affect SD  covariances and correlations []. Selection for FCR will improve efficiency of feed utilization but because of the genetic dependence of FCR and its components  selection for reduced FCR will reduce FI and increase growth rate. Increases in both FI and BWG cannot be predicted accurately because of the inherent problem of FCR being a ratio trait. Lin [] has developed a linear index based on the components of FCR. Gunsett []  Famula [] and Campo and Rodriguez [] have shown that the linear index is more efficient than direct selection on the ratio. However  Gunsett [] has also pointed out that the advantage of the linear index decreases as the correlation between the two component traits increases or as the heritability of both components moves towards equality. The genetic correlation between RFI and FCR was 0.31 at days 28-35 compared to 0.84 at days 35-42. This suggests that the nature of the pleiotropic relationship between RFI and FCR may be dependent on age  and consequently the molecular  physiological and nutritional factors that govern RFI and FCR may also depend on time of development  or on the nature of resource allocation of FI above maintenance designated for protein accretion and fat deposition. The lack of genetic correlation between RFI and BWG at days 35-42 provides the independence of RFI on the level of production  thereby making it possible to study the molecular  physiological and nutrient digestibility mechanisms underlying RFI without the confounding effects of growth. Estimating genetic properties of RFI provides the genetic parameters that are needed in combination with economic values in the selection criteria in order to ascertain the economic benefits of selecting for feed efficiency.

In this study  we attempted to compare whether the duplicates arising from tandem duplications and retropositions are retained by the same mechanisms in human and mouse genomes. Both sequence and expression similarity analyses revealed that tandem duplicates tend to be more conserved  whereas retrogenes tend to be more divergent. The duplicability of tandem duplicates is also higher than that of retrogenes. However  positive selection seems to play significant roles in the retention of both types of duplicates. We propose that dosage effect is more prevalent in the retention of tandem duplicates  while 'escape from adaptive conflict' (EAC) effect is more prevalent in the retention of retrogenes. Gene duplication is one of the most important sources of genomic novelty and complexity []. There are three main molecular mechanisms leading to new duplicates [  ]: 1) unequal crossing-over during homologous recombination  2) duplicative transposition at the DNA level and retroposition mediated by mRNA  and 3) polyploidization. While polyploidization is characterized by bursts of large-scale genome duplication  the former two processes are often small-scale and proceed continuously []. Recently  the investigations of full genome sequences have revealed that both large- and small-scale duplications play significant roles in the evolution of various organisms []. Although the molecular basis of gene duplication has been well understood  how the newly created duplicates are fixed in the population is still quite controversial []. Several evolutionary models for this issue have been proposed  and according to the current perspective []  they can be distinguished from two independent dimensions: 1) the extent of functional divergence for the new duplicates  and 2) whether positive (adaptive) selection is involved in the process. The outcomes of functional divergence are usually classified as gene conservation  subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization [  ]  though the definitions for the latter two are often ambiguous. Theoretically  the duplicates can undergo adaptive evolution or neutral genetic drift to achieve each outcome. Statistical analyses on empirical data have suggested that none of the mechanisms alone can interpret the maintenance of all duplicates []. However  we suspect that these retention mechanisms may not contribute equally for duplicates stemming from different molecular bases. In fact  by examining the substitution rate between duplicated pairs  Jun et al. [] have found that retrotransposed and interspersed segmental duplicates diverge more quickly than tandem duplicates. To further compare the underlying retention mechanisms  we attempted to investigate the tandem duplicates arising from unequal crossing-over and retrogenes arising from retroposition in human and mouse genomes. We chose both types of duplicates because: 1) tandem duplicates and retrogenes are easier to screen  and 2) after ancient large-scale genome duplications at the origin of vertebrates  most duplicates have been created via small-scale events in mammalian genomes []. In addition  we made the assumption that the duplication rate for each type is constant per year rather than per generation in mammalian genomes. This seems a reasonable assumption because the duplication rate has often been presented with respect to absolute time scale in previous studies [  ]. All paralogs (protein-coding genes with pseudogenes excluded) and relevant annotations (identity scores  locations and exons) were retrieved from Ensembl database (release 50) via BioMart []  which amounted to 80 683 and 159 047 pairs of duplicates in human and mouse genomes  respectively. The original dataset had a lot of redundant pairs in multi-member gene families. For example  in a -member family  there would be (-1)/2 paralogous pairs listed  although at most only -1 duplication events were needed to create the family. In this case  we only chose the -1 pairs that contained all the members and had the highest total identity score. Altogether  9 425 and 11 224 non-redundant pairs were preserved for the two genomes. Next  we applied CHSMiner [] to detect and remove paralogous segments arising from large-scale duplications. The segments should contain at least two pairs of duplicates  and the gap size between two neighbouring duplicates in either segment should be less than 30 genes []. The duplicated pairs located in those segments with FDR < 0.05 were filtered. After this step  we obtained 6 552 and 8 308 pairs for further screening in human and mouse genomes  respectively. Although tandem duplicates should be adjacent to each other on one chromosome  the extensive gene inversions may insert irrelevant genes into the tandem arrays. We followed the stringent definition adopted by previous studies [  ] to screen the tandem duplicates  which restricted the inserted spacers to no more than one gene. This resulted in 1 210 and 1 802 paralogous pairs in human and mouse genomes  respectively [see additional file  and ]. We implemented a method similar to those of Emerson [] and Pan [] to screen retrogenes. First  the pairs with a multi-exon member and an intronless member were considered as putative parental-retrogene pairs  but the pairs with both members intronless were ignored as they were not clearly created via retropositions. Next  for the putative pairs with both members located on the same chromosome  we discarded those with the intervening spacers containing less than 10 genes  since they were confused with tandem duplicates. Finally  we preserved 410 and 680 pairs resulting from retropositions in the two genomes  respectively [see additional file  and ]. The similarity of protein sequences between two duplicates  as measured by their average amino acid identity  can be retrieved directly from BioMart. The  and  of their coding sequences were downloaded from the EPGD database  [] [see additional file       and ]. To avoid the influence of saturation effect []  only the pairs with  < 1 were considered in the / analysis. The tissue-specific expression profiles and the annotation of the probesets were downloaded from the GNF gene expression database  []. We chose the datasets HUMAN U133A/GNF1H and MOUSE GNF1M for the corresponding species. The Present/Absent calls in the profiles were used to indicate whether a probeset was expressed or not  and the Marginal calls were also treated as Present calls. When a gene had many probesets  it was considered to be expressed if any one of the probeset was present. We ignored the probesets such as '_f_at'  '_s_at' and '_x_at' because they could not be mapped to unique genes in a gene family. For a duplicated pair  common probesets shared by the two members were also excluded. Finally  if  was the number of tissues where both members were expressed  and  was the number of tissues where one member was expressed while the other was not  then their expression similarity was calculated as /() [see additional file       and ]. We identified 1 210 tandem duplicates and 410 retrogenes in the human genome  and 1 802 tandem duplicates and 680 retrogenes in the mouse genome. The higher number of tandem duplicates than retrogenes in both genomes implies a higher gene duplicability for tandem duplicates. Previous studies have found that gene duplicability is positively correlated with gene dosage [] and gene complexity []  although the correlation with functional essentiality is not always the same in yeasts and mammals [–]. To investigate the difference in gene duplicability between tandem duplicates and retrogenes in more detail  we counted the number of each type of duplicates in gene families with various sizes (Figure ). The result shows that their distributions among gene families are quite different ( < 0.01 for both genomes  chi-square test). Specifically  tandem duplicates are more likely to be enriched in larger families  whereas retrogenes do not display a preference. . Distribution of the duplicates among small (=5 members) and large (>5 members) families; tandem duplicates are more likely to be enriched in large families than the retrogenes ( < 0.01 for both genomes  chi-square test) Similarity of coding sequences has been widely used to indicate whether the new duplicates undergo gene conservation or functional divergence. While some reports have suggested that the duplicates really undergo sequence divergence when they are newly produced [  ]  other reports have found that they still remain more conserved than singletons []. However  taking all duplicates as a whole will neglect some specific factors that belong to different molecular bases. For example  the effect of gene conversion  which keeps duplicates appearing similar through local DNA recombination []  may have greater influence on tandem duplicates than retrogenes. The higher duplicability of tandem duplicates may also leave more recent and less divergent gene pairs. To test the hypothesis  we compared the amino acid identity between both types of duplicates (Figure ). The result shows that  the sequence identity of tandem duplicates is significantly higher than that of retrogenes (human:  = 0.021  mouse:  = 0.034  rank sum test). In agreement with Jun et al. []  this result implies that tandem duplicates tend to be more conserved  whereas retrogenes tend to be more divergent. . Medians for tandem duplicates and retrogenes in mouse genomes are 74 and 68.75  respectively ( = 0.034  one-tailed rank sum test); medians for both types of duplicates in human genomes are 63 and 55.75  respectively ( = 0.021) In addition to the coding sequences  the evolution of regulatory elements is also important to determine the fate of duplicates. In fact  the differentiation of regulatory motifs can increase the expression specificity of the duplicates among various tissues and developmental stages  which is perhaps the most common form of subfunctionalization []. Previous reports have found that a rapid expression divergence exists between duplicates []  and that the expression diversity is also increased compared to singletons []. However  as tandem duplications directly occur at the DNA level  it is more likely that the new duplicates preserve their original regulatory motifs and expression patterns. In contrast  as retrogenes are randomly inserted into the genome via mRNAs  they are more likely to acquire distinct regulatory motifs and expression patterns. To test this hypothesis  we compared the expression similarity for tandem duplicates and retrogenes by using microarray data across diverse tissues (Figure ). Although a lot of duplicates have been quite differentiated for both types  the expression similarity between tandem duplicates is still significantly higher than that between retrogenes (human:  = 0.036  mouse:  = 0.002  rank sum test). Therefore  the gene expression profiles also support the difference in functional divergence for both types of duplications. . Medians for tandem duplicates and retrogenes in mouse genomes are 8.5 and 1.8  respectively ( = 0.002  one-tailed rank sum test); medians for the both of duplicates in human genomes are 7.9 and 2.0  respectively ( = 0.036) As mentioned in the section   the retention mechanisms are determined by both functional divergence and evolutionary forces. To compare the evolutionary forces for both types of duplicates  we first performed the traditional / analysis (Figure ). The result shows little difference in the / ratios between tandem duplicates and retrogenes (human:  = 0.607  mouse:  = 0.257  -test). In addition  the non-synonymous substitutions in most duplicates are under selective constraints (/ < 1). . (A) Comparison of  ratios for tandem duplicates and retrogenes (log-scale). The non-synonymous substitutions in most duplicates are under selective constraints ( < 1); there is little difference in the  ratios between both types of duplicates (human:  = 0.607  mouse: = 0.257  -test) (B) Distribution of the duplicates before and after the split of human and mouse lineages (˜80 million years ago []). /2 was used to estimate the duplication age  which can be translated to the absolute time scale by using 2.5e-3 substitutions per site per million years []; there are significantly more tandem duplicates and retrogenes arising in the mouse-specific lineage ( < 1e-4 for both types  chi-square test) Nonetheless  the / test is directed to single site substitutions  which is not suitable for the case of whole gene substitutions such as the addition of duplicates. Lynch [] has presented a new strategy for this issue by examining the role of effective population size. Briefly  if the new duplicates are nearly neutral and fixed by genetic drift  a small population size is favourable for their retention. On the contrary  if the new duplicates are advantageous and fixed by positive selection  the opposite should be true. In fact  Lynch has suggested that the long-term increase of duplicates from prokaryotes to eukaryotes is initially a neutral process in response to the reduction of population size []. However  Shiu et al. [] have argued that positive selection also plays an important role at least in mammalian genomes because there are more duplicates retained in the mouse lineage (larger population size) than in the human lineage (smaller population size)  which cannot be explained by the difference in their duplication rate. Furthermore  since the generation time in mice is shorter than in humans  there will be more generations that are subject to selective pressures for mice and consequently  more duplicates retained in the mouse genome. In our dataset  there are both more tandem duplicates and more retrogenes in the mouse genome. To test if the excessive duplicates are really created in the mouse lineage  we grouped the age of the duplicates (inferred from ) according to the divergence time between the two species (Figure ). The result shows that  while the duplicates generated prior to the split of the two genomes are more or less the same  there are more duplicates arising in the mouse-specific lineage ( < 1e-4 for both types  chi-square test). Based on the same assumption with Shiu et al. []  this result implies that positive selection plays essential roles in the retention of both types of duplicates. Of the two key dimensions to determine the retention mechanisms  we have found that the extent of functional divergence is distinct for tandem duplicates and retrogenes  whereas the underlying evolutionary forces are the same. As tandem duplicates are generated at the DNA level and easily influenced by gene conversion  they are more likely to be maintained (Figure  and ). Two main models can be used to account for the conservation of duplicates  i.e. dosage model and buffering model. The former proposes that as the new duplicates will increase the gene dosage  they can bring about some selective advantages []. In contrast  the latter argues that the conserved duplicates are just used for compensation in case of the functional loss of their counterparts []  and thus they are free from selective pressures. Given the signature of positive selection (Figure )  we propose that the dosage model is more prevalent in the fixation of tandem duplicates. In fact  the dosage model predicts that the fitness of dosage-sensitive genes will increase with the increase of gene copies []  which is consistent with our observation that tandem duplicates tend to form large families (Figure ). Another large-scale functional analysis has revealed that tandem duplicates are enriched in receptors and binding proteins []  which are also dosage-sensitive genes []. Interestingly  copy number variants (CNV)  which are strongly associated with segmental tandem duplicates []  may also be maintained by dosage effect and positive selection []. Retrogenes and tandem duplicates display nearly opposite molecular properties. Since retrogenes are often distant from their parental counterparts and lose the original regulatory elements  they are more likely to undergo functional divergence (Figure  and ). There are also two main models available to account for the functional divergence  namely 'escape from adaptive conflict' (EAC) model [] and 'duplication-degeneration-complementation' (DDC) model []. Both of the models predict that the new duplicates will share the functions of the ancestral genes. However  the EAC model argues that duplications can release the potential benefits through functional specialization  whereas the DDC model only requires that the joint effect of the duplicates fulfil the original functions. The signature of positive selection in the retention of retrogenes votes for the prevalence of the EAC model (Figure ). In addition to our results  the analysis of gene movements has revealed that the X-linked genes are excessively transferred to autosomes via retropositions in mammalian genomes []. These retrogenes can not only sustain essential functions during the inactivation of the male X chromosome  but also develop male-specific expression patterns [  ]. The coexistence of functional divergence and selective benefits provides an important evidence for the EAC model.

In this population  the paternal allele -intron3-3072A increased litter size from the third parity. The non-additive effects on litter size reported here should be tested before implementation in other pig breeding schemes. The use of molecular information in pig breeding programs may enhance genetic gains by increasing the accuracy of genetic evaluation and decreasing generation intervals []. More than twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on candidate porcine genes have been associated with litter size or with its main components [] and some genetic tests have been developed and implemented by breeding companies. For example  variants of the genes  and  have been shown to have effects on litter size ranging from 0.25 to over 1 piglet per litter []. The retinol binding protein 4 () gene codes for a member of the RBP protein family present in the uterus and in embryos during the early stages of gestation []. These proteins bind retinol  the bound retinol is then internalized by the cells and triggers embryogenesis []. Messer . [] have proposed  as a possible candidate gene associated with litter size. Subsequently  Rothschild . []  have carried out a study on animals from six commercial lines and reported a significant effect of an intronic polymorphism  the - I  on the total number of born piglets. Many other studies have shown the existence of a relationship between this polymorphism and litter size [–]. The protein coded by the estrogen receptor 1 () gene promotes the expression of different transcription factors involved in the reproductive function of female tissues (ovaries  cervix  uterus...). The  polymorphism has been studied previously in the Tai-Zumu line by our group but no significant effect on litter size was observed []. Recently  Gonçalves . [] have performed an interesting study in a commercial population that revealed a significant interaction on litter size between - I and  polymorphisms. A polymorphism detected in the porcine insulin-like growth factor 2 () gene  the -intron3-G3072A SNP []  has been described as the causal factor of the SSC2 imprinted QTL  which affects fat deposition and muscle growth [  ]. Pigs inheriting the paternal allele A have lower backfat thickness and higher lean growth. These effects have been confirmed in different experimental crosses and commercial populations [–]. Thus  it is likely that allele A has been favored in populations where artificial selection has focused on decreasing fat deposition and increasing lean content. IGF2 is a peptide hormone that participates in the IGF axis  which plays an important role in the promotion of cell proliferation and in the inhibition of apoptosis []. Some authors have demonstrated a direct participation of IGF2 in the reproductive function in mouse and farm animals [  ]. In addition  selection on lean growth and consequent decrease of fat percentage could reduce prolificacy since larger litter sizes impose greater demand on the sow's energy reserves []. Therefore  selecting the paternal inherited allele A could have undesired effects on litter size  which should be evaluated []. Estimates of the genetic parameters of litter size in pigs are usually obtained using repeatability models where different parities are considered as different records of the same trait. However  various results support the hypothesis that early and later parities may be partially controlled by different genes and should be considered as different traits. Therefore the use of multitrait models would be more appropriate [–]. The aim of this research was to study the possible effects of porcine    and  polymorphisms on the prolificacy of a hyperprolific Chinese-European composite pig line. For this purpose  the detection of new polymorphisms in the  gene and analysis of their possible effects on litter size were carried out. In addition  the interaction between  and  polymorphisms was investigated on our material. The -intron3-G3072A polymorphism  already used in selection to increase lean growth  was analyzed in order to check if selection on the paternal allele A could affect litter size. All the analyses were carried out using a bivariate model to discriminate the genetic effects on early and later parities. Research protocols followed the guidelines stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching (FASS  1999). Data from a Chinese-European composite dam line (Tai-Zumu) were provided by GENE+. This line was developed from Meishan and Jiaxing sows inseminated by hyperprolific French Large White boars  and it was selected for lean growth during nine generations []. The pedigree available for this composite line contained 2973 animals of which 2570 sows had 6472 litter size records distributed among 59 farm-year-season classes. The number of litters per parity class is reported in Table . Different subsets of genotyped sows were used for the different association analyses carried out. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples according to a standard protocol []. Total RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie  Madrid  Spain) from liver samples. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 5 µg of total RNA  Superscript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen  Life Technologies  Barcelona) and random hexamers following the supplier's instructions. The PCR reactions were performed in a 25 µL final volume containing standard buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0  50 mM KCl  20 mM (NH4)2SO4)  MgCl concentrations optimized for each amplified fragment (Additional file   Table S1)  200 µM dNTP  0.5 µM of each primer  0.5 U of Tth polymerase (Biotools  Madrid  Spain) and 70 ng of genomic DNA or 2 µL of cDNA. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94°C (5 min)  40 cycles at 94°C (30 s)  the specific annealing temperature (Additional File   Table S1) for each primer pair (45 s) and 72°C (45 s)  with a final extension step at 72°C (10 min). The amplified products were sequenced using BigDye-Terminator Cycle Sequencing 3.0 in an ABI 3730 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems  Warrington  UK). The sequences were edited and aligned using Winstar software. A 565 bp fragment spanning from exon 2 to 4 of the  gene was amplified from genomic DNA samples of three Tai-Zumu individuals using the PCR protocol published by Rothschild  []. These authors reported an  polymorphism but the exact information about its location was not available. The final sequence was submitted to GenBank (accession number: GU932906). Moreover  two overlapping  cDNA fragments spanning from exon 2 to 6 and covering the complete coding sequence (CDS) were amplified from Tai-Zumu individuals. The primer pairs (RBP4F1-RBP4R1 and RBP4F2-RBP4R2  Additional File   Table S1) were designed from the available porcine  mRNA sequence (GenBank accession number: NM_214057). Five intronic and one exonic SNP were detected in the  sequences obtained. One of the intronic SNP (c.249-63G>C) was identified as the  polymorphism previously reported by Rothschild  []. This SNP was genotyped on genomic DNA samples using the published PCR-RFLP protocol. Allele G named as restriction pattern 1 corresponds to three main bands of 190/157/134 bp and allele C named as restriction pattern 2 corresponds to four main bands of 190/134/112/45 bp []. A pyrosequencing protocol that allowed simultaneous genotyping of three intronic SNP (c.248+15T>G  c.248+16G>A and c.248+27A>T) was developed using primers RBP4F3-RBP4R3-RBP4Pyr3 (Additional File   Table S1). In addition to Tai-Zumu individuals  samples from wild boars as well as Iberian  Landrace  Duroc  Large-White and Meishan breeds were also analyzed.  haplotypes were determined using the PHASE software. The - II genotyping data were taken from Muñoz  [] and the -intron3-G3072A polymorphism was genotyped by pyrosequencing as described by Van Laere . [] in a PSQ HS 96 system (Pyrosequencing AB  Uppsala  Sweden). A multitrait animal model was used to estimate genetic parameters. Under this approach  the numbers of piglets born alive at each one of the six parity classes (1 to 5 and = 6) were treated as different traits. where to represent litter size records (NBA) at each parity class  to are the vectors of fixed effects for the six different traits considered  which include the genetic line of the litter's sire (Tai-Zumu or Landrace)  parity order and farm-year-season  to and to are vectors of random additive genetics and residual effects for each trait  respectively. Matrices to and to are incidence matrixes that associate respectively elements of to and to with the records in to is the vector of permanent environmental effects for each sow with records in the last parity class being  the incidence matrix relating the elements of with the records in . The expectation of (i = 1 to 5 and = 6) is and the variance-covariance structure of random effects was assumed to be: where  and  are the direct additive genetic and residual variances for trait i  respectively   is the direct genetic covariance between trait i and j (j = 1 to 5 and = 6) and  their residual covariance. A preliminary analysis of the whole data set was performed using this multitrait model. Then  a bivariate model was used to carry out a subsequent analysis of litter size data. In this model  the number of piglets born alive at the first and second parity (NBA) and the number of piglets born alive at the third and subsequent parities (NBA ) were considered as two different traits. The reduced model can be written as: Finally  three specific bivariate models were used for the different association analyses  depending on indicator variable values included in  matrices: Mendelian inheritance: used in the analysis of the effect of    and  polymorphisms. It includes additive () and dominant () effects. The value of  for each sow depends on her genotype ( = -1  0  1) and  assumes a zero value for homozygote individuals and 1 for the heterozygotes. Mendelian inheritance with epistasis effects: used in the joint analysis of  and  polymorphisms. Besides  and  values  additive x additive interaction () effects are also included.  are equal to -1  0 or 1 depending on the genotypic combination of the analyzed polymorphisms (AA11 = -1; AA12 = 0; AA22 = 1; AB-- = 0; BB11 = -1; BB12 = 0 and BB22 = 1) Paternal or maternal imprinting: used in the analysis of  SNP. Two association analyses were performed fitting the paternal imprinting effects. Additive and dominant effects were included in the first analysis but not in the second one. In the first analysis  imprinting effects are included () for the heterozygote sows: on the one hand   = -1/2 or  = 1/2 if they have inherited respectively allele G or allele A from the father and on the other hand   = 0 for homozygote individuals. In the second analysis  the sows that have received the paternal allele G (GG or GA) have  = -1/2 and those that have received the paternal allele A (AA or AG) have  = 1/2. A similar parameterization was used for maternal imprinting. The statistical significance of each effect was tested comparing the full and reduced models by the <U+03C7> approach to the distribution of the log-likelihood ratios. Variance components and parameter estimates were obtained using VCE-5 program [] and association analysis were performed using Qxpack package [] Estimated values of heritability ( = s/s) for NBA at each parity class and estimated genetic correlations between parities are shown in Table . Heritability values for the last two parity classes clearly exceed those of the first four classes. Genetic correlations are greater between adjacent parities  but their values tend to decrease as the number of interspersed parities increases. Although different parities should be considered as different traits  the lower number of genotyped dams compared to the total number of sows requires the use of simpler models to perform the association analyses of this study. According to the structure of the genetic correlations  the records of the first and second parities were grouped in one trait (NBA) and the remaining in another one (NBA ). Parameter estimates for both traits obtained from the whole data set are shown in Table . On the one hand  estimates of parity order effects on NBA were expressed as deviation from the first parity (-0.08 ± 0.36) and on NBA as deviation from the third parity (4-3 = 0.25 ± 0.18; 5-3 = -0.04 ± 0.43 & = 6-3 = 0.07 ± 0.69). On the other hand  the estimated effect of genetic line of the litter's sire was not statistically significant  i.e. 0.25 ± 0.18 for NBA and -0.07 ± 0.25 for NBA. After sequencing and aligning the 565 bp genomic fragment of the  gene  five intronic SNP were detected: c.111+47T>C  located in intron 2 and c.248+15G>T  c.248+16A>G  c.248+27A>T and c.249-63G>C located in intron 3. The c.249-63G>C SNP was identified as the polymorphism  [] and corresponds to the second position of a recognition site of the  I restriction enzyme (C GG). Moreover  a silent SNP  c.156G>A was detected on exon 3. In addition  two overlapping cDNA fragments of 485 and 479 bp  respectively  were amplified and sequenced. The assembled fragments form an 861 bp sequence that covers the complete CDS. As a result  the SNP c.156G>A was confirmed but no other exonic polymorphism could be detected. From the comparison of the different sequences  SNP c.111+47T>C  c.156G>A  c.248+15G>T and c.248+16A>G seem to be cosegregating in the sequenced Tai-Zumu individuals. In order to check their segregation pattern  SNP c.248+15G>T  c.248+16A>G  c.248+27A>T and c.249-63G>C (- I) were genotyped on different domestic pig populations (Tai-Zumu  Duroc  Landrace  Large-White  Meishan and Iberian) and wild boars. The results distinguished four different haplotypes for the quoted positions: TGAC  GGAG  GAAG and GATG. Their respective frequencies in the different populations are shown in Table . In a first step  an association analysis of the  SNP was performed in 534 sows with 957 litter size records for NBA and 1043 for NBA. Allele 1 (frequency = 0.51) was significantly associated with a higher number of piglets born alive in the two first parities (NBA)  but not in the third and subsequent parities (NBA ). The estimated additive effect on NBA was 0.42 piglets per litter (=0.016)  and no dominance effects were observed (Table ). A separate analysis of  SNP was carried out on 403 sows (56 AA  180 AB and 167 BB)  with 733 litter size records for NBA and 934 for NBA. No significant effect on litter size was evidenced. In addition  a joint analysis between  and  polymorphisms was performed using data from 375 sows with 679 litter size records for NBA and 874 for NBA. The number of sows for each one of the nine genotypic combinations ranged from 12 ( AA/ 22) to 81 ( AB/ 12). The additive effect of  on NBA was confirmed and a significant interaction effect was detected on NBA (Table ). The genotypes of the largest litter sizes corresponded to the combinations ( AA/ 11) and ( BB  22) and the least prolific to the alternative combination ( BB/ 11) and ( AA/ 22) (Figure ). The estimated differences for NBA between both groups of sows are 1.09 ± 0.54 piglets ( < 0.046).       . Results obtained in the different association analyses fitting  SNP effects are shown in Table .A Mendelian inheritance analysis was performed on 550 genotyped sows (192 GG  264 GA and 94 AA)  with 985 records for NBA and 1057 records for NBA   but no significant result was obtained. Otherwise  to implement a model of imprinting inheritance requires that the paternal or maternal inheritance of the alleles can be determined in the heterozygote sows. This was possible for 56 of the 264 total heterozygotes: 31 with the paternal allele G and 25 with the paternal allele A. The analysis was performed on 342 sows with 613 records for NBA and 710 records for NBA. When additive and dominant effects were taken into account  a suggestive additive effect of the paternal allele A was detected on NBA (0.36 ± 0.21   0.052). If only paternal imprinting effects are considered  a significant increase produced by the paternal allele A of the number of piglets alive was detected on NBA. Maternal imprinting effects were not evidenced in a complementary analysis (Table ). If most of the genes affecting NBA at different parities were the same  homogenous heritability estimates and high values of genetic correlations would be expected. However  as shown in Table   heterogeneous values of heritability and genetic correlation were found. These results  as others previously obtained from different pig breeds  suggest that different genes or combinations of genes may affect litter size in each one of the parities [–]. Thus  multitrait models instead of the repeatability model should be used to analyse porcine litter size data  although simpler bivariate models distinguishing early and later parities may be adequate for reduced data sets. Porcine  studies performed so far have mainly focused on association analyses between the - polymorphism and litter size. The current study allowed us to detect four  haplotypes in six different pig breeds and European wild boars. TGAC is the only haplotype shared by all the populations analyzed and hence it is probably the ancestral haplotype. GGAG was exclusively detected in Meishan and GATG in Meishan and Tai-Zumu. The other haplotype (GAAG) was detected in all the pig breeds and wild boars analyzed except Iberian pigs that only displayed the TGAC haplotype. Some authors have reported introgression of Asian alleles in many European breeds  but not in Iberian pigs [–]. Our results confirm this and suggest an Asian origin for haplotypes GGAG  GAAG and GATG. The low frequency (0.009) of haplotype GAAG in wild boars can be explained by the existence of uncontrolled mating between wild boars and domestic pigs in a region where wild boars coexist with open air pig production. Another aspect to consider is that the number of detected haplotypes is higher for Meishan individuals than for those from European breeds. This is consistent with Amaral . [] who reported a higher haplotypic diversity and lower proportion of fixed markers in Chinese breeds. Similar situations have already been reported for other genes (    ) related to reproductive traits [  ]. The GATG haplotype showed a low frequency in the Tai-Zumu population (Table ) and thus performing an association analysis with one of the SNP instead of the haplotypes seemed more suitable. The SNP chosen was  I because it presents intermediate allelic frequencies in the population. Given the distribution of haplotypes observed in the Tai-Zumu population  the analysis carried out with the  SNP would be equivalent to comparing haplotype TGAC to haplotypes GAAG and GATG. Individual and joint association analyses of - I with NBA and NBA revealed a favourable additive effect of allele 1 on NBA. This result is in accordance with that detected by Rothschild . []. They have reported a 0.23 piglet/litter effect of the  allele on the total number of piglets born in six lines from different genetic origins. Also  Spöter . [] have detected both additive and dominant effects of 0.24 and 0.31 piglet/litter on NBA  in the German Landrace breed but not in the German Large-White breed. Similar negative results were obtained by other authors in a Duroc x Large White synthetic line and in a Polish breed [  ]. Experiments where frequencies of - I alleles were compared in control and selected lines for increased litter size did not reveal any significant result [  ]. These diverse results indicate that the causal mutation could be in linkage disequilibrium with the porcine  SNP. Besides  a possible dependence on the genetic background should be taken into account  because epistatic effects could be affecting pig prolificacy as recently reported [  ]. Gonçalves  [] have pointed out that effects of the  polymorphism on litter size depend on the genotype of the - II allele in a comparison between sows from three genotypic classes. The litter size for second and later parities of sows carrying either  allele A/ genotype 11 or  allele B/ genotype 22 was greater than that of sows grouped in the third class ( AA/ 22 and  BB/ 11). The results of our joint association analysis allow us to corroborate more precisely the results obtained by Gonçalves . [] i.e.  sows with genotypic combinations  AA/ 11 and  BB/ 22 were the most prolific for NBA. These findings may reflect a physiological interaction between estrogens and RBP4 proteins. Once  the first secretion of RBP has occurred in the embryo  embryonic estrogens are secreted in the maternal uterus where they induce an increase of expression and secretion of RBP proteins. These proteins enter the embryo cells rising the RBP receptors density and allowing the embryo development to continue []. Therefore the joint selection of  and  could be implemented to improve prolificacy in Tai-Zumu pigs  although its use in other commercial populations requires confirmation of the observed interaction. Implementation of molecular markers in selection requires exhaustive verification in order to ensure that no undesirable effect arises in other economically important traits. So far  some studies have been developed to check the effect of -intron3-G3072A on prolificacy  with uneven results in different populations  although the methodology used and the available information varied among the studies. Using a Mendelian inheritance model  Horak . and Katska-Kiazkiewicz . [  ] have detected significant effects of different  polymorphisms on litter size in Czech and Polish pigs  respectively. In addition  Rempel . [] have not detected any significant effect of -intron3-G3072A in a composite pig line. Assuming an imprinting inheritance model  Buys . [] have detected an increase on litter size due to the paternal inherited allele G in dam lines based on Large-White and Landrace breeds. However  in other studies an increase in prolificacy was detected on the heterozygote individuals who inherited the paternal allele A [  ]. In the current study  both types of inheritance were taken into account. A significant effect was only detected under the inheritance model of paternal imprinting  i.e. an increase of 0.74 piglet on NBA. Hence  it is clear that the results depend on the model employed. Note that imprinting phenomena could arise from CpG island methylation events that trigger the silencing of the genes on a chromosomal region [  ]. Indeed  the -intron3-G3072A mutation is located in a CpG island and its causality on pig lean growth has been well confirmed []. Although more studies are required to explain the effects on prolificacy  selection of the paternal -intron3-G3072A mutation could be implemented in the Tai-Zumu population due to its beneficial effects both on lean growth and litter size in third and subsequent parities. A multitrait model is recommended to analyze the effects of various polymorphisms on litter size since early and later parities can be partially controlled by different genes. Analysis of the  gene in wild boars and six porcine populations allowed to detect four haplotypes. Only one of the four detected haplotypes was shared by all the analyzed pig and wild boar populations indicating an ancestral origin of the quoted haplotype. Otherwise   does not seem to be the causative mutation associated with an increase in litter size. However  an interaction effect between  I and - II on NBA was detected in the Tai-Zumu population. According to this  the joint use of the most favorable genotypic combination could be implemented in order to select for higher litter size. Selecting the paternally inherited -intron3-3072A allele in Tai Zumu increases litter size from the third parity. The causative mutation could be situated either in the  gene or very close to this gene.

Dominance and epistatic effects are typically confounded with additive genetic and non-genetic effects. This confounding may cause the estimated genetic variance components to be inaccurate and biased. In this study  we constructed genetic covariance structures from whole-genome marker data  and thus used realized relationship matrices to estimate variance components in a heterogenous population of ~ 2200 mice for which four complex traits were investigated. These mice were genotyped for more than 10 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the variances due to family  cage and genetic effects were estimated by models based on pedigree information only  aggregate SNP information  and model selection for specific SNP effects. We show that the use of genome-wide SNP information can disentangle confounding factors to estimate genetic variances by separating genetic and non-genetic effects. The estimated variance components using realized relationship were more accurate and less biased  compared to those based on pedigree information only. Models that allow the selection of individual SNP in addition to fitting a relationship matrix are more efficient for traits with a significant dominance variance. Complex traits are important in evolution  human medicine  forensics and artificial selection programs [–]. Most complex traits show a mode of inheritance that may be caused by many functional genes with additive and dominance effects  and possibly epistatic interactions  and environmental effects [  ]. Traditionally  pedigree information has been used to estimate heritabilities and genetic effects for complex traits [–]. In many family studies  non-genetic factors such as familial or shared environmental effects can be confounded with genetic factors []. In particular for full-sibs there is confounding between shared environmental effects  additive genetic effects and non-additive genetic effects. Recently  it has become feasible to generate individual genotype information on large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across the whole genome  and genome-wide association studies have been performed in a number of species [  ]. It is expected that SNP and causal genes will be in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  making it possible to genetically dissect variation in complex traits in a more effective way []. Indeed  it has been shown that whole-genome dense SNP analyses can provide extra benefits compared to classical approaches based on pedigree information only []. In this study  we propose novel strategies that utilize dense SNP data for the genetic dissection of complex traits. First  we estimate a realized relationship matrix based on aggregate SNP information [–]. The realized relationship matrix in a classical mixed linear model makes it possible to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates for the narrow sense heritability  compared to traditional pedigree-based analysis [  ]. Second  we explicitly search for additional additive and dominance effects that may not have been already captured  by using a Bayesian model selection approach. In the process  a stochastic model selection of random SNP effects is carried out nested in a mixed linear model with additive polygenic effects. Additional genetic effects found in this process make it possible to estimate additive genetic and dominance variances with greater precision for some traits which have significant dominance effects. We examine the estimates by using a validation step where unobserved phenotypes in an independent validation set are predicted. We use phenotypic data for four complex traits and genotypic data for ~2200 mice with ~11 000 SNP across the whole genome. Publicly available data including pedigree  genotypic and phenotypic information on heterogeneous stock mice were used []; . The total number of animals was 2 296 from 85 unrelated families. The available pedigree spanned four generations. In this complex pedigree  there were 172 full-sib families with an average size of ~11 (SD ~8). The mice were reared in a total of 536 cages  and the number of animals per cage ranged from two to seven. This number was considered as a cage density factor for analyses. Figure  describes the family structure for one of the 85 unrelated families  which contains 44 members and five nuclear (full-sib) families. Cage information is displayed below each animal when known and indicates a fair degree of confounding between cages and families. Genotypes were available for 12 112 SNP on most animals in the pedigree  and we used the 11 730 SNP located on the autosomal chromosomes. The reason for excluding the sex chromosomes was that modeling them would complicate the analyses without greatly changing the estimates. The phenotypes were already adjusted for environmental fixed effects  e.g. sex  age  year and season [  ]. However  the effects due to cage  cage density and family were further modeled with and without using information on SNP and additive polygenic effects. Four complex traits were investigated i.e. coat color (CC) (a score from light to dark)  weight at 10 weeks (WT)  recovery from ear punctuation (REP)  and freezing time during cue (FDC). The reasons for choosing these are: CC has a number of major genes with relatively large effects and the environmental variance is small  WT is a typical quantitative trait with the variance probably affected by numerous genes  REP is a quantitative trait with a moderate heritability  and FDC is a quantitative trait with a low heritability. . The members are indexed from 1 to 44; the cage information is under the indexed number if available The intra-class correlation of phenotypes for groups having relationship  based on pedigree information was estimated ( = 1/16  1/8  1/4 and 1/2). For example  the intra-class correlation for the group with relationship  = 1/2 was that for full-sibs. However  for relationship  = 1/16  1/8  and 1/4  it was difficult to group and classify them because of the complicated pedigree structure. In order to estimate intra-class correlations for the group with relationship   pairs of relationship  were used  but in a way that there were no relationships between individuals of different pairs  i.e. relationship =  within each pair and relationship = 0 for individuals of different pairs. Because of this restriction  not all pairs of relationship  could be used simultaneously. Therefore  we sampled 10 000 independent pairs for each relationship  for each trait. The number of pairs for relationship   and the average number of pairs in 10 000 samples are given in Table . The variance between these sampled pairs scaled by total variance would be the intra-class correlation [] for individuals having a relationship . Estimated intra-class correlations were averaged over the 10 000 sampling sets. These correlations are  approximately  the summary statistics that are modeled in the variance component analyses. A mixed linear model analysis was used to estimate random polygenic  cage and family effects  and the fixed effect of cage density. The model can be expressed as  where  is a vector of phenotypic observations   is a vector of fixed effects including the overall mean and the cage density as covariates   is a vector of random environmental family effects   is a vector of random environmental cage effects   is a vector of  random additive polygenic effects for all animals derived from pedigree information ( = 2296)  and  is a vector of residuals. It is assumed that  and  are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a variance of    and   respectively.      and  are incidence matrices for the effects. The variance covariance matrix () of phenotypic observations for the model can be written as  where  is the numerator relationship matrix based on pedigree information only  and  is an identity matrix. In order to see if estimates for genetic and environmental family effects are dependent  a simple comparison is carried out for model 1  by omitting subsequently the term  (model 1) or  (model 1). Variance components and effects are estimated by a residual maximum likelihood (REML) method [  ]. The ratio of each variance component over the total phenotypic variance was calculated. When SNP information is available  the realized relationship matrix () can be estimated and implemented in the model [–]. To estimate   we used the method introduced by Oliehoek et al. (2006) since it is robust and best-performed among tested methods in their study. The details to estimate  are in Appendix A. The model can be written as  where  is a vector of  random genome-wide effects for all animals. It was assumed that  is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance . The variance covariance matrix of phenotypic observations for this model is  Variance components and effects were again estimated by REML [  ]. Effects of specific quantitative trait loci (QTL) may not be fully captured by model 2  and a Bayesian approach can be used to explicitly search for sets of SNPs that explain additional genetic variance. In the first instance  we model only additive effects of QTL. The model can be written as  where is the number of SNP associated with the QTL  is the random additive effects of the i SNP which is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance    is a column vector having coefficients 0  1 or 2 representing indicator variables of the genotype for each animal at the i SNP. The variance covariance matrix of phenotypic observations is  In addition to additive SNP effects  dominant SNP effects are modeled for SNP having three genotypes and its heterozygosity > 10%. The model can be written as  where sis the random dominance effects of the i SNP assuming a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance   and is a column vector having coefficients equal to 1 for a heterozygous genotype and 0 for a homozygous genotype at the i SNP. The variance covariance matrix of phenotypic observations is  The polygenic heritability based on   and the ratio of variance due to family  cage and additive and dominance SNP effects over the total phenotypic variance were estimated using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) and REML. In the estimation of variance components  solving mixed model equation (MME) was a heavy computing task because of very dense . Therefore  solving dense MME and obtaining REML estimates in every MCMC round was almost impossible in models 3 and 4. Because of this obstacle  we used a computationally tractable strategy to estimate variance components. Initially  variance components were estimated using REML from model 2 (    and ). In an RJMCMC process (Appendix B)  the number of SNP associated with QTL  their positions and effects were sampled  conditional on the estimated variance components of     and . The SNP effects were treated as fixed effects such that it was not required to update the variance covariance matrix () nor invert  for each set of sampled QTL effects  which made it possible to carry out a large number of RJMCMC rounds. Variance components for family  cage  polygenic and additive and dominance SNP effects were estimated every 1000 rounds using REML  and the estimated variance components were stored to obtain the posterior mean of the estimates. We used a total of 100 000 rounds of MCMC after 10 000 burn-in periods. Although the variance components were updated and stored only 100 times  the estimates reached convergence quickly probably because of a large number of iterations for the main process. In order to efficiently search for sets of significant SNP  we preliminarily pruned SNP  and excluded closely linked SNP having r > 0.95 in sliding 50 SNP windows using PLINK []. After pruning  4194 SNP remained and were used for the Bayesian analysis. We predicted phenotypes of individuals ( ) with models 1 to 4. In the Bayesian approach (models 3 and 4)  averages of  over all RJMCMC rounds were used as predicted phenotypes. In order to quantify how well each model can disentangle genetic effects from environmental effects  we used two strategies to produce estimation and validation sets. First  we randomly selected approximately half of the individuals within each full-sib family  which divided the whole data into two subsets. One set was used as an estimation set  and the other set was used as a validation set. Since some individuals in the estimation and validation sets belonged to the same full-sib family  prediction was carried out within full-sib families. Second  approximately half of the full-sib families were randomly selected within each of the 85 unrelated families. This also divided the whole data into two subsets. In this case  no individual in the estimation and validation sets shared the same full-sib family although they would be related. Therefore  prediction was performed across full-sib families. In ten replicates  the phenotypes for a validation set (~50% of the population) were predicted from the estimation based on the phenotypes and genotypes for the rest of the population in the estimation set. For each comparison  we correlated the predicted value of an animal in the validation set with its phenotype (which was not used in the estimation phase). We term the correlation between predicted phenotypes and actual phenotypes as the accuracy of prediction. Figure  shows phenotypic correlations as a function of additive relationship for each trait. For all traits  the correlation among full-sibs (k = 1/2) was relatively much higher than for other types of relationship. For CC  the correlation increased exponentially. For REP  the correlations for  = 1/16  1/8 and 1/4 were relatively low and there was little increase until a highly increased correlation for  = 1/2. For FDC  the correlations for  = 1/16  1/8 and 1/4 were close to zero with again a much higher value for  = 1/2. For WT  the pattern was similar; the correlations for 1/16  1/8 and 1/4 were low  and not much different from each other  but increased dramatically with  = 1/2. The relative high correlations for  = 1/2 were probably due to the fact that members within this group (i.e. full-sib) had common dominance and environmental family effects in addition to common additive genetic effects. . Intra-class phenotypic correlation plotted against relationship based on pedigree information. FDC - Freezing during cue; REP - Recovery from ear punctuation; WT - Weight at 10 weeks; CC - Coat color Estimated variance components proportional to the total phenotypic variance and model log-likelihood are compared in Tables      and . The results for the trait FDC are shown in Table . The model without family effects gave a log-likelihood value of 1619.24 which was significantly lower than that from the full model 1. A model without polygenic effects gave the same log-likelihood as the full model (1621.3)  indicating that no genetic effects are captured by the pedigree information. Indeed  genetic variance was estimated as zero in the full model 1. This was not the case in model 2 which implemented the realized relationship matrix based on aggregate SNP information. In model 2  the variance due to additive genetic effects was increased to 25%  and the variance due to family effects was decreased to 7% of the total phenotypic variance. The model log-likelihood increases to 1633.91 which was much higher than that from model 1. This showed that the realized relationship matrix based on SNP information could disentangle the genetic effects which were confounded with environmental family effects in the pedigree-based analysis. When using model 3 to search for specific additive SNP effects  the additive genetic variance increased slightly to 30% of total phenotypic variance  e.g. 18% due to polygenic and 12% due to specific SNPs. The variances for family and cage effects did not change much compared to model 2. The averaged log-likelihood was 1650.56  and the averaged number of QTL fitted in the models was 3.55 in the RJMCMC process. When using model 4 to search for specific additive and dominant SNP effects  a relatively large variance due to dominance effects was estimated (27% of total phenotypic variance). Model 4 showed the highest value for the average log-likelihood  and the average number of additive and dominance QTL fitted was 10.2. The averaged Akaike information criterion (AIC) for model 4 was dramatically lower than that for model 3  implying that model 4 was not better than model 3. The results for the trait REP are shown in Table . A model without either polygenic effects or environmental family effects gave a lower log-likelihood than the full model 1. This indicated that both polygenic and family effects should be fitted in the model. In the full model 1  the variance of family  cage and polygenic effects as percentage of total phenotypic variance was 10%  11% and 25%  respectively. When using model 2  the additive genetic variance increased to 50% of total phenotypic variance  while family and cage variance was reduced to 6% and 8% of total phenotypic variance  respectively. The log-likelihood with model 2 was substantially higher than that with model 1 (1670.71). This indicated that the model implementing the realized relationship matrix based on aggregate SNP information explained variation in phenotypes better than the model implementing the numerator relationship matrix based on pedigree information (this is also empirically proven in the next section). When using model 3  the estimated variance due to additive genetic effects increased slightly to 54% of total phenotypic variance. Variances for family and cage effects did not change much compared to those of model 2. The average log-likelihood was 1717.3  and the average number of QTL was 5.3 in the RJMCMC process. When using model 4  the estimated dominance variance was 15% of total phenotypic variance. The average log-likelihood was 1730.33 and the average number of additive and dominance QTL was 14.72. The average AIC for model 4 was not much improved  compared to that for model 2 (Table ). Table  shows the results for the trait WT. On the one hand  the model without polygenic effects gave a log-likelihood of 3382.73 which was significantly lower than that from the full model 1 (3389). On the other hand  the family effects were shown to be negligible in phenotypic variation  i.e. a reduced model excluding family effects gave the same likelihood as the full model. In the full model 1  the family  cage and polygenic variances were estimated as 0%  17% and 64% of total phenotypic variance  respectively. However  model 2 gave very different estimates  i.e. 14%  16% and 38% for family  cage and polygenic variances  respectively. The log-likelihood for model 2 was much higher than that for model 1. When using model 3  the family and cage variances decreased slightly to 12% and 14% while the additive genetic variance increased to 48%  e.g. 27% due to polygenic and 21% due to specific SNPs. The values for the average log-likelihood and AIC were improved although they were not substantially higher than those for model 2. In model 4  the family and cage variances decreased to 5% and 6%. The additive genetic variance was 44% which was not very different to that of model 3  and the dominance variance was estimated as 35%. The average log-likelihood and AIC were moderately improved. The results for the trait CC are shown in Table . A model without polygenic effects based on pedigree information gave a significantly lower log-likelihood compared to the full model 1 but omitting family effects gave only a small change. When using model 2  there were only slight changes in the variance components  e.g. the family variance increased to 7% and the polygenic variance decreased slightly to 71% of total phenotypic variance. However  the model log-likelihood was considerably higher than that from the model 1. When using model 3  the estimated variances were similar to those of model 2 although most of the additive genetic variance was captured by specific SNP. In model 4  nearly all the variance was captured by additive and dominant QTL effects and the averaged log-likelihood as well as AIC were far better than in any of the other models. Table  shows sampling correlations between estimated variance components as derived from the average information matrix  i.e. the variance covariance matrix of estimated variance components. Correlations between  and  were very high and negative for REP  WT and CC  ranging from -0.85 to -0.94. Correlations between  and  were moderate and negative for FDC (-0.41). This showed that the additive genetic effects derived from pedigree information were highly confounded with the environmental family or cage effects. However  correlations between  and  were low for all the traits (-0.1 ~ -0.23)  and those between  and  were negligible  indicating that realized relationships based on aggregate SNP information could disentangle genetic effects from environmental effects. For all the traits  the sampling correlations between estimated variances due to genetic and non-genetic effects were close to zero when using models 3 and 4. Accuracies of the prediction of unobserved phenotypes for the various models are shown in Table . Prediction was carried out for individuals within full-sib families or across full-sib families. In general  the accuracy was much lower for model 1 than for model 2. For all the traits  the accuracies for model 3 were slightly higher than those for model 2 although the differences in accuracy between models 2 and 3 were not significant. For FDC and CC the accuracies for model 4 were far better than those for model 3 where there was a considerable difference in AIC between models 3 and 4. However  for REP and WT there was no significant difference between the accuracies for models 3 and 4 and AIC values for the models were also not substantially different to each other. Accuracies were highest for CC  which has the largest heritability  and smallest for FDC which has also the lowest heritability. The accuracies for predicting individuals within full-sib families were higher than those for predicting across full-sib families  which was expected since family information could not be used across the full-sib families. Interestingly  the difference between the accuracies for models 1 and 2 was larger when predicting phenotypes across full-sib families  compared to that when predicting phenotypes within full-sib families. The reduction in accuracy due to lack of family information was larger when using model 1 than when using model 2. This showed that the performance of model 2 was apparently less dependent on environmental family effects. Deviation from unity of the regression coefficient of true phenotypes on predicted phenotypes is an indication of bias in the estimation compared to the true value. The averaged values of regression coefficients were close to 1 when predicting phenotypes within full-sib families. However  when predicting phenotypes across full-sib families  the values were clearly biased probably because of lack of family information across the full-sib families. In general  models 3 and 4 would give more biased estimates  compared to models 1 or 2 although the difference was small. We have shown that a mixed linear model implementing a realized relationship matrix based on aggregate SNP information can efficiently disentangle genetic effects from environmental family and cage effects when the number of causal genes is large and their effects are additive  e.g. REP and WT in this study. When dealing with a trait having a limited number of causal genes with possibly dominance effects  e.g. FDC and CC in this study  a model with a finite number of individual loci can be used to help to disentangle efficiently genetic effects from non-genetic effects. Moreover  the latter model can separate additive and non-additive genetic effects and capture more of the total genetic variance. Therefore  the estimated variance components and resulting solutions from the models based on SNP information are more reliable and accurate  compared to those based on pedigree information only  and they allow a better dissection of the various genetic and non-genetic components of variation. For REP and WT there was no improvement in accuracies for models 3 or 4  compared to those for model 2  which may be due to the fact that the true model for the traits is probably an infinitesimal model like model 2  i.e. a large number of causal genes  each with a small effect. Another possible reason might be that we used a slightly unrealistic prior for the number of QTL in the RJMCMC process. We used a Poisson distribution with a mean of 1 as the prior distribution for the number of QTL (Appendix B). It has been reported previously that the method is robust to different priors for the number of QTL [    ]. Higher values gave more QTL sampled into the model  but the effect on prediction accuracy was small []. Since we analysed a single data set we cannot be sure about all the causal factors and how they are (partially) confounded. However  we have shown that the model likelihood increased (Tables  to )  the sampling correlation between estimated effects for the factors decreased (Table )  and the accuracy of predicting genetic effects in validation sets increased (Table ) when using the models based on whole-genome SNP data. These observations strongly suggest that confounding effects between genetic and non-genetic effects are better disentangled when using whole-genome SNP data  compared to traditional approaches based on pedigree information only. In our study  we have estimated a variance covariance matrix of the variance components using average information from Fisher's scoring and the Hessian matrix []. A full Bayesian approach [–] may be able to assess the confounding between family  cage and polygenic effects by estimating the posterior correlations between variance components  e.g. BUGS []. Our approach differs from a full Bayesian method as we used a (residual) maximum likelihood within the MCMC process to take advantage of a quick convergence and to decrease reducibility problems. Moreover  the realized relationship matrix was simultaneously fitted with specific SNP effects so that larger SNP effects  with or without dominance effects  could be captured and estimated adjusted for polygenic effects. In real practical situations where genetic and environmental effects are often confounded  the proposed approach may be worthwhile to implement and help dissect genetic variation of complex traits. The better performance of the realized relationship matrix based on SNP information  compared to the numerator relationship matrix based on pedigree  is probably due to the fact that SNP-based analysis can better predict some of the variation within a family []. In Figure   a validation set for REP was used as an example to show variation in estimated genetic values within families. As shown in Figure   individual genetic values estimated from model 1 based on pedigree information are the same for all the members of the same family whereas those from model 2 based on SNP vary within families (Figure ). Part of the variation within families could be captured by SNP information  resulting in consistent improvement on the estimation of phenotypes (Table ). Similar results were observed for other traits. . Estimated genetic values plotted against family mean for model 1 (A) and model 2 (B) Because most elements of the realized relationship matrix based on SNP data are non-zero  sparse matrix techniques [  ] could not be used neither to invert the  matrix nor to solve the mixed model equation. This resulted in much longer computing time to estimate variance components based on the realized relationship matrix. Therefore  we had to use the computationally tractable approach that was modified from the original approach. However  the estimated variance components for family  cage and polygenic effects were mostly consistent across the MCMC process. Therefore  we did not expect very different results when using the modified version. In model 3  covariance between SNP was negligible probably because the model had a better fit when less dependent SNP were selected. However  this was not the case with model 4 because additive and dominance effects for a SNP were always fitted together whether they were correlated or not. This would cause a negative covariance between SNP effects  and overestimation of total phenotypic variance. When covariance between SNP is explicitly modelled  better estimates can be obtained although there is a risk of overparameterization in model 4. In conclusion  the proposed method implementing a realized relationship matrix based on aggregate SNP information is useful to genetically dissect complex traits especially when there are confounding factors between genetic and non-genetic effects. Resulting variance components are less biased and more accurate. A further analysis could be carried out using the proposed Bayesian approach to disentangle additive genetic and dominance effects. This novel strategy may help to understand the architecture of various complex traits. Meuwissen THE  Hayes BJ  Goddard ME: Prediction of total genetic value using genome-wide dense marker maps.

All authors drafted the manuscript and approved the final manuscript.                                      Following Oliehoek et al.

Therefore  When multiple marker loci are used  Due to dependency of the estimates on the allele frequency at each locus  a different weight should be given to each locus. Following Oliehoek et al.

[] introduced an equal drift estimator for obtaining assuming the increase in coancestry since the base population is equal at all loci. where is expected homozygosity at locus l  and is expected homozygosity at the locus having the lowest homozygosity. Expected homozygosity is calculated from estimated allele frequencies.                                                                           Concerning model 3 and 4  the number of significant SNPs () and an indicator vector of their positions () are unknown parameters to be estimated. Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is used to obtain the posterior distribution of and . During the MCMC procedure  maximum likelihood estimates are obtained for   a  d       and  ( ) given sampled and  in every round. This is an empirical Bayesian approach [  ]. The posterior probability of the parameters can be written as  where (|  <U+03C1>   ) is the likelihood of the observed phenotypes given the sampled variables  (     ) is the joint prior probability of the variables  and the denominator is summed over the probabilities of all possible parameter states. If the parameter states are many  a MCMC method can be an efficient tool to obtain the posterior distribution for the parameters as used in this study. When varying the number of SNP in the model  the model dimension varies. A Metropolis-Hastings sampler cannot properly infer the correct distribution unless the model dimension is fixed. However  a RJMCMC [] can deal with all possible states across different model dimensions according to the proper acceptance ratio  and give the correct posterior distribution []. In this study  SNP-in and SNP-out step are used for moving the Markov chain across different model dimensions. With a proposal probability  a SNP can be newly added to the model (in) or excluded from the model (out). When adding a SNP ( + 1)  its position is uniformly sampled from all unoccupied putative positions across the region  and included in the model. When deleting a SNP  one of the occupied SNP in the model is uniformly sampled  and excluded from the model. The parameters for the new model are estimated using ML. The proposal of adding or deleting a SNP is accepted with an acceptance ratio  The first term in the right hand side is the posterior density consisting of the likelihood and the prior  and the second and third term are the proposal probability of adding or deleting a SNP from the model. (*|) is a proposal probability of changing the number of SNP in the model from to *  and  is the Jacobian of the transformation function probability from the current model to the other. Because adding or deleting a SNP in the method is the identity transformation   is 1 [    ]. The prior of the number of SNP  e.g. ()  has a Poisson distribution with mean =1. This assumes that there is no prior information available for the number of SNP  and this is a conservative way of detecting SNP associated with QTL  avoiding false positives. A flat uniform prior is used for . In order to remedy the computational burden due to dense  the process is slightly modified. In the process  the log-likelihood of the observed phenotypes is conditional on the variance covariance matrix () with      and  that are already estimated in model 2. The log-likelihood can be obtained as  In every 1000 rounds  REML estimates for  and  are obtained given and   which assumes normal prior.

In conclusion given a high SNP density  the gene frequency model can be used to map QTL with considerable accuracy even within a 1 cM region. Molecular information is currently being used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and for genetic evaluation. This information usually consists of molecular genotypes at polymorphic loci. These loci can be broadly classified into two types: I) those that have a direct effect on the trait  and II) those that do not have a direct effect on the trait but are linked to a trait locus (markers). Loci of type II can be further classified into two types: IIa) loci that are in linkage disequilibrium with the trait locus across the population (LD markers)  and IIb) loci that are in linkage equilibrium with the trait locus (LE markers) []. In outbred populations  until recently  marker analyses were primarily based on LE markers [–]. LE markers do not provide information to model the mean at linked QTL  but they do provide information to model covariances at the linked QTL. These covariances can be written in terms of the conditional IBD probabilities at a linked QTL [    ] and provide information to map QTL and for genetic evaluation using markers. This cosegregation (CS) information comes from the non-random association of grand-parental origin of alleles at markers and QTL. This kind of analysis is called pedigree-based linkage or cosegregation analysis. The accuracy of mapping a QTL by these methods depends on the number of recombinations or meioses within the pedigree. On the other hand  LD markers provide information to model both the mean and covariances at the linked QTL [–]. This LD information comes from the non-random association of allele states at markers and QTL. Before high density genotypes were available  LD between markers and QTL was created by crossing of two divergent lines. Given the high density genotypes that are currently available  markers that are in close proximity to QTL are expected to be in LD with the QTL. Thus LD or association mapping can now be undertaken in outbred populations without the need to create specialized crosses. These analyses that capture the information from LD markers for mapping and genetic evaluation are called population-based association or linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses. Association analysis is expected to have higher accuracy than linkage analysis  but it is less robust to spurious association []. An analysis that combines the LD and CS information (LDCS analysis) has higher accuracy than LA analysis alone as well as greater robustness to spurious association than LD analysis alone [  ]. Many methods have been proposed for the LDCS analysis. In some of these methods  phenotypes are modeled as a mixture distribution due to the segregation of the QTL. Analyses involving mixture distributions are computationally demanding [  –]. Thus  other methods often model phenotypes as a normal distribution  where the mean and covariance matrix are computed conditional on marker information [    –]. The method proposed in this paper belongs to the latter group. An analysis that models the mean and covariances using LD markers was first proposed by Goddard [] and was further developed by Wang et al. []  when disequilibrium was entirely due to crossbreeding and the marker locus was assumed to be in equilibrium with the QTL in the parental breeds. Methodology to accommodate purebred populations with disequilibrium was considered by Fernando and Totir []. The parameters in their model included the mean and variance at the linked QTL for each marker haplotype in the founders []  but did not specify the number of alleles at the QTL. Here  we consider a similar approach but following Fernando [] and Johnson and Harris []  we assume only two alleles at the linked QTL  which is also a common assumption in models where segregation of the QTL is explicitly modeled resulting in a mixture distribution for the phenotypes [    –  –]. The parameters in this two-allele model include the gene frequency at the linked QTL for each marker haplotype in the founders and the additive effect of the QTL [  ]. Harris [] estimated these model parameters by restricted maximum likelihood []. One of the problems with this approach is that the number of gene frequencies to be estimated increases exponentially with the number of marker loci that are used to form haplotypes. The number of parameters to be estimated can be reduced by making assumptions about how LD is generated  which then provides a model for QTL gene frequencies for the different haplotypes []. In this paper a logit-normal prior probability density is considered for the QTL gene frequencies to accommodate relationships between QTL frequencies for different marker haplotypes. In this paper we will first present the gene frequency model that combines linkage disequilibrium (LD) and cosegregation information  as first introduced by Fernando []. Then we will evaluate the performance of the model by determining the power of detecting a QTL within a given chromosomal region and precision for fine mapping of a QTL that has been detected to the given region  using high-density SNP genotypes by Bayesian analysis. To simplify the analysis we only consider data from unrelated individuals in a purebred population. Analysis of data from related individuals will be discussed in a subsequent paper. Results from the gene frequency models will be compared with those from QTL mapping by least squares regression analysis []. A method based on computing identical by descent (IBD) probabilities for the unobservable QTL given observable marker has also been used for LD mapping in livestock []. Previous studies  however  have shown that this IBD method and regression give comparable results (see Discussion) []. In the following we assume the QTL has been localized to a 1 cM segment of the genome  and it will be fine mapped within this region using biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A single QTL with two alleles   and   is assumed to be present on this segment of the genome  and this QTL will be referred to as the marked QTL (MQTL). All other QTL are assumed to be unlinked to the markers and are referred to as residual QTL (RQTL). All QTL are assumed to be additive. Suppose genotypes at the MQTL were observed. Then  trait phenotypic values of individuals in a purebred population can be modeled as where  is the vector of trait phenotypic values   is a vector of non-genetic fixed effects   is the QTL substitution effect   is the vector of the sum of additive effects of all RQTL   is a vector of residuals  and    and  are known incidence matrices. Given data from  animals  the incidence matrix  will have  rows and a single column  with row  of  containing the number of alleles carried by animal . Now  for the situation considered here  the genotypes at the MQTL are not observed  and genotypes are available only at linked markers. Thus   is an unobservable random matrix. The usual mixed model methodology cannot accommodate models with unobservable incidence matrices. Thus we define where  denotes the observed genotypic information on markers  and E(|) is the conditional expectation of  given . Using the double-expectation theorem  so  in 2 is a random vector with null mean. Now   in 1 can be written as The level of LD between the marker and the QTL  which is usually quantified by the squared correlation () between them  determines the ability to predict the allele at the QTL from the allele at the marker locus. Consider the following situations with different levels of LD. When the marker locus and the QTL are in LE ( = 0)  they are independent  thus the conditional mean E(|) = () doesn't depend on marker information . When the marker locus and the QTL are in LD ( > 0)  they are dependent  thus the conditional mean E(|) depends on marker information . When the marker locus and the QTL are in complete LD ( = 1)  they are perfectly correlated  thus the allele at the QTL can be predicted exactly from allele at the marker locus. These situations show that E(|) depends on the LD between the markers and QTL. Thus by modeling the conditional mean of  given marker information  E(|)  captures the LD information for mapping the QTL. Although  has null mean  its covariance matrix depends on the marker information because of the cosegregation of the QTL and linked markers []. Thus modeling the covariance matrix of  given marker information  Cov(|)  captures the cosegregation information for mapping QTL. In the following  we will denote the conditional expectation E(|) by . Now the model for the trait phenotypic values can be written as Provided we can compute   all the incidence matrices in this model are known  and the mixed model equations for this model can be setup provided we can compute the inverse of the covariance matrix for each of the random vectors  and . The covariance matrix for  is proportional to the additive relationship matrix . The inverse of the additive relationship matrix is sparse  and thus it can be computed efficiently []. On the other hand  the inverse of the covariance matrix for  is not sparse  and thus its computation is not efficient. However   can be written as   where  and  are the additive effects of the maternal and paternal MQTL alleles of individual   and  is a known incidence matrix relating  to . It can be shown that the covariance matrix    for  can be calculated using a simple recursive formula that also leads to an efficient algorithm to invert []. The model for trait phenotypic values now becomes When the marker locus is in equilibrium with the MQTL  the QTL and marker are independent. And as we will see in detail in the following section  each row of  will be a constant that is equal to twice the frequency of the QTL. Thus   can be dropped from the model. In this situation  only cosegregation information will contribute to the analysis through the modeling of covariances among MQTL effects. When disequilibrium is complete and all marker genotypes are observed  E(|) = . Thus  in this situation   is null  and after utilizing the disequilibrium information  cosegregation information does not contribute to the analysis. When disequilibrium is partial  E(|) <U+2260>   and  is not null. In this situation  disequilibrium information will contribute to the analysis through the model for the mean of MQTL effects  and cosegregation information will contribute to the analysis through the model for covariances between MQTL effects. These points are further clarified in the following sections  in which we will show how to compute  and the covariance matrix for . Recall that the mean of MQTL effects is   where row  of  has the number of  alleles carried by animal . Thus  the element of  is the sum of two Bernoulli variables  ((  ) = |)  which is a variable indicating whether the maternal allele of  is a   and ((  ) = |)  which is a variable indicating whether the paternal allele of  is a . Now  has expected value: where and (  ) is the maternal MQTL allele state and (  ) the paternal MQTL allele state of individual . These probabilities depend on the location l of the QTL relative to the markers. Let (  ) = denote the event that the maternal MQTL allele of individual  originated in a founder with marker haplotype . Then  for a founder    can be written as where is the conditional probability that a founder with marker haplotype has MQTL allele . Similarly   can be written as The in 14 and 15 are the disequilibrium parameters. Thus  under equilibrium  when marker and QTL allele states are independent  the conditional probability of a  allele on a founder haplotype does not depend on the marker alleles on that haplotype  i.e.  Because for all i  Similarly  Thus  from 7  12 and 13  each row of  is a constant that is equal to twice the frequency of the QTL. However  under disequilibrium  when marker allele states and QTL allele states are not independent  the are not all equal and it follows that  and  depend on the marker haplotypes and thus would be different for animals with different marker haplotypes. Thus vector  is not a vector of constants. This demonstrates that disequilibrium information contributes to modeling the mean of MQTL effects. Cosegregation information contributes to modeling the covariances of MQTL effects. The gametic value  is the product of a Bernoulli variable with probability parameter  and   thus the variance of  is and similarly  the variance of  is As it is shown by 12 and 13 that under equilibrium   thus the variance of MQTL gametic values does not depend on the marker genotypes. However  under disequilibrium   and  thus the variance of MQTL gametic values depend on the marker genotypes. These variances contribute to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the vector of gametic values. In this paper  we mainly focus on unrelated individuals  whose gametic values are uncorrelated  thus the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are zero. Bayesian methods will be used to make inferences on QTL effects and position under the statistical model described in the previous section. Given the high marker density being used in this paper  the QTL position is restricted to the midpoint between adjacent markers. In the Bayesian approach  prior knowledge about parameter values in a statistical model are quantified in terms of prior probabilities. Then  inferences about parameter values are based on posterior probabilities  which are obtained using Bayes theorem as where (|) is the conditional density of the data vector  given the vector of parameter values   and f() is the prior probability density of . In this paper we only consider a case with unrelated individuals  which allows RQTL effects to be merged with the residual effects of model (1). Cases with pedigree data will be covered in a subsequent paper. When individuals are unrelated  the gametic deviations of those individuals are also uncorrelated  thus cosegregation information can also be combined with the residual  This  however  results in the residual variances to be heterogeneous  Residual covariance matrix * is diagonal with element  equal to  when individuals are unrelated. Now  the model simplifies to The parameters in model 19 are:        and  because all other variables  such as  and   are functions of these parameters  as specified through equations  and . The size of the vector of conditional QTL probabilities of marker haplotypes   is 2when using haplotypes of  markers. In this study we only consider models where k is 1 or 2. When k is 1  the estimated QTL location was limited to the marker positions  and  is a vector of size 2 with elements corresponding to haplotypes 0 and 1 of the marker at the putative QTL location. When k is 2  the estimated QTL location was limited to the mid-points of adjacent markers  and  is a vector of size 4  with elements corresponding to haplotypes 00  01  10 and 11 of the two SNPs flanking the putative QTL location  with alleles denoted by 0 and 1. The prior densities that were used for these parameters are described next. Following common practice  the priors given below were used for  and   which are parameters in the usual mixed linear model []. A flat prior was used for the fixed effects : The prior for  was taken to be scaled inverted chi-square distribution with degree of freedom and scale parameter   The prior for  was taken to be logit-normal because this distribution can account for any correlations between elements of   which can range from 0 to 1. Thus the logit transformation of   was taken to be multivariate normal with null mean and covariance matrix . So the prior for  was written as where  is the Jacobian of the transformation. The covariance matrix accommodates covariances between elements of   which arises from the LD generating mechanism. In the following we  however  only consider the case where 's are uncorrelated  which means is diagonal. The prior for the effect of the biallelic QTL    was set to be normal with null mean and variance   The prior for location of the QTL    was taken to be a discrete uniform distribution. If there are L segments on the chromosome  the prior density for  was set to be It was further assumed that trait phenotypic values had a multivariate normal distribution given all location and dispersion parameters: Then the joint posterior density of parameters is Drawing inference directly from this posterior is impractical  so a Markov-chain was constructed for which 27 is the stationary distribution. Under certain conditions  samples drawn from such a chain can be used to make inferences on the parameters in 27 []. The most important conditions here are the existence of a unique stationary distribution and irreducibility of the chain []. As described below  a blocked Gibbs sampling strategy was used to construct a Markov Chain with stationary distribution 27. The sampler consisted of three blocks: fixed effect  was in the first block     and  were in the second  and  was in the third. Parameters in each block were sampled from their full condition distributions  which are the conditional distributions of these parameters given parameters in other blocks and the phenotypic and marker data. The conditional posterior distribution of fixed effect parameter  is where  is the solution to the mixed model equations  and  is the left hand side of mixed model equations. For each of the remaining parameter blocks  the full conditional posterior distribution does not have a standard form. Thus  Metropolis-Hasting algorithm was used. This requires a proposal distribution to draw the candidate samples from. The joint conditional posterior distribution of    and  is Rather than drawing samples from a proposal for   we draw samples from a proposal distribution of  and the sampled  is transformed to . The proposal for  was taken to be a multivariate normal distribution with mean equal to the value from the previous sample and variance . Thus the proposal for  is Then  the proposal for  is where n is the size of vectors  and . The covariance matrix was set to   with  sufficiently small such that  will be sampled in the neighborhood of the previous sample. The proposal distribution of  was taken to be normal with mean equal to the value from previous sample and variance  sufficiently small to ensure sampling in the neighborhood of the previous sample  The proposal for  was taken to be where L is the number of chromosome segments flanked by adjacent markers. In the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm the candidate samples are accepted with probability []: where The full conditional posterior of  is Since * is not equal to   the full conditional posterior of   does not have the form of the usual inverse chi-square distribution. Thus Metropolis-Hasting was used with a normal proposal to obtain candidate samples. The mean of this proposal distribution of  was set to the previously accepted value of   and variance  was set to a sufficiently small value to ensure sampling in the neighborhood of the previous sample. The candidate samples were also accepted with probability: where Least squares regression to map a QTL using high-density SNP genotypes  as described by Grapes et al. []  was used for comparison. The regression method on haplotypes is where is the copy number of haploype j for individual i  and is the effect of haplotype j on phenotype. In this study we only consider models with 1 or 2 SNPs. For the 1-SNP regression method  there are two possible haplotypes 0 and 1  and the hypothesis :  =  vs  :  <U+2260>  was tested. For the 2-SNP regression method  there are four possible haplotypes 00  01  10 and 11  and the hypothesis :  =  =  =  vs :  <U+2260>  or  <U+2260>  or  <U+2260>  was tested. This analysis was repeated for each SNP or SNP bracket. The estimated QTL location was at the SNP yielding the smallest p-value for the 1-SNP model  and at the midpoint of the SNP bracket yielding the smallest p-value for the 2-SNP model. When several locations had p-values numerically equal to zero  the middle location among those with zero p-values was chosen to be the QTL location. Computer simulation was used to compare the power to detect and the precision to map QTL by Bayesian analysis using the gene frequency model (BGF) with least squares using the regression method (LSR). We simulated 2000 biallelic loci spaced either 0.01  0.005 or 0.002 cM apart. Among these  every tenth locus was a QTL  and the remaining loci were markers. In the first generation  alleles were sampled independently from a Bernoulli distribution with probability 0.5. This generates a genome in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. LD was generated in this chromosomal segment by random mating with a mutation rate of 2.5 * 10 and an effective population size of 500 for 1000 generations  followed by 50 generations of random mating with the population size reduced to 100. It has been estimated that the effective population size of livestock has decreased due to breed formation and artificial breeding []. The effective population sizes used in this simulation attempt to mimic this phenomenon. The initial allele frequencies of 0.5 and mutation rate of 2.5 * 10 allow the population to approach mutation-drift equilibrium after the 1050 generations of random mating []. In the following  each set of 10 consecutive loci is referred to as a locus bin. Thus  there were 200 bins on the chromosomal segment that was simulated. In the final generation  out of each bin  the marker that had allele frequencies closest to 0.5 was selected. This generated markers spaced either 0.1  0.05 or 0.02 cM apart. For the two-marker BGF and LSR analyses  marker haplotypes are assumed to be known. Out of the 200 QTLs  the QTL that had allele frequencies closest to 0.5 was identified. Markers for the analysis were chosen out of the selected markers from a chromosomal segment of 1 cM consisting of k consecutive locus bins. Thus  k was 10  20  or 50 when marker spacing was 0.1  0.05  or 0.02 cM. It is known that some methods of fine mapping are favored when the QTL is simulated at the center of the chromomsal segment []. Thus the identified QTL was simulated at a distance of 0.3 cM from the first marker locus in the segment. In addition to SNP density  the impact of sample size (500 or 1000) and of variance explained by the QTL (2% or 5% of the phenotypic variance) on power and precision were studied. Mean absolute error of estimates of QTL location was used as the statistic to quantify precision of QTL mapping. Power to detect the QTL was quantified as follows. For the regression method  the critical value for detecting a QTL was estimated by simulating data sets with no QTL and computing the upper 10% quantile F-value from 1500 replications of F-tests. Power was estimated by simulating data sets  each with one QTL  and calculating the percentage of F-values that were larger than the estimated critical value. For the gene frequency model  the estimate of QTL variance was used as the statistic to calculate power. The critical value for this test was estimated by simulating data sets with no QTL and computing the upper 10% quantile for the QTL variance from 1500 replications. Power was estimated by simulating data sets  each with one QTL  and calculating the percentage of estimates of QTL variance that are bigger than the estimated critical value. In this study the simulated true haplotypes were used for 2-SNP BGF and LSR. For both 1 and 2-SNP BGF analyses  power to detect the QTL increased with sample size  QTL variance  and marker density (table ). The 2-SNP BGF model seemed to have slightly higher power than the 1-SNP model. For both 1 and 2-SNP LSR analyses  power increased with sample size and QTL variance (table ). Power also increased when marker spacing decreased from 0.1 to 0.05 cM but  in most cases  power decreased when marker spacing was further reduced to 0.02 cM. As described earlier  when markers were spaced 0.1  0.05  or 0.02 cM apart  the number of markers or marker pairs in the chromosomal segment was 10  20 or 50. The decrease of power when marker spacing dropped from 0.05 to 0.02 cM may be due to the increase in number of tests that were done to detect a significant QTL within the chromosomal segment. In all scenarios studied 1-SNP LSR had slightly greater power than 2-SNP LSR. In most scenarios studied  both 1 and 2-SNP BGF had power close to those of LSR. The standard error of the mean absolute error of estimates of QTL location was about 0.003 for the 1 and 2-SNP BGF analyses. For almost all scenarios the 2-SNP BGF had almost the same precision as the 1-SNP BGF. For both analyses precision of estimates of QTL location increased with sample size and QTL variance (table ). However  similar to the LSR  precision decreased when marker spacing decreased from 0.1 to 0.05 and 0.02 cM  except when sample size was 500 or the QTL explained 5% of phenotypic variance. The standard error of the mean absolute error for estimated QTL location of the 1 and 2-SNP LSR method was about 0.004 cM. For almost all scenarios the 2-SNP LSR had higher or same precision as 1-SNP LSR. In all scenarios  the 1 and 2-SNP BGF were consistently better in precision than the LSR  except for just one scenario when QTL explained 5% of phenotypic variance  marker spacing was 0.05 cM and sample size was 500  1-SNP BGF and LSR had about the same precision. For both analyses  precision of mapping QTL increased with sample size and QTL variance (table ). In most cases precision increased when marker spacing was reduced from 0.1 to 0.05 cM but remained unchanged when marker spacing was further reduced to 0.02 cM  except when sample size was 500 and the QTL explained 5% of phenotypic variance. The fact that precision doesn't increase with the decrease of marker spacing for both BGF and LSR analysis shows that without enough information  higher marker density does not necessarily result in higher precision for mapping. If sample size or QTL variance was sufficiently high  precision increased with the increase of marker spacing. The reason for this is that  when there is not sufficient information  the likelihood will not peak at the location of the QTL  but may have a plateau centered at the QTL location  as shown in Figure . With the higher marker spacing  four markers are on the plateau of the likelihood  of which two are inside bracket B. Thus the QTL has probability 0.5 to be mapped inside bracket B. With lower marker spacing  ten markers are on the plateau  of which six are outside and four are inside bracket B. Thus the QTL has a higher probability to be mapped outside than inside bracket B  which results in lower precision. However  when there is sufficient information due to a larger number of observations or higher QTL variance  the likelihood will be more peaked. Thus there is less probability that the QTL will be mapped outside of bracket B  resulting in a higher precision with a decrease in marker spacing. In all scenarios studied  both 1 and 2-SNP BGF had precision higher than LSR. . When there is not sufficient information  the likelihood will not peak at the location of the QTL  but may have a plateau centered at the QTL location. With the higher marker spacing  four markers are on the plateau of the likelihood  of which two are inside bracket B. Thus the QTL has probability 0.5 to be mapped inside bracket B. With lower marker spacing  ten markers are on the plateau  of which six are outside and four are inside bracket B. Thus the QTL has a higher probability to be mapped outside than inside bracket B  which results in lower precision. However  when there is sufficient information due to a larger number of observations or higher QTL variance  the likelihood will be more peaked. Thus there is less probability that the QTL will be mapped outside of bracket B  resulting in a higher precision with a decrease in marker spacing. In this study  we have presented a gene frequency model that combines LD and cosegregation information for use in fine mapping of QTL. In this method LD information is captured by modeling the conditional mean of the QTL given marker information  and cosegregation information is captured by modeling the covariance matrix of the QTL given marker information. This model can accomodate situations when there is no LD and only cosegregation information as well as only LD and no cosegregation information. It should be noted that using 13 leads to an approximation of the covariance matrix and its inverse when marker data are not complete. Complete marker data in this situation are the ordered genotypes at the marker locus. Wang et al. [] gave a recursive formula that gives exact results with unordered genotypes at a single locus. The advantage of using 13 to compute   however  is that this leads to an efficient algorithm to invert this covariance matrix []  and without such an algorithm  genetic evaluation with large pedigrees may not be possible. Recently  however  Thallman et al. [] developed a recursive formula that gives exact results with missing genotypes for a pedigree with loops. Implementation of this algorithm is  however  beyond the scope of this paper. Least squares regression  which is easy to implement and computationally efficient  was used to compare to the gene frequency model in power and precision of QTL mapping. Besides the regression method  an identity by descent (IBD) method has been proposed for QTL mapping by Meuwissen and Goddard []. This method is based on computing IBD probabilities between QTL alleles on haplotypes of relatives given the similarity between marker alleles on these haplotypes. An algorithm was developed to approximate the probability that the alleles at the QTL are IBD given the number of marker alleles that are consecutively identical in state to the left and right of the QTL []. Grapes et al. [] studied the precision of QTL mapping using the IBD and regression methods. When markers were spaced 1  0.5  or 0.25 cM apart  the IBD method with 10 markers had higher precision in mapping than regression with 10 markers. In a subsequent study  Grapes et al. [] showed that the IBD method with 4-6 markers led to higher precision than with 10 markers. In both these studies  markers were used in the analysis even if they were fixed after 100 generations of random mating. Using only markers that are segregating after 100 generations of random mating  Zhao et al. [] studied power and precision of the regression and IBD methods under scenarios with different marker spacing and percentage of phenotypic variance explained by QTL. Using four or six markers gave best result for the IBD method for both power to detect and precision to map a QTL  but regression with 1 SNP had even higher precision  except in one scenario where the IBD method was better. The IBD method had higher power than regression  except for two scenarios with higher marker density  where regression had the same or higher power than the IBD method. Because results from regression were close to or better than those from the IBD method  regression was used in this study to compare with the gene frequency model in power and precision of QTL mapping. Calus et al. [] compared the accuracy of predicting breeding values in genomic selection for regression with 1 marker haplotypes  2 markers haplotypes  IBD with 2 markers haplotypes and IBD with 10 markers haplotypes. The marker density simulated in their study was 2343  1166.4  463.9 232.1 or 119 polymorphic markers across 3 M genome  and heritability of the trait was 10 or 50%. Thus marker densities in their study were much lower than in this paper. At lower marker densities  IBD with 10 markers always had the highest accuracy of estimated breeding values  and regression with one marker had the lowest accuracy. As marker density increased  the difference in accuracies decreased. However  at the highest marker density  when heritability was 10%  regression with 1 marker had the highest accuracy. Thus  since in this paper  marker densitites were much higher  it is expected that the difference between the performance of regression and IBD method would be negligible. The least squares regression method with one SNP had slightly higher power than with two SNPs for most of the scenarios studied. These results on LSR are consistent with those from Zhao et al. []  who found that LSR with one SNP gave similar or higher power than with two SNPs  especially with high marker density. Unlike LSR  the gene frequency model with two SNPs had similar or slightly higher power than the BGF with one SNP. Both 1- and 2-SNP BGF Models had power close to the 1- or 2-SNP regression methods. LSR with two SNPs had similar or slightly higher precision of mapping QTL than with one SNP. Grapes et al. [] found that regression with one SNP had better precision than two SNPs  except for one scenario where they had the same precision. In their study  10 or 20 evenly spaced biallelic markers were simulated within a 2.25-9 cM region in the base population  and all markers were used for mapping after 100 generations of random mating. This would result in some markers that are fixed  which wouldn't contribute to the analysis. However  in practice  uninformative SNPs will not be used in the analysis. In the present study and in that by Zhao et al. []  only markers that were segregating were chosen for analysis. Zhao et al. [] found that LSR with one SNP had higher precision than LSR with two SNPs. This result is not in agreement with our results  and may be due to the higher marker densities in our study  with 11  21  51 markers in a 1 cM region compared to 6  10  20 markers in an 11 cM region in the study by Zhao et al []. With the higher marker density  LD would be stronger  thus regression on one or two SNPs would not be much different  compared to lower marker density. BGF with two SNPs gave similar or higher precision than with one SNP. Both 1- or 2-SNP BGF models had higher precision than the 1- or 2-SNP LSR models. When marker density is high  sample size and QTL variance are large  BGF and LSR models converge in both power and precision. In the study by Calus et al. []  difference in the accuracy of estimated breeding values between IBD and regression method was lowest at the highest marker density. The essential difference between the BGF and regression model is the heterogeneous variance of the BGF residuals  which can be seen from (18). However  when  is 0 or 1  as can be seen from (14) and (15)  and  will also be 0 or 1 when haplotypes are known  which is always true for one-marker haplotypes and was also assumed for two-marker haplotypes in this paper. In this case  there is no heterogeneity of BGF residuals and the two methods will have the same performance. When all elements in  are 0 or 1  it implies complete LD between marker and the QTL. However  analyses of high-density SNP data in livestock have shown that LD between adjacent marker loci is not complete [–]. One of the advantages of the gene frequency model is that it can be used to combine linkage disequilibrium and cosegregation information for QTL mapping. However  here its performance was studied only for the simple case with unrelated founder individuals  where only LD contributes to the analysis. Thus in this case  the primary difference between the two models is that in the gene frequency model residual variances are heterogeneous (see equation )  whereas in the regression model residual variances are assumed homogeneous. Another difference between these two models is the assumption of biallelic QTL in the gene frequency model. This assumption is often made in Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian QTL mapping methods for mixture models because it is a good approximation  although the number of QTL alleles is unknown and difficult to infer in outbred populations []. Biallelic QTL methods have been shown to successfully detect linkage for multiallelic QTLs [–]. A comparison between the performance of mutiallelic and biallelic analyses under multiallelic modes of inheritance using the package Loki and the multiallelic version of Loki (maLoki) was done by Rosenthal et al. [] using both simulated and real data. For simulated data a four-generation pedigree with 98 individuals was simulated to detect the linkage of a six-allele trait gene. Although the multiallelic analysis had better mixing and convergence than the biallelic analysis  the biallelic analysis was better at detecting linkage  and it had a lower bias in estimating the QTL position and the number of QTL. For real data 8 pedigrees with 216 individuals were used to detect linkage of APOC3 gene with QTL for high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Both biallelic and multiallelelic analysis had good mixing. Both the biallelic and multiallelic analyses fitted one or more QTL with probability almost one  while the probability of fitting two or more QTL was .27 for multiallelic analysis and .61 for biallelic analysis. However  the parameter estimates for the larger QTL were very similar. And their estimates are close or the same in posterior mean  standard deviation and range of total number of QTLs  and in posterior mean of QTL. Due to the good performance of biallelic analysis and increased computational cost of multiallelic analysis  biallelic analysis can be a good approximation that computationally easier and more feasible. The BGF model  however  can be extended to accommodate QTL with any specified or even unspecified number of alleles. If the number of alleles is not specified  it can be made to be an unknown parameter in the model with some prior distribution. But this will lead to more parameters that need to be estimated  thus will affect the power and precision of the analysis. The 2-SNP BGF performed slightly better with regard to power and precision of QTL mapping than the 1-SNP BGF. It should be noted that the BGF method requires knowing the haplotypes for founder individuals. Haplotypes at a single locus can be determined from the genotype of the individual at this locus  the haplotypes for 2 or more loci cannot be inferred from the genotypes of the individual at these loci. Thus for 2-SNP BGF in practice haplotypes probabilities have to be calculated using genotypes of the individual  its ancestors and descendents. In this study the simulated true haplotypes were used for 2-SNP BGF. Thus  in practice  when haplotype probabilities are used  the slight advantage of 2-SNP BGF may not persist.

The multibreed maternal animal model introduced in this study simplifies the problem of estimating (co)variance components in the framework of a hierarchical Bayes analysis. Using this approach  we obtained for the first time estimates of the full set of genetic (co)variance components. It would be interesting to assess the performance of the procedure with field data  especially when interbreed information is limited. Mixed linear models used to fit phenotypic records taken on animals with diverse breed composition are termed multibreed animal models. Theoretical [  ] and empirical [  ] arguments indicate that the proper specification for the genetic covariance structure in these models should be heterogeneous. However  even though the theory has long been developed [    ] and classical [  ] and Bayesian [] inference procedures have been presented  very recent papers on (co)variance component estimation in crossbred populations (e.g.  [  ]) do not account for this particular dispersion structure  possibly due to the lack of appropriate general purpose software []. Estimation of (co)variance components in multibreed populations is not an easy task [    ]. Basically  the difficulty arises because the scalar (co)variance components can not be factored out from the inverse of the additive genetic covariance matrix. As a consequence  within the framework of a hierarchical Bayes analysis the full conditional posterior distribution of each (co)variance component is not recognizable  and thus algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings must be used []. The approach based on the decomposition of the genetic covariance matrix by source of variability [] supplies a much simpler formulation for (co)variance component estimation  which is easy to assimilate with the collection of estimation techniques available in general purpose software. García-Cortés and Toro [] have empirically illustrated the validity of their proposal through a numerical example  but they have not presented a formal derivation of the equivalence between their model and the one formalized by Cantet and Fernando [] using the quantitative genetic arguments of Lo et al. []  at least when the goal is to predict breeding values. In this study we address the issue. Basically  we will present a formal derivation of the equivalence through a somewhat different formulation from the one of García-Cortés and Toro []. Further  we will expand the model to include maternal effects  and formalize a hierarchical Bayes analysis to estimate the parameters of interest. Finally  the multibreed analysis discussed above is used in the analysis of weaning weight records from an Angus × Hereford crossbred experiment. For the sake of simplicity  assume a two-breed ( and ) composite population with individuals pertaining either to one of the two parental breeds  or to one of several breed groups produced by crossbreeding. The trait of interest is under the influence of a large number of unlinked loci  and the two parental breeds that give rise to the population are in gametic phase equilibrium. Thus  assuming additive inheritance  the genotypic value of individual  in any breed group can be modeled as where µ is the mean genotypic value in the reference breed group  and    represent  respectively  the additive effects of the paternal and maternal alleles that individual  inherited at locus  ( = 1  ...  ). In this context  Lo et al. [] have derived the expression for the variance of the genotypic value as a linear function of the additive variance in each parental population  and an additional source of variability arising due to differences in allelic frequencies between these populations: the segregation variance [  ]. In the two-breed case  it is equal to where  and  respectively are the expected proportion of breed  and breed  genes in individual    and  are the additive variances of each breed  and  is the segregation variance. The last term in (2) stands for the covariance between genotypic values for the parents of the individual  and can be developed further by expanding to the previous generation. Under this formulation  Lo et al. [] have shown how to compute efficiently both the genetic covariance matrix using the tabular method []  and its inverse using the algorithms of Henderson [] and Quaas []. Later  Cantet and Fernando [] have demonstrated how to use the theory to predict breeding values by BLUP within the framework of a genetic evaluation. Alternatively  García-Cortés and Toro [] have decomposed the genetic covariance matrix into several independent sources of variability. In the two-breed situation it is verifiable that where    = {    }  are partial numerator relationship matrices in accordance with the source of variability []. These matrices have order  ×  (where  is the number of individuals) to ensure conformability for addition. However  if an individual does not contribute to the source of variability (for example  purebred  individuals does not contribute to  and  sources of variation) the corresponding row and column are null vectors  and thus the matrix is singular. This formulation of the genetic covariance matrix is consistent with a conventional animal model with several random effects  i.e.  the breeding values by breed origin      = {    }. It should be clear that under this alternative model the breeding values of non-contributing individuals to a particular source of variability are defined to be fixed and equal to zero  and are termed null by breed origin. The alternative formulation presented by García-Cortés and Toro [] alleviate difficulties inherent to (co)variance components estimation within multibreed animal models  specially through estimation techniques based in known full conditional distributions (i.e.  Gibbs Sampler)  within the framework of a hierarchical Bayes analysis. Furthermore  the referred model is equivalent to the model presented by Cantet and Fernando [] in terms of the covariance structure  because both formulations are identical (see the definition given by Henderson []). Yet  the equivalence in terms of breeding value prediction is not straightforward  because the coefficient matrix derived form the mixed model equations is singular  and equations corresponding to non-contributing individuals have to be discarded in order to solve the system and to obtain equivalent results []. Our proposal is to redefine the  vectors such that they only include the  breeding values non-null by breed origin. This entails defining appropriate incidence matrices  for each source and rewriting the model equation as where  of order  × are related to the non-null breeding values by breed origin    = {    }. Note that this formulation does not include breeding values constrained to zero  so that   where the non-singular matrix  contains the non-null rows and columns of . Define then the matrix  of order  ×   such that where  is the incidence matrix for the random effects in [] and []. It is then verifiable that the product  retrieves the null-row pattern with respect to matrix . In turn  a subsequent post-multiplication by   retrieves the null-column pattern  so that Using (6) and (5) in (4) This result shows that model (4) is equivalent to the model presented by Cantet and Fernando [] in accordance to the definition given by Henderson []. Moreover  note that the BLUP of each non-null breeding value by breed of origin can be written according to [] Now  both expressions (6) and (8) can be used to show that the addition of the   weighted by the corresponding  matrices to ensure conformability  equals where  = (  ) from the multibreed animal model presented by Cantet and Fernando []. Finally  note that even though we have assumed a two-breed composite population in our presentation  the argument readily generalizes to a multibreed population composed of  breeds. Consider now a maternally influenced trait  and assume therefore the covariance structure described by Willham []. Additionally  consider the theory of Lo et al. [] extended to correlated traits as presented by Cantet and Fernando []. We will use subscripts \"\" and \"\" to differentiate between direct and maternal effects  respectively. Then  using the approach presented in the previous section  we define the model where  ( × 1) is a data vector  and  ( × ) represents  without loss of generality  the full-rank incidence matrix of the fixed effects vector  ( × 1). Furthermore   and  are random vectors with entries corresponding to the direct and maternal non-null breeding values by breed origin    = {    }. Note  respectively  and  ( × 1) is a random vector accounting for maternal permanent environmental effects. Accordingly     and  are the corresponding incidence matrices. Finally   ( × 1) represents the white-noise error vector. To simplify the notation  let  = [ | ] and . Next  consider a hierarchical Bayes construction for model (10) as presented by Cardoso and Tempelman [] following Sorensen and Gianola []. The objective is to make inferences about parameters of interest  typically the (co)variance components. At the first stage of the analysis  it is necessary to specify the full conditional sampling density of the data vector. Assume therein a multivariate normal process Then  the prior distributions for vectors      = {    }  and  are specified. Firstly  a multivariate normal process will be assumed for the vector of fixed effects . This assumption avoids the occurrence of improper posterior distributions  while reflecting a prior state of uncertainty for the fixed effects []. According to Cantet et al. []  we set where  = {}  with  = 1 × 10 for  = 1  ...  . Secondly  multivariate normal distributions will also be specified for the non-null breeding values by breed origin   according to quantitative genetic theory In (13)   and  represents the partial numerator relationship matrices defined by García-Cortés and Toro []  but without null rows and columns. Finally  a multivariate normal process will be assumed for the vector of maternal permanent environmental effects. Thus In the next level of the hierarchy  a priori distributions are to be assigned to the dispersion parameters  i.e.  the scalars  and   and the matrices    = {    }. At this point  conjugate scaled inverted-gamma densities are assumed: Inverted Chi-squared for the scalars and Inverted Wishart for the matrices. Then In (15)   are (2 × 2) matrices containing the a priori values for the genetic (co)variance components for each source of variability. Moreover   and  represent prior values for the maternal permanent environmental variance and the white-noise error variance  respectively. All these values should be interpreted as statements about the expectation of the prior distributions  and are defined by the analyst. In turn  <U+03C5>   and  represent the parameters for the degrees of freedom of the corresponding distributions  and are interpreted as a degree of belief in those a priori values []. They are also defined by the analyst. Now  assuming that    |     = {    }  |   and  are all a priori independent  the joint posterior distribution will be proportional to the product of the likelihood function times each of the prior densities  as follows Explicitly  and after grouping together common factors []  we obtain where  and . Starting with expression (17)  it is possible to identify the kernel of the full conditional posterior density of any parameter of interest by keeping the remaining ones fixed. In fact  it is verifiable that all full conditional posterior densities are analytically recognizable and thus can be sampled using standard procedures as those described by Wang et al. [] or Jensen et al. []. Detailed expressions for the full conditional posterior densities are derived and displayed in the appendix. In this section we describe the implementation of the hierarchical Bayes analysis to a data set from an Angus × Hereford crossbred experiment. Data belongs to the AgResearch Crown Research Institute  New Zealand  and consists of 3749 weaning weight records and the corresponding genealogy (Table ). Records were collected between 1973 and 1990 on both purebred and crossbred individuals  including progeny from inter-se matings  backcrosses  and rotational crosses (Table ). A detailed description of the mating design and other relevant features from the experiment can be found in Morris et al. []. Our goal was to estimate (co)variance components inherent to this experimental population  thus we fitted the model presented in the previous section. The model included the non-null direct and maternal breeding values by breed origin  and fixed effects for sex  age of dam  and day of birth (fitted as a covariate)  following the description given by Morris et al. []. To account for differences in the mean phenotypes between the breed groups  fixed effects of direct and maternal breed and heterosis were also included using the parameterization given by Hill [  ]. (Co)variance components were estimated through a single-site  systematic scan Gibbs sampling algorithm  like the one suggested by García-Cortés and Toro []. The computation strategy in the current research was also based on setting-up the mixed model equations for an animal model with several random effects. However  instead of discarding equations corresponding to non-contributing individuals  these were never set up: the system was simply collapsed by changing the appropriate coordinates  i.e.  by removing null rows and null columns. Note that this strategy has the advantage of reducing the number of necessary contributions  but it requires that all the animals with null contributions to any source of variability be identified. Specifically  a FORTRAN 90 program was written  inspired on the class notes from Misztal []. The code is based on programs from the BLUPF90 package [] and specific F77 routines from our research group [R.J.C. Cantet and A.N. Birchmeier  personal communication]. The program has a modular structure with two main internal subroutines. The first one generates the contributions to the random effects and computes the entries in the partial numerator relationship matrices according to a slightly modified version of the inbreeding algorithm of Meuwissen and Luo []. The second subroutine is used for sampling successively the vector of unknowns without setting-up the mixed model equations  thus accelerating considerably the performance by iteration. The code is available under request from the first author. The implementation of the Gibbs sampling was undertaken in two stages. In the first stage  an exploratory analysis was done by seeking some reasonable values for the scale parameters of the prior distributions of the (co)variance components. First  a maternal animal model was fitted [  ]  and (co)variance components were estimated using the ASReml [] package. Scale parameters for maternal permanent environmental and error variances densities were then set according to the REML estimates. Second  estimates of the genetic (co)variance components were arbitrarily distributed among the three sources of variability. Once prior values were chosen  the program was executed and several chains in between one and two million iterations were calculated  depending on the sign of the direct-maternal genetic covariances  the degrees of belief assigned to the parameters  and the number of samples discarded as burn-in. Posterior summaries and convergence diagnostics were reasonably consistent among all chains so that results are not shown. Finally  mean posterior mode values  taken among all the chains  were used to set the scale parameters of the prior distributions of the (co)variance components in the definitive analysis. Based on these preliminary analyses  a large chain of 3 500 000 iterations was obtained in the second stage  following the suggestion of Geyer []. The first 100 000 samples were discarded as burn-in  and the remaining 3 400 000 were used to study convergence through all single-chain diagnostics supplied by the BOA [] package  executed under the R [] environment. Posterior means  modes  medians and standard deviations for all (co)variance components  as well as 95% high posterior density intervals (HPD)  were computed using the program POSTGIBBSF90  from the BLUPF90 [] package. Relevant features regarding the implementation of the multibreed analysis to the Angus × Hereford data set are described below. The final analysis took about five days of execution on a personal computer with a Pentium 4 (CPU 3.6 GHz  3.11 GB of RAM) processor  at a rate of 0.11 second per cycle. The numerical values used to initialize the scale parameters and the degrees of belief for the prior distributions of all (co)variance components are displayed in Table . Overall  auto-correlations among samples of the same parameter were very large for all (co)variance components  especially for those associated with the segregation terms. However  by using an appropriate thinning the auto-correlations decreased to reasonable values without affecting posterior summaries and  as a consequence  convergence was analyzed for the full length chain of 3 400 000 iterations. It is worth emphasizing that the sample sequences of all the (co)variance components succeeded in passing all single-chain convergence tests supplied by the BOA [] package. Table  displays the marginal posterior summaries for the eleven scalar (co)variance components of the fitted model. Additionally  Figure  displays the corresponding density shapes that were estimated using a non-parametric technique based on a Gaussian kernel []. In general  genetic (co)variance components showed marginal posterior densities with high degree of symmetry  except for those components associated with the segregation between breeds. In particular  while the mean values of direct and maternal segregation variances were respectively  = 9.62 kg and  = 13.37 kg  the modes for both direct and maternal segregation variances were about 3 Kg. . Besides  there were differences in the posterior summaries of the genetic (co)variance components according to the source of variability. First  there was a small scale deviation in the means of the direct additive variances between Angus and Hereford breeds:  = 120.74 kg vs.  = 100.24 kg  respectively  both breeds having similar standard deviations. By contrast  the means of the maternal additive variances showed quite a large difference towards Hereford ( = 37.63 kg vs.  = 95.18 kg)  displaying higher dispersion than their direct counterparts. Finally  posterior means for the direct-maternal genetic covariances were negative in both breeds  being the magnitude of the parameter in Angus about half the value obtained for Hereford ( = -27.00 kg vs.  = -56.31 kg). On the contrary  the segregation covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects was positive within the 95% HPD interval. Besides  the posterior mean was  = 9.55 kg and the posterior mode was 3.20 kg. Posterior summaries for direct heritability  maternal heritability  and direct-maternal correlation in the reference F population are presented in Table . Heritabilities were defined as the quotient between the additive variance for each trait  computed as the weighted sum of additive variances by source of variability  and the phenotypic variance for the reference breed group. Direct and maternal heritabilities means were 0.27 and 0.18  respectively  with a small shift with respect to the mode in the latter case. In turn  mean direct-maternal correlation was -0.33. The posterior probabilities that all variance quotients are strictly positive were greater than 0.95 in agreement with the 95% HPD intervals. Finally  relative contributions of each source of variability to the total direct and maternal additive variances in individuals F are displayed in Table . The contribution from the Angus to total direct additive variance was higher than the contribution of Hereford (50.26% vs. 41.73%) while  conversely  Hereford origin accounts for almost twice the maternal additive variance (23.59% vs. 59.65%). In turn  the contribution of the segregation variance to the total additive variance was not significant for the direct component of the trait (< 10%)  though it was more important for the maternal component (˜ 17%). However  when the contribution was calculated using the posterior modes  segregation variance contributed in a non-significant fashion in both cases: 3.32% and 5.71% for the direct and maternal components  respectively. In this study we formalized the equivalence between the multibreed animal model with heterogeneous additive variances introduced by García-Cortés and Toro []  and the one derived from the quantitative genetic theory [  ]. In doing so we used a different formulation not including breeding values for the individuals with null contributions within the additive vectors by breed origin. Next we defined appropriate matrices that retrieved the null-row and null-column patterns from the incidence matrices of breeding values and from the partial numerator relationship matrices. Finally  on using these matrices and by means of appropriate algebraic operations  we showed the equivalence between both models. Even though in our derivation we assumed a two-breed composite population  the generalization to  breeds requires only redefining the appropriate vectors of breeding values by breed origin. Further  we extended the model to include maternal effects [  ] and  in order to estimate (co)variance components  we described a hierarchical Bayes implementation. Generally speaking  the Bayesian approach is more intuitive  more flexible  and its results are more informative when compared to inference methods based on maximizing the likelihood function. The basic idea in the Bayesian approach is to combine the knowledge a priori about the unknown parameters  with the additional information supplied by the data []. In particular  within the framework of a multibreed animal model  an advantage of the approach is the possibility to incorporate prior information about the (co)variance components by source of variability []. In any case  if there is complete uncertainty about these parameters a priori  a possible action is to consider flat unbounded priors []. Alternatively  another option is to use conjugate inverted-gamma distributions as priors  which are parameterized so that they reflect the uncertainty through the degrees of belief chosen by the analyst  as we did in the current application. In both situations  the analytical expression for the full conditional posterior densities is recognizable and  as a consequence  it is possible to implement a Gibbs sampling algorithm as the inference method []. In fact  as pointed out by García-Cortés and Toro []  only a small extra coding effort is required to accommodate a Gibbs sampling algorithm for (co)variance components estimation in the framework of a multibreed animal model with heterogeneous variances. Basically  it is necessary to modify slightly one of the several routines available to compute inbreeding coefficients to appropriately assign contributions to the partial numerator relationship matrices. With this purpose  García-Cortés and Toro [] used the procedure of Quaas []. By contrast  we adapted the subroutine of Meuwissen and Luo [] as it presents two advantages for the problem at hand: 1) it is a faster algorithm  and 2) it performs on a row by row basis [  ]. Modifying the Meuwissen and Luo [] subroutine requires redefining the expression for the within-family variance  and initializing the work variable FI with the appropriate coefficients of breed composition. Among other important issues  implementing a Gibbs sampler involves choosing a sampling strategy  deciding the number of chains to be generated  and defining the initialization values  length of the burn-in period  and number of cycles needed to ensure a representative sample from the marginal distribution of interest []. In this study we used a single-site  systematic scan sampling strategy. For all other issues while implementing the Gibbs sampler  we followed the work of Geyer []. Therefore  the results presented here are based on a very long chain after discarding the first 3.4% (100 000) samples as burn-in. The main concern was the extremely high correlations observed between adjacent samples for all (co)variance components. However  it is worthy of note that even though sub-sampling reduced these auto-correlations to reasonable amounts  thinning is not a mandatory practice []  and certainly is not needed to obtain precise posterior summaries []. Another concern is the computing feasibility of the Gibbs sampler described here for large datasets. In this regard  two major issues that affect run-time should be distinguished: first  the number of arithmetic operations needed to accomplish one cycle of the Gibbs sampler as a function of the number of individuals in the pedigree file  and second  the number of cycles necessary to attain convergence. The most time consuming tasks within each round of the procedure are sampling of the location parameter vector  and computing the quadratic forms while sampling the covariance matrices. These steps involve arithmetic operations on the entries of large matrices: the mixed model coefficient matrix and the partial numerator relationship matrices  respectively. Yet  given the sparse storage of these matrices and the fact that arithmetic operations are performed only on non-zero entries  it can be shown that the time per cycle is  ultimately  linear in the number of individuals. It should also be noticed that the system size grows in a quadratic fashion according to the number of breeds involved []. However  the increase in the number of equations will be somehow alleviated due to the existence of null equations  and this will depend on the breed composition of the animals in the data file. Now  ascertaining convergence is another issue. In our implementation  formal tests were inconclusive for chain lengths below 1 000 000 cycles for some of the (co)variance components. Particularly  the Raftery and Lewis test computed using the BOA package []  indicated that there were strong dependencies in the sequences and as a consequence  there was a very slow mixing of the chain. Thus  in a larger data set  strategies to improve the mixing will probably be needed to reduce run-time. A review on such strategies can be found in Gilks and Roberts []. The multibreed animal model introduced in the current research was fitted to an experimental Angus × Hereford data set  and for the first time estimates of the full set of genetic (co)variance components described by Cantet and Fernando [] in a maternal animal model framework were obtained. As a matter of fact  Elzo and Wakeman [] have reported REML estimates for a multibreed Angus × Brahman herd  but they used a sire-maternal grandsire bivariate model. These authors parameterized the additional variability arising due to differences in allelic frequencies between breeds in terms of the interbreed additive variance []  a parameter equivalent to twice the segregation variance as defined by Lo et al. []. The estimates of the maternal additive interbreed variance and the interbreed additive covariance obtained by Elzo and Wakeman [] were in absolute terms much greater than the estimates reported here for the equivalent segregation parameters. However  they questioned the validity of those estimates since the number of records they had was small and the number of (co)variance components to be estimated was relatively large. Elzo and Wakeman [] also indicated that there was very little information on the interbreed parameters contained in their data. In fact  many of the problems associated with small amounts of data spring from difficulties in quantifying properly the estimation error  especially in models with a hierarchical structure []. By incorporating uncertainty through probability densities  Bayesian methods overcome this problem [  ]. We now discuss other issues of the analysis. First  the results obtained in the current research suggest that the allelic frequencies in the two parental breeds that gave rise to the Angus × Hereford population were similar. This is inferred from the almost trivial contribution of the segregation variance to the total additive variance for both the direct and the maternal component of the trait (see [  ]) when posterior modes are taken as point estimates for the variances. In connection with this  it is worth mentioning that posterior marginal distributions of the segregation (co)variance components were strongly asymmetric  a pattern which has also been reported by Cardoso and Tempelman [] when analyzing post-weaning data from a Nelore × Hereford crossbred population. In addition  posterior mean values used as point estimates for the direct and maternal heritabilities  and the direct-maternal genetic correlation in the reference population were in agreement with the values found in the literature []. It is important to emphasize  however  that under the multibreed animal model presented here  phenotypic variance is specific to each breed composition  so that heritabilities and correlations are meaningful only to each breed group. Moreover  breed compositions and functions thereof are key features of the multibreed analysis: they are used both for computing the inverses of the partial numerator relationship matrices  as well as regressor variables for fitting breed group and heterosis mean effects. In fact  in order to fit properly the model described here  the breed composition of each individual must be known. However  data sets with precise information on the breed composition of animals are lacking. Also  an adequate data structure is needed in order to obtain accurate estimates of the (co)variance components; for example  only the data from the progeny of crossbred parents provide information to estimate segregation variance []. In this respect  the data file used here had exceptional features. First  it contained plenty of interbreed information  with records collected on individuals pertaining to several breed groups  and with many pedigree relationships connecting groups to each other. In addition  it had a suitable data structure to estimate (co)variance components from maternal animal models [  ]: a high percentage of the dams had their own records  and a high proportion of the cows had more than one calf. It would be interesting to assess the performance of the multibreed analysis described here with field data  especially when interbreed information is limited. Theoretical and empirical considerations justify the use of a heterogeneous genetic covariance structure when fitting multibreed animal models. In this regard  the approach based on the decomposition of the genetic covariance matrix by source of variability [] simplifies the problem of estimating the (co)variance components by using a Gibbs sampler. In fact  our results show that the ensuing model is equivalent to the one described in []. Furthermore  the extension to include maternal effects and the implementation of the hierarchical Bayes analysis is straightforward. Additionally  we fitted weaning weight data from an experimental Angus × Hereford population  and we obtained  for the first time  estimates of the full set of genetic (co)variance components  including a positive estimate for the direct-maternal segregation covariance.

Starting from the joint posterior distribution in (17)  it is possible to identify the full conditional posterior density of any parameter of interest by keeping the rest of them fixed. In this section we will present the analytic expression for the full conditional densities arising from the multibreed maternal animal model introduced in (10). Detailed derivations can be found in Sorensen and Gianola []  and Jensen et al. []. Let the location parameter vector  be such that . The full conditional distribution of this vector is then proportional to Explicitly  (A1) is equal to Now  by means of appropriate algebraic operations it can be shown [] that Here   is the solution to the mixed models equations arising from model (10)   is the corresponding inverse coefficient matrix  and  the right hand side. Unlike the mixed model equations presented by García-Cortés and Toro []  the system derived from (10) has a unique solution. It should be reminded that under this formulation  it is necessary to add  to the diagonal entry corresponding to every fixed effect  where  reflects a prior state of uncertainty about the location parameters. Next  we focus on the full conditional posterior distribution of the error variance. This distribution is proportional to and explicitly equals to Define then Hence  it is verifiable that An inspection of expression (A7) reveals that this is the kernel of a scaled inverted Chi-square density with parameters  and . In short Next  note that the full conditional posterior distribution of the genetic covariance matrix by source of variability  ( = {    }) is proportional to In (A9)  the symbol  is used to represent the genetic covariance matrices for the other sources of variability. Under the conditional distribution of   these matrices are taken as constants. Then  according to (24)  conditional distribution (A9) can be written explicitly as The last expression is recognizable as the kernel of the Inverted Wishart distribution . A similar result can be used to obtain the full conditional distributions of the two other genetic covariance matrices by source of variability. Finally  it remains to specify the full conditional posterior distribution of the maternal permanent environmental variance. This density is proportional to and explicitly to On defining it is verifiable that It follows by inspection that density (A14) is in the form of a scaled inverted Chi-square density with parameters  and   so that Below are the links to the authors’ original submitted files for images.

Genetic parameters and breeding values obtained by different models were compared to evaluate the consequences of including non-additive effects on genetic evaluation.ResultsIncluding inbreeding as a covariable did not affect the estimation of genetic parameters  but heritability was reduced when dominance or common environmental effects were included. A high heritability for harvest weight was estimated in both populations (even = 0.46 and odd = 0.50) when simple additive models (A + F and A) were used. Heritabilities decreased to 0.21 (even) and 0.37 (odd) when the full model was used (A + C + D + F). In this full model  the magnitude of the dominance variance was 0.19 (even) and 0.06 (odd)  while the magnitude of the common environmental effect was lower than 0.01 in both populations.

The models used were: additive  with and without inbreeding as a covariable (A + F and A respectively); additive plus common environmental due to full-sib families and inbreeding (A + C + F); additive plus parental dominance and inbreeding (A + D + F); and a full model (A + C + D + F). Genetic parameters and breeding values obtained by different models were compared to evaluate the consequences of including non-additive effects on genetic evaluation. Including inbreeding as a covariable did not affect the estimation of genetic parameters  but heritability was reduced when dominance or common environmental effects were included. A high heritability for harvest weight was estimated in both populations (even = 0.46 and odd = 0.50) when simple additive models (A + F and A) were used. Heritabilities decreased to 0.21 (even) and 0.37 (odd) when the full model was used (A + C + D + F). In this full model  the magnitude of the dominance variance was 0.19 (even) and 0.06 (odd)  while the magnitude of the common environmental effect was lower than 0.01 in both populations. The correlation between breeding values estimated with different models was very high in all cases (i.e. higher than 0.98). However  ranking of the 30 best males and the 100 best females per generation changed when a high dominance variance was estimated  as was the case in one of the two populations (even). Dominance and common environmental variance may be important components of variance in harvest weight in   thus not including them may produce an overestimation of the predicted response; furthermore  genetic evaluation was seen to be partially affected  since the ranking of selected animals changed with the inclusion of non-additive effects in the animal model. Several studies have shown that non-additive effects like common environmental and dominance genetic effects can be an important component in the total phenotypic variance of quantitative traits in fish [–]. In salmon breeding  common environmental effects may be observed when members of different families are reared in separate tanks until the fish reach a sufficiently large size for individual physical marking. Common environmental variance represents a proportion of the total phenotype variance and ranges from 0 to 0.09 for growth related traits in salmonids [          ]. In trout  significant full-sib family effects for body weight have been considered as indirect evidence of dominance variance  ranging from 0.01 to 0.17 []  however  it may be confused with other non-additive effects or a common environmental effect. Dominance genetic variance representing a proportion of the total phenotypic variance has been reported in various species and ranges from 0 to 0.22 for body weight at harvest in rainbow trout []  from 0.08 to 0.27 for different measurements of body weight in Chinook salmon [  ]  from 0.02 to 0.18 for body weight at harvest in Atlantic salmon []  and from 0.16 to 0.34 for swim-up stage weight in brown trout []. In the context of animal models  Rye and Mao [] and Pante et al. [] have shown that fitting non-additive effects  particularly dominance genetic effects  resulted in a remarkable decrease in the heritability estimate  while the residual variance either remained the same or increased slightly. Thus  the predicted genetic response may be biased upwards if dominance genetic variance is not included in animal models. Pante et al. [] have suggested that if significant dominance genetic variance is found  studies should be undertaken to determine whether re-ranking of breeding values occurs. The objective of this study was to investigate the magnitude of dominance genetic and common environmental variances  and the consequences of including these effects plus inbreeding on the genetic evaluation of harvest body weight in O. kisutch. Particularly  we are interested in the effects on heritability  genetic response and on ranking of animals selected as parents. The study was based ontwo . populations from the Genetic Improvement Center (CMG) maintained by the Institute for Fisheries Development (IFOP) and the University of Chile in Coyhaique (XI Region  Chile). These two populations  termed 'even' and 'odd' year classes  were initiated in 1992 and 1993  respectively  from a common base population and managed in a two-year reproductive cycle. Since the program began  both populations were managed as closed populations  maintained by mating approximately one male with three females. The fish spawned from late April to June; the eggs of each full-sib family were incubated separately  and at the eyed egg stage  120 families were moved to separate tanks for hatching and kept until fish were individually marked using PIT (passive integrated transponder) tags. Rearing families in separate tanks usually produces a common environmental effect that should increase in magnitude as full-sib families are maintained for a long time under these conditions.To prevent high common environmental effects in harvest and confounding effect with dominance  60-80 fish from 100 families were individually PIT (Passive integrated transponder) tagged in December  seven months after spawning  when the fish averaged about 5-10 g. Then  fish were transferred to estuary water conditions (Ensenada Baja) where each full-sib family was randomly stocked in equal numbers of fish into three rearing sea-cages. Body weight at harvest (harvest weight) was recorded at about 620 days post-spawning  when the fish weight was on average over 2 500 g. Artificial selection for harvest weight and early spawning was applied for four generations as described and analyzed in Neira et al. [  ] using a simple animal model. The general data structure and the frequency of full-sib family sizes are shown in Table  and Figure   respectively. The intended design to obtain 100 full-sib families per generation was reached  except for year class 1992 for which only 48 families were formed due to initial infrastructure limitations. A total of 11 833 and 10 327 harvest weight records were analyzed in the even and odd populations  respectively (Table )  and as expected for a selection experiment  the harvest weight tended to increase with generations. The frequency distribution of full-sib family size at harvest was bimodal for the even population ranging from 2-67 (mean = 26) and unimodal for the odd population ranging from 1-53 (mean = 20). This data structure should allow us to estimate the variance of dominance given that full-sib relationships are present  and because the number of animals per family is adequate. . The estimation of variance components and the calculation of breeding values were performed with the program AIREMLF90 [] using single trait animal models as described in Pante et al. []. Prior to analysis  the character harvest weight was adjusted to fixed age (620 days)  using multiplicative correction factors  to account for the different times of fish growth  so the covariate age was not included in the genetic analysis. Five different animal models were compared  that included the following effects and covariate: random genetic additive effect  with and without inbreeding as a covariate (A + F and A respectively); additive effect plus the random common environmental of full-sibs effect and inbreeding (A + C + F); additive effect plus the random parental genetic dominance effects  and inbreeding (A+ D + F); and a full model (A + C + D + F). where  is a vector of observations of animals;  is a vector of the contemporary group fixed effect year*sea-cage*sex with 30 levels;      are random effects of additive genetic  common environment due to full-sib families  and dominance respectively; ß is the linear regression of  on inbreeding coefficients;  is the coefficient of inbreeding;        are the corresponding incidence matrices relating the effects to ; and  is the vector of random residuals. The assumptions for the parameter means () and variances were: where  is the additive genetic variance   is the dominance genetic variance   is the common environmental variance   is the error variance  A is the additive genetic relationship matrix  D is the dominance genetic relationship matrix and I is an identity matrix. Note that parental dominance variance is one quarter of the offspring dominance variance []. Relative variance components were expressed as ratios of the total phenotypic variance (): heritability () = ; the dominance variance () = 4 ; the common environmental variance ratio () =  for each of the models and for the two populations of .   where  are additive genetic variance  dominance genetic variance and common environmental variance  respectively. The additive model was compared to other models using likelihood ratio (LR) tests. The likelihood ratio is LR = -2ln[l (<U+03B8>|y)/l (<U+03B8>r|y)]  where l (<U+03B8>|y) is the maximum of the likelihood function when fitted to a full set of parameters and l (<U+03B8>r|y) is the maximum likelihood  subject to the restriction that r parameters were constrained to fixed values. Asymptotically  the LR test statistic is  distributed  with r degrees of freedom []. Genetic responses per generation using the different models were calculated as the difference between mean breeding values in successive generations. To measure the magnitude of a possible over/under estimation of genetic response due to omission of dominance  common environmental effects  and/or inbreeding  the ratio of the genetic response of each model with the simplest model (A) was used. Performance rankings of animals obtained by different models were compared by: 1) Pearson correlations between estimates of breeding values of the total number of pedigree animals per population and 2) the count of the number of sires and dams that would have been excluded from the selected group using the simplest (A) model (30 best fathers and 100 best dams) in each of the other models. Estimation of the variance components and inbreeding coefficient for all models and for the two populations are shown in Table . Variance components were different in each population  though the inclusion of non-additive effects and inbreeding produced similar effects on the variance estimates for both populations. Including inbreeding as covariable neither affected the estimation of additive variance and nor significantly increased log likelihood. A high additive variance for harvest weight was estimated in both populations when simple additive models (A + F and A) were used  leading to high heritability estimates for both populations (0.45-0.50) while  additive variance decreased and residual variance increased when dominance or common environmental effects were included. Thus  heritability decreased to 0.21 (even) and 0.37 (odd) when C  D or both were considered in the model. When D was included in the model  the magnitude of dominance variance expressed as a ratio of the total phenotypic variance ranged from 0.19 to 0.21 (even) and from 0.06 to 0.10 (odd). The magnitude of the common environmental effect expressed as a ratio of the total phenotypic variance was lower than 0.01 when D was considered in the model in both populations and was 0.06 (even) and 0.02 (odd) when D was not included. The estimated D and C effects are confounded in both populations because the magnitude of the residual variance increased marginally or remained the same when an effect was added to the model (Table ). As Table  shows  the average genetic selection response in harvest weight was 21-22% higher in the even population than in the odd population only when simple models (A and A +F) were used but  when the model included C  D or both  estimation of the genetic response was slightly better in the odd population  between 5 to 10% higher  than in the even population. Analysis of the ratio of the genetic response between models (Table ) shows that the estimated response is practically the same between both additive models (A and A + F)  but using these models overestimated the genetic response between 22-25% in the odd population and 40-41% in the even population. Correlations between breeding values estimated with different models were near unity (0.98 to 1.00) suggesting that the breeding values of the selection candidates estimated by the different models do not re-rank (Table ). However  minor changes observed in the breeding values resulted in some candidate fish for selection obtained in one model to be excluded in another (Table ). Major differences in selected candidates were observed between both additive models (A and A + F) as compared to models involving dominance effects  common environment effects and both simultaneously (Additional file   Table S1 and Table S2). Also  more differences were observed in the even population than in the odd population  which showed the highest dominance variance (Table ). Small differences of 1-10 excluded candidates (sires and dam) were found between both additive models (A and A + F) and between the models including dominance effects  common environment effects  or both simultaneously. In the present study  the magnitude of additive and non-additive effects was estimated for body weight at harvest in . . In our study  population sizes were almost half (11 000) of that reported by Pante et al. [] in trout (20 000 individuals per population) and very small to that described by Rye and Mao [] in Atlantic salmon (50 000-60 000 individuals per population)  thus information may not be sufficient to separate with sufficient precision non-additive effects  dominance and full-sib environmental variances []. Few studies have addressed this issue in fish  but our results were similar to previous estimates for growth-related traits in other salmonids [    ]. As for the results reported in rainbow trout by Pante et al. []  including non-additive effects in different models significantly reduced the heritability estimates in both populations studied (even and odd) in comparison with simple models. Consequently  with the reduced heritabilities reported for the models with dominance  the estimates of genetic response per generation reported by Neira et al [] in both populations appear to be overestimated. These authors have estimated an average genetic response per generation of 383 g (10.5%) and 302 g (9.9%) for the even and odd populations  respectively. These results are very similar to those reported in this study with the simple random models (A  A + F). However  in tour study  we have estimated a genetic response using the dominance model (A + D + F) of 224 and 234 g per generation  which implies overestimations by 40% for the even population and 25% for the odd population. The higher overestimation was produced in the even population for which a higher magnitude of dominance variance was estimated. Differences between even and odd populations have been reported by Gallardo et al. []  in other areas such as inbreeding rate (even population 2.45% per generation; odd population = 1.10% per generation)  and effective population size (even population = 61; odd population = 106). Including inbreeding coefficients as a covariable did not affect the heritability estimate  which agrees with results previously reported for trout by Pante et al. []. In the present study  this may be due to the relatively low level of inbreeding in each population  indeed the inbreeding coefficient after five generations was estimated to reach between 4-10% by Gallardo et al. []. Comparison of the rankings of animals between models was performed using two different approximations: a) Correlation of breeding values between models [  ]  and 2) Comparison of the numbers of sires and dams that would have been excluded from the group selected by the simple model per generation  30 best sires and 100 best dams  in each of the models. High correlations between breeding values suggest that no re-ranking occurs  which agrees with results described by Ferreira et al. [] who compared full animal models with or without inbreeding in three growth traits in a Hereford cattle population. Changes of ranking  i.e. correlation near 0.5  were observed by Ferreira et al. [] only when sire models were compared with full models. However  although the correlations between breeding values were high  we observed that some candidates ranking in the top list with the simple models were excluded from the full models. This evidence shows that using simple models do not result only in overestimating genetic response  but also in the possibility that other animals may be selected as breeders. The results presented in this study show that dominance variance of harvest weight in . may be as important as additive variance  in contrast to common environmental effects  which are always small compared to additive and dominance variances. As reported by Pante et al. [] in trout  we have found evidence that there are confounding effects between dominance and common environments  suggesting that the data structure does not allow us to estimate both components properly. Dominance and common environmental variances may be important components of variance of harvest weight in   thus not including them may overestimate the predicted response. Genetic evaluation is partially affected  since the ranking of animals is partially changed when including non-additive effects in the animal model. However  the magnitude of these effects may be very different in different populations.

Molecular markers were used to investigate if putative Algarvia animals could be identified for use as progenitors in a breeding programme to recover this nearly extinct breed.Methods46 individuals phenotypically representative of Algarvia cattle were genotyped for 27 microsatellite loci and compared with 11 Portuguese autochthonous and three imported breeds. Genetic distances and factorial correspondence analyses (FCA) were performed to investigate the relationship among Algarvia and related breeds. Assignment tests were done to identify representative individuals of the breed. Y chromosome and mtDNA analyses were used to further characterize Algarvia animals. Gene- and allelic-based conservation analyses were used to determine breed contributions to overall genetic diversity.ResultsGenetic distance and FCA results confirmed the close relationship between Algarvia and southern Portuguese breeds. Assignment tests without breed information classified 17 Algarvia animals in this cluster with a high probability (q > 0.95). With breed information  30 cows and three bulls were identified (q > 0.95) that could be used to reconstitute the Algarvia breed. Molecular and morphological results were concordant. These animals showed intermediate levels of genetic diversity (MNA = 6.0 ± 1.6  R = 5.7 ± 1.4  H = 0.63 ± 0.19 and H = 0.69 ± 0.10) relative to other Portuguese breeds. Evidence of inbreeding was also detected (F = 0.083   < 0.001). The four Algarvia bulls had Y-haplotypes H6Y2 and H11Y2  common in Portuguese cattle. The mtDNA composition showed prevalence of T3 matrilines and presence of the African-derived T1a haplogroup. This analysis confirmed the genetic proximity of Algarvia and Garvonesa breeds (F = 0.028   > 0.05). Algarvia cattle provide an intermediate contribution (CB = 6.18  CW = -0.06 and D1 = 0.50) to the overall gene diversity of Portuguese cattle.

Molecular markers were used to investigate if putative Algarvia animals could be identified for use as progenitors in a breeding programme to recover this nearly extinct breed. 46 individuals phenotypically representative of Algarvia cattle were genotyped for 27 microsatellite loci and compared with 11 Portuguese autochthonous and three imported breeds. Genetic distances and factorial correspondence analyses (FCA) were performed to investigate the relationship among Algarvia and related breeds. Assignment tests were done to identify representative individuals of the breed. Y chromosome and mtDNA analyses were used to further characterize Algarvia animals. Gene- and allelic-based conservation analyses were used to determine breed contributions to overall genetic diversity. Genetic distance and FCA results confirmed the close relationship between Algarvia and southern Portuguese breeds. Assignment tests without breed information classified 17 Algarvia animals in this cluster with a high probability (q > 0.95). With breed information  30 cows and three bulls were identified (q > 0.95) that could be used to reconstitute the Algarvia breed. Molecular and morphological results were concordant. These animals showed intermediate levels of genetic diversity (MNA = 6.0 ± 1.6  R = 5.7 ± 1.4  H = 0.63 ± 0.19 and H = 0.69 ± 0.10) relative to other Portuguese breeds. Evidence of inbreeding was also detected (F = 0.083   < 0.001). The four Algarvia bulls had Y-haplotypes H6Y2 and H11Y2  common in Portuguese cattle. The mtDNA composition showed prevalence of T3 matrilines and presence of the African-derived T1a haplogroup. This analysis confirmed the genetic proximity of Algarvia and Garvonesa breeds (F = 0.028   > 0.05). Algarvia cattle provide an intermediate contribution (CB = 6.18  CW = -0.06 and D1 = 0.50) to the overall gene diversity of Portuguese cattle. Algarvia and seven other autochthonous breeds made no contribution to the overall allelic diversity. Molecular analyses complemented previous morphological findings to identify 33 animals that can be considered remnants of the Algarvia breed. Results of genetic diversity and conservation analyses provide objective information to establish a management program to reconstitute the Algarvia breed. Breeding practices designed to alleviate production constraints are prejudicial to the survival of traditional domestic animal breeds  and tend to lead to impoverishment of the gene pool []. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has encouraged a series of conservation measures designed to help prevent irreversible loss of diversity of domesticated animal species []. A heightened awareness of the cultural  historical and social heritage represented by traditional breeds has led to increased interest in their preservation []. Despite its small geographic area  Portugal hosts a wide variety of domestic breeds []  with as many as 13 autochthonous cattle breeds recognized [  ]. Analysis of genetic diversity of some of these breeds has used blood protein polymorphisms []  microsatellite variation [–]  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [  ] and Y chromosome sequence variation []. These studies have shown that  among European cattle  the Mirandesa breed is one of the most important targets for preservation based on its contribution to diversity []. In general  southern European cattle appear to represent particularly important reservoirs of genetic diversity [].  cattle are native to the Algarve region of southern Portugal and were first represented in 1868 [] and later described with more details [–]. Based on its morphology  the breed has been classified in the Aquitanian (or Red Convex) group  together with Alentejana  Mertolenga  Garvonesa and Minhota [  ]. Except for Minhota  these breeds are distributed throughout the southern river Tagus valley.  cattle were used predominantly for meat production and/or draft. Although they were never formally registered as an independent breed  25 000 - 29 000 animals were officially catalogued between 1940 and 1970 []. Since then  the population has declined rapidly and the breed was considered to be effectively extinct by the 1980s []  an event that subjected the Regional Agricultural Authorities to criticism for failure to implement proper conservation measures. The morphology of eight autochthonous Portuguese cattle breeds has been analyzed by numerical taxonomic methods []  and these analyses have been extended recently to include animals thought to derive from the  breed []. This study identified a uniform group of animals that shared many of the phenotypic characteristics of that breed. These remnants were preserved mainly for cultural reasons by traditional breeders in different areas of Algarve and southern Alentejo regions. In the present study  we have characterized these putative  animals using nuclear microsatellites  Y chromosome markers and mtDNA sequences to determine to which extent they can be genetically distinguished from related autochthonous breeds  and to identify individuals that would represent suitable progenitors for a breeding programme to reconstitute the  breed. Forty-six animals (42 females and four males) were chosen from ten independent herds and consisted of individuals thought to derive from the  cattle on the basis of phenotypic similarity  as judged by traditional farmers with experience on the breed characteristics []. Additionally  samples from Garvonesa (29) and Preta (47) breeds were collected because they are present throughout the southern region of the country and admixture with  cannot be excluded. The herds in which putative  individuals were located also had animals from the Alentejana breed. A 9 ml whole blood sample was collected from each individual by jugular venipuncture in tubes containing EDTA-K3 as anticoagulant. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes using the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems  Minneapolis  USA). A set of 27 microsatellite markers  and ) was used to genotype each animal. Multiplex PCR were performed using fluorescence-labelled primers  as described by Mateus . []. PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on ABI PRISM 310 instruments (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA) and fragment size analysis was done with STRand software []. Genotypes from nine Portuguese autochthonous and three imported breeds were obtained from Mateus . [  ]  thus the complete dataset included  in addition to the above breeds  Alentejana (50 individuals)  Arouquesa (50)  Barrosã (50)  Brava de Lide (40)  Minhota (50)  Marinhoa (51)  Maronesa (47)  Mertolenga (50) and Mirandesa (50)  Charolais (45)  Friesian (35) and Limousin (48). Reference samples were included in all PCR assays to standardize allele sizing across datasets. Allele frequencies were determined with GENALEX version 6 []. The software GENEPOP version 3.4 [] was used to perform global and per locus/per population Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) tests  and to test for genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD). Exact probability tests were done for loci with four or fewer alleles; otherwise  a Markov chain method was employed [] with 10 000 dememorization steps  500 batches and 5 000 iterations. GENETIX version 4.02 [] was used to estimate within-population observed (H) and unbiased expected (H) heterozygosities []  the mean number of alleles (MNA)  and inbreeding coefficients (F) []. The statistical significance of F > 0 was obtained based on 1 000 permutations. Pairwise population F values were calculated with FSTAT version 2.9.3 [] and -values obtained based on 1 000 randomizations. This software was also used to estimate allelic richness (R) per locus and population. To investigate breed relationships  neighbour-joining (N-J) dendrograms [] were constructed from D genetic distances [] using POPULATIONS version 1.2.28 []. Bootstrap values were obtained with 1 000 replicates over loci. A dendrogram based on allele-sharing distances between individuals was also constructed using this software. TREEVIEW version 1.6.6 [] was used to visualize and edit the dendrograms. A factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) was done with GENETIX to investigate relationships among individuals. Assignment tests were performed to identify individuals most representative of the  breed and to detect admixture. STRUCTURE version 2.2 [] was used to estimate the most probable number of population clusters (K). The analysis was done without prior information on populations  assuming correlated allele frequencies and admixture []. Ten independent runs with 100 000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations and 10 000  were performed at each K (1 = K = 9) to calculate <U+0394>K as in Evanno . []. A longer run (1 000 000 iterations and 100 000 ) was done for the most probable K to determine the number of individuals within each cluster. An assignment test with these settings but including prior breed information was also performed. The partially Bayesian simulation-exclusion procedures of GENECLASS version 2.0 [] were used for assignment tests with 10 000 Monte Carlo resamplings of individuals [–]. The contribution of each population to the overall genetic diversity was analysed considering the within- (CW) and between-breed (CB) diversity components  and aggregate genetic diversity (D1 = F*CB + (1-F)*CW) as described by Ollivier and Foulley []. METAPOP software version 1.0.2. [] was used to account for allelic diversity and estimate the contribution of each population (c) to a pool of maximal genetic diversity []. Equal weights were given to within- and between-breed coancestries (<U+03BB> = l). The average molecular coancestry () of each population was also obtained with this software. The four putative  males were genotyped for one SNP ()  one  ()  and five microsatellites ( and ) located in the male-specific region of the bovine Y chromosome. Analyses were done as described by Ginja . [] for a comparison with previously identified patrilines in Portuguese autochthonous breeds. A 919 bp PCR fragment containing the complete mtDNA control region was obtained and sequenced for  animals. The analysis was done as described by Ginja . [] and sequences were aligned with the taurine reference sequence [GenBank: V00654  []] using the Multalin interface . Haplotypes were identified with GENALEX [] and ARLEQUIN version 2.0 [] was used to calculate haplotype diversity (H)  nucleotide diversity (p)  and the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences (MNPD) accounting for heterogeneity of substitution rates per site []. mtDNA sequences of the southern Portuguese autochthonous breeds and the imported Limousin were obtained from the GenBank database [accession numbers: FJ815445-59  FJ815525-40  FJ815573-88  FJ815620-35 and FJ815880-95] and used in ARLEQUIN to estimate pairwise-population F values (5% significance level obtained with 10 000 permutations). A Median-Joining (MJ) network of haplotypes was constructed with NETWORK version 4.5.10 [] software to investigate breed relationships. The genetic distance analysis confirmed that the putative  animals were close to the southern Garvonesa and Alentejana breeds  and distant from northern breeds such as Mirandesa (Additional file  Figure S1). It also showed that this group of animals was more closely related to Preta than to Brava de Lide  both of which are considered to belong to the Black Orthoid breed group. Relationships among the individuals of  and of southern Portuguese breeds that clustered with  in Additional file  Figure S1 are shown in the N-J dendrogram of allele sharing distances in Figure . Limousin cattle was included in the analysis because they are raised in the southern region of Portugal and have been used to upgrade the autochthonous breeds []. Thirty-two  animals formed two closely related subgroups each containing a few Alentejana animals. Five  individuals clustered with Garvonesa (AG24  AG27  AG33  AG34 and AG35)  four with Preta (AG40  AG41  AG42 and AG43) and five with Mertolenga (AG12  AG17  AG23  AG32 and AG37). Results of the FCA showed that Preta is the most distant breed but that among southern Portuguese breeds including  genetic differentiation was weak (Additional file  Figure S2). The relationships among individuals represented in the FCA graph were consistent with those shown in Figure . . The N-J dendrogram is based on allele sharing distances among animals from the autochthonous breeds Alentejana (Alt  N = 50)  Garvonesa (Garv  N = 29)  Mertolenga (Mert  N = 50)  Preta (Pret  N = 47)  the  population (AG  N = 46) and the imported Limousin(LM  N = 48) STRUCTURE analyses assume that within a population all loci are in HWE and linkage equilibrium []. Although for some breeds a high number of loci showed significant ( < 0.05) deviations from HWE without correction for multiple testing (Additional file  Table S1)  the assignments with STRUCTURE were conducted to include all loci  because some deviations from HWE are not expected to affect the performance of the test []. The HWE deviations found in Brava de Lide and Preta breeds are most probably related with a  effect and/or inbreeding  considering that the F values for these breeds were highly significant [see discussion for Brava de Lide in []]. Within breeds  LD was significant ( < 0.001) for one pair of loci in the Alentejana breed  four in the Preta and four in the Brava de Lide  but none of these corresponded to markers located on the same chromosome. The assignment tests of STRUCTURE and GENECLASS were done exclusively for the  animals  the related southern breeds (Alentejana  Garvonesa  Mertolenga and Preta) and the Limousin cattle to determine which  animals clustered as an independent group  and to detect admixture. The STRUCTURE assignments without prior information on source breeds showed the highest <U+0394>K at K = 6 (Additional file  Figure S3). The estimated genotype membership coefficients (q) obtained for each individual are shown in Figure .  animals clustered with the Alentejana and Mertolenga breeds at K = 2 and only appeared as an independent cluster at K = 6. . STRUCTURE was used to obtain q values for each individual of the southern Portuguese breeds and the imported Limousin with K varying from 2 to 6 Approximately 54% of all individuals were correctly allocated to each of the six clusters with q = 0.95 (Table ). For the  cluster (K = 6)  the average individual genotype membership proportion (Q) was 0.66 ± 0.40 and this cluster contained 17 individuals (37%) with q = 0.95 (AG4  AG5  AG6  AG7  AG8  AG10  AG13  AG14  AG15  AG16  AG18  AG19  AG22  AG24  AG25  AG27 and AG28). Among the remaining  animals  one (~2%) was misclassified with q = 0.95 and 28 (~61%) were not assigned to this population (q < 0.95). When prior information on populations was used  ~85% of all individuals were correctly allocated with q = 0.95 (Table ). Among the 46  animals  33 (72%) were allocated to this cluster with q = 0.95. These included the 17 listed above plus AG1  AG2  AG2M  AG3M  AG4M  AG9  AG11  AG20  AG21  AG26  AG29  AG30  AG31  AG40  AG42 and AG43. Eleven (24%)  animals were not assigned to this population (q < 0.80) and admixture was detected with Garvonesa (AG33  AG34  AG35 and AG36)  Limousin (AG23  AG32  AG37  AG39 and AG41) and Mertolenga breeds (AG12 and AG17). For the  population  the average value of Q was 0.85 ± 0.27 and was the lowest among all breeds. Results of GENECLASS assignments are summarized in Additional file  Table S2. Animals were correctly assigned if the genotype probability was higher than the threshold exclusively in their source population. For  animals  ~22 to 50% of the individuals were correctly assigned with accuracies > 0.94 (ratio between the number of correctly assigned individuals and the sum of correctly and incorrectly assigned). Depending on the threshold considered  between 2 and 20% of the  animals were excluded (genotype probabilities lower than the threshold in all populations) and 30 to 76% were assigned to multiple populations (genotype probabilities greater than the threshold in at least two populations). The genetic diversity (MNA = 6.0 ± 1.6  R = 5.7 ± 1.4  H = 0.63 ± 0.19 and H = 0.69 ± 0.10) of the 33  animals identified with STRUCTURE was identical to that found for the related Alentejana breed  and slightly lower than the average estimates across all breeds included in this study (Additional file  Table S1  MNA = 6.8 ± 0.6  R = 6.0 ± 1.8  H = 0.67 ± 0.05 and H = 0.70 ± 0.03). Ten population-specific alleles were found in the  population but none had a frequency greater than 0.05. Deviations from HWE were significant ( < 0.05) due to heterozygote deficit at ten loci (  and ). Evidence of inbreeding within the  group could be inferred from the F estimate (0.083) which was significantly ( < 0.001) greater than zero. The molecular coancestry of  animals ( = 0.322) was slightly higher than the overall value of 0.310. Pairwise population F estimates showed that  animals are genetically closer to the Alentejana breed (F = 0.045   0.05) than to the other southern breeds (results not shown). Among the four  bulls  two (ALG3M and ALG4M) had the H11Y2 haplotype which is fixed in the Alentejana breed but also common in other Portuguese breeds  whereas the two other animals (ALG1M and ALG2M) had the H6Y2 haplotype which is fixed in the Garvonesa breed but also found in other Portuguese breeds as well as in Charolais and Limousin breeds []. Complete mtDNA control region sequences (909 bp) were obtained for the 33  animals (four bulls and 29 females) assigned to this group with STRUCTURE (sequence quality of AG19 was low and thus was discarded). Sequence alignment is shown in Additional file  Figure S4 with polymorphic positions represented. A total of 12 distinct haplotypes was identified [GenBank: G086285-G086317] based on 21 variable sites  of which 11 were phylogenetically informative  nine were singletons  and one was an . The European T3 haplogroup (T at nt16255) was the most frequent (29 animals) but the African-derived T1a type (T at nt16050  C at nt16113 and C at nt16255) was also detected in three  individuals (AG16  AG40 and AG43). Genetic diversity estimates in the  population were H = 0.81 ± 0.05  p = 0.003 ± 0.002 and MNPD = 3.03 ± 1.62. Pairwise F values showed that  is significantly differentiated from all breeds except from Garvonesa (F = 0.028   > 0.05). Haplotype relationships represented in the MJ-network (Figure ) showed that the most common haplotype in the  population (11 animals  including males AG3M and AG4M) was shared with one Alentejana individual  whereas the second most frequent haplotype (10 animals) was shared with three Garvonesa  two Mertolenga and one Preta individuals. Two  animals (AG40 and AG43) and one Garvonesa shared a T1a haplotype. Interestingly  a T1a haplotype found in one  (AG16) and three Alentejana animals was substantially different from other haplotypes of this haplogroup. This haplotype has a C and an A at positions nt16122 and nt16196  respectively (nt330 and nt404 in Additional file  Figure S4)  which are characteristic of the African-derived AA mtDNA lineage described in Latin American Creole cattle and also found in Iberia []. Although this haplotype lacks the C and T at positions nt16053 and nt16139  respectively (nt261 and nt347 in Additional file  Figure S4)  that also define AA  it can represent more ancestral Iberian mtDNA lineages [for a discussion see []]. . Breeds are colour-coded as follows: Alentejana (orange)   (red)  Garvonesa (blue)  Mertolenga (brown)  Preta (green) and Limousin (black); circle sizes are proportional to haplotype frequencies; major haplogroups are indicated by coloured shadows: European T3 (red)  African-derived T1a (orange) and ancestral Mediterranean Q (brown); mutated nt positions that differentiate haplogroups are also shown; theoretical median vectors are represented by grey dots Contributions of each breed to the overall genetic diversity are shown in Table . Following the Weitzman approach  and based on population pairwise D values  the between-breed influence on diversity (CB) varied from 3.90 (Arouquesa) to 10.23 (Brava de Lide). The within-breed diversity (CW) values varied from -0.62 (Brava de Lide) to 0.43 (Mertolenga). The F value estimated across all breeds and used to calculate the aggregate genetic diversity (D1) was 0.089. Among autochthonous breeds  the lowest value for D1 was found in the Mirandesa breed (0.23) and the highest for the Preta breed (0.92). The influence of the  breed on the overall genetic diversity was intermediate across all estimates except for the allelic diversity-based (c) calculation.  ranked within the six breeds that contributed most to CB (6.18)  and showed a lower contribution to both CW (-0.06) and D1 (0.50). When the allelic diversity was considered   and seven other autochthonous breeds made no contribution to the overall genetic diversity. Decisions to initiate costly conservation programmes need to take into account assessment of extant variability and diversity loss  as well as cultural and economic aspects [–].  cattle were adapted to the climatic and geographical conditions of Algarve  a region that is highly susceptible to suffer from climate change []. In addition to its cultural and historical relevance  reconstituting this breed could also contribute to reinforce sustainable agriculture  a non negligible component of the economic activity of the region. The use of molecular data to assess the genetic structure of domestic species in conservation programmes has been described [  –]. Analysis of morphological and molecular information provides a more solid basis to define the characteristics of a breed than the use of morphological traits alone. DNA markers were not available at the time when the  breed became nearly extinct  and no biological samples have been preserved. Based on morphology descriptions []  putative  descendants were identified []. As preliminary work towards reconstituting this breed  we used molecular markers to investigate to which extent these animals could be distinguished from other Portuguese cattle. In agreement with their morphological classification [      ]  genetic distances and factorial correspondence analyses showed a close relationship between  and other breeds of the Aquitanian (Red Convex) group.  and Garvonesa breeds are considered to be descendants of the Alentejana breed []  and our study shows that  is closely related to these breeds. This genetic proximity probably also reflects recent admixture  because most of the  animals were found in herds predominantly composed of Alentejana animals. Genetic erosion due to crossbreeding is expected to have occurred since the breed began to decline about 35 years ago. We used assignment tests to determine whether a cluster of putative  animals could be distinguished from the related southern breeds and to identify potential candidates to reconstitute the breed. STRUCTURE results confirmed that the most probable partition of the data agreed with the number of populations tested. Although the  group was the last to emerge as an independent cluster  it was possible to identify 17 cows that belonged to this group with q values > 0.95 without using prior information on populations. With prior information on sample origin  33 animals (30 cows and three bulls) were classified as . The partially Bayesian method of GENECLASS resulted in relatively low percentages of animals classified in each breed but  because of the high accuracy  it was useful to confirm reference animals in each population. Even though GENECLASS methods are conservative []  the results were consistent with those of STRUCTURE with 23 animals assigned to  of which only two (AG34 and AG1M) were not among those selected by STRUCTURE. Based on their genotypes  three bulls (AG2M  AG3M and AG4M) identified as  can be used to reconstitute the breed. The remaining bull (AG1M) was possibly admixed with Alentejana  according to the STRUCTURE analysis  although with GENECLASS it was assigned to the source population but with a low probability. Overall  a certain amount of convergence of results from independent approaches is noted  since 19 of these animals (16 cows and three bulls) were also identified as belonging to the core group to reconstitute the  breed based on numerical taxonomy analyses of morphological characters []. Admixture was detected in several  females  three of which (AG33  AG35 and AG41) did not represent descendants of this breed because they were misclassified. Based on morphology  these animals clustered within a group also containing Alentejana  Garvonesa and Mertolenga animals []. The heterogeneous composition of the putative  population is reflected by the lower average genotype membership coefficients when compared to those of breeds having herdbook registries. This result was not surprising given the expected dilution of  through crossbreeding. The Y-haplotypes of the putative  bulls provided additional evidence of the genetic proximity with Alentejana and Garvonesa breeds  but did not exclude possible admixture with imported breeds such as Limousin or Charolais. mtDNA analysis corroborated the close genetic relationship between the core group of 33  animals and the Garvonesa breed through their sharing of haplotypes. Common Iberian matrilines (European T3 and African T1a) were found in the  population  as well as a distinct haplotype (AG16) possibly related to the more ancestral African-derived AA haplogroup found in Creole cattle []. The use of genotypic data  together with morphological analysis  facilitated the definition of a group of animals that could be used to reconstitute the  breed. How conservative the inclusion criteria should be relative to the acceptable degree of admixture will depend on breeding strategies yet to be defined. The genetic diversity of the core set of 33  animals was slightly lower than that found across Portuguese breeds. A significant heterozygote deficit was detected  possibly due to inbreeding  which is consistent with the strong genetic erosion. These results were not unexpected considering the extremely reduced number of extant  descendants. Another possible explanation for HWE deviations could be the sampling of  animals from independent herds  which could generate population subdivision and an increased frequency of homozygotes (e.g.  effect). Gene diversity-based estimates indicate that the  population makes an intermediate contribution to the overall genetic diversity of Portuguese cattle. In contrast  the allelic diversity-based estimates suggest that the variation found in  is represented in the genetic pool of four other autochthonous breeds. The decision concerning which of these measures should be used in management programs to evaluate breed contributions to overall genetic diversity is not consensual []. In the case of Portuguese autochthonous breeds that are considered endangered []  particularly for the  breed  immediate conservation measures should aim at maximizing gene diversity rather than allelic diversity. This approach would maintain allelic diversity and guarantee a more effective response to selection while controlling inbreeding [  ]. Although nearly three decades have elapsed since the  breed was declared effectively extinct  we were able to identify a small group of cows and bulls with phenotypic characteristics of this breed. Analyses of autosomal  maternal and paternal markers have helped refine previous morphological findings to identify 33 animals that can be considered remnants from the  breed. For cultural and economic reasons  reconstituting the  breed is relevant to maintain the distinct regional identity of the Algarve. Molecular analyses have characterized the genetic diversity of the core set of animals which  together with information from conservation analyses  can be used to establish a management program to reconstitute the  breed.

The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting flesh colour and growth related traits in an F2 population derived from an isolated  landlocked wild population in Norway (Byglands Bleke) and a commercial production population.MethodsOne hundred and twenty-eight informative microsatellite loci distributed across all 29 linkage groups in Atlantic salmon were genotyped in individuals from four F2 families that were selected from the ends of the flesh colour distribution. Genotyping of 23 additional loci and two additional families was performed on a number of linkage groups harbouring putative QTL. QTL analysis was performed using a line-cross model assuming fixation of alternate QTL alleles and a half-sib model with no assumptions about the number and frequency of QTL alleles in the founder populations.ResultsA moderate to strong phenotypic correlation was found between colour  length and weight traits. In total  13 genome-wide significant QTL were detected for all traits using the line-cross model  including three genome-wide significant QTL for flesh colour (Chr 6  Chr 26 and Chr 4). In addition  32 suggestive QTL were detected (chromosome-wide P < 0.05). Using the half-sib model  six genome-wide significant QTL were detected for all traits  including two for flesh colour (Chr 26 and Chr 4) and 41 suggestive QTL were detected (chromosome-wide P < 0.05). Based on the half-sib analysis  these two genome-wide significant QTL for flesh colour explained 24% of the phenotypic variance for this trait.ConclusionsA large number of significant and suggestive QTL for flesh colour and growth traits were found in an F2 population of Atlantic salmon. Chr 26 and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting flesh colour  while Chr 10  Chr 5  and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting growth traits (length and weight). These QTL could be strong candidates for use in marker-assisted selection and provide a starting point for further characterisation of the genetic components underlying flesh colour and growth."

Chr 26 and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting flesh colour  while Chr 10  Chr 5  and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting growth traits (length and weight). These QTL could be strong candidates for use in marker-assisted selection and provide a starting point for further characterisation of the genetic components underlying flesh colour and growth. Carotenoid uptake and subsequent deposition in the muscle of fish such as salmon  trout and char is a heritable quantitative trait that is commercially very important for the aquaculture industry [–]. Astaxanthin is an expensive ingredient in fish feed (5-10% of feed cost) and muscle deposition of colour in the fish is relatively poor [  ]. Market preference for red-fleshed fish has made flesh colour an important trait for breeding goals in Atlantic salmon selection programs. However  at present flesh colour cannot be accurately measured on live adult individuals. Consequently  no within-family selection can be performed and only part of the genetic variation of the trait can be exploited. Marker assisted selection (MAS) using markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flesh colour represents an excellent way to improve the efficiency of selection. Heritabilities for flesh colour in Atlantic salmon tend to be low when subjective colour card measurements are used and medium when measurements are based on instrumental methods  with a reported range generally between 0.1 and 0.2 [  ]. The extent of genetic control of pigmentation in salmonids has not been conclusively demonstrated. A cross between extremely strong- and weak-coloured populations of Chinook salmon exhibited a phenotypic distribution originally explained by a model involving two loci  each with two alleles []. The proposed model could not explain the anomalous red:white ratios among the progeny of one male parent. A recent study has shown that this dataset could be fully explained by a model with one locus and three alleles []. In another study []  a single locus SCAR marker with a relatively strong association to flesh colour in Coho salmon has been identified  suggesting that the genetic control of flesh colour may be controlled by relatively few loci with large effects  rather than a large polygenic effect. A dynamic model of carotenoid metabolism in salmonids  based on ordinary differential equations  has identified the uptake process of carotenoid over the muscle membrane as a potential important source of genetic variation []. Given that this model mimics the real situation  the existence of key regulatory sites could possibly suggest the presence of loci with relatively large effects. However this does not necessarily mean that the trait will be regulated via polymorphisms with major effects within the genes encoding these sites. An F2 population is a useful design to detect loci affecting QTL when two phenotypically distinct populations are crossed []. In Atlantic salmon  such populations are relatively rare  and the production of divergent or inbred lines is a long term undertaking due to the long generation interval. However  isolated populations of Atlantic salmon do exist in Norway  and show clear evidence of substantial phenotypic differences from production fish that have been under artificial selection for several generations. The Bleke salmon is a freshwater Atlantic salmon population inhabiting the inner part of the Byglandsfjord in southern Norway. This slow-growing ice age relict was isolated from sea-migrating populations about 9000 years ago because of a waterfall barrier (Vigelandsfoss) []. Female Bleke salmon become sexually mature after 4-5 years of freshwater life at a size of about 25 cm fork length [] compared to that of 70-120 cm in ancestral migratory populations. In 1999  Bleke salmon were crossed to commercial Norwegian salmon selected for fast growth and high colour. The resulting F1 were then crossed to produce an F2 mapping population suitable for the detection of QTL for flesh colour  growth rate and other traits diverging between the parental populations. The aim of our study was to identify QTL affecting flesh colour and growth traits in this F2 population. The mapping population consisted of six F2 families that originated from a cross between two divergent populations  the landlocked Byglands Bleke population and a commercial breeding population under selection (Aqua Gen AS). In 1995  three Bleke salmon were crossed with three commercial Norwegian salmon  forming three full-sib families. Five F1 males from one family and five F1 females from another family were subsequently crossed to produce five full-sib F2 families  in addition to a sixth F2 family that was sired by a male from the third F1 family. The pedigree is depicted in Figure . . Founding generation (P) consisting of Bleke males (Bleke) and Aqua Gen females (AGen). F2 progeny were slaughtered at three years of age and had the following traits recorded: length (L)  body weight (BW)  slaughter weight (SW)  and colour (C) in SalmoFan™ colour units. In addition  Fulton's condition factor ()  a measure of a fish's girth  was calculated as (BW × L × 100) [] and dressing percentage (D%) was calculated as ((BW-SW)/BW × 100). Samples that were paler than the palest colour value (20) on the SalmoFan were given the score 19. Not all the individuals had sufficient gonad developed to be sexed at sampling. For the unsexed progeny  paternal allelic segregation at the microsatellite locus Ssa202DU  known to be tightly linked to the sex-determining locus []  was used to divide the progeny into males and females. The appropriate marker phase was established from the sexed progeny in each family. Fifty progeny from each extreme of the colour distribution were selected from three F2 families (8B  9B and 10B)  and all 76 progeny from a fourth family (10A) were selected for genotyping. Corrected values for colour based on the fish size correlation were not used in this selection in order to provide sufficient power for QTL detection for the other traits. Due to differences in progeny numbers between the families  this represented selective genotyping fractions (both extremes) of 44%  35%  35% and 100% respectively for families 8B  9B  10B and 10A (Table ). Following the initial QTL analysis  384 additional individuals were selected from the remaining extremes of the colour distribution from families (8B  9B and 10B) as well as 384 individuals from two additional families (8A and 9A) for subsequent genotyping at putative QTL. DNA extraction was carried out from muscle tissue samples using the DNeasy 96 kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocol. The majority of microsatellite markers used in this study were chosen from the SALMAP microsatellite map of Atlantic salmon []  covering all 29 linkage groups (chromosomes). The nomenclature of chromosomes follows that introduced by Philips et al. []. In total  128 informative microsatellite loci were initially genotyped  including duplicated loci amplified from the same primer pair (see additional file  for names and female map positions). Following the initial analysis  23 additional loci were genotyped. The microsatellite markers were distributed across 32 PCR multiplexes that were subsequently combined into 16 multiplexes for capillary electrophoresis. Primer sequences and multiplex information are available on request. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed in volumes of 5 µL  using 0.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems)  250 µM dNTP mix  1.5 mM MgCl  0.25-1 pmol of each primer (depending on amplification efficiency of each marker in multiplex)  0.25 µL DMSO  and 5 ng DNA template. PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for 10 min  35 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds  54°C for 1 min  and 72°C for 1 min  followed by a final extension at 60°C for 45 min. The lengths of the fluorescent PCR products were determined relative to the LIZ500 size standard (Applied Biosystems) on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems)  using GeneMapper 4.0 (Applied Biosystems) software for allele calls. Since samples of the F1 parents were not available  genotypes had to be inferred from the grandparent and progeny genotypes. A custom Visual Basic for Applications program in Excel was used for this task. In situations where it was equally likely for a parental genotype to fit the sire or dam  then  the genotype was arbitrarily applied  the linkage relationship to adjacent markers examined  and finally the parental genotypes reversed if necessary (i.e. if the marker was not linked when it should have been). Separate male and female maps were constructed due to large sex-specific recombination differences observed in salmonids []. Marker grouping and initial marker ordering was done with Joinmap 3.0 []. A Joinmap input file was made for each mapping parent (in double haploid format)  containing information on alleles inherited from that parent only. Marker grouping was performed at a minimum LOD score of 4.0. Following marker grouping  homologous linkage groups from each sire and each dam were integrated into single sex-specific maps. The data was examined for unlikely double recombinants and for inconsistencies in marker order between parents using a custom VBA program in Excel (available by request from the authors). Occurrences of double recombinants over small distances were checked for genotyping errors. After marker orders and potential genotype errors had been verified  the final maps were constructed using Joinmap. The Kosambi mapping function was used. Interval mapping using regression methods was applied to two different genetic models: (1) line-cross analysis following Haley et al. [] assuming founder lines to be fixed for different QTL alleles and (2) half-sib model []  making no assumptions about the fixation of QTL alleles in the founder lines. In the line-cross model  QTL effects are partitioned into additive and dominance effects. The additive effect was estimated as half the difference between the phenotypic values for homozygotes for the Aqua Gen and Bleke alleles at the QTL  with a positive or a negative sign indicating that the Aqua Gen or the Bleke allele  respectively  increased the value of the trait score. The dominance effect was calculated as the phenotypic deviation of the heterozygotes from the mean of the two homozygotes. GridQTL software [] was used for QTL analyses. Due to the significant effect of sex on the traits under study  sex was included as a fixed effect for the analysis in both models  based on records of sexed individuals and marker segregation at Ssa202DU. In the initial QTL analysis including four families  male and female mapping parents were analysed separately under the half-sib model. In the subsequent analysis with the larger data set  a joint analysis of male and female mapping parents in the half-sib model was performed by duplicating the dataset prior to analysis  with the designation of parents as sire or dams inverted in the duplicate. In the initial QTL analysis  length was included as a covariate for the analysis of colour  however in the subsequent analysis  body weight was used as the covariate. Full-sib family was fitted as a fixed effect in the line-cross model in the larger dataset (but was omitted in the initial analysis). P values were calculated for all trait-by-chromosome combinations with the significance of the peak F-statistic (putative QTL) estimated after 10 000 chromosome-wide permutation tests []. The chromosomal location of the QTL was taken as the position with the highest F-statistic. Two levels of significance are reported for the detected QTL. A QTL was found to be genome-wide significant if the chromosome-wide significance level was smaller than 0.05 * 29  a Bonferroni correction based on the number of linkage groups examined. QTL that were chromosome-wide significant at P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 but not genome-wide significant were regarded as 'suggestive' QTL. Because this was an initial scan  and also for ease of comparison of the results with those of other studies (as suggested by [])  correction for multiple traits was not performed. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the QTL using the half-sib model was calculated as 4*(1-MS/MS) where MS is the mean squared error of the full model  accommodating one QTL effect for each informative mapping parent  while MS is the corresponding mean squared error of the reduced model omitting QTL effects []. Correction for overestimation of QTL effects due to selective genotyping for flesh colour was not performed due to the different selective genotyping fractions in each family and to the fact that almost all individuals within each family were ultimately genotyped for the four linkage groups that were further investigated. In addition  this correction was not applied for the other traits due to the fact that progeny were only selected from the extremes of the colour distribution and not for these traits (however  the positive correlation between length  weight and colour will mean that some selective genotyping has taken place  and some QTL effect overestimation has occurred). Confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each genome-wide significant QTL using the bootstrap method [] and 10 000 iterations. Analysis of raw phenotypic data in the F2 population revealed that all traits exhibited substantial levels of phenotypic variation (Table )  and strong phenotypic correlations were observed between numerous traits (Table ). Flesh colour was moderately to strongly correlated to length (0.76)  body weight (0.75) and slaughter weight (0.74). Colour was also moderately correlated to  factor (0.60) and weakly correlated to dressing percentage (0.20). There were significant differences in all trait averages between the two sexes (P < 0.001). A total of 6% of all F2 progeny had flesh colour scores below the minimum SalmoFan value of 20  and were therefore given the score 19 for this trait (Figure ). . Frequency distribution of colour scores over the six F2 families. An initial genome scan was performed using four of the six full-sib families  for the traits flesh colour  body weight and length. Under the across family half-sib model  genome-wide significant QTL were identified for flesh colour on Chr 4  for body weight on Chr 4 and for length on Chr 10 and Chr 4 (Table ). All QTL were detected in the sire-based analysis. Under the line-cross model  genome-wide significant QTL were identified for flesh colour on Chr 4  for body weight on Chr 5 and Chr 4 and for length on Chr 10 and Chr 4 (Table ). Numerous additional suggestive QTL were also detected. Genome-wide significance in either model was used as criteria to select chromosomes 10  5  and 4 for genotyping in additional samples. In addition  suggestive evidence for a colour QTL on Chr 26 under both models was used as criteria for selection of Chr 26 for additional genotyping. Seven hundred and sixty-two additional animals were genotyped for markers on chromosomes 10  5  4  and 26. To improve coverage  23 additional microsatellites were genotyped for chromosomes 26 and 4 (see Additional File . In total  13 genome-wide significant QTL were detected for all traits using the line-cross model (Table ). Five QTL were significant at the chromosome-wide P < 0.01 level  and 27 were significant at the chromosome-wide P < 0.05 level (suggestive QTL). Of the 45 significant or suggestive QTL detected  40 had primarily additive effects  whilst five had larger dominance effects. For flesh colour  three genome-wide significant QTL were detected  two with primarily additive (Chr 26 and Chr 4) and one (Chr 6) with primarily dominance effects. Numerous linkage groups had multiple QTL mapping to them  particularly the strongly correlated length  body weight and slaughter weight traits. Genome-wide significant QTL for colour mapped uniquely to Chr 26 (Figure ) and Chr 6  and on Chr 4 a genome-wide significant QTL peak (Figure ) was 53 cM away from genome-wide significant QTL peaks for length and weight (Figure ). Genome-wide significant QTL for length  body weight and slaughter weight were confirmed on Chr 10 (Figure ) and Chr 5 (Figure ). Based on the sign of the additive effect  only three of the 45 QTL were identified where the allele derived from the Bleke line increased the value of the trait score (positive additive effect). 95% QTL confidence intervals were large  covering nearly the entire chromosomes. .

In total  six genome-wide significant QTL were detected for all traits using the half-sib model (Table ). Of the 41 suggestive QTL identified  16 QTL were significant at the chromosome-wide P < 0.01 level  and 25 were significant at the P < 0.05 level. Like the line-cross model  numerous linkage groups had multiple QTL mapping to them  with relatively conserved positions for the strongly phenotypically correlated traits. A genome-wide significant QTL for flesh colour mapped to Chr 26 (Figure )  where no QTL for other traits was detected  and on Chr 4 a genome-wide significant flesh colour QTL peak (Figure ) was 56 cM away from QTL peaks for length and weight. Together  the two genome-wide significant QTLs for flesh colour on Chr 26 and Chr 4 explained 24% of the phenotypic variance for this trait. Genome-wide significant and suggestive QTL were also detected for length  body weight and slaughter weight on Chr 10 (Figure ) and Chr 5 (Figure ). The number of parents showing statistically significant evidence for QTL segregation ranged from one to six (Table  and Additional File ). In most cases  95% QTL confidence intervals covered nearly the entire chromosome  however the flesh colour QTL interval on Chr 26 was much narrower (38-47 cM). All the genome-wide significant QTL mapped using the line-cross model were genome-wide or chromosome-wide significant (P < 0.01) under the half-sib model  with the exceptions of the QTL for flesh colour on Chr 6 and the QTL for length and body weight on Chr 5. Estimates for the amount of phenotypic variance explained by each QTL in the line-cross model were generally much lower than in the half-sib model: 12.6% vs. 3.7% for colour on Chr 26; 11.3% vs. 1.3% for colour on Chr 4; 6.2% vs. 1.4% for body weight on Chr 4; 4.8% vs. 2.3% for length on Chr 10. Numerous suggestive QTL were uniquely detected by both models (Tables  and ). This study used an F2 resource population to identify numerous significant and suggestive QTL for flesh colour  growth and body composition traits in Atlantic salmon. Using line-cross and half-sib regression analyses  genome-wide significant QTL for flesh colour were detected on Chr 6  Chr 26 and Chr 4. Assuming a heritability between 0.1 and 0.2 [    ]  these QTL could underlie a large portion of the genetic variance for the trait. Salmonids with access to astaxanthin containing diets accumulate carotenoids as they grow  and this accumulation in muscle continues till the fish approach sexual maturity []. The ratio of absorbed to non-absorbed carotenoid increases as the fish grows  and as a result  the concentration of fillet astaxanthin normally increases with increasing fish size  which is consistent with the strong positive correlation between fish size and flesh colour observed in this study. Consequently  a large proportion of the observed variance in flesh colour can be explained by body size  reducing the power of QTL detection for this trait. Despite this  highly significant QTL were detected for flesh colour after the inclusion of body weight as a covariate  indicating that there is measurable genetic variation present in this population. Relatively few QTL studies have been carried out on flesh colour traits in salmonids. Araneda et al. [] identified a dominant SCAR marker associated with colour in Coho salmon ()  and Houston et al. [] found suggestive evidence for QTL in Atlantic salmon on chromosomes 16  18 and 23. None of these QTL reached significance in our study  although chromosomes 18 and 23 reached near chromosome-wide significance. Given the relatively low number of independent loci identified in these studies  and the small number of genome-wide significant QTL found in our study  genetic control of flesh colour in salmonids may be explained by relatively few loci of large effect. However  further validation of the suggestive QTL may reveal that they contribute to a more polygenic effect. Dahl [] has reported that the juveniles of the Bleke strain remain in the rivers for two to four years until they reach a length of 12 cm  before migration into the Byglandsfjord  an oligotrophic lake with a poor invertebrate population and no forage fish. In the lake  the Bleke strain exhibits enhanced growth rates  while the maximum fish size generally does not exceed 30 cm and 250 g []. After having been landlocked for thousands of years  an adaptation to the poor growing conditions may explain the differences in growth observed between the Bleke and wild fish from the Vosso river. However  the Bleke strain exhibits enhanced growth when transferred to lakes with ample forage fish available []. This may suggest that environment rather than genetic effect is more responsible for poor growth. Indeed  ecological factors related to energetics and feeding are almost certainly largely responsible for the establishment of dwarfism in the population  as was documented for Lake Whitefish populations []. If this is the case  it represents an important deviation from the assumptions of an F2 population derived from different lines  which are typically under strong selection for particular traits (e.g. []). In addition  the trait variance observed in the F2 population  while large (CV = 48.2%  16% and 15.7% for body weight  total length and K-factor respectively)  was of comparable magnitude to other salmon mapping families (45.5%  17.8% and 9.7% for the same traits) [] and to outbred full-sib families in other species such as barramundi () (CV = 45.9%  16.4% and 8.1% for the same traits) []. In this study  genome-wide significant QTL for growth and body form traits were found on Chr 10 (BW  L  SW)  Chr 5 (BW  L  SW) and Chr 4 (BW  L  SW). Other studies have found evidence for QTL on Chr 4 [  ]  and QTL have been reported in Arctic charr on linkage groups homologous to Chr 4 and Chr 5 []. In addition  numerous linkage groups harbouring suggestive QTL for body weight  length and K-factor were replicated from previous studies. Nevertheless  the large number of different QTL reported for growth traits in Atlantic salmon  in particular body weight  suggests that these traits are highly polygenic (Table ). Another possible explanation for the different QTL reported for these traits is that different QTL may be segregating in the European and North American populations used in these studies. European and North American Atlantic salmon have been shown to be quite distinct from one another  with  estimates of 0.27 using microsatellites [  ] and 0.33 using allozymes (reviewed in []). Therefore it is quite likely that some QTL  such as those affecting body weight  segregate in one subgroup and not in the other. The detection of QTL for multiple traits on the same linkage groups (e.g. Chr 4) can be explained by either the linkage of two QTL (one for each trait)  or the presence of a single QTL with pleiotropic effects. Reid et al. [] detected QTL for both body weight and condition factor on five linkage groups in Atlantic salmon  and argued that they may represent different sets of genes due to low genetic correlations reported between the two traits previously. For the colour and 'growth' QTL detected on Chr 4 in this study  there is evidence to suggest that these are two separate QTL  given that the QTL peaks for colour and weight are some distance apart. However  the large  overlapping confidence intervals covering these QTL in both the line-cross and half-sib models means that further analyses will be needed to confirm this. Studies on genetic correlations between flesh colour and growth have been somewhat inconclusive in salmonids. Withler and Beacham [] have found a moderately positive genetic correlation between final body weight and flesh colour in Coho salmon  however it was not significantly different from zero (0.44 ± 0.48). Other studies have reported stronger evidence for positive genetic correlations between growth and colour in salmonids [  ]  indicating that the same sets of genes may be involved. An extremely large QTL for IPN resistance explaining nearly all the genetic variance for this trait has been identified on Chr 26 in Atlantic salmon []  mapping to a similar position to the flesh colour QTL in this study. Although there is little published evidence for a strong genetic correlation between flesh colour and IPN resistance  genotypes at the IPN QTL have been found to be positively correlated to flesh colour (T. Moen  pers. comm.). This suggests the possibility that extreme colour phenotypes represent individuals with alternate IPN QTL alleles due to an undocumented secondary effect of IPN infection on flesh colour. One hypothesis is that a non-lethal infection of a population with IPN could result in the more resistant fish processing or depositing pigment differently to the susceptible fish  resulting in downstream differences in flesh colour that can be explained by the IPN QTL genotype. Under the line-cross model  the QTL allele with a positive effect on the trait value (additive effect) almost exclusively originated from the commercial line for all traits. This is not surprising given that selection has been performed for a number of generations on growth and body composition traits in this population  while the Bleke population is a natural population subject to environmental selection influence alone. Although the genome-wide significant QTL were generally detected in both the line-cross and half-sib models  a large number of suggestive QTL were uniquely detected by each model. This is likely due to the underlying assumptions of the models. Mapping of QTL using F2 populations is very powerful when the assumption of QTL allele fixation in the founding lines holds true  and is quite robust to limited deviations from this ideal situation []. However  when there is a very large reduction of this contrast  the power of detecting the QTL using the line-cross model is substantially reduced []. In the extreme case where the lines do not differ with respect to the allele frequency  then the power will be equal to zero. The half-sib model is more general  with no assumption on the number and frequency of QTL alleles in the founder populations and is almost certainly more realistic for the population in this study  since both lines are outbred. In QTL studies performed in divergent pig populations and their crosses  it has been shown that even in these selected populations there is still a considerable amount of genetic variation at loci affecting traits of interest []. Other studies in salmonids have also indicated high levels of variability at QTL within strains. In a QTL mapping study for temperature tolerance in Arctic charr []  it was unexpectedly found that multiple QTL were detected in pure strain parents (Fraser River and Nauyuk Lake). It was hypothesized that  under the assumption that pure strains were almost fixed for alternate alleles  greater effects would have been detected in the male F1 hybrid parent due to segregation of QTL alleles. This was inferred because these strains descend from populations that are adapted to very different thermal regimes. The extent of QTL variability in the founding lines in our study is also apparent since the half-sib analysis shows that the QTL segregate in only a fraction of the F1 parents. For the flesh colour QTL on Chr 26 and Chr 4  the QTL appeared to be segregating in six and four parents respectively  out of 12 parents in total. For the rest of the suggestive QTL  the number of heterozygous parents ranged between two and four (out of eight for most linkage groups). Interestingly  only the sires appeared to be segregating for colour on Chr 4  which could be explained by the lack of male recombination enabling detection in the sires only  when the underlying variation is actually located some distance away from the nearest marker. One possible weakness of the across-family half-sib analysis as undertaken here is that low QTL heterozygosity in the parents reduces the power of detection []. The optimal solution to the analysis of this F2-type dataset could be a combined half-sib/line-cross model  as suggested by Kim et al. []. The estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the QTL under the line-cross model were substantially smaller than under the half-sib model (the largest QTL for flesh colour explained only 3.7% of the phenotypic variance in the line-cross model vs. 12.6% in the half-sib model). This is probably due to the fact that the F0 lines were outbred and therefore the estimated QTL effects were underestimated []. If in such a situation the data are analysed using a line-cross model  the estimated additive effect will be reduced by a fraction (p - p)  where p is the frequency in the H line and p is the frequency in the L line. Clearly  these results should be further validated with a denser marker map and additional families  since the QTL could only be mapped to relatively broad chromosomal regions. A relatively dense Atlantic salmon SNP chip  recently developed at the Centre for Integrative Genetics (CIGENE) in Norway in collaboration with international partners and containing 5000-7000 polymorphic SNP  may be a useful tool for this purpose. These SNP arrays offer much more efficient genotyping and scoring  and can be relatively inexpensive when coupled with methods such as selective DNA pooling [  ]. The increased marker density of this SNP array will not only help close the gaps that are present in the current linkage map  but may facilitate the use of linkage disequilibrium information to further fine-map QTL. Nevertheless  this study presents useful evidence for QTL of the important commercial and biological trait of flesh colour  and provides additional information on QTL for commercially important growth traits. There is of course a risk that QTL segregating in a resource population like that used in this study may not be found in commercial populations. However  if this should be the case  the QTL identified in the present study still contribute to a better understanding of the genetic control and biological mechanisms underlying the metabolism of dietary pigments in salmon  and the genetic architecture of growth traits in this species. A large number of significant and suggestive QTL for flesh colour and growth traits were found in an F2 cross between a landlocked and a commercial strain of Atlantic salmon. Chr 26 and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting flesh colour  while Chr 10  Chr 5 and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting growth traits (length and weight). These QTL could be strong candidates for use in marker-assisted selection and may provide further insight into the genetic control of flesh colour and growth traits in this species.

In general  our results show that it is possible to combine QTL detection and introgression even in outbred species.

With respect to the linkage drag and obligatory drag  the results of the combined detection and introgression scheme are very similar to those of traditional introgression schemes. In QTL mapping designs such as those using F2 or backcross animals  the power to detect QTL is based on the assumptions that all genes affecting the trait of interest are biallelic with alternative alleles fixed in each parental inbred line and that there is no genetic variation within the line. In some plant species and laboratory animals  highly inbred lines are available that may fulfil this condition  but many important species are outbreeders: such as livestock (e.g.  [])  trees (e.g.  [])  fish (e.g.  [])  as well as most wild species (e.g.  []). However  detecting a QTL is only the first step in genetic improvement programs. When a QTL with desirable characteristics is detected e.g. in wild or unimproved populations  it may be desirable to introgress it into the commercial population. One approach to shorten the time needed for introgression is to combine both  QTL identification and introgression  into a single step. This combines the strengths of fine mapping and backcrossing and paves the way for introgression of desirable but unknown QTL into recipient animal and plant lines []. Combining QTL identification and introgression corresponds to a continuous backcrossing scheme  where the information of the backcross generations is used to identify and map the QTL. Whilst previous work has shown the benefit of combining QTL mapping and gene introgression []  the method applied only to inbred lines has a major limitation. The objective of this study was to extend the approach of Yazdi et al. []. We will focus primarily upon instances where the recipient line does not carry the favourable QTL allele  since otherwise a marker assisted selection scheme can be used (e.g. []). The effectiveness of this method was investigated through computer simulation considering two outbred lines  in which QTL alleles were segregating and polygenic effects were included. In this study  we simulated individuals with a genome consisting of one 100 cM chromosome and including a polygenic effect  i.e. assuming many genes each with a small effect. The polygenic effect was assumed to be independent from the QTL effect within lines but in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL effect between lines. The chromosome carried a single QTL with a major effect on the trait of interest located at 84.5 cM from the beginning of the chromosome  and it included 101 anonymous markers  positioned at the ends and at 1 cM intervals along the chromosome. The QTL was positioned so that it was neither around the chromosome's centre or ends nor located at a marker position. Positions at the chromosome's centre and ends were avoided respectively because QTL mapping methods can show a bias towards the centre of the considered segment [] and because an end location would result in truncated likelihood peaks which are unsatisfactory for assessing the procedures proposed. Each locus  either QTL or marker  was assumed to be biallelic with additive gene effects for the QTL and no effects for the markers. Two founder outbred lines were considered: a donor line containing a favourable QTL allele with a high frequency and a recipient line considered to be highly desirable for other traits. Throughout this report  subscripts'd' and 'r' represent donor and recipient lines  respectively. For the donor line  marker loci and QTL were both assumed to be biallelic with alleles  M or m for markers  Q or q for QTL  where M and Q are the major alleles  and where Q is the favourable allele at the QTL locus. The allelic frequency in the donor line () was varied as described later. When markers and QTL segregated within lines  they were considered to be in pair-wise linkage equilibrium  which is a conservative assumption since there is no population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) contributing information. Within the recipient line the QTL was considered to be fixed for the minor allele. In another set of scenarios  the recipient line was considered complementary to the donor line for the frequencies of the QTL alleles; for example  if the major allele had a frequency of 0.9 in the donor line  its frequency was () = 1 - () = 0.1 in the recipient line (see Table ). Therefore  when  () = 0.5  there is no difference in QTL allele frequencies between lines. The outbred recipient and donor lines were simulated using Monte Carlo simulation. In the base population  two QTL alleles were randomly sampled for each animal. In addition to the effect of the major QTL  the recipient and donor lines were assumed to have developed over generations from a common base generation with a genetic variance . The genetic variance within both lines () was derived from the common base population (see Appendix). The difference between the two lines for the trait of interest was considered to be 1unit in favour of the donor  and was assumed to be due to genetic drift. This genetic difference ignored the QTL and the markers which were assumed to be mutations having occurred later. Introgression was carried out by crossing the outbred lines to produce an F1 generation  and then by recurrent backcrossing of the selected individuals from the crossbred population to the recipient line  to produce generations BC  BC  BC and BC. In this study  BC was the last backcross generation considered. All generations were discrete and consisted of N individuals. In this population structure  recurrent parents come from the recipient line  and non-recurrent parents are the selected F1  BC  BC and BC individuals. In each generation  selection was based on the probability that the candidate is heterozygous for the QTL  conditional on the marker information. Individuals were selected if the probability of being heterozygous exceeded a predetermined threshold value of 0.95. As a consequence  a variable number of candidates was selected and given an opportunity to breed. The calculation of this selection criterion will be described in the QTL mapping section. Mating took place randomly to reproduce  offspring (1/2  males  1/2  females). For each offspring  a sire and dam were chosen at random from among the selected ones. In each generation  crossing-over events were generated according to Haldane's [] mapping function. A gamete passing from a parent to an offspring had an equal chance of carrying the paternal or maternal chromosome sequence and if a recombination occurred the reading sequence switched to the alternative parental chromosome. The polygenic value of the offspring was calculated as: Where a is the Mendelian sampling term for the offspring and was randomly sampled from a Normal distribution of mean 0 and variance   where t denotes the generation. Due to crossing of lines  the magnitude of  will vary and the approach to calculate  is given in the Appendix. The values obtained are: A phenotypic record for each individual was simulated based on the following model: Where is the phenotypic value of the i individual ( = 1 ... )   is the population mean  g is the mean difference between donor and recipient lines  is the donor line contribution to individual i for the polygenic effect which decreases from 1/2 to 0 from F onwards  is the animal's polygenic effect obtained as described above  is an indicator variable which takes the value 1 when carrying the favourable QTL allele and otherwise is 0   is the allele substitution effect of the favourable QTL allele  and is a random normal variable with mean 0.0 and variance . The QTL effect was assumed additive  but this assumption can be relaxed (see Yazdi et al.  2008 []). The single interval mapping regression model [] was applied for QTL mapping. In this model  one marker interval at a time was used to construct a putative QTL likelihood at the midpoint location of the interval. For each generation in the backcross program  using marker information for individual i and interval j  denoted by   with the phenotypic value y of the recorded trait  a mixed model for a putative QTL at the interval's midpoint was fitted. From generation BC1 onward  all the accumulated phenotypes from the previous generations were used in the model to estimate the QTL locations and effects. Therefore the following model was used for each interval in each generation: Where  is a vector of observations in the backcross generation t for t = 1 ... 4   is the overall mean; <U+03B3> is a vector of generation effects for average genetic merit   is fixed effect of favourable QTL allele;  is a vector of animal polygenic values   is a vector of residual effects;  is the matrix of additive genetic relationships among animals assuming that the recipient and donor lines were unrelated;  is a vector with each element 1   is a design matrix for effect of generation   is a vector of probabilities of the QTL genotypes p(|) conditional on marker genotypes and position of the flanking markers  described in more detail below. The  is an incidence matrix that assigns the animal's effects to the vector of observations. The probability of the QTL genotype p(|) was calculated based on the marker genotype of the individual and its non-recurrent (backcross) parent at flanking markers in each interval  assuming that marker phases are known. Calculation of p(|) was based on the recombination fractions  and  between the QTL and the heterozygous flanking markers of the non-recurrent parent []. If a marker locus of the non-recurrent parent was non-informative then the interval was expanded until the next heterozygous marker locus []. Heterozygous markers of non-recurrent parents were assumed informative  through the combination of known marker phases and closely linked flanking markers  so that the recurrent or non-recurrent grand-parent of both alleles could be inferred. However  the value of p(|) was not conditioned on the phenotypes in the population  so once calculated  the p(|) remains constant over generations for each QTL position. The markers information was used to trace the line of origin  and hence the QTL genotype was based on this information. As developed in the discussion  it is possible to improve the calculation of the probability of heterozygous parents by including phenotypic information; hence relying only on identification of the original line is a conservative assumption. Parameters were estimated using the average information algorithm for restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML) included in the DMU-package of Madsen and Jensen []. The convergence criterion was chosen so that the norm of the update vector for the (co)variance components was less than 10-. The interval with the highest maximized likelihood values was taken as the estimated location of the QTL  and the estimate of effect  for this interval was taken as the estimate of the QTL allele substitution effect. The selection criterion for selecting carrier () parents was the probability that the individual carries the favourable donor allele at the estimated QTL locations given the marker information. Individuals that were heterozygous at the estimated QTL location with a probability (|) = 0.95 were selected  where  is the estimated location of the QTL with the highest probability across all intervals. Hence there was a possibility that some non-carrier parents were selected erroneously. However  no attempt was made to remove these errors. In this study  two different values of N (500 or 1000)  four frequencies of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line (1.0  0.90  0.75 or 0.50)  and three heritability values ( = 0.50  0.31 or 0.17) were considered. For one set of scenarios with all four values of  ()  the recipient line was assumed to be fixed for all m and q alleles. In these scenarios  (= ()  although as stated above  marker loci and QTL were in pair-wise linkage equilibrium. In another set  allele Q was considered as segregating in the recipient line  with () = 1 - () with () = 0.90 or 0.75. Marker loci in the recipient and donor lines were segregating with () = () = () as described above. Three different sizes of the QTL effect were considered: a = 2.23  1.48  and 1.02  where a is the allele substitution effect of the QTL. If the allele frequency in the donor line was 1  this generated a genetic variance due to the QTL of 1.24  0.548  and 0.260  respectively  and the polygenic variance was assumed three times bigger than the QTL variance  i.e. 3.713  1.65 and 0.782. If heritability is defined as the sum of the QTL and polygenic variances divided by this same sum plus the environmental variance  then the heritability values are 0.50  0.31 and 0.17  respectively. Although we will differentiate between the schemes by referring to these heritability values  it should be noted that the actual heritability in any one generation may differ from these heritability values due to (i) differences in allele frequencies at the QTL alleles and (ii) changes in the Mendelian sampling variance as described in the Appendix. Simulations were replicated 100 times. For each replicate  the efficiency of selection  the donor genome contribution and the linkage and obligatory drags at BC1 and BC4 were calculated from direct examination of the marker sequence along the genome of individuals with respect to the estimated QTL location []. The efficiency of selection is calculated as the ratio of the number of selected individuals that are heterozygous for the actual QTL to the total number of selected individuals. The donor genome contribution is the fraction of the backcross genome that derives from the donor genome. The linkage drag is the average length of the intact segment of the donor genome flanking the QTL  whereas the obligatory drag is the minimum segment length of the donor genome to the left and to the right of the QTL across the whole population  which represents the part of the donor genome that cannot be removed from an intercross formed from the final generation. Frequencies of QTL alleles and genotypes of individuals in the base outbred lines and their backcross (BC) generations are presented in Table  for all studied cases. Since the frequencies of genetic markers were the same as those of the QTL in the donor line  they are not shown. Heterozygous individuals for which the favourable QTL allele originated from the donor line    are informative in the sense that they contribute to the accuracy of the QTL mapping as formulated. As the frequency of the favourable allele in the donor line decreases from 1  the proportion of individuals with the informative genotype is reduced (column 4 in Table ). In Tables  and   results are presented for 12 different scenarios  where Q is segregating at one of four frequencies in the donor line (() = 1.0  0.90  0.75 and 0.50) and is not segregating (() = 0.0) in the recipient line and where three heritability values ( = 0.50  0.31 or 0.17) are considered. The estimates of the QTL allele substitution effect () were comparable to the true values when the favourable QTL allele was fixed  () = 1.0 in the donor line (Table ). However  estimates of QTL allele substitution effects were underestimated as the frequency of favourable QTL allele decreased from 1 in the donor line. For example  when () = 5.0  only 50% of the F1 individuals carried the favourable QTL allele from the donor line when it was heterozygous for linked markers because of the linkage equilibrium assumed in the simulated data. Based on the selection criteria  only 50% of the selected parents were truly heterozygous for the QTL while the remaining were falsely assumed to be heterozygous  and consequently the estimate of  was about 50% of the true values. In general  when the frequency of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line decreases  which corresponds to a decreasing effect of the donor chromosome segment  the estimate of  is also reduced. There was no evidence of an association between this bias and the heritability. The estimate for the QTL location in most scenarios was close to the true interval (85) in both BC1 and BC4 generations (Table ). When the frequency of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line was 0.5 with the lowest heritability values  the estimates of the QTL location were biased (i.e. at  = 1.02 at and BC1). The direction of the bias for QTL location is towards the centre of the chromosome as is expected when the QTL location is not estimated accurately []. The standard error of the QTL location increased slightly as the frequency of the favourable QTL allele decreased in the donor line together with decreasing heritability. However  the range of location estimates depends on the frequency of the favourable QTL in the donor line. For instance  when () = 1.0 location estimates ranged between intervals 84 and 86  while when () = 0.5 they ranged between intervals 62 and 98. The efficiency of selection in BC1 and BC4 generations was lower if the frequency of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line was reduced (Table )  which is directly linked to the frequency of informative individuals in Table . This decreasing efficiency of selection partially explains the underestimates of   because the method estimated the average effects of the QTL allele coming from the donor line  which is underestimated if the donor line has a low frequency of the favourable QTL allele. Comparing BC1 and BC4  efficiencies of selection across generations were very similar. In general  the accuracy of the estimates of efficiency of selection was high and the replication error was very low. It should be noted that the efficiency of selection also reflects the reduced number of selected animals. The estimated polygenic variances (Table ) were overestimated when the QTL effect was underestimated  i.e. it picked up the generic variance that was not explained by fitting the QTL. The genome contribution of the donor line after four backcross generations ranged from 41.5 to 44.2 cM across the different QTL allele frequencies in the donor line and the different QTL allele substitution effects. Since the genome was 100 cM long  all values in cM can be considered as proportional. It should be noted that there was no background selection in this study. Likewise linkage drag was also reasonably consistent across scenarios  ranging from 36.2 to 38.7 cM across all scenarios. Although there was no significant difference between linkage drags across the different heritabilities and frequencies of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line  there was a trend for a lower linkage drag when the frequency of the favourable QTL allele in the donor was reduced. The obligatory drag ranged from 2.1 to 2.3 cM with a slight increasing trend in conjunction with a lower frequency of the favourable allele in the donor line. The standard error of the obligatory drag was very low and similar across the different frequencies of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line and the different QTL allele substitution effects. The number of selected individuals was under 50% but usually close to this value  which is the upper bound of our expectation because only 50% of the animals are heterozygous. As the frequency of the favourable allele in the donor line decreases  the number of non-informative individuals increases (Table ). The estimated residual variance was close to the true value () and did not deviate significantly ( = 0.05) from the true value in all scenarios. Results for the 12 different scenarios (four values of () for each of three  values)  when N = 500 correspond to those in Tables  and   are not shown since there was a very similar pattern of estimation properties. Decreasing N resulted in greater underestimation of parameters when () decreased. The magnitudes of donor genome contributions and linkage drags for N = 500 were greater than for N = 1000 due to the lower number of recombinations occurring. The size of the total donor genome and linkage drag that remained over the generations when the frequency of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line was 0.9   = 1.48 and N = 1000 is illustrated in Figure . The total donor genome was ~77 cM long in BC and decreased to ~42 cM in BC. The linkage drag also decreased from ~71 in BC to ~37 cM in BC. Hence  as expected  the trend decreased over generations. Results of these parameters in the other scenarios were similar. . In order to investigate the effects of variable frequencies of the favourable QTL allele in the recipient line  scenarios in which Q is segregating in the recipient line are presented in Table . Results are presented only for two different frequencies (0.10 and 0.25) of the favourable QTL allele in the recipient line and three heritability values and two population sizes. Here () = 1.0 - () can be compared to Table  where () was 0 with the same (). The degree of underestimation of  was more severe. This was associated with greater bias in the estimate of the QTL location  which was more towards the centre of the chromosome as compared to the results for BC1 in Table . This was in part due to the identification of Q homozygotes with genotype as carriers for which the markers had no true information on position. The efficiency of selection is comparable to the results in Table . The QTL mapping and gene introgression approach is extended here to outbred populations  where it is assumed that the QTL allele frequencies may vary in both recipient and donor lines and where the polygenic effects are included in order to model the background genes. The process was qualitatively successful in detecting the QTL and integrating it progressively into a recipient line over several generations of backcrossing  although quantitatively the process resulted in underestimation of the allelic substitution effect ()  unless the favourable QTL allele in the donor line was nearly fixed  i.e. () and correspondingly absent in the recipient line. Analysis of the results shown in Tables  and  indicates that this underestimation is proportional to the difference in allelic frequency -. For instance  in Table  when the frequency of the favourable QTL allele in the donor line is 0.75 and the recipient line has no Q alleles  the estimates of  are about 75% of the true values. In Table   when the frequency of the Q is 0.25 in the recipient line  the estimates of  are about 50% of the true values. This underestimation is in agreement with previous reports [] on the detection and estimation of QTL in outbred lines. The estimate of  reflects the difference in genetic value between the introgressed chromosome segment of the donor line and that of the recipient line. Hence   gives an unbiased estimate of the value of the introgressed donor segment  rather than the QTL  and this may be smaller than the QTL effect if the donor segment does not always carry the positive QTL allele or if the recipient segment already carries the positive QTL allele. This arises as a result of the mapping method which is concerned solely with the identification of the line of origin from the marker alleles. In these models  complementarity of allelic frequencies was assumed  thus although a conservative assumption of linkage equilibrium was made within each line  LD between the QTL and markers would still occur in the F1 due to a difference in allele frequency between the lines  but would decline to 0 when the frequencies approach 0.5 within each line. However  there are two reasons to assume that the combined detection and introgression procedure could be used mainly when there is substantial LD in the F1 cross. Firstly it may be assumed that the marker density of maps might be sufficient to generate haplotypes predictive of the line's origin not only in the immediate vicinity of the marker locus  but also in the region spanning the marker loci. Secondly it might be expected that the more valuable recipient line would have been screened to identify QTL for the trait of interest that may have been segregating within it  before beginning the costly process of introgression  thus it is possible that the frequency of the donor line QTL is low only within the recipient line. Taken together  these arguments suggest that the simulation's assumptions of strong LD between QTL and markers might be a likely outcome in application. When QTL are mapped in outbred populations  it is important to account for background genes  which are modelled as polygenic effects here  because the background genes may cause spurious associations between the markers and the trait (see Meuwissen and Goddard []  for a review). Including a polygenic effect in the model  reduces spurious associations substantially  but does not guarantee that they do not occur. Therefore  here and in any other application of QTL mapping in outbred populations  one needs to remain aware that spurious associations may occur. However  the results suggest that spurious associations are less of a problem in the combined QTL detection and introgression schemes than in the standard QTL mapping in outbred populations schemes  because the LD generated by crossbreeding will probably overwhelm spurious associations [–]. In this study  the methodology used for QTL detection was very straightforward and conservative in the way the information was used  but it could be made more sophisticated. For example  lack of fixation at the QTL locus within either recipient or donor line could be included within the model []. The latter requires that the probability of the QTL genotype being is estimated not only from the marker data but also from the phenotypes. Conditional on the marker genotype  the data analysis then becomes a question of fitting a mixture model (one component distribution for each possible QTL genotype). This is a complicated model  especially since the polygenic effects need to be fitted simultaneously  but MCMC methods may be able to fit such a model. Furthermore  within-population LD between markers and QTL may be used to improve the estimates of QTL genotype probabilities []. If it is assumed that the donor and recipient populations are derived from a common ancestral population  across-population LD may be used to further improve the mapping precision. Therefore  although the result showed that mapping precision was quite good  even without using these additional sources of information  the use of more sophisticated methods may remove the biases observed in this study when estimating QTL effect and location. The risks of carrying out such a combined QTL detection and introgression scheme will lie in false positive QTL and in location errors. The first risk may be controlled by setting high significance thresholds before accepting the presence of a QTL; given the cost of the process it seems sensible to set stringent thresholds. Concerning the second risk  inaccurate localization problems may be addressed by using quite wide confidence intervals for the QTL  i.e. introgressing a chromosome region most certainly carrying the QTL  although this will increase the linkage drag and the obligate drag. Another localization problem that may arise is the localization of a ghost QTL [  ]  i.e. a QTL peak that occurs in between two real QTL as the result of the joint effect of the two linked QTL. Improving the mapping precision  e.g. by including LD information  may reveal that there are actually two QTL underlying the original QTL signal. In practice  there may still be a problem resulting from spurious associations arising from  say  LD over long distances leading to erroneous localization of the QTL. Such problems are more likely to occur with populations with a historically low effective size. Therefore  combined QTL mapping and introgression might be suitable for introgression of genes from wild ancestors in  say  sylvicultural or aquacultural settings. In agricultural species  a lower may demand more care. Nevertheless  our results show that nothing prevents combining detection and introgression even in outbred species. As stated in Yazdi [] such a process is often thought of as two steps thus making it longer and more costly. However  using the combined process  it is possible to save at least one generation. As discussed by Yazdi []  with respect to the linkage drag and obligatory drag  the combined detection and introgression scheme and the traditional introgression schemes give very similar results. It is assumed that recipient and donor lines have drifted independently from a base population with variance . By the time of introgression  variance within each line is   and the observed squared difference in means (- ) is also  i.e. 1 genetic s.d. within each line. Then  assuming both lines have an accumulated inbreeding coefficient of F since the base populations  equating expectations: since it is assumed the difference is a result of drift. On the right hand side  (  ) = 0  and . Furthermore . Therefore: to give F = 0.2. Therefore where the observed result for the squared difference would have been 'just as expected' occurs when F = 0.2  which gives  The Mendelian sampling variance of an offspring within this framework is given by The F1 offspring have F = 0.0  but F = F = 0.2 since they come from within the recipient and donor lines and have accumulated inbreeding  . For BC1  the offspring has 1/2 chance of receiving two randomly selected recipient alleles with a probability of identity by descent (IBD) of 0.2  and 1/2 chance of receiving one recipient and one donor allele with a probability 0 of being IBD  so the offspring has F = 0.1. It has one parent with F = 0.0 and the other with F = 0.2  to give For BC2  for a locus unlinked to that being introgressed  the offspring has probability ¾ of receiving two randomly selected recipient line alleles with a probability of identity by descent (IBD) of 0.2  and probability 1/4 of receiving one recipient and one donor line allele with probability 0 being IBD  so the offspring has F = 0.15. It has one parent with F = 0.1 and the other with F = 0.2  to give This sequence continues for BC3 and BC4 analogously  and the offspring have inbreeding coefficients of 0.175 and 0.1875 respectively  and  and  Andersson L  Georges M: Domestic animal genomics: deciphering the genetics of complex traits.

However the probability of detecting AS cases in flocks participating in genetic breeding programme against CS should be considered. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a zoonotic transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)  which may have spread to sheep and goat populations. This situation has prompted European countries to organise control and surveillance of TSEs in small ruminants in which BSE cannot be clinically distinguished from scrapie. In sheep  genetic susceptibility to classical scrapie (CS) is supported by polymorphic variations at codons 136  154 and 171 of the PRNP gene  which encodes the normal cellular protein prion (PrP) []. The main alleles defined by these three codons can be classified by increasing risk as follows ARR < AHQ < ARQ ˜ ARH < VRQ []. This knowledge has made it possible to implement eradication programmes throughout Europe based on positive selection of the most resistant allele (ARR) and negative selection of the most susceptible one (VRQ) [  ]. Recently  an atypical form of scrapie (AS) has been detected and has challenged such programmes since animals genetically resistant to CS are affected [–]. However  although it is generally accepted that CS is an infectious and contagious disease []  the contagiousness of AS is questioned. Indeed  the marker specific for AS disease is not detected outside the central nervous system [  –]  even in cases where AS has been experimentally transmitted to transgenic mice [] and sheep []. Furthermore  most AS cases have been observed in animals with genotypes showing low susceptibility to CS. Several studies have shown that AS susceptibility is highly associated with PrP codons 141 (L/F) and 154 (R/H) [  ]. It is important to note that AS cases have been detected in ALRR carriers but rarely in VLRQ carriers. A descriptive study has reported that the estimation of AS prevalence in Europe is similar  whatever the country or tested population and amounts to about 6 cases per 10 000 tests. Conversely  CS prevalence appears to be heterogeneous both between countries and  within countries  between fallen stock and healthy slaughter []. This could hide a relatively high prevalence of AS in the most susceptible genotypes. In addition  estimation of the prevalence of AS in ALRR-ALRR animals is strategically important to assess the impact of current breeding programmes on the AS prevalence in the general population. In France  breeders of flocks participating in breeding programmes for CS resistance are encouraged to join in a voluntary scrapie certification scheme  for which it is also compulsory to send animals to breed selection centres (Internal circular from French Ministry of Agriculture  DGAL/SDSPA/N2006-8093). This certification scheme implies testing all fallen stock over 18 months  which increases the risk of detecting AS cases in these flocks compared to general flocks. We have carried out a case control study by using data from the TSEs surveillance programme to estimate the risk of AS associated with the PrP genotypes in the French sheep population and to compare it with the risk of CS. In addition  we have used our dataset to estimate the prevalence of AS per genotype and the risk for a fully CS resistant flock (100% ALRR-ALRR) to be detected positive for AS under certain assumptions. Cases were recruited among the animals tested for TSEs in France from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2007. Each year since 2002  a number of adult (over 18 months old) sheep from unknown TSE status flocks was randomly selected for TSE detection at abattoirs (healthy slaughter) or at rendering plants (fallen stock). Details concerning the French active surveillance programme are described in Cazeau []. Between 2002 and 2007  859 157 samples were analysed within this programme  among which 532 500 were tested with the recommended tests for AS detection [  ]. All positive samples were confirmed and typed by the National reference laboratory for animal TSEs of AFSSA Lyon using EU approved reference methods []. For all positive cases the presence of BSE was dismissed by discriminatory tests; the cases detected with the tests recommended for AS were typed in order to classify them as AS or CS; other positive cases were assumed to be CS. During that period  404 cases of AS and 395 cases of CS were confirmed. Among these cases  DNA was available or could be extracted from the central nervous system samples kept at AFSSA Lyon for respectively 248 AS and 245 CS cases. During that period  the PrP genotype of all cases was routinely determined  when suitable samples were available  at codons 136  154 and 171 with a technique that could not differentiate ARH and ARQ alleles. Further analyses were conducted to specify alleles at position 141 and 171 by the Taq man method [  ]. It is generally agreed that this method provides accurate  reproducible and reliable results. For example  in human large-scale association studies  the error rate is estimated to be less than 0.3% [] or even 0.05% []. These analyses were conducted by the National reference laboratory for PRNP genotyping (Labogena  Jouy-en-Josas  France) which is certified for this test by the French standard COFRAC (NF EN ISO/CEI . PrP polymorphisms at codons 136  141  154 and 171 of the 248 AS cases were analysed after direct sequencing of the coding region of the PRP gene encompassing codons 92-282. These analyses were conducted by INRA (Jouy-en-Josas  France). For more details concerning primers and sequencing see []. Controls were recruited among animals that were tested for the presence of TSEs with a negative result. Controls for AS were animals tested with one of the tests recommended for the detection of AS and controls for CS were animals tested with any rapid test. As a legal requirement []  during the TSE active surveillance programme 2002-2007  a subset of 3 347 animals was randomly selected for PrP genotyping. We used this sample as genotype controls. The genotyping of this control dataset was conducted by Labogena at codons 136  154 and 171 with the limits specified before (missing information for codons 141 and 171). No significant difference of PrP frequencies at codons 136  154 and 171 was observed between the present control dataset and estimates from an external data set of the general French ovine population []. In addition  distributions in both datasets were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For these two reasons  we inferred F141 and H171 information from the external data set to our control data set. In order to take into account a possible uncertainty on the estimation of F141 and H171 in the external dataset  we considered that the estimated values for F141 and H171 were random variables with beta-multinomial distributions with means and variances equalling those estimated from the external dataset. Finally  we took into account that uncertainty in the inference process by bootstrapping 1 000 times the control dataset. In order to adjust for potential confounding variables  we collected information on the stream of surveillance (healthy slaughter/fallen stock) and the dentition of the animals (2-4 definitive incisors (DI)/5-7 DI/8 DI) which is a poor proxy for age [] but was the only information available. This led to exclude some animals for which information was missing (two cases of CS and nine controls). For each type of scrapie  we fitted multivariate logistic regression models to assess the risk associated to genotypes with ALRQ-ALRQ as the baseline category  because this genotype is assumed to be the ancestral genotype. We adjusted the models on the surveillance stream with healthy slaughter as the baseline category  and on dentition  with the class corresponding to the youngest animals as the baseline category. The model outputs were odds ratio (OR) which can be interpreted as an approximation of the relative risk in the context of rare diseases. We could not estimate OR associated with the genotypes in which no case was detected. The value of the OR and their 95% confidence intervals for the 1 000 datasets were computed using the Rubin method []. We estimated the prevalence of AS for each genotype. Because the proportion of animals genotyped was different for cases and controls  we defined it as the national prevalence (404/532 500 for AS) times the proportion of the genotype among cases  divided by the frequency of the genotype in the general population. Using a Bayesian approach  we considered that each of these proportions followed a beta distribution with mean and variance estimated by the observations. We derived the median and the 95% credibility interval of prevalences based on 2 000 iterations obtained after convergence. We have considered the risk for a fully ALRR-ALRR flock to be detected positive for AS. We assumed that in any flock the individual risk of AS depended only on the genotype  the age and the surveillance stream. Considering that the animals tested from a given flock had the same distribution of age and surveillance stream as the general population  the average individual risk for an ALRR-ALRR animal could be estimated by the prevalence previously estimated for this genotype. Since the occurrence of AS in a flock was defined as an independent event  the number of cases in a flock  X  followed a binomial distribution. The probability for at least one animal being AS positive among  animals tested was: Using the previous methods to estimate the prevalence per genotype  we derived the median of the probability and its 95% credibility interval for n varying from 1 to 1 000  based on 2 000 iterations obtained after convergence. All the statistical analyses were done with R for Windows [] and Winbugs []. After exclusion of missing information on genotypes and dentition  248 AS cases  245 CS cases and 3 317 controls were used to estimate OR and prevalence (Table ). Cases of CS and/or AS were detected in all genotypes. There were no AS cases among the ALRR-VLRQ  ALRQ-ALRH  ALRQ-VLRQ  and VLRQ-VLRQ genotypes. The ALHQ-ALHQ  AFRQ-ALHQ and AFRQ-AFRQ genotypes were associated with the highest risks of AS compared to ALRQ-ALRQ. Within CS cases  the VLRQ-VLRQ animals presented the highest risk compared to ALRQ-ALRQ. ALRR carriers and to a lesser extent ALHQ carriers were the most resistant to CS. The AS prevalence estimates for the most susceptible genotypes (AFRQ/ALHQ  ALHQ/ALHQ and AFRQ/AFRQ) were respectively 11  25 and 31 times higher than the prevalence for the general population (Table ). The AS prevalence estimate for ALRR-ALRR animals was not significantly different from that in the general population. The animals tested at fallen stock were significantly more at risk for CS but not for AS. Adjustment on the dentition of the animals improved the fit of the model for AS (log-likelihood ratio test of models with and without dentition: p-value <0.003)  the oldest animals were more at risk but OR was not significantly different from 1 at 5%. However  this could be due to a lack of power since comparison with the intermediate category showed that the OR associated with the oldest category was significantly different from 1. For CS there was no observed effect of age. The probability for a 100% ALRR-ALRR flock to be detected as positive for AS was not negligible when 100 animals were tested (Figure ). For instance  a flock with a constant size of 400 ALRR-ALRR adult ewes and an adult mortality rate of 5% would have 200 animals tested over a 10 year-period of time. Under these conditions  the cumulative probability over 10 years to detect at least one AS case out of 200 animals tested for TSEs would be 10%. . Plain line: median of probability  dashed lines: 95% credibility interval of probabilty This study was aimed at estimating the genetic risk for AS in French sheep and potential consequences of the current breeding programme for the ARR allele on the risk of atypical scrapie. The analysis was conducted on a sheep population submitted to TSE active surveillance and we have considered the ancestral genotype ALRQ-ALRQ as the baseline reference. Our results were congruent with those from other studies either regarding ranking AS susceptibility [      ] or AS genotype specific prevalence []. We detected a significant risk of AS for sheep carrying the ALRR-ALRR genotype. The risk and prevalence of AS for AFRQ-AFRQ  AFRQ-ALHQ and ALHQ-ALHQ genotypes were the highest. Besides  AFRQ-AFRQ and ALHQ-ALHQ homozygotes had a much higher risk than AFRQ-ALRQ and ALHQ-ALRQ heterozygotes which is not indicative of a dominant effect. The effect of the VLRQ allele towards AS was not obvious. No or very few cases of AS have been detected among VLRQ carriers  depending on the other allele  but VLRQ carriers are also relatively rare. So the apparent protective effect cannot be properly confirmed and such an effect would need to be assessed through a larger study  at the European scale for example. Our estimations were based on a control dataset and a case dataset both originating from the population submitted to TSE active surveillance which is representative of adult animals collected at rendering plants or slaughtered for human consumption. Both datasets were randomly selected and we did not identify any selection bias linked with the exclusion of missing data within case and control datasets. A strong assumption to establish such an estimation is that population and risk are homogenously distributed. In France  this assumption appears to be verified for AS but not for CS for which an important spatial heterogeneity is observed [  ]. This could be due to differential exposure to CS infectious agent and/or different strains of CS having different behaviours in terms of genetic susceptibility [  ]. For this reason  we have decided not to present genotype specific prevalence for CS. Matching cases and controls could have been an option. However that was not possible in our design  which used the subjects retrospectively selected in compulsory TSE active surveillance. Our knowledge of the general French sheep population genotype structure was based on an extensive survey for the codons 136  154 and 171 but it was based on an unbiased but much smaller sample for the codon 141. We took into account that difference of accuracy and the resulting uncertainty by bootstrapping the control dataset  which eventually increased the robustness of our results. The maintenance of the polymorphism of the PRNP gene raises question. This could be explained by an absence of selection due to the late onset of clinical signs in the life of farm animals. Alternatively  it could be maintained by a balancing selection process [  ]. The weak associations between PrP alleles and the production performances or health traits found so far [] would hardly contribute to this selection. However  recent results have shown the selective advantages of susceptible PrP alleles on survival traits or on physical breed characteristics [  ]. Another explanation may be found in heterozygous advantage and/or frequency dependency. The frequency dependent selection is supported by the differences of genetic susceptibility associated to PrP alleles towards the numerous strains of scrapie that prevail in the different subpopulations. This diversity includes AS and the many strains of CS []. There is also a possible advantage of heterozygous compared to homozygous individuals  specific to AS and suggested by the lower risk for AFRQ-ALHQ animals compared to ALHQ or AFRQ homozygous animals found in our study and in Great Britain []. The susceptibility to AS conferred by the ALRR allele questions the long term consequences of the breeding programme for CS resistance on AS prevalence in the sheep population and particularly in the flocks deeply engaged in this programme. The AS prevalence estimated for the ALRR-ALRR subpopulation (0.60‰  CI95%: 0.45-0.78) was not significantly different from the current average national prevalence (0.76‰  CI95%: 0.69-0.83). Therefore in standing conditions and assuming AS occurrence is not dependent on infectious exposure  increasing frequency of the ALRR allele in the general population should not result in an increase of the global AS prevalence in the sheep population. Despite the low prevalence of AS in ALRR-ALRR animals  the probability of detecting a positive case is not negligible when the number of animals tested increases as shown by Figure . Farms fully engaged in ALRR-ALRR selection tend to test more animals due to their participation in the scrapie certification scheme  thus the probability to detect AS in their flock should be considered. The consequence is that they face a risk of being placed under inadequate control measures. The assumption of a common risk of AS in farms is supported by the homogenous distribution of the disease and similarities of prevalence per genotype in France and in Europe [    ]. This is partly challenged by the existence of some potential risk factors  such as mineral feeding [  ]. However  in a recent case-control study  the farm level risk factors were much less important than the genetic factors []. Actually a number of studies argue for the hypothesis that AS could develop in the absence of exposure to an infectious agent [  –  ]  even if a doubt persists given the limited knowledge on the physiopathology of AS. Genotype appears as a very strong component for risk of AS and possibly age too. To have a better understanding of their respective impact on the development of the disease it would be useful to study the age-genotype interactions. This would especially help to assess age-specific penetrance of the different genotypes and to have an insight on the survival of animals with very susceptible genotypes. Unfortunately to carry out such assessments  more detailed data on age of cases and control populations and larger populations are required. Careful monitoring of AS positive flocks as planned by new European approaches on the control of AS could help address this issue in the future []. Finally  AS occurrence appears to be heavily dependent on the PrP genotype  possibly modulated by some environmental risk factors which are to be further explored. Even if the open reading frame of the PRNP gene has a strong influence on the occurrence of AS it might not be the unique genetic factor of susceptibility. Other regions of the PRNP or other genes could be involved either independently or in synergy and this hypothesis is also worth to be investigated.

By rescaling the time axis from continuous to several discrete classes  grouped survival data (discrete survival time) models can be used instead.MethodsThe productive life length of 12319 Large White and 9833 Landrace sows was analyzed with continuous scale and grouped data models. Random effect of herd*year  fixed effects of interaction between parity and relative number of piglets  age at first farrowing and annual herd size change were included in the analysis. The genetic component was estimated from sire  sire-maternal grandsire  sire-dam  sire-maternal grandsire and animal models  and the heritabilities computed for each model type in both breeds.ResultsIf age at first farrowing was under 43 weeks or above 60 weeks  the risk of culling sows increased. An interaction between parity and relative litter size was observed  expressed by limited culling during first parity and severe risk increase of culling sows having small litters later in life.

By rescaling the time axis from continuous to several discrete classes  grouped survival data (discrete survival time) models can be used instead. The productive life length of 12319 Large White and 9833 Landrace sows was analyzed with continuous scale and grouped data models. Random effect of herd*year  fixed effects of interaction between parity and relative number of piglets  age at first farrowing and annual herd size change were included in the analysis. The genetic component was estimated from sire  sire-maternal grandsire  sire-dam  sire-maternal grandsire and animal models  and the heritabilities computed for each model type in both breeds. If age at first farrowing was under 43 weeks or above 60 weeks  the risk of culling sows increased. An interaction between parity and relative litter size was observed  expressed by limited culling during first parity and severe risk increase of culling sows having small litters later in life. In the Landrace breed  heritabilities ranged between 0.05 and 0.08 (s.e. 0.014-0.020) for the continuous and between 0.07 and 0.11 (s.e. 0.016-0.023) for the grouped data models  and in the Large White breed  they ranged between 0.08 and 0.14 (s.e. 0.012-0.026) for the continuous and between 0.08 and 0.13 (s.e. 0.012-0.025) for the grouped data models. Heritabilities for length of productive life were similar with continuous time and grouped data models in both breeds. Based on these results and because grouped data models better reflect the economical needs in meat animals  we conclude that grouped data models are more appropriate in pig. Length of productive life is important from economical  herd-health and animal welfare points of view in sustainable animal production. Intensive selection on production and reproduction traits without considering functional and exterior traits can lead to decreased longevity [  ]. In Austria  exterior traits are taken in account during selection of replacement gilts before the first insemination. At this stage only a negative selection is carried out  without any official recording for later use. However  data on length of productive life and number of piglets born/weaned are routinely collected and available for Herdbook sows. The total number of piglets born or weaned can also be used to express the lifetime production of sows  but genetic evaluation of litter size is already implemented in the Austrian system. Length of productive life measured as the number of days between first farrowing and culling has been analyzed in several studies using either Cox [] or Weibull models []. During the productive life of sows  the period between weaning and conception can be non-productive and optimally  it should be kept as short as to ensure the highest number of litters. Using conventional measurements of lifetime (i.e. number of days between first farrowing and culling)  it is not possible to differentiate between productive and non-productive days during a sow's lifetime  which can lead to less pertinent results in breeding value estimation []. For this reason  a sow's productive life would be better expressed as the number of completed parities. This approach requires rescaling of the time axis from a continuous scale into several discrete classes. The consequence of this approach is that Cox and Weibull models will no longer be valid  because these usual approaches assume continuity of the baseline hazard distribution and/or absence of ties between ordered failure times []. Instead  grouped survival data (discrete survival time) models introduced by Prentice and Gloeckler [] can be used. Grouped data models have been used in beef cattle []  rabbits [] and dairy cattle to evaluate fertility traits []  but not for length of productive life in pigs. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of Weibull and grouped data models and to estimate heritabilities using different genetic models for Large White and Landrace sows. Length of productive life was analyzed for 12319 Large White sows originating from 838 boars and 4348 dams and for 9833 Landrace sows originating from 457 boars and 2236 dams. Overall survival for both populations is shown in Figure . All sows were purebred and were part of the herd book in nucleus or multiplier herds. Records from breeding farms represented 10% of the Landrace sows and 40% of the Large White sows. Landrace and Large White animals are used on breeding farms in Lower and Upper Austria  crossed with Large White animals on the multiplier level. In Steiermark  the Large White breed is used on both breeder and multiplier levels. In some cases  breeding farms also produce F1 sows if these can be marketed for a good price. For these reasons  breeding and multiplier farms were difficult to distinguish and thus  in this study  they were analyzed jointly. In all cases  F1 sows are mated with Pietrain boars on the piglet producer level in Austria. . For the Weibull model  length of productive life was defined as the number of days between first farrowing and culling. We assumed that culling took place either at the last weaning of the sow or 28 days after the last farrowing if the number of weaned piglets was known  but if both weaning date and number of weaned piglets were missing  culling date was set one day after the last farrowing. The choice of setting the culling date at 28 days after the last farrowing for sows with incomplete weaning date was based on the average nursing period in the whole dataset. Two intervals per parity were used for the grouped data model: from farrowing to weaning and from weaning to the next farrowing. Intervals were numbered sequentially from 1 up to 18 (i.e. sow alive after the 9 weaning). Animals were censored either at the date of the last weaning  if they were alive at the time of data collection or at the 9 weaning if they were alive at the 10 farrowing. Only sows born after 1995 were included in the evaluation and age at first farrowing between 250 and 550 days was required. The analysis was carried out using a proportional hazards model (assumed to be either the Weibull model or a grouped data model) with the Survival Kit v6 program package []. The continuous length of productive life was analyzed with the following Weibull model: where is the time-dependent random effect of herd and year of farrowing assumed to follow a log-gamma distribution  the fixed time independent effect of class of age at first farrowing  the time-dependent effect of interaction between parity and relative number of piglets (see below for detailed description)  the time-dependent effect of annual herd size change. The random genetic component differed  defining an animal  sire  sire-maternal grandsire  sire-dam or sire-maternal grandsire-dam within a maternal grandsire genetic model. For age at first farrowing  33 classes were created with one-week intervals  where the first group contained animals up to 43 weeks of age and the last group contained animals older than 75 weeks at first farrowing. Parity and classes for piglets born alive relative to the annual herd's mean were combined into an interaction term and included into the model (similar to []). This was done in several steps: Step 1: The number of piglets born alive was corrected for the first farrowing litter size. This was necessary  because the average number of piglets born at first farrowing is lower than that at later farrowing; where n is the number of the parity ranging between 2 and 6. Parities 6 and higher were treated in the same way  because of very similar coefficients. The values for the coefficients between parity 2 and parity 6 were: 1.055  1.0877  1.0922  1.0853 and 1.0473; where  is the corrected number of piglets and  is the number of the parity ranging between 2 and 6. Step 2: The average number of piglets for each year within each herd (h × y) was computed; Step 3: The previously corrected numbers of piglets born alive (in Step 1) were compared to the annual herd's mean (computed in step 2). where  is the corrected number of piglets born alive and  is the number of the parity ranging between 1 and 9 (maximal parity after censoring). Ten classes (relative piglet classes or RPC) were created according to percentage deviation from the herd mean  as follows: <75%  75-85%  85-90%  90-95%  95-100%  100-105%  105-110%  110-115%  115-125% and >125%. RPC were inserted in the model as an interaction term with the parity number. Classes were recoded as numbers with three digits  where the first digit denoted the parity number (from 1 to 9)  and the last two digits the RPC class (from 1 to 10). Similarly the annual herd size changes were grouped into eight classes  according to number of farrowing per herd and year  where January 1 of each year was considered as cut point. In case the number of farrowings was equal or below 10  no change was accounted for that particular year. The bounds for classes were: decrease by more than 50%  decrease by 30-50%  30-10%  between decrease by 10% and increase by 10%  increase by 10-30%  30-50%  50-100% and increase by 100% and more. Longevity of sows can also be influenced by index values on growth traits but since these indexes are not routinely saved in Austria  we could not include them into the models. Grouped data models are a special case of proportional hazards models  where failure times are grouped into intervals A = [a  a)  i = 1  ...  r with a = 0  a = +infinite and failure times in A are recoded as t. Therefore the regression vector is assumed to be time-dependent but fixed within each time interval []. For the grouped data models  the same effects as for the Weibull model were used. For both Large White and Landrace databases  the same structure of fixed and random effects was used. All models accounted for pedigree information up to the third generation of ancestors. The genetic variance was estimated as the mode of its approximate posterior density after Laplace integration of the other parameters []. At the same time  the mean  variance and skewness of this posterior density were obtained. Knowing these three parameters  makes it possible to draw the posterior density of the variance component using a Gram-Charlier approximation. The standard deviation of the posterior density can be interpreted as a conservative estimate of the standard error. From this  the standard error of the heritabilities was computed using the Delta method (see e.g. []). In this case  the sow's sire was included in the model  accounting for 1/4 of the genetic variance. To be correct  the model implicitly assumes that mates are non-related  non-inbred  non-selected and that each dam has one recorded progeny only. The pedigree file contained the sires' sire and sires' maternal grandsire. The effective heritability was computed from the sire's variance as in Yazdi et al. []. The effective heritability accounts for censoring in contrast with the equivalent heritability which conceptually assumes that all animals have died. The effective reliability is useful to compute expected reliabilities of EBV as a function of the expected number of animals still alive at a given time. The effect of the herd-year was treated as a time-dependent random variable assuming a loggamma distribution in all cases. The following equation was used: where  is the genetic variance  var( × ) the herd year variance   the proportion of uncensored animals and genetic variance = 4 * sire variance. This was similar to the sire model  but the sow's maternal grandsire was also included in the model and recoded jointly with the sires. This model accounts for 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16 of the genetic variance under the same assumptions as the sire model (i.e. mates are non-related  non-inbred  non-selected and each dam has one progeny only). Additionally dams can be related and selected through their sire (i.e. the maternal grandsire of the progeny). The pedigree file had the same structure and the heritability was computed with the equation: where  is the genetic variance  var( × ) the herd year variance   the proportion of uncensored animals and genetic variance = 4 * sire variance. The additional 1/16 genetic variance in the denominator stands for the maternal grandsire's variance. Here both the sire and dam were included in the model  but recoded together in the data preparation step. Both sire and dam account for half of the genetic variance  and full-sibs are therefore recognized as being more similar than half-sibs. For both parents of the sow  their sire and dam were included in the pedigree file. The effective heritability was computed as: where  is the genetic variance  var( × ) the herd year variance   the proportion of uncensored animals and genetic variance = 4 * sire variance. The genetic variance was multiplied by 2 in the denominator (compared to the sire model) because the sire and dam variances are assumed equal. This model is in some sense a compromise between sire-maternal grandsire and sire-dam models  because the relationship matrix involves only males and it still accounts for repeated records. The sow's sire and maternal grandsire are recoded together in the data preparation step. In the final model the sire  maternal grandsire and dam of the sow are included as separate random effects. This model does not account for the Mendelian sampling term of the animal but in contrast with the sire-maternal grandsire model  sisters can have different genetic values and more than one progeny each in which case a non genetic maternal effect is also accounted for. The main difference with a sire-dam model including a maternal effect is that dams are considered as related only through their sire (i.e. maternal grand dams are supposed to be unselected and to have only one progeny each). The heritability was computed as: where  is the genetic variance  var( × ) the herd year variance   the proportion of uncensored animals   the dam within maternal grandsire variance and genetic variance = 4 * sire variance. The additional 1/16 genetic variance in the denominator stands for the maternal grandsire variance. In this case  the animal effect is responsible for the entire genetic variance and all its ancestors are accounted for. It is included in the evaluated model as a random effect  as well as the pedigree file together with its sire and dam. The heritability is computed as follows: where  is the genetic variance  var( × ) the herd year variance   the proportion of uncensored animals. A brief statistical overview of the databases is presented in Table . The total proportion of right censored sows was 26.4% in the Large White and 22.3% in the Landrace database. Landrace sows lived 92 days longer and completed 0.56 more parities on average  compared to Large White sows. Standard deviations were large in both cases. Large White sows had approximately 0.5 more piglets per farrowing. The average age at first farrowing was similar in both populations. Similar trends for the risk ratios of age at first farrowing were found for all models and also across breeds (Figures  and ). A high risk of culling was observed for sows which had their first litter at a very young age  compared to the reference class (risk ratio = 1) at week 52 for Large White and week 51 for Landrace sows. After this  a longer period with a moderate risk follows  approximately till 59 weeks of age  after which the risk of culling increased again. . n = number of uncensored observations; the arrow indicates the reference class. . n = number of uncensored observations; the arrow indicates the reference class. As for the interaction between parity and RPC  the risk ratios for classes were different between breeds and model types (continuous time or grouped data). The risk ratios from the grouped data models were similar during the first parity  but were higher later on  compared to continuous time models  as showed in Figure . Within breed and model type  the risks of culling for the classes were similar  regardless of the genetic component. . Note: The three digit classes on the x axis stand for parity (hundreds) and class of relative piglet classes (tens and ones); for example 201 is the lowest RPC class in parity 2; the arrow indicates the reference class. Within parities the risk was highest for sows with a litter size below 75% of the herd's average in a given year  with only a slight decrease for sows with a higher number of piglets. First parities of both Large White and Landrace sows seemed to be exceptions from this pattern. In Large White sows  only a slight decrease of the risk ratio was observed throughout the classes and the peak value for the worst class was much lower. In Landrace sows  the risk ratio was much higher for sows with a litter size below that of the farm's average  but for the other classes no clear tendency was observed. For Large White sows  the risk ratios were similar for farrowings 2 to 4 in both Weibull and grouped data models and from parity 6 (not shown) it increased. However  during the last parity the risk dropped for the grouped data model  compared to the Weibull model. For Landrace sows  the risk ratios were similar only for the first three parities in grouped data models  and increased from parity 4 onwards. Again during the last parity (not shown) the risk ratio dropped considerably. Unlike the other cases  the risk of culling decreased between parities for the Weibull model in the Landrace breed. The risk of culling in both populations was highest for sows from herds with a rapid size decrease (Figure )  as expected. The opposite tendency was not clear for growing farms: the risk remained virtually the same whether the herd size decreased by less than 30% or increased to by whatever percent. . The arrow indicates the reference class. The estimated genetic variances and heritabilities together with their standard errors for all models in both breeds are given in Tables  and . The posterior density of the genetic variance for each model is presented in Figure . These figures show that all genetic variances are statistically different from 0 and that the confidence intervals (credible sets) are quite wide. For a given breed and type of model (Weibull vs. grouped data)  the posterior densities overlap to a large extent. In general  heritabilities differ slightly depending on the breed and genetic model used. For a given genetic model  genetic variances and heritabilities are extremely similar in grouped data and continuous time models for the Large White breed  but they are systematically higher in the grouped data model for the Landrace breed. . wide black line: animal model; dashed line: sire-maternal grand sire model; thin black: thin black line: sire-maternal grand sire (dam within maternal grand sire mode; dark grey line: sire model; light grey line: sire-dam model. For the Landrace breed  heritabilities range between 0.05 and 0.08 (s.e. 0.014 - 0.020) for the continuous time and between 0.07 and 0.11 (s.e. 0.016 - 0.023) for the grouped data models. Heritabilities for Large White sows range between 0.08 and 0.14 (s.e. 0.012 - 0.026) for the continuous time and between 0.08 and 0.13 (s.e. 0.012 - 0.025) for the grouped data models. Whatever the breed  heritabilities are highest for the sire and sire-dam models. The sire-mgs and the sire-mgs-dam within mgs models gave similar  but smaller heritabilities. For the latter model  the dam within mgs variance is supposed to include 3/16 of the genetic variance plus the maternal non genetic effect variance if such an effect exists. In fact  for the Large White breed  the estimated within mgs variance of the dam (0.016/0.015) was smaller than 3/16 of the estimated genetic variance (0.031 for both models). This inconsistency was not observed in the Landrace breed. Hence  if a maternal non genetic effect exists  it should be very small. Finally  the lowest genetic variances and heritabilities were obtained with the animal model. The average length of productive life in the whole dataset was 503 days for Large White and 596 days for Landrace sows  with large standard deviations. Results for the Landrace breed were comparable  but for the Large White breed  they were lower than those reported in the literature i.e. 617 days in [] and 602 days in []. Such results are heavily dependent on the amount of censored records and the length of the study period. Prolonged productive life is important for two main reasons: 1. in general  the number of piglets born during farrowing 3 and 4 is higher than during the first farrowings  which means that with a higher proportion of older sows  piglet production increases. 2. On breeding farms with short generation intervals  it is especially important that only a low proportion of sows be culled for health and fertility problems  and the remaining ones be selected according to production traits  like litter size  fattening or carcass traits. Our results show that age at first farrowing affects the risk of culling only for animals that have their first litter very early or late in life. A very young sow is not prepared to give birth because of its body development is not sufficient. This particular problem seems to affect only sows farrowed before 43 weeks of age. This result is in agreement with [] in Danish Landrace herds for which in the case of an early first mating i.e. before 210 days of age  the risk for culling was higher than for sows mated later. After the 43rd week  the risk ratio dropped to a level around that of the reference class. Age at first farrowing increased the risk of culling again  for sows older than 60 weeks. If we assume that all sows are supposed to be put into reproduction at the same age  then it is likely that these sows had certain problems preventing them to conceive earlier. If these problems had persisted  they could have been culled early based on the higher risk ratios. Similar results have been published by [    ]. When the production level of the animals is included in the statistical model  the genetic value of the \"functional\" length of productive life can be approximated  as production is usually the main source of voluntary culling. Hopefully  selection on functional longevity would lead to a reduction in involuntary culling because of reproduction or health problems. When the production of the animal is not taken into account in the model  the genetic effect reflects the \"true\" longevity  which means that voluntary (i.e. for low production) and involuntary culling reasons are considered together. In this paper  we have decided to focus on functional longevity  and therefore  we have included the number of piglets born alive relative to the annual herd's mean in our model  to account for phenotypic selection on litter size. Working only with absolute numbers of piglets would not be appropriate  because production at a young age is generally lower than at an age when the body is fully developed (milk production in cows []  goats []  litter size in sheep []  litter size in pigs []). Also culling decisions based on litter size may vary with herd management and year. In other words  the same litter size can be treated differently in different farms or on the same farm in different years. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the farmers' decisions based on time and place  when and where they take place. The risk ratios for the interaction between parity and RPC decreased within parity. This means that sows with a higher number of piglets born alive are clearly favoured  regardless of age of the sow or farrowing number. In most cases the risk of culling for sows with litters 25% above the herd's average is two to three times lower than for sows 25% under the herd's average. This was not the case at first parity  when the risk was only slightly lower for Large White sows  and without any clear tendency for nearly all classes of Landrace sows. The reason can be that the farmer did not want to cull the younger sows with a low number of piglets immediately  but rather wanted to give them another chance. Our results are similar to those of [] for risk ratios between parities. Although in our case the parity number was included in an interaction term  the risk ratios followed a similar pattern. The results can be compared better with the studies by [  ] who also evaluated the risk of culling as an interaction term with parity number. In both cases  they found an increased risk of culling for sows with poor performance  which is similar to our results. There was a difference when comparing risk of culling between parities. Engblom et al. [] have found that the risk of culling was relatively low for parities 2 to 7  while in our study  risks of culling were similar throughout the first parities and increased later in life. Brandt et al. [] have used standardized values for the number of piglets born and have reported a relatively stable risk at the beginning of the productive life. They have concluded that culling decisions based on performance are made between parities 4 and 5. These results are in agreement with our findings  which show that the risk of culling was low for the first parities  and increased from parity 4 in Landrace sows. In Large White sows  the risk of culling was higher in parities 2 to 6  compared to the first parity  with an even more rapid increase from parity 7 onwards. The risk of culling for effect of herd size change was similar for both breeds. The risk was highest for sows from herds that dramatically decreased in numbers with more than 50%. Decrease of farm size to such an extent could mean  that some extraordinary event happened (major financial problems or disease outbreak)  which led to closure of the farm or extreme shrinkage of the herd. In the future  these records should be treated as right censored  because most likely the majority of the animals would live longer in normal circumstances. In Large White herds for the second worst class  the risk was twice the one of the reference class  but it was stable in the case of only a slight decrease or increase in herd size. For the Landrace dataset the risk was extremely high for the worst class  but decreased rapidly in the second worst category  when the risk of culling was only 1.5 times higher for the Weibull model and 1.3 times higher for the grouped data model  in comparison with the reference class. Only a slight reduction in risk of culling for Large White herds increasing in size by more than 50% was detected. These results suggest that the farmer's decision to increase his herd size has a lower impact on keeping existing animals in the herd compared to the culling as a result of herd shrinkage. This indicates that the culling process on these farms continues in its usual way  probably because the expansion is done by introducing younger animals either from their own production or from other farms. Growth performance undoubtedly influences the length of the productive life in pigs  and as such it should be included in the evaluation. New indexes for growth are calculated every two weeks in Austria and selection is based on these indexes. Including these in our models would be desirable  but unfortunately these indexes are not routinely saved. Nevertheless  the functional length of productive life could be modelled even better if they are added in the model. Most estimations of genetic variance in survival models have been based on sire or sire-maternal grand sire models [      ]. Two reasons have justified such choices: first  the Laplace approximation of the posterior density of the genetic variance requires the repeated inversion of the Hessian matrix of the log-posterior density  which quickly becomes too time-consuming for large (animal model) applications. Due to the existence of time-dependent variables  this matrix is often less sparse than the usual mixed model coefficient matrix. Second  the quality of the Laplace approximation has been shown to depend on the number of observations per level of genetic effects []. Indeed  for many years  it was believed that animal models could not fit with the Survival Kit because of this alleged poor performance of the Laplace approximation. It has been shown recently (see [] for references) that this concern was not justified when the data structure is adequate (several generations of related females). Increase in computing power has also made estimation easier for animal models on larger populations. In this study  the sire model systematically led to the largest estimates of genetic variances (140 to 180% of the animal model genetic variance). However  it can be noted that there is a large uncertainty associated with the estimation of the genetic variance and that the overlap of its credible set with those of the other models is large. It has been claimed that the sire survival model is not consistent [] because the error term of the survival models is not normally distributed and therefore does not properly include the remaining 3/4 of the genetic variance. One potential reason for the overestimation of the genetic variance may be a poor partition of the genetic variance between the sire variance and the error term. In contrast  animal models gave low estimates of genetic variances and heritabilities. The other models gave estimates of genetic parameters very similar to the animal model in Landrace sows  but intermediate between the sire and animal models in Large White sows. The reason of this difference between breeds is unclear. Whatever the breed  the sire-mgs-dam within mgs does not present much advantage: the genetic variance estimates are almost exactly those obtained with the sire-mgs model and the dam component is small  not even representing the expected 3/16 of the genetic variance in Large White sows. The use of an animal model or a sire-mgs model to estimate the genetic variance seems advisable to account for all (or most) of the relationships in the population. The sire-mgs is less satisfactory from a modelling point of view but is favourable when the data structure is not adequate for the use of the animal model and also for easier computing. Heritabilities in our study ranged between 0.08 and 0.14 for Large White and between 0.04 and 0.11 for Landrace sows depending on the model type. In general  heritabilities showed some variation  but after considering the standard error of estimates it seems that none of the genetic models is clearly superior to another. To compare our results with those of other authors  we considered only the studies using survival analysis and not those using linear models  because estimates from these methods are not comparable []. Yazdi et al. [] have published a rather wide range of heritabilities for longevity in Landrace populations ranging from 0.11 to 0.27. Serenius and Stalder [] have found heritabilities around 0.16-0.17 for Landrace and 0.17-0.19 for Large White populations. It is important to note that  in both these papers  heritabilities were computed assuming that the residual effects followed an extreme value distribution with the variance p/6  while we used the effective heritability according to []. This could potentially lead to differences in results depending on parameters of the Weibull distribution. For more details see []. In other words the direct comparison of heritabilities on log or original scale and the effective heritability is not possible. To obtain more comparable results  we used the variances of [  ] and inserted them in the equation of [] (the same as we used for the sire model in our study). We used the sire variance of 0.037 in [] using a model scenario similar to that in our study (herd*year treated as random  time dependent variable with 1 year intervals  with gamma parameter 5.76). Based on the estimated variance of the random herd*year effect and computed from the estimate of the gamma parameter  their effective heritability was 0.09. This result is very similar to our result of 0.07 from the sire model in the Landrace breed. Using the same approach  we recalculated the heritability from [] using the original sire's variances 0.068 to 0.081  resulting in effective heritabilities ranging between 0.18 and 0.21. These newly computed results were close to those in the paper (0.16-0.19) and were higher than our results in all cases. The herd*year effect was treated as a time-dependent fixed effect in this study  so no further adjustment was possible. Engblom et al. [] have used the same heritability definition as in our study  and found values of 0.06 for Landrace and 0.12 for Yorkshire (Large White) breeds with a sire survival model. Our study supports the previous findings that heritabilities for longevity in different breeds are not necessarily the same  even when using identical models. Their results were very similar to h = 0.07 for Landrace and h = 0.14 for Large White in our sire models. The production cycle (interval between two farrowings) in sows consists of three periods: gestation period  suckling period and days open (service period). The heritability for gestation length is 0.25-0.3 [  ]  but altering its length is not a breeding objective. In the Austrian Large White population  the mean gestation length is 114.8 ± 1.5 days  and in the Landrace 115.3 ± 1.5 days. The nursing period is heavily affected by breeders' decision for herd management. It is usually four weeks in Austria for both Large White (28.2 ± 5.0 days) and Landrace (28.2 ± 6.6 days) populations. The interval from weaning to first ovulation is optimally 5 to 6 days. If fertilisation is not successful  it can be longer with cycles repeated every 21 days. The time intervals for days open show much wider variation compared to gestation length and nursing period  with 16.0 ± 17.2 days in Large White and 14.0 ± 17.3 days in Landrace populations. From the average values and standard deviations of these three major components of the farrowing interval  it is obvious that the larger part of the variation is caused by days open. When considering days of productive life as the dependent variable  sows with longer reproductive cycles will tend to have higher estimated breeding values. This inconsistency is lifted when using grouped data models [  ]. More reproductive cycles increase the breeding value of an animal not because it lives longer  but because it produces more. In this study  alternative models for the genetic evaluation of longevity in sows using continuous time and grouped data models in Large White and Landrace sows were examined. Risk of culling associated with length of productive life was influenced by all fixed and random effects. An increased risk was observed for animals having their first litter before 43 weeks or after 60 weeks of age  for sows from herds rapidly decreasing in size and sows with litter size under the herd's average in the given year. Some differences between the two breeds were observed  but in general the risks of culling for fixed effects in all models were comparable. Heritabilities for the length of productive life were estimated using sire  sire-maternal grandsire  sire-dam  sire-maternal grandsire-dam within maternal grandsire and animal models with Weibull and grouped data models in both breeds. They ranged from 0.08 to 0.14 (s.e. 0.012-0.026) in Weibull and from 0.08 to 0.13 (s.e. 0.012-0.025) in grouped data models in Large White sows  and from 0.05 to 0.08 (s.e. 0.014-0.020) for the Weibull and from 0.07 to 0.11 (s.e. 0.016-0.023) for the grouped data models in Landrace sows. Sire-mgs models offer a good compromise between accurate modelling of the genetic part and computation requirements in case the data structure is not adequate to use an animal model. Heritabilities are low as for functional traits in general  but given the high economic importance of the length of productive life  it is really worthwhile to consider it as a selection criterion in pig breeding. The grouped data models in pig tend to focus on the exact number of reproduction cycles rather than on the duration of productive life. Therefore sows with a higher number of parities are favoured  in contrast with sows which live longer just because of longer intervals between parities. The performance of grouped data models was comparable to continuous time models. Based on these results and because grouped data models reflect better the economical needs in meat animals  we conclude that grouped data models are more appropriate in pig. The final outcome of the study is to provide basic information for routine genetic evaluation of the length of productive life in Austrian pig populations. The grouped data model will be used for its favourable contribution to deal with the non-productive days during a sow's lifetime.

Conservation of genetic diversity in livestock is of vital importance to cope with changing environments and human demands []. Intensive livestock production systems have limited the number of breeds and lines used  and many native breeds have become rare or extinct  causing a loss of genetic diversity. To conserve biodiversity and ensure its sustainable use  efforts are being made world-wide []  for example in the form of genetic diversity conservation via gene banks or by maintaining genetic diversity in breeding populations. Determining and evaluating genetic diversity present within livestock breeds are crucial to make the right conservation decisions and to efficiently use resources available for conservation. To evaluate genetic diversity in livestock populations  several methods have been developed []. These methods are based on pedigree information  or on molecular data when pedigree information is not available. During the last decade  availability and use of molecular information have increased  and numerous types of markers have become available to evaluate genetic diversity. Microsatellites have been widely used for conservation purposes  but are gradually being replaced by SNP markers which are available in large numbers across the entire genome. These dense marker maps enable us to evaluate genetic diversity more precisely and to obtain information on the genetic diversity separately for each specific segment of the genome. Basically  there are two approaches to evaluate genetic diversity. In molecular and population genetics  heterozygosity of markers is the most widely used genetic diversity parameter []. In quantitative genetics and animal breeding  additive genetic variance of traits estimated with the help of pedigrees is generally used to evaluate genetic diversity []. To determine additive variance with markers  the probability that two alleles are identical by descent (IBD)  i.e. originate from the same ancestral genome  is estimated []. The probability of IBD is closely related to the relationship coefficient () calculated from pedigrees for the estimation of additive variance. Although theoretically both approaches should give similar results  in practice they are weakly correlated [  ]. As dense marker maps have become available  it is possible to estimate additive genetic effects of markers and this is routinely used in  for example  QTL-detection [] and genomic selection [  ]. A crucial difference between heterozygosity on the one hand and IBD probabilities and  on the other hand is that the latter depend on a base population. Markers can be alike in state (AIS) but not IBD if they originate from different ancestors in the base population. With heterozygosity this distinction is not made. For example  in the case of QTL detection  IBD probabilities are used because they better predict whether two chromosome intervals carry the same QTL. The reason is that if an individual carries markers at two loci around an interval that are both AIS  but not IBD (i.e. originate from different ancestors)  it is less likely that the interval between the markers is completely AIS and carries the same QTL. However  if both markers are IBD the interval will also be IBD (and AIS)  unless a double recombination has occurred in the interval. Both heterozygosity and IBD probabilities can be used to estimate genetic diversity in specific regions of the genome  in which it may deviate from the average diversity calculated over the whole genome. Heterozygosity and IBD probabilities as genetic diversity measures may also deviate from each other. It is unclear how substantial the difference is between the two approaches and whether it varies over the genome. These local differences may be averaged out if the average diversity is calculated over the whole genome. However  both approaches can be used to estimate the genetic diversity for sequences lying in between genetic markers. Because IBD probabilities are used specifically to predict the presence of QTL between markers one may expect that IBD probabilities better predict genetic variation between markers. Whether this is a substantial difference is not clear. The aim of this paper was to compare two different estimates of the genetic diversity of a region lying in between markers over the genome i.e. IBD probabilities between marker haplotypes and heterozygosity. Towards this aim  we generated genetic diversity over a genome by computer simulation of two populations each with a different marker density. IBD-based genetic diversity and heterozygosity were compared for the average diversity of regions in the genome containing several marker intervals  and for the genetic diversity at each marker interval. To evaluate how well these estimates predict the genetic diversity over the genome  both were compared to the true genetic diversity. A population was computer simulated with neutral SNP markers across the genome. Next  for each locus in the genome  the genetic diversity was estimated in three ways: (1) based on IBD probabilities with flanking markers; (2) based on expected heterozygosity with flanking markers; (3) the true expected heterozygosity of the marker itself. For (1) and (2)  the marker at the locus itself was assumed to be unknown. In this way the predicted diversities (1) and (2) could be compared with true genetic diversity (3). Simulations were aimed at generating a population with a neutral genetic diversity varying over the genome. We avoided selection as this may cause specific patterns in genetic diversity (e.g. selective sweeps). Variation in diversity in the simulated population was generated by random mating  recombination  mutation and sampling of maternal and paternal chromosomes. The simulated population started with 1000 animals with an equal sex ratio  and this structure was kept constant for 1000 generations. Animals were mated by drawing parents randomly from the previous generation  and mating resulted in 1000 offspring (500 males and 500 females) in each generation. A genome containing a single 1-M chromosome was simulated  starting with 2 000 SNP marker loci with positions on the genome determined at random. This density is roughly equivalent to the current SNP chips available for livestock species (e.g. 50 K SNP chip for the 30-M genome in cattle). In the first generation (base population)  marker loci were coded as 1 or 2 and allocated at random  so that allele frequencies (p) averaged 0.5. This was comparable to the simulation used in the study of Habier et al. []. During the simulation of the 1000 generations  marker alleles were dispersed through the population by random mating  recombinations and mutations. Recombinations between adjacent loci occurred with a probability calculated with Haldane's mapping function  based on the distance between the loci. Mutations occurred for each locus only once during the 1000 generations  where mutations changed the allele state from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 1  with equal probability. Three additional generations were simulated after the first 1000 generations  which were assumed to be genotyped  to analyse genetic diversity over the genome  e.g. similarly as in livestock breeds where only recent generations are genotyped. All SNP markers with a minor allele frequency in generations 1002 and 1003 of <0.02 were discarded from the analysis. Thus  the generated population consisted of 3000 animals (generation 1001  1002 and 1003) with a known genotype  and 1665 SNP markers were still segregating in these generations. To determine whether marker density would influence the genetic diversity estimation with the different estimates  a second population was obtained with a lower marker density. This population was based on the first population  by changing only the number of SNP markers from 1665 to 166  by systematically deleting 90% of the SNP markers. Genetic diversity was estimated for each marker interval on the genome. A marker interval was defined as the interval between two genotyped markers  with one marker lying in between these two markers which was not taken into account for the genetic diversity estimation (ungenotyped marker) (Figure ). In the next marker interval  this middle ungenotyped marker became the flanking marker of the interval with the adjacent marker being the ungenotyped marker. The genetic diversity estimation was based on IBD probabilities between haplotypes  where a haplotype was defined as a combination of ten consecutive markers  i.e. five markers on either side of the marker interval []. Haplotypes were reconstructed from the genotypes using the methods of Windig and Meuwissen []. By using IBD probabilities  the chance of markers being similar (AIS) but not IBD is taken into account. This contrasts with heterozygosity  where similar markers are all assumed to originate from the same ancestor (AIS = IBD). Additionally  because haplotypes were used  the recombination history is taken into account to estimate the probability of IBD. For example  a long string of identical markers strongly indicates a recent common ancestor (probability of being IBD must be high)  because strings of identical markers from non-recent ancestors are generally broken up by recombination. . The ungenotyped marker is placed in the middle of the marker interval; genetic diversity was estimated for each marker interval  using the adjacent markers left and right of the interval. IBD probabilities were calculated between the existing haplotypes in the simulated population for each marker interval  by combining linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis information  where both pedigree and marker information were used. IBD probabilities were first calculated for the first generation of genotyped animals  using the algorithm of Meuwissen and Goddard []. In this method  IBD probabilities are calculated for a fictitious locus A in the middle of a marker interval  where information is used from the markers on either side of this locus A. In our case  locus A is positioned at the marker locus in the middle of each marker interval. The probability of A in two haplotypes being IBD or not IBD is estimated by weighing all possible combinations of the markers in the haplotype being IBD or not IBD with recombinations. The IBD probability is calculated back to an arbitrary base population  T generations ago (we used T = 1000). In this calculation  effective population size (we used Ne = 1000 during the 1000 generations) and recombination probabilities based on marker distances are taken into account. As the number of markers with identical alleles increases  the probability that the two fictitious alleles for A are IBD also increases. After calculating IBD probabilities for the haplotypes in the base generation  the haplotypes of the animals in later generations were added  and the elements in the IBD matrix for those descendant haplotypes were calculated using the algorithm of Fernando and Grossman []. In this algorithm  IBD probabilities between offspring are calculated based on the IBD probabilities between the parents and the inheritance of the markers []. Whenever the IBD probability of descendant haplotypes with one of their parental haplotypes exceeded 0.95  the descendant haplotype was clustered with this parental haplotype. This was done to avoid excessive numbers of near identical haplotypes resulting in long computation times. The genetic diversity for all marker intervals on the genome in the simulated population was estimated using haplotype frequencies and IBD probabilities between haplotypes. Haplotype frequencies (frequency of the different haplotype configurations in the population) per marker interval were obtained by: where is a contribution vector with haplotype frequencies for all haplotypes on marker interval   is the number of haplotypes of type  on marker interval   and is the total number of haplotypes in the population on marker interval . Genetic diversity per marker interval was determined by calculating the average haplotype relatedness at each locus []: where is the average relatedness for marker interval   and is the IBD-matrix for marker interval . The genetic diversity for marker interval  was calculated as: This is the predicted probability that the marker in the middle of the interval is not IBD. Expected heterozygosity [] was calculated for each marker interval on the genome in the simulated population  using one flanking marker on either side of the interval. Heterozygosity was calculated in two different ways: average heterozygosity of the two adjacent markers around the marker interval (H_AVG)  and heterozygosity for the interval treating both markers as a single two-marker haplotype (H_HAP2). For the calculation of H_AVG  first expected heterozygosity was calculated for the markers on the left and right of the interval separately (see Figure   markers on the left and right of the interval are in bold): where  and  are the allele frequencies for marker  in the simulated population. Subsequently  the expected heterozygosity for each marker interval (H_AVG) was calculated by taking the average of the expected heterozygosity for both markers left and right of the marker interval. H_HAP2 was calculated for the combination of the two markers on the left and right of the interval as a two-marker haplotype (see Figure   haplotype is shown with the two markers in bold)  where four combinations were possible (11  12  21  and 22). H_HAP2 for marker interval  was calculated as: where is the frequency of the haplotype with combination  at marker interval . Comparison between genetic diversity measures GD_IBD  H_AVG and H_HAP2 was done by calculating Pearson's correlations. Correlations were calculated between the genetic diversity measures for each marker interval  but also between the measures averaged over groups of adjacent marker intervals  to investigate whether the correlations would change when the measures were averaged over larger regions of the genome. Therefore  correlations were calculated between GD_IBD  H_AVG and H_HAP2 for 4  10  20 and 40 marker intervals together. For example  for 10 marker intervals together  the correlations were calculated with the average measures for interval 1-10  11-20  21-30  etc. To evaluate whether one of the approaches better predicts genetic diversity  a true genetic diversity was calculated for the ungenotyped marker lying within each marker interval. This marker was not used to estimate genetic diversity with GD_IBD  H_AVG and H_HAP2  but the adjacent markers were used to predict the diversity in this ungenotyped marker. The true genetic diversity for the ungenotyped marker in the marker interval was determined by calculating the expected heterozygosity (Equation 4). To compare true genetic diversity (H_TRUE) with GD_IBD and heterozygosity (H_AVG and H_HAP2)  Pearson's correlations were calculated for each marker interval and for groups of marker intervals (4  10  20 and 40). Two correlations were estimated for each comparison: between true genetic diversity of the even markers and their estimated genetic diversity based on the uneven (flanking) markers  and the other way around. This was done because the genotyped marker in one marker interval became the ungenotyped marker in the next marker interval. In the simulated data  1665 SNP markers were still segregating in generations 1001  1002 and 1003. Marker distances ranged from 0.00 cM to 0.50 cM  with an average of 0.06 cM. The number of marker haplotypes used for GD_IBD after clustering varied from 1 to 56  with an average of 20.70 haplotypes. The average minor allele frequency over the 1665 SNP markers was 28%  ranging from 2 to 50%. The average linkage disequilibrium (r) between adjacent markers  calculated as the square of the correlation of allele frequencies []  was 0.26. The simulated population was comparable to real livestock populations. For example  in cattle nowadays ~50 000 SNPs are used for a 30-M genome  which gives an average marker distance of 0.06 cM. On the cattle 50 k SNP chip  for HF dairy cattle the r between adjacent markers is between 0.15 and 0.20 for an average marker distance of ~0.06 cM [  ]. The true genetic diversity over the simulated genome  calculated as the expected heterozygosity for the marker locus within each marker interval (H_TRUE)  ranged from 0.04 to 0.53 with an average of 0.36 (Figure ). A large number of H_TRUE values was found between 0.48 and 0.50 (Figure )  which is in accordance with a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for an allele frequency range 0.4-0.5. .

Genetic diversity estimated by IBD probabilities (GD_IBD) varied considerably over the genome  with values ranging from 0.00 to 0.75  with an average of 0.52 (Figures  and ). Expected heterozygosity calculated for the two adjacent marker loci around each marker interval as an average (H_AVG) resulted in systematically lower values with a smaller range compared to GD_IBD (0.05 to 0.50  average of 0.36) (Figures  and ). When expected heterozygosity was calculated for flanking markers as a two-marker haplotype (H_HAP2)  the level and range of values increased and were more similar to GD_IBD (0.05 to 0.75  average of 0.55) (Figures  and ). This result was expected  since genetic diversity estimation with H_HAP2 is more similar to GD_IBD because H_HAP2 also uses a haplotype construction  but with only two markers instead of ten. Both heterozygosity estimates fluctuated more over the genome compared to GD_IBD  reflecting a lower correlation between values of adjacent marker intervals for the heterozygosity estimates (H_AVG: r = 0.23; H_HAP2: r = 0.28; GD_IBD: r = 0.64). The correlation between H_TRUE and GD_IBD was weak (r = 0.21)  and comparable to the correlations between H_TRUE and H_AVG (r = 0.19) and H_HAP2 (r = 0.20) (Table  and Figure ). These results indicate that both GD_IBD and heterozygosity estimates are similar in predicting the genetic diversity for ungenotyped regions of the genome in the current simulated population. The correlation between GD_IBD and H_AVG was 0.46  and was slightly higher between GD_IBD and H_HAP2 (r = 0.49) (Table ). . (a) by IBD probabilities between marker haplotypes (GD_IBD); (b) by expected heterozygosity as an average for the two flanking markers (H_AVG); (c) by expected heterozygosity for the two flanking markers as a two marker haplotype (H_HAP2). When GD_IBD  H_AVG and H_HAP2 were averaged over groups of marker intervals  the correlations between H_TRUE and these estimates increased. They were moderate when estimates were averaged over 40 marker intervals (r = 0.61-0.64  Table ). Correlations of all three estimates with H_TRUE were comparable to each other. The correlation between GD_IBD and heterozygosity estimates H_AVG and H_HAP2 increased with an increasing number of marker intervals  and in the case of 40 marker intervals equalled 0.75 and 0.82  respectively. This indicates that GD_IBD  H_AVG and H_HAP2 are similar in predicting the genetic diversity for specific regions of the genome in a population with a high marker density. When genetic diversity over the genome was estimated in a population with a lower marker density  the correlations between the true genetic diversity and GD_IBD  H_AVG and H_HAP2 changed  and turned out to be slightly higher for GD_IBD (Table ). This result suggests that GD_IBD is a better predictor for genetic diversity when using marker maps with a lower marker density. The aim of this paper was to compare two different estimates of genetic diversity of a region lying in between markers over the genome i.e. IBD-based genetic diversity and heterozygosity. Genetic diversities estimated by IBD probabilities and by heterozygosity of flanking markers were positively correlated. The correlation of GD_IBD and heterozygosity with the true genetic diversity was quite similar for a simulated population with a high marker density  for both specific and large regions over the genome. For a population with a lower marker density  GD_IBD turned out to be a better predictor of genetic diversity. The assumption that is made for genetic diversity in the ungenotyped marker interval is different for GD_IBD and heterozygosity. With GD_IBD the assumption is that in the base population relatedness was 0  i.e. all markers were not-IBD and \"heterozygosity\" was 100%. With heterozygosity  no such base population is assumed and the assumption is that heterozygosity in the current generation for genotyped markers is predictive for ungenotyped markers. This explains why the average GD_IBD estimated in this study was higher than the heterozygosity estimates and the true heterozygosity. Heterozygosity based on SNP markers with only two alleles will have  under HWE  a maximum heterozygosity of 50% when the minor allele frequency is 50%  as was simulated in this study. For markers that have an unlimited number of alleles  the true heterozygosity would probably be on average closer to GD_IBD  while for markers with a low diversity the true heterozygosity would be below both GD_IBD and heterozygosity estimates. When the genotyped marker is actually part of the gene of interest  e.g.  when the marker is a known QTL  then heterozygosity at the marker fully determines the additive genetic variance due to the QTL. In that case  additive genetic variance due to the QTL simply equals Ha  a denoting the allele substitution effect of the gene []. Hence  when markers coincide with genes of interest  i.e. there are no QTL other than the genotyped markers  there is no need to consider IBD probabilities. However  in most cases  the genes of interest and their QTL will be unknown  and it is unlikely that they coincide precisely with genotyped markers. Consequently  prediction of diversity in the ungenotyped regions between markers is more relevant than the expected diversity at the markers  because most genes of interest will be in the regions between two markers. Such a prediction requires LD between the genotyped markers and the regions in-between markers  similar to the requirements in QTL mapping []. Our results show that the IBD-based method and heterozygosity are similar in using LD information in the current simulated data with 1665 SNP markers. However  when a population with a lower marker density was used  GD_IBD became a slightly better predictor of the genetic diversity in the marker interval. In this second population the LD between markers is low due to a larger marker distance  and in that case the IBD-based method was expected to be a better predictor  based on QTL mapping and genomic selection studies. Explaining genetic diversity at a ungenotyped locus is similar to the approaches of QTL mapping and genomic selection  where the objective is to predict genetic variance at one or more unobserved QTL. In those approaches  it has been shown that using an IBD-based method to predict genetic variance at the unobserved QTL is beneficial when the LD between the marker(s) and the QTL is low  while this benefit disappears when the LD increases [  ]. In our study we ignored the non-segregating SNP markers  as these markers are fixed in the simulated population and show no variation. This can be compared with common practice where base pairs for which no SNP markers are detected are considered uninformative. However  we do not know whether this variation was never there or existed in earlier generations and disappeared. In the latter case  these base pairs indicate a genetic diversity of 0  and should not be ignored. In addition  when non-segregating markers are used in another population  they might show variation and become informative. However  the correlations between the different estimates for genetic diversity as estimated in this paper are unlikely to be influenced by the exclusion of non-segregating markers. In this study  the estimation of genetic diversity was done for a neutral genome without selection. The correlation between genetic diversity estimates and true genetic diversity was weak  but might increase if adaptive trait variation is taken into account. The availability of dense marker maps has opened up new possibilities to identify reduced or increased levels of variability on specific regions of the genome  associated to functional genes []. In case of selection  larger regions with less variation can be found on the genome [] and a better prediction of the genetic diversity is possible. How well the two methods predict genetic diversity depends on the variation in diversity between adjacent markers. In contrast to GD_IBD  the heterozygosity estimates assume that diversity is similar for adjacent markers and for instance ignore recombination. When regions of the genome form 'haplotype blocks'  adjacent markers have (near) identical diversity. In this case  heterozygosity will better predict the genetic diversity. This was seen when we simulated a population with an effective population size of 100 instead of 1000  and 'haplotype blocks' occurred due to the loss of variation. In this population the correlation between the heterozygosity estimate H_AVG and the true genetic diversity was higher compared to the correlation between GD_IBD and the true genetic diversity (0.97 and 0.90  respectively). However  when a population contains more variation  diversity in between markers can be missed by heterozygosity  as heterozygosity is only based on the variation of the markers itself. In that situation  GD_IBD also takes into account the variation and possible recombination in between markers  and is then expected to be a better estimator of the genetic diversity over the genome. Consequently  as shown in this study the method of choice will also depend on the marker density [  ]  with high marker densities (i.e. > 50 markers per cM) heterozygosity is likely to perform better  with lower marker densities (i.e. <10 markers per cM) GD_IBD is likely to perform better. In conclusion  the IBD-based method and heterozygosity used to estimate genetic diversity of ungenotyped regions of the genome (i.e. between markers) give similar results for a simulated population with a high marker density. However  for a population with a lower marker density  the IBD-based method gives a better prediction  since variation and recombination between markers are missed with heterozygosity. IBD-based methods can provide more insight in the genetic diversity of specific regions of the genome  and subsequently contribute to select more accurately the animals to be conserved  for example  to construct a gene bank.

This article reviews the main  infection models and chicken lines studied under a historical perspective and then the candidate genes and QTL identified so far. Salmonellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative enteric bacterium . More than 2500 serotypes have been described  mostly belonging to the species []. Some  serotypes can infect a broad range of domestic animals including poultry  sheep  cattle and pigs and cause symptoms of varying severity ranging from mild gastro-enteritis to death. Some of these serotypes  such as  Typhimurium and  Enteritidis  can infect humans. Other serotypes are host-specific  infecting a single species and generally causing severe  typhoid-like symptoms sometimes leading to death (for instance   Gallinarum and  Pullorum in poultry). These serotypes can be responsible for disease outbreaks leading to severe economic losses. Prophylactic measures  vaccination and use of antibiotics are insufficient to eradicate salmonellosis in poultry stocks  whatever the serotype involved. In this context  selection of more resistant chickens can be considered as an alternative solution to decrease occurrence of the disease. The first selection experiments at the beginning of the 20 century aimed to decrease disease occurrence in poultry production systems  which was mainly caused by  Pullorum and  Gallinarum. As food safety became an important concern and these host-specific serotypes were better controlled  the interest of researchers and breeders extended towards decreasing food contamination  mainly due to the serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium.  Enteritidis alone  which infects the eggs of contaminated hens  is responsible for one third of the human food poisoning cases in France [] and of about 15% in the UK in 2007 . It does not cause severe symptoms in poultry  but the eggs and meat of infected animals can become a reservoir of infection for the human consumer. In particular  asymptomatic carriers have a major role in  propagation in poultry and hence in food contamination  since they cannot be easily identified and isolated. This is the reason why today resistance to carrier-state ability  and not only to general salmonellosis resistance  is taken into account by some breeders and researchers. Simulation studies demonstrate the usefulness of rearing animals more resistant to carrier state in the prevention of disease propagation in poultry  in synergy with vaccination []. Experiments for the selection of genetically resistant animals can be traced back as early as the 1930's [  ] and the first step was the demonstration that distinct disease resistances or susceptibilities exist between different lines or breeds of chicken. The second step consisted in evaluating the heritability of disease resistance-related traits  which confirmed that the observed variability among lines had a genetic origin [–]. Next  genomic regions responsible for the observed genetic variability were identified  which provided a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in resistance and should theoretically lead to marker-assisted selection (MAS). MAS can potentially accelerate the selection process  and prevent infection of animals. To date  two different approaches have been used successfully to unravel the genetic control of disease resistance variability  i.e. (1) candidate gene approaches with  knowledge of the genes potentially involved (for instance  [–]) and (2) quantitative approaches through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses  which have been conducted since the development of molecular markers in the 1990's [–]. A final step towards obtaining more resistant animals is selection itself  with or without the contribution of molecular markers. The feasibility of selection for increased resistance to  Enteritidis carrier-state has been demonstrated []. Nevertheless  molecular markers still have to be included in the selection process  in order to take advantage of the recent knowledge acquired on genetic resistance mechanisms. In this article  we review the literature on studies aimed at identifying the genes responsible for variable resistance to salmonellosis in chicken. The article is organised as follows: (1) the different  infection models  (2) the genetic resources used  (3) the candidate gene approaches  (4) the QTL analyses conducted and (5) the co-localisations occurring between candidate genes and QTL. Many different  infection protocols are described in the literature. Here  we focus on the protocols that have been used for genetic studies. Many factors have to be taken into account to assess  resistance i.e. infectious doses   serotypes and strains  route and age of infection  delay between infection and phenotypic observations  and the animal rearing conditions. In addition  different parameters can be measured: survival rate  lethal dose leading to 50% of dead animals (LD50)  internal organ contamination  presence/absence of    count  etc. The main infection models used to identify genes for resistance to  are summarized in Table . At the beginning of the 20 century  the breeder's main objective was to reduce mortality in industrial poultry stocks. For practical reasons   resistance assessment was carried out on young chicks (1 day to 2 weeks). Chicks are more susceptible to salmonellosis than adults  so that discrimination among animals was evaluated via their survival rates. Chicks were infected with a high dose of the serotypes that were known to cause the most severe symptoms in infected chicken  i.e.  Pullorum   Gallinarum and  Typhimurium [    –]. Some studies also reported infection of hens at peak of lay []  because the possibility of vertical transmission of bacteria to eggs was already a concern. Different infection routes were used according to the study: oral [–]  intraperitoneal []  or subcutaneous []. With the improvement of alternative disease control practices  such as chemotherapy  competitive exclusion  prophylactic measures  use of antibiotics and vaccination  disease outbreaks in poultry stocks were reduced and the interest in selection for  resistance decreased. In the 1980s  the number of human food poisoning outbreaks increased  mainly due to  Enteritidis  which renewed the interest to select more resistant animals. Several studies aimed at comparing the effects of different serotypes on mortality rates  and of the route of inoculation (intramuscular or oral) were carried out on day-old chicks [–]. A few studies assessed the carrier state of chickens infected with  Enteritidis  since symptom-less carriers are the main cause of disease propagation in poultry. In such studies  the persistence of bacteria in infected chickens has to be assessed several weeks post-infection. Guillot et al. [] infected day-old chicks with high doses (orally or intra-muscularly) but followed the persistence of bacteria in several internal organs  in addition to measuring mortality. Duchet-Suchaux et al. [  ] developed a model in which one week-old chicks were orally infected with a smaller dose of bacteria  thus preventing mortality and disease symptoms  in order to observe the persistence of bacteria in different organs several weeks after infection. The carrier-state in adult chickens has been less well studied. Protais et al. [] and Lindell et al. [] orally infected adult hens at peak of lay and followed the persistence of bacteria in different organs. In the above studies   resistance was assessed by observing survival rates or quantities or presence/absence of bacteria in different organs. In more recent studies  indirect  linked parameters have been used to characterise  resistance: innate or adaptive immunity-related traits [–]  antibody response after a . Enteritidis vaccine [  ]  or gene expression by genome-wide  microarray analyses [–] or more targeted studies focusing on one or several genes [–]. Observation of these traits contributes to a better understanding of the immunological and transcriptional mechanisms involved in resistance differences between lines. The first step towards the identification of resistance genes is to choose and mate parental lines that differ in  resistance levels. Phenotypic variation is very high in poultry. For research purposes  inbred lines derived from selected breeds are the material of choice because of their higher rate of homozygosity and their relationship to actual commercial breeds. The first published studies at the beginning of the 20 century reported comparisons of different layer lines  i.e. mainly White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red lines [    –]. Most of these studies mention the greater resistance of the Rhode Island Red compared to the White Leghorn lines. The following studies used inbred or partially inbred lines generated from commercial layer or broiler lines. Mortalities after  Typhimurium or  Enteritidis infection of the inbred lines N  C  15I  Wl  6  7 and 0  all derived from White Leghorn layer lines  have been compared [–  ]. Lines C  7 and 15I were always more susceptible  whereas lines N  6 and Wl were always more resistant to infection. This line ranking was identical whatever the serotype used. Mortality and persistence of bacteria in internal organs were compared in the experimental White Leghorn inbred lines B13 and Y11  in the meat-type experimental line Y11  and in a commercial line (L2) [–]. Some studies used lines which were especially selected to study disease resistance: for instance  divergent lines for low/high antibody response []. The effects of genetic differences in resistance to  can be investigated by studying traits related to the immune response on different chicken lines. Heterophil functionality has been measured in several commercial lines of birds differing in their resistance to  Enteritidis [–]. Crop immune response has been measured in eight commercial layer hens and White Leghorn chickens []. Some studies report genetic differences for the antibody response to . Enteritidis [    ]. Similarly  many studies report gene expression differences between different chicken lines after artificial infection  identified by genome-wide  microarray analyses [–] or more targeted studies focusing on one or several genes [–]. Other studies used lines selected for other traits (such as growth rate or feed conversion efficiency [  ])  which makes it possible to investigate the interaction between the main trait under study and  resistance. A candidate gene approach requires  knowledge of the genes potentially involved in  resistance. The first candidate gene tested in chicken was chosen on the basis of genetic studies carried out in mice infected by  Typhimurium. This gene   (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein  now )  has been identified on mouse chromosome 1  under the name Ity (Immunity to Typhimurium)  after mice strains were classified into two categories: resistant vs. susceptible  as reviewed in []. The identity of Ity with two other genes  Bcg and Lsh  involved in resistance to  respectively   and   was demonstrated after the positional cloning of a unique gene  [].  has since been described as a member of a solute carrier gene family and hence renamed . Physiological and functional studies support the role of  in the control of the intracellular replication of parasites in phagosomes. A homologue of  has been mapped on chicken chromosome 7 [  ] and cloned subsequently []. Another major gene   (Toll-like receptor 4)  previously named   belongs to a family of innate immune system receptors (Toll-like receptors) and is involved in the recognition of LPS (lipo-polysaccharide) from Gram-negative bacteria.  was mapped to mouse chromosome 4 after analysis of mouse strain C3H/HeJ which has both a hypo-responsiveness to LPS motifs and a higher susceptibility to  Typhimurium. Positional cloning of  led to the identification of  as a positional candidate. The chicken homologue of  has been mapped to micro-chromosome 17 and cloned []. Several studies have attempted to determine whether  and  are involved in resistance variation to  Typhimurium and  Enteritidis. The survival rate of young chicks derived from a backcross between lines W1 and C and infected intra-muscularly one day post-hatch with  Typhimurium was linked to  and   which  together  explained up to 33% of the differential resistance to infection [  ]. This effect was observed only during the first seven days post-infection. An effect of  on the early stages of systemic  infection using day-old chicks was confirmed in five groups of meat-type chickens [] and in F1 progenies derived from crosses between a broiler line and Fayoumi or MHC-congenic lines [  ]. Since human  infection is mainly due to the consumption of eggs or meat from adult chickens  commercial egg-type chickens intravenously infected with  Enteritidis have also been studied but at 13 weeks instead of at a young age []. Similarly  it has been demonstrated that a marker closely linked to  displayed a within-sire effect on liver and spleen load assessed early (three days post-infection)  which confirms the possible involvement of  early in the process of systemic infection in these chicken lines  although infection occurred at an older age. Following bacterial contamination several weeks after infection is the only way of studying the  carrier-state. Thus  the potential role of  in later stages of the infection was demonstrated  firstly in mice inoculated with  Enteritidis at 8-10 weeks with spleen bacterial counts  42 days post-infection []. Interestingly  it seems that different  alleles were involved in early vs. late resistance. The same allele may be involved both in resistance to colonisation in early stages of the infection and in a high excretion rate in later stages. Similarly  an effect of  on spleen contamination was then demonstrated in chicken lines orally inoculated at peak of lay and slaughtered four weeks later []  while in the same study the role of   although suspected  was not confirmed. More recently  the effect of the  locus was found significantly associated with carrier-state resistance variations in divergent chick lines []. In addition to these two genes  many genes related to immune response in chicken have been tested for their association with caecal or splenic load after  Enteritidis challenge of one-day- to three-week-old chicks (Table ; [      –]). Other studies have focused on the antibody response to  Enteritidis vaccination [–]. These studies exploit either polymorphisms found in the gene itself (mainly SNP) or closely associated genetic markers. Most of these genes have been tested in progenies derived from crosses between White Leghorn MHC-congenic inbred lines and inbred Fayoumi lines. Such crosses between genetically distant parental lines are an efficient way of maximising genetic variation. However  genes identified in this way may be fixed in other populations  so that their interest for selection purposes needs to be validated. Many genes have been identified in gene expression studies. Most of them are probably not directly responsible for the actual genetic variation between these lines  but they remain functional candidates until they are tested for their role in genetic variation. Genome-wide microarray studies have led to the identification of genes differentially expressed between different chicken lines infected with . Enteritidis [–  ] or before/after infection with  Enteritidis [    ]. Other genes have been more specifically studied  such as for instance genes coding for cytokines [  ]  Toll-like receptors [    ] or innate immune response genes []. Targeted candidate gene analyses have very rarely led to the complete unravelling of the heritable part of phenotypic variations. On the contrary  QTL analyses are designed to encompass the greatest part possible of the observed variability  with the inconvenience that the genomic regions identified are anonymous and often contain several hundred genes. Until now  few QTL studies have been carried out to identify genes for acute resistance or resistance to carrier-state in chicken (Table ). The first QTL study of  resistance analysed data from a back-cross progeny produced from White Leghorn inbred lines ((6 × 15I) × 15I) and infected at two weeks of age with  Typhimurium []. A major QTL controlling spleen bacterial load was identified on chromosome 5 and named .  was shown to be involved in bacterial clearance by macrophages []. Using a 6 generation backcross mapping population and high density SNP panels  the  locus was confirmed and its localisation was refined at a position between 54.0 and 54.8 Mb on the long arm of chromosome 5 []. This region spans 14 genes  including two very striking functional candidates: CD27-binding protein (Siva) and the RAC-alpha serine/threonine protein kinase homolog  AKT1 (protein kinase B  PKB). AKT1 is involved in cellular survival pathways  primarily by inhibiting apoptotic processes. Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating AKT1  which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery. AKT1 can also activate NF-<U+03BA>B by regulating I<U+03BA>B kinase (IKK)  resulting in transcription of pro-survival genes and stimulation of pro-inflammatory responses []. Hijacking of this pathway by the  effector protein SopB provides support for  as a plausible candidate gene for bacterial proliferation and its association with the susceptibility/resistance status of the host. QTL for carrier-state resistance have been identified in one back-cross and one F2 progeny  both derived from the White Leghorn inbred lines 6 and N  infected at one week post-infection with either  Typhiumurium (BC) or  Enteritidis (F2) and assessed for their caecal and caecal lumen content bacterial loads two to six weeks later []. One genome-wise significant QTL on chromosome 2 and five chromosome-wise significant QTL on chromosomes 1  5  11 and 16 were identified (Table ; Figure ). Some QTL were specific to one of the two progenies studied (BC vs. F2)  which can be attributed to differences in the progeny types  the serotypes used for infection  or the times of infection and phenotypic assessments. Different QTL were found for the caecal bacterial load and the caecal lumen bacterial load. Two of these QTL  on chromosomes 2 and 16  have recently been confirmed in a more targeted analysis of the same progeny []. Interestingly  two QTL on chromosomes 1 and 16 were validated in a completely different genetic background  i.e. lines derived from commercial chicken lines []. Thus  genetic studies conducted on experimental lines can be of potential interest for marker-assisted selection in commercial lines. Furthermore  two different sets of QTL and candidate genes have been confirmed in adult chickens and in chicks derived from the same commercial line  which strengthens the hypothesis of a genetic control of  carrier-state differing according to chicken's age previously formulated [].   . Mapchart 2.1 software was used to draw this map []. Positions are indicated in Mb. QTL positions are indicated by plain black boxes to the right of chromosomes; their length was calculated to cover 20 cM centered on the QTL likelihood peak. ABR: antibody response; SE:  Enteritidis; ST:  Typhimurium. Other studies have more specifically focused on the antibody response to  Enteritidis vaccination. Associations were found between microsatellite markers and traits related to the antibody response to  Enteritidis vaccination  from data obtained respectively from BC and F2 progenies derived from inbred lines selected for high/low antibody response and from F1 families derived from crosses between a broiler and either MHC-congenic White Leghorn lines or the Fayoumi line [  ]. Nevertheless  the significant microsatellites identified were not located in the same genomic regions. This could be due to genetic differences between the parental lines studied  but also to differences in the experimental conditions (Table ). The time of assessment and possibly the vaccine used were different and may have influenced the outcome of infection. The different candidate genes  QTL and microsatellites significantly linked to  resistance are shown in Figure . These loci are located on 16 of the 38 autosomal chromosomes of the chicken genome. Microchromosomes are poorly represented  due to the lack of genetic markers and genome sequences in these regions. Genomic co-localisations reveal a possible common genetic background explaining variations for resistance under different experimental conditions. Genetic or physical co-localisations indicate the possibility of the co-localised loci being identical  although the possibility of close physical linkage between adjacent genes should obviously never be discarded. Three types of genetic co-localisations can be observed between the candidate genes and the  resistance QTL mentioned above. First  several co-localisations occur between QTL for antibody response-related traits [] and candidate immune-response genes: two on chromosome 1  one on chromosome 3  and one on chromosome 6. Before the immunity-related genes can be considered as relevant candidates for the co-localising QTL  ideally they should be tested in the same conditions as the QTL with which they co-localise  i.e. in particular with the same phenotypic trait  in the same or similar progeny  using the same  serotype under the same infection or vaccination model. The absence of other potentially relevant candidates should also be verified in the QTL confidence intervals. Secondly  a cluster can be observed on chromosome 5  including two QTL for resistance to  Enteritidis and  Typhimurium []  one QTL for the antibody response to  Enteritidis vaccination []  the QTL  and the  gene. It is theoretically possible that all these QTL are actually the same gene  although the refined  locus does not include []. The molecular cloning of   which is so far the QTL with the most important effect identified  would solve this question. Finally  a co-localisation involves the MHC on micro-chromosome 16 and a  Enteritidis carrier-state QTL []. Due to the high density of immunity-related genes and to the poor recombination rate observed on this chromosome  identifying which gene is the causal gene at this QTL will not be easy. Several candidate genes and QTL have been successfully identified as having roles in phenotypic variations related to  resistance. Despite the many differences in infection models and genetic materials used and in traits assessed  which make the comparison of these loci somewhat speculative  great progress has been achieved in the last few years to understand the genetic control of resistance to . The diverse experimental conditions used lead to a complex sum of results  but allow a more complete description of the disease. Resistance to salmonellosis and  carrier state varies according to the chicken line under study  the chicken's age  and the trait assessed  and probably many other parameters which have not been studied yet. Comparisons of the different models used raise many questions. In particular  the genetic differences between acute and carrier-state resistance and the influence of the chicken's age on resistance are interesting theoretical issues which still need to be investigated thoroughly before selection is considered. The genomic regions carrying the candidate genes  and   the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and the QTL   identified using several infection models  are interesting candidates for more in-depth studies. With the development of high-throughput technologies such as microarray expression analyses and RNA-seq []  new-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and high density SNP genotyping  a huge quantity of differentially expressed candidate genes and polymorphisms is already available  which should speed up the unravelling of the  resistance genetic mechanisms. The most limiting factors are and will clearly remain the frequent and inevitable lack of precision and reliability of phenotypic assessments and the poor density of genetic recombinations in the progenies under study  which both limit the precision of QTL localisation and fine-mapping. Another limiting step resides in the choice of the relevant differentially expressed genes to be tested for their involvement in genetic variation. All these studies will no doubt lead to a large number of genes or genome regions involved in  resistance variation and extend our theoretical knowledge of the genetic control of this disease. However  for practical applications  i.e. to implement marker assisted selection in commercial populations  it will be important to identify which of these genes are the most important. The answer will vary according to the chicken population under study and the selection criteria used  which clearly is an obstacle to practical application. Genomic selection may soon settle this matter by the direct selection of resistance-related traits in populations under selection. This new knowledge of the genetic architecture of  resistance in fowl  in addition to genomic selection  could soon lead to the selection of more resistant animals. Combined with other measures  it should contribute in reducing the spread of the disease in commercial flocks.

The proposed method is computationally very efficient and suitable for marker-assisted breeding value estimation in large livestock populations including effects of a number of known QTL. Marker-assisted breeding value estimation using predicted haplotypes increases accuracy especially for traits with low heritability. In livestock  many QTL regions have been identified for quantitative traits []. In some cases  fine mapping has also led to the detection of causative mutations  e.g. DGAT1 in dairy cattle for milk yield and milk composition [  ] and IGF2 in pigs for body weight []. In breeding programs these QTL-regions can be utilized in marker-assisted selection (MAS). Three types of markers can be used: markers in linkage equilibrium with the QTL (LE-MAS)  markers in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL (LD-MAS) and the causative mutation itself as in gene-assisted selection (GAS). GAS leads to the highest genetic gain  because no recombination exists between the marker and QTL []. However  identifying the gene is not easy and is resource demanding []. The amount of QTL variation explained by markers in LD-MAS can be increased by increasing the marker density and thereby increasing the LD between markers and QTL. Alternatively  combining alleles of different marker loci into haplotypes is expected to increase the proportion of captured QTL variance as well. Based on data of a whole genome scan with 9323 SNP-markers in Angus cattle  Hayes . [] have reported that 4 and 6-marker haplotypes increased the accuracy of MAS more than the single marker in highest LD with the QTL. However  2-marker haplotypes performed worse than the best marker. One of the challenges when applying MAS in livestock populations is that often a large part of the population is not genotyped  i.e. some animals have only phenotypes  some have only genotypes and others have both genotypes and phenotypes. Several methods have been proposed to overcome these differences. For LE-MAS  one would like to apply a method that uses identity-by-descent (IBD) information of haplotypes to properly account for relationships between haplotypes of related animals and to account for phase differences between markers and QTL in different families []. Creation of inverse IBD-matrices is  however  very time consuming []. With high-density SNP-chips  LD-MAS can be applied without having to use IBD-matrices. With LD-MAS  either flanking markers or identical-by-state haplotypes (IBS) can be used in marker-assisted breeding value estimation. When using flanking markers in MAS  genotype probabilities could be calculated with iterative peeling methods [–] but these are time consuming. Gengler . [  ] have proposed a straightforward and quick method to predict genotype probabilities and gene contents for bi-allelic markers using a mixed model methodology  where gene content is the number of positive (negative) alleles (i.e. 2  1  0 for AA  Aa  aa). For ungenotyped animals  the accuracy of predicted gene contents is similar whether mixed model equations or single-marker iterative peeling are used [  ]. Gengler . [] suggested that the method can also be applied in the case of multi-allelic markers. Multi-marker IBS haplotypes can be considered as a special form of multi-allelic markers  making the mixed model methodology a candidate method to predict haplotypes for ungenotyped animals. The objective of this article is to develop a method to predict haplotypes of animals that are not genotyped using mixed model equations and to investigate the effect of using those predicted haplotypes on the accuracy of marker-assisted breeding value estimation. The method is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation  varying haplotype length  heritability of the trait and distance between the markers. The method is compared to gene-assisted and conventional breeding value estimation  which yield  respectively  the upper and lower limit of accuracy. Consider a situation where a QTL-region is mapped for a trait  without having identified the causative mutation and where some animals in the population are genotyped for SNP-markers in that region  but most of them are not genotyped  which is very common in animal breeding populations. In this study we would like to use IBS-haplotypes in marker-assisted breeding value estimation. When the haplotype is based on the single SNP-marker closest to the QTL  the method of Gengler . [  ] can be used to predict the missing 'gene content'  the number of A-alleles  if there are A and a-alleles. The method of Gengler . [  ] uses the additive genetic relationship matrix in a mixed model setting to predict the gene contents of those animals not genotyped based on genotyped relatives. This method can not be applied directly for haplotypes based on multiple markers  because discrete haplotypes can not be directly constructed based on predicted continuous gene contents of SNP-markers for ungenotyped animals. However  this procedure can be easily modified to apply to a situation with haplotypes based on multiple markers. Consider that haplotypes are based on two bi-allelic markers  one on each side of the QTL. There are four possible haplotypes. For every genotyped animal  one can infer how many copies it carries for each haplotype ( = number of haplotype copies)  which is 0  1 or 2 (see Table  for a small example). This is in essence the same as the 'gene content' for a bi-allelic locus and the same mixed model methodology with the additive genetic relationship matrix can be applied to predict the  for each haplotype for the ungenotyped animals. In the case of  haplotypes this can be modeled as: where is the number of copies of haplotype  (which is 0  1 or 2 effectively)   is the population mean number of copies of haplotype   is the EBV for and  is the residual of . Although  for each animal  it is assumed that the haplotypes are independent from each other; therefore  univariate mixed model analyses can be performed. Analogous to gene contents for a bi-allelic locus []  this can be formulated in mixed model matrix notation as: where  is a vector of ones   is a design matrix linking  with   is the inverse additive genetic relationship matrix   is the variance ratio of residual variance and additive genetic variance for  allowing for a small proportion of genotyping and haplotyping errors or recombination    is a vector with the EBV for  with for genotyped animals and for ungenotyped animals  is a vector with observed  of genotyped animals and is set to missing for ungenotyped animals. The heritability assumed for  is 0.99. Basically  with no genotyping or haplotyping errors   (the predicted ) should be equal to the phenotype (the true ) for genotyped animals  implying a heritability of 1.0. In the case of haplotypes  recombinant haplotypes can be transmitted from one parent to its offspring. In such a case  the recombinant haplotype can not be fully explained in the model by the haplotypes of the parent. This decreases the parent-offspring regression  i.e. decreasing the heritability. Here we set the heritability to 0.99 to allow for some small proportions of genotyping and haplotyping errors and recombination. Preliminary analysis showed no effect when the heritability was changed to 0.95. To include the effects of the haplotypes to perform marker-assisted breeding value estimation using best linear unbiased prediction (MABLUP)  these  can be used as covariables in random regression  where inclusion as a random effect is preferred so that effects will be regressed towards zero when there is hardly any phenotypic information  e.g. a certain haplotype appears only in one animal with a phenotypic record. Assuming no other systematic environmental effects  the model is as follows: where  is the phenotype   is the overall mean and modeled as a fixed effect  is the random polygenic EBV    which is the predicted number of copies of haplotype   is the random regression coefficient for haplotype  and  is the residual. In matrix notation the model can be summarized as: where  and  are the design matrices for fixed effects and polygenic breeding values  respectively  the matrix  contains the  for all haplotypes  and are respectively the variance ratios for the polygenic breeding values and the random regression on    is the vector with solutions for fixed effects (in this case only the mean)  is the vector with and is the vector with . The variance of is  (see Appendix for derivation)  where  is the additive genetic QTL-variance  and the variance of is   where  is the additive genetic variance due to the polygenic effect. Equations () and () can be considered as a generalization of the method by Gengler . [  ] to multi-allelic markers and haplotypes. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the method. The simulation scheme represented a nested full-sib half-sib design (multiple offspring per mating and dam nested within sire) with discrete generations which is common in commercial animal breeding programs. The simulation scheme was identical to that reported in Mulder . []. One trait was simulated with additive genetic effects of one bi-allelic QTL   a polygenic additive genetic effect and a residual effect  ( = + +). All animals had phenotypic records. Because the method of MABLUP relies on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTL  first  100 generations of random mating were performed prior to the data collection scheme (generation 101 - 105). In the first 100 generations  50 sires and 50 dams were randomly mated each generation. The QTL and 20 bi-allelic markers were placed on one 1 M long chromosome. The QTL was placed in the middle of the chromosome and the markers were equally spaced  their distance varying from 0.1 to 5 cM. The QTL was in the middle of the marker bracket between marker 10 and 11. In the founder generation  all markers and the QTL were in linkage equilibrium and had a fixed allele frequency of 0.5. The QTL-variance  was set to 15% of the total genetic variance  when the allele frequency is 0.5. The allele substitution effect was set to   assuming that the allele frequencies  and  are 0.5  which is the case in the founder generation. Recombination rates were calculated using Haldane's mapping function []. During these 100 generations  some markers or the QTL became fixed due to drift. After establishing LD  from generation 101 onwards and for each generation 50 sires and 250 dams were selected based on conventional BLUP-EBV (Equation () without haplotype effects) and randomly mated to produce 2 000 offspring. Each sire was mated to five dams and each dam produced four male and four female offspring  resulting in that each sire had 40 half-sib offspring  five full-sib groups of eight full-sibs. A total of five generations of phenotypic data (generation 101 - 105) were created and used in breeding value estimation (10 000 animals in total). The animals of generation 101 served as base generation in the pedigree. The generations 102 - 104 were used to create linkage disequilibrium due to selection []. In generation 101  simulated polygenic effects were sampled from (0  )  where  is the polygenic genetic variance. In subsequent generations polygenic effects were sampled from (0.5 + 0.5   0.5  (1 - ))  where is the average inbreeding coefficient of the parents. Inbreeding coefficients were calculated using the Meuwissen and Luo [] algorithm. Residual effects were sampled from (0  )  where  is the residual variance. The overall heritability was set to 0.03  0.10 or 0.30  while the QTL explained 15% of the total genetic variance when the allele frequency was 0.5 as it was in the founder generation. The phenotypic variance was 1.0 in all situations when the allele frequency of the QTL was 0.5. The realized variance of the QTL was lower due to deviations of the allele frequency from 0.5 and re-estimated in generation 101. Results were based on 200 effective replicates after discarding the replicates with minor allele frequency of the QTL in the last generation (generation 105) less than 0.05. Averaged over all effective replicates  the average allele frequency of the negative QTL-allele was 0.63 in generation 101 before selection started and deviated from 0.5  because in replicates with allele frequencies closer to 0  the QTL was more likely to become fixed in generations 101-105 due to selection. The used parameter values are listed in Table . In this study we used three types of haplotypes: 1) the closest neighboring left marker of the QTL is used as a single-marker haplotype (NM)  2) both flanking markers closest to the QTL-locus are used to form a 2-marker haplotype (HAP2) and 3) on both sides the two markers closest to the QTL are used to form a 4-marker haplotype (HAP4). In the case of NM  Equation () and () reduced to the method by Gengler . [  ] with the difference that in this case it was not the causative mutation  but a linked marker. In addition   =   where  is the allele substitution effect (see equation A1 in the Appendix)  because we modeled only one SNP marker allele. The markers chosen to form haplotypes had minor allele frequencies of at least 5% in generation 105. Haplotypes were known from the simulation and thus  phasing was not needed. In generation 105  the breeding program starts with MABLUP according to Equation () and () using the three different haplotype methods. We simulated three genotyping scenarios: (1) only sires and males in the last generation are genotyped and (default) (2) all males are genotyped and (3) all animals are genotyped. In scenario 1 and 2  females are not genotyped. In addition to MABLUP  gene-assisted BLUP (GABLUP) and conventional BLUP (CONBLUP) are also performed for comparison. For GABLUP  it is assumed that all animals are genotyped for the QTL. For GABLUP the model is equal to Equation ()  with the difference that the true gene content is used as  and the variance is the same as for NM. For CONBLUP  Equation () is used without regression on  and the variance of the additive genetic effect is set to . For all evaluations  mixed model equations were solved using MiX99  which makes use of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm []. The mixed model equations were considered converged when the relative difference between the left-hand and right-hand sides of the mixed model equations was smaller than 1.0 * 10. Accuracies were calculated as correlations between estimated and true breeding values. The QTL-EBV was calculated as  for each animal. The total EBV was calculated as the sum of the QTL-EBV and the polygenic EBV. Accuracies of MABLUP were compared to those of GABLUP and CONBLUP. The accuracies of GABLUP and CONBLUP can be considered as the upper and lower limits for the MABLUP accuracy. In addition  regressions of true breeding values on estimated breeding values were calculated to get an idea of the over- (regression coefficient < 1.0) or underestimation (regression coefficient > 1.0) of the variance of EBV. Bias of estimated breeding values was calculated as estimated breeding values minus true breeding values. In addition  accuracies of  were calculated as correlations between estimated and true  and regressions of true on estimated  were calculated. The proportion of QTL-variance explained by the three different haplotypes NM  HAP2 and HAP4 was calculated to assess whether using IBS-haplotypes was suitable. The proportion of QTL-variance explained by the haplotypes is also a measure of linkage disequilibrium between the haplotype and the QTL. For NM  the  between the marker and the QTL can be calculated as the squared correlation between them []. For multi-allelic haplotypes  such as HAP2 and HAP4   was calculated according to Equation () in Hayes . []  based on an equation for multi-allelic markers by Zhao . []. Table  shows the mean  standard deviation and mean square error (MSE) for predicted number of haplotype copies () for ungenotyped animals as a function of the true number of haplotype copies. For all three methods  the predicted  increased with the true  and a clear distinction was made in  between animals carrying the haplotype or not. For genotyped animals the predicted  closely resembled the true . For ungenotyped animals  the absolute numbers decreased from NM towards HAP4  due to regression to the mean and the mean  decreased from NM towards HAP4  albeit the difference between homozygotic carrier and non-carrier is largest for HAP4. As a consequence  the MSE increased with increasing true  for HAP2 and HAP4 and for HAP4 more than for HAP2. In general  the mean  decreased with the frequency of the haplotype (results not shown). Table  shows the accuracy of predicted  and the regression of true  on predicted  for ungenotyped females. The accuracy decreased from NM towards HAP4  especially for HAP4  due to recombination between genotyped ancestors and ungenotyped offspring. Especially for HAP4  the accuracy decreased when the marker distance increased  which is again due to a higher probability of recombination (results not shown). The regression of true  on predicted  was approximately 1 for NM and HAP2  but somewhat lower for HAP4  due to the lower accuracy. Figure  shows the mean proportion of QTL variance (r) explained by the haplotype as a function of marker distance. For all three methods  r decreased with increasing marker distance. The HAP4 method captured most of the QTL variance and NM the least. Figure  shows the frequency distribution of r values for the three methods at a marker density of 0.1 cM. It shows that HAP4 had the highest proportion of replicates with r values between 0.90 and 1.00. With NM and HAP2  a substantial proportion of replicates had r values below 20% indicating that the haplotype explained very little QTL-variance. .

Table  shows the accuracies of QTL-EBV  polygenic EBV and total EBV for genotyped males and ungenotyped females under different genotyping scenarios with the three methods of MABLUP when the marker distance was 0.1 cM. The accuracy of polygenic and total EBV hardly changed when the number of genotyped animals increased. The accuracy of QTL-EBV increased only slightly with an increasing number of genotyped animals. This means that the use of predicted haplotypes in MABLUP did not negatively affect the accuracy of EBV. Because of the small differences in accuracy  in the rest of the article we only show results under the scenario where sires and males in the last generation were genotyped. Figure  shows the accuracy of QTL-EBV (panel A and B) and total EBV (Panel C and D) for genotyped males (panel A and C) and ungenotyped females (panel B and D) as a function of marker distance using three different haplotype methods for MABLUP or using CONBLUP or GABLUP when all animals were genotyped. For genotyped males (Figure ) the accuracy of the QTL-EBV was between 0.22 and 0.90 for NM  HAP2 and HAP4 and 1.0 for GABLUP. Among the three haplotype methods  HAP4 had the highest accuracy and NM the lowest. The accuracy decreased with increasing marker distance and more rapidly for HAP4 than for NM  due to a decreasing proportion of QTL variance explained by the haplotypes (Figure ). For ungenotyped females (Figure )  the accuracy of the QTL-EBV was much lower than for genotyped males  between 0.15 and 0.57 for NM  HAP2 and HAP4  but with the same trends across marker distances as for genotyped animals. The MABLUP methods based on HAP2 and HAP4 were both able to increase substantially the accuracy of the total EBV of genotyped males in comparison to CONBLUP when the distance between the markers was small (Figure ). The accuracy of MABLUP with HAP4 approached the accuracy of gene-assisted BLUP when the marker distance was 0.1 cM or less. The advantage of MABLUP was negligible when the marker distance was large  e.g. 5 cM. For ungenotyped animals (Figure )  the increase in accuracy of total EBV of MABLUP over conventional BLUP was  however  negligible regardless of marker distance. .

Although the average accuracy of QTL-EBV was moderate to high for genotyped males when markers were separated by 0.1 cM  substantial variation existed between replicates (Figure ). Especially with NM  the variation between replicates was large and even negative accuracies were obtained  although in a very small proportion of the replicates (5.5% of replicates). With HAP4  accuracies of QTL-EBV were always positive and in 86.5% of the replicates larger than 0.80. With HAP2 this proportion equaled to 60% and with NM only to 30.5%. The figure clearly shows that HAP4 had not only the highest average accuracy  but also the least variation in accuracy of QTL-EBV. .

Table  shows the accuracies of QTL-EBV  polygenic EBV and total EBV for genotyped males and ungenotyped females using different values of heritability in the three MABLUP methods when the marker distance was 0.1 cM. The accuracy of QTL-EBV increased with increasing heritability  as expected. However  the increase in accuracy of total EBV of MABLUP methods in comparison to CONBLUP was largest with a low heritability. For ungenotyped animals  the increase in accuracy with MABLUP in comparison to CONBLUP was smaller  e.g. from 0.35 to 0.37 with HAP4 at a heritability of 0.03  but the increase in accuracy was negligible when the heritability was 0.30. HAP4 had in all cases the highest accuracies for QTL-EBV  polygenic EBV and total EBV  i.e. the ranking of the methods did not change. Table  shows the regression of true on estimated breeding values for different values of heritability for the three MABLUP methods when the marker distance was 0.1 cM for genotyped males and ungenotyped females. The regressions for QTL-EBV were substantially lower than 1.0 in the majority of the situations  except when the heritability was 0.03. This indicated that the variance of the QTL-effect was overestimated when the heritability was 0.10 and 0.30. HAP4 had regression coefficients closest to 1.0 indicating that in this case  overestimation was the smallest. Regressions for polygenic and total EBV were in most cases close to one. The variances of the polygenic EBV were slightly overestimated in all cases. The variances of the total EBV were slightly overestimated for genotyped males for CONBLUP and MABLUP and slightly underestimated for ungenotyped females with MABLUP  but overestimated with CONBLUP. Overall  the variance of total EBV was less biased with MABLUP than with CONBLUP. Table  shows the bias in estimated breeding values for different values of heritability using the three MABLUP methods and CONBLUP for genotyped males and ungenotyped females when the marker distance was 0.1 cM. The polygenic EBV were on average biased upwards and the QTL-EBV were biased downwards  or in other words the QTL-effects were underestimated  but the polygenic EBV absorbed this effect. The total EBV were biased upwards for all methods when the heritability was 0.10 and 0.30  due to the shift of the estimated mean in the model  which was caused by genetic trend due to selection and the change in allele frequency of the QTL. Bias was largest for NM  whereas HAP2 and HAP4 were similar. Without selection total EBV were unbiased (results not shown). There was hardly any difference in bias between genotyped males and ungenotyped females. Adding the overall mean to the EBV removed the bias in total EBV. It can be concluded that total EBV of MABLUP and EBV of CONBLUP were biased due to selection  but this bias did no affect the ranking of animals. In this study we developed a method to predict haplotypes of ungenotyped animals using pedigree information of genotyped animals in mixed model equations and we evaluated the use of these predicted haplotypes in marker-assisted BLUP. The method is an extension of Gengler . [  ] to multi-allelic markers or haplotypes. The method was evaluated with Monte Carlo simulation. Clearly the predicted number of haplotype copies was regressed towards the mean and more so than the gene contents in Gengler . [  ]  especially when the frequency of a certain haplotype was low  which is more likely with longer haplotypes because of an increasing number of haplotypes. When using only a neighbor marker  the predicted gene contents were in the same range as in Gengler . [  ]. Because of the almost-unity heritability the number of haplotype copies is hardly regressed towards the mean for genotyped animals. The accuracy of the predicted haplotypes was lower for HAP4 than for HAP2 and decreased with increasing marker distance due to the increased probability of recombination. Lowering the heritability might be an option  taking into account that the number of haplotype copies from parent to offspring is not fully heritable but subject to recombination. However  BLUP is very robust against changes in heritability and preliminary results showed no effect when the heritability was changed to 0.95. The 4-marker haplotype gave the best results in marker-assisted breeding value estimation. It captured 90% of the QTL-variance when markers were separated by 0.1 cM. Because of this high proportion of explained QTL-variance  the proportion of QTL-variance explained by the haplotype can not increase much  and therefore we did not consider longer haplotypes. Furthermore  longer haplotypes are more subject to recombination  decreasing the accuracy of predicted number of haplotype copies. Hayes . [] found that 6-marker haplotypes explained more QTL-variance than 4-marker haplotypes  but had much lower proportions of QTL-variance explained by the markers due to lower marker density and lower LD. Hayes . [] found that the increase in accuracy was much higher with haplotypes than with using a neighbor marker in agreement with this study. Calus . [] investigated the use of different definitions of haplotypes on the accuracy of genomic selection and found that with a high marker density the regression on single SNP worked almost as well as haplotypes with two markers. In their study all SNP were used for a single SNP regression  whereas in this study only one SNP was used to estimate the QTL-effect. This disfavored the neighbor marker method in our study  although the ranking of the alternatives is the same as in Calus . []. In the context of QTL fine-mapping  Grapes . [] found that single marker regression with 10 markers performed worse than an IBD-method using linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis information with a haplotype window of 10 markers  but single marker regression performed similarly when 20 markers were used. Zhao . [] found that the power of a model with regression on two or four SNP yielded higher power to detect QTL than 2- or 4-marker haplotypes. This suggests that ranking of methods for QTL mapping might be different than for accuracy of marker-assisted or genomic selection []. The proportion QTL-variance explained by the haplotypes or the neighbor marker () was higher than in Hayes . []. At marker distances ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 cM  estimated  in cattle populations have been found lower (~0.05 - 0.27) than those found in this simulation study [  –]. However  in pig and poultry populations higher  have been estimated (~0.20-0.50 in pigs and poultry) [  ]  resembling the observed  in our study. The  between neighbor marker and QTL or between pairs of markers followed the expected  based on distance in cM and the effective population size []. The lower  values found at short distance in cattle populations is probably due to much higher effective population sizes in the past  because LD at short distances reflects more the past effective population size []. As a consequence of lower LD at short distances in cattle  a higher SNP density than that used in this study is necessary to achieve in cattle the same accuracy of QTL-EBV as presented here. Haplotypes were assumed to be unrelated in this study and it was assumed that the same QTL-allele is linked to a certain haplotype (identity-by-state = IBS). Due to recombination  linkage phases between haplotypes and QTL may be different in different families. In the context of genomic selection  Calus . [] compared 2-marker IBS-haplotypes with 2- and 10-marker identity-by-descent haplotypes using combined linkage disequilibrium linkage analysis information (LDLA) to construct the inverse IBD-matrices. They found that IBD-haplotypes yielded higher accuracies  especially when using 10-marker windows  but at the cost of much higher computing time. The difference between IBS and IBD-haplotypes decreased with increasing marker density. Therefore  in our study it is unlikely that IBD-haplotypes would increase accuracy significantly when the distance between the markers is less than 0.1 cM. A major disadvantage of using haplotypes is the need to phase the data. Hayes . [] estimated the effect of haplotyping errors on the proportion of QTL-variance explained by the haplotypes in their data set and found a limited effect  but suggested that phasing errors are dependent on the data structure used. Accurate and fast algorithms are available for use in livestock populations [    ]. Windig and Meuwissen [] have shown that their algorithm is very fast and yields almost perfect haplotype reconstruction with dense marker maps in pedigreed populations. Its performance was similar to that of SIMWALK2 [] in terms of accuracy  but with a much lower computing time. Furthermore  the presented method can accommodate haplotyping errors  e.g. by adjusting the heritability of  to a lower value  albeit at the expense of a lower accuracy. The major advantage of the method used in this study is its computing efficiency  because optimized BLUP software can be used to predict haplotypes. The computation time was respectively ~4  6 and 10 s for neighboring marker (NM)  2-marker haplotypes (HAP2) and 4-marker haplotypes (HAP4) to predict the genotypes/haplotypes on a dual-processor 64-bit Windows PC with 2.40 GHz and 36 GB of RAM; programs were compiled for 32-bit. Therefore  breeding companies do not need other software for imputing genotypes  which is usually much slower and much more memory intensive  prohibiting its use for large populations  e.g. with more than a million animals. An additional advantage is that no assumptions are needed on where ungenotyped animals should appear in the pedigree  it can handle all possible scenarios. Therefore  the proposed method is very suitable for application of marker-assisted breeding value estimation in large populations  such as national evaluations in cattle. Also for genomic selection purposes the method is very useful  e.g. for 50 000 SNP-markers it would take only about two days on a single processor to predict all SNP-genotypes or haplotypes for a similar number of animals as in this study. The use of 4-marker haplotypes (HAP4) increased the accuracy of marker-assisted breeding value estimation substantially in comparison to conventional breeding value estimation for genotyped animals  but the benefit for ungenotyped animals was small in agreement with Mulder . []. However  with a low heritability  ungenotyped animals gained considerably in accuracy. This can be visualized by approximating the accuracy of the total EBV () as: where  is the proportion of genetic variance explained by the haplotypes (=   where  is the accuracy of the QTL-EBV and  is the amount of genetic variance explained by the QTL)   is the accuracy of the polygenic EBV and is the accuracy of the predicted number of haplotype copies. If we take the situation where the heritability is 0.03  the distance between markers is 0.1 cM and the QTL explains 15% of the genetic variance   is 0.34 (Table ) and we assume that  is 0.10 (assuming  = 0.8 (Table ))  then Equation () yields = 0.374  close to the value in Table . Using Equation ()  we can also quantify the benefit of genome-wide EBV for ungenotyped animals. Lets assume that we can explain 90% of the genetic variance by markers ( = 0.9)  then we can increase up to 0.58 assuming that  is constant. So even for ungenotyped animals genome-wide EBV can increase accuracy in comparison to conventional BLUP  especially for low heritability traits  when their paternal ancestors are genotyped. In this study we show that mixed model equations can be used to predict number of haplotype copies for ungenotyped animals and these predicted number of haplotype copies can be used in marker-assisted breeding value estimation. Four-marker haplotypes give the highest accuracy for total estimated breeding values. The accuracy of the total EBV increases for genotyped animals  but for ungenotyped animals the increase is marginal unless the heritability is smaller than 0.1. The method works best when the distance between the markers is less than 1 cM. The proposed method is computationally very efficient and suitable to apply for marker-assisted breeding value estimation in large livestock populations including effects of a number of known QTL. Marker-assisted breeding value estimation using predicted haplotypes increases accuracy especially for traits with low heritability. It is expected that genomic selection for ungenotyped animals using predicted haplotypes or marker genotypes will be beneficial especially for low heritable traits. Assuming that the haplotypes explain 100% of the QTL-variance  the variance of haplotype effects  used in Equation () can be calculated similarly to the variance when regressing on one bi-allelic marker/QTL: where  is the allele substitution effect   is the allele frequency of one of the two SNP-alleles. Extrapolating the result of Equation (A1) to  haplotypes yields: where is the frequency of haplotype . Assuming equal frequencies of all  haplotypes yields: The limit of Equation (A3) is: showing that the variance of haplotype  is half the additive genetic variance of the QTL with an infinite number of haplotypes. Although the result in Equation (A2) depends on haplotype frequencies and number of haplotypes  preliminary analyses showed that using the result of Equation (A4) yields high accuracies of QTL-EBV. Furthermore  these preliminary analyses showed that the accuracy of the QTL-EBV is insensitive to .

Three distinct methods were used to calculate MEBV: a Bayesian Method (BM)  Least Angle Regression (LARS) and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR). The accuracy of MEBV calculated with BM and LARS decreased when the number of simulated QTL increased. The accuracy decreased more when QTL had different variance values than when all QTL had an equal variance. The accuracy of MEBV calculated with PLSR was affected neither by the number of QTL nor by the distribution of QTL variance. Additional simulations and analyses showed that these conclusions were not affected by the number of individuals in the training population  by the number of markers and by the heritability of the trait. Results of this study show that the effect of the number of QTL and distribution of QTL variance on the accuracy of MEBV depends on the method that is used to calculate MEBV. In current breeding programs  estimation of breeding values is based on phenotypes of selection candidates and their relatives  often measured after animals reach to a certain age. This leads to a moderate to long generation interval  substantial costs and complex logistics for phenotypic recording []. Comparatively  breeding values estimated with genomewide distributed markers (MEBV) will increase annual genetic gain due to a reduced generation interval and improved accuracy  at lower costs [  ]. Calculation of MEBV requires a population with information on genetic markers and phenotypes  called the  population. Phenotypic performance of the training population is used to estimate effects for the genetic markers which can be used to calculate MEBV of individuals with only marker information  called the  population. Accuracy of MEBV depends on the heritability of the trait  the size of the training population  the method used to estimate marker effects and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) [–]. Linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL is a function of the distance between markers and QTL and of the effective population size []. A large number of markers  distributed over the whole genome  is required to achieve high LD between markers and QTL when number and location of QTL on the genome are unknown. Simulation studies have shown that accuracy of MEBV increases when LD increases [      ]. The accuracy of MEBV also depends on the variance of individual QTL since the ability to detect a QTL is related to its size. The size of a QTL  measured as the proportion of the genetic variance explained by that QTL  depends on its variance and on the genetic variance. Genetic variance  in turn  is a function of the number of QTL and of the variance of the individual QTL. Hayes and Goddard [] have estimated parameters of a Gamma distribution describing the QTL effects found in published QTL detection experiments. This gamma distribution has been used in simulation studies to model the distribution of QTL effects [          ]. Even though the distribution of QTL effects can vary considerably between different traits  the effect of the number of QTL on the accuracy of MEBV has been addressed only by Daetwyler [] and the effect of distribution of QTL variance on the accuracy of MEBV has not been studied. An important problem when estimating marker effects is the large number of markers relative to the number of phenotypes in the training data []. Meuwissen et al. [] have solved this by using a Bayesian method (BM) that uses a sampling algorithm to obtain a posterior distribution of the marker effects. This Bayesian method is used in many simulation studies and in practical breeding programs  e.g. []. The Bayesian setup enables to incorporate a prior for the number of QTL and for the distribution of QTL effects []. Goddard [] has found higher accuracies when a prior distribution for QTL effects reflecting the gamma (or exponential) distribution of QTL effects was used  compared to using a normal prior distribution for QTL effects. For many quantitative traits  however  the true distribution of the QTL effects is unknown. Two other methods that might be suitable for estimating MEBV are Least Angle Regression (LARS) and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR). LARS is a penalized regression method which identifies predictor variables that are highly correlated to the response variable and includes these in a regression model []. Park and Casella have shown similarities between LASSO  a variant of LARS  and Bayesian regression models []. They have shown that the posterior mode of a Bayesian model  similar to that proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  and the regression coefficients estimated using LASSO are equal. Thus  LARS is a nonbayesian alternative to BM. Regardless of the number of genetic markers  the rank of the matrix of marker data will be less or equal than the number of individuals in the training data. This implies the existence of correlations between marker genotypes. These correlations can be used to calculate MEBV by regressing the phenotypes on linear combinations of the markers. Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) is a method that builds orthogonal linear combinations of the markers that have a maximum correlation with the phenotypes and regresses the phenotypes on these linear combinations  which are also called components []. Since components are orthogonal  regression coefficients of the components are independent. Datta et al. [] have used PLSR in gene expression studies  Moser et al. [] and Solberg et al. [] have used PLSR to calculate MEBV. Although BM and PLSR have been used independently to calculate MEBV  the accuracy of these methods when the number of QTL and the distribution of QTL variance varies is unknown. Therefore  the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of number of QTL and distribution of QTL variance on the accuracy of MEBV estimated with methods BM  LARS and PLSR. Each simulated genome consisted of four chromosomes of 1 Morgan each. Ten thousand loci were equally distributed over each chromosome  there were thus 40 000 loci distributed over the whole genome. In the base population  4 000 of these loci  equally distributed over the genome  were made biallelic with allele frequency equal to 0.50. The remaining 36 000 loci were monomorphic in the base population. Two hundred gametes for the base population were simulated assuming linkage equilibrium and were randomly combined to create 100 individuals. Five thousand generations were simulated to generate LD between loci and to reach a mutation-drift equilibrium. Each individual in each generation contributed two gametes to the next generation with the objective of maintaining a population size of 100 individuals with Ne equal to 199 (the simulated population structure was thus different from a Wright-Fisher scenario). Each gamete transmitted to the offspring was simulated as an independent meiotic event. The number of recombinations for each chromosome was drawn from a Poisson(1) distribution  reflecting the size of the chromosomes in Morgan. The positions of the recombinations were sampled assuming no interference between recombinations. Mutation rate for the 40 000 loci was set at 10. A mutation switched the allelic status; mutation of a 0 allele produced a 1 allele and mutation of a 1 allele produced a 0 allele. Each individual in generation 5 000 contributed 10 gametes to generation 5 001  resulting in 50 fullsib families of 10 individuals each. Each individual in generation 5 001 contributed two offspring to generation 5 002  resulting in 250 fullsib families of 2 individuals each. Generation 5 001 was used as the training population and generation 5 002 was used as the evaluation population. Mutation rate was set to 0 in generations 5 001 and 5 002 to avoid the introduction of a large number of new alleles with a low Minor Allele Frequency (MAF). We simulated sixty replicates. To simulate a range of QTL distributions  six scenarios were generated which were combinations of three levels for number of QTL and two distributions of QTL variance (Table ). Depending on the scenario  up to fifty percent of the loci with a MAF greater than 0.10 were selected to become QTL in generation 5 001. QTL scenarios were numbered from 1 to 6  with increasing number of QTL accounting for 90% of the total genetic variance. Biallelic loci that were not selected as QTL in any scenario were used as biallelic markers. Within a replicate  this resulted in the same marker set across all QTL scenarios. Each QTL scenario was applied to all 60 replicates. The number of QTL contributing to the trait was changed by letting 5% ()  25% () or 50% () of all loci with a MAF greater than 0.10 contribute to the trait. QTL for the scenarios with low and intermediate numbers of QTL were uniformly selected from the 50% of loci selected as QTL in the scenario with high number of QTL. The variances of all QTL contributing to the trait were equal ()  or unequal (). The additive effects of QTL were calculated based on the specified QTL variance and the allele frequency of each QTL. For the scenarios of equal QTL variance  variance of each QTL was set to 1. For the scenarios of unequal QTL variance  variance of every tenth QTL was set to 81 and variances of the other 9 QTL were set to 1. In this way 10% of the QTL were responsible for 90% of the total additive genetic variance. The QTL effects were assigned to each QTL after the QTL were selected and therefore the same QTL were present in scenarios of equal and unequal QTL variance. The true breeding value (TBV) of each individual was calculated as the sum of the allelic effects. Additive genetic variance    was calculated as the variance of the TBV in generation 5 001. Deviates from a N(0  ) distribution were added to TBV and  was equal to  to simulate phenotypes with a heritability of 0.50. In addition to the QTL scenarios  we studied the effect of heritability  pre-selection of markers based on MAF  and size of the training population on the accuracy of the MEBV calculated with the three methods. In the first alternative  heritability of the trait was reduced from 0.50 to 0.25. In the second alternative  markers with a MAF lower than 0.10 in the training population were excluded from the marker data. In the third alternative  the size of the training population was increased from 500 to 1 000 individuals by adding 10 fullsibs to each family while the size of the evaluation population was maintained at 500 individuals. Each alternative was applied to all six QTL scenarios and to the 60 replicates. The simulations were performed with HaploSim []  a package for R [] which is available from the R repository CRAN . The simulations and computations were run on a system with a dual core Intel 2.33 Ghz processor and a Fedora Core 10 operating system. To validate and characterize the simulations  we determined the number of biallelic markers  heterozygosity of biallelic markers  linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers and coefficient of determination of QTL. Heterozygosity of a population is the average number of heterozygous loci of an individual. Expected heterozygosity in a situation of mutation-drift equilibrium  expressed as a fraction of the total number of loci  is a function of mutation rate (u) and effective population size (Ne) []: In our simulations  where effective population size was 199 (Crow and Kimura  Equation 3.13.5 []) and mutation rate was 10  expected H is 7.90·10. For a genome consisting of 40 000 loci  the expected number of heterozygous loci in an individual is 316. Linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers was calculated as the squared correlation between adjacent markers and was expressed as r. The coefficient of determination of a QTL  expressed as R  is the proportion of variance of that QTL explained by a set of markers. Rwas calculated using the equation R = c'Kc  where c is a vector of correlation coefficients between the markers and the QTL  and K is the matrix of pairwise correlations of the markers. When the absolute correlation between a pair of markers exceeded 0.95  only one of these two markers was used to avoid singularity of matrix K. R was calculated as the mean of R between each QTL and the 50 markers in highest LD with that QTL and provided an estimate of the upper limit of the accuracy of MEBV that could be obtained based on this number of markers. We used three methods to estimate marker effects in the training population. The methods differed in how they estimated the additive effects of individual marker loci  but used an identical approach to calculate MEBV after these effects were estimated: where  is the vector of breeding values estimated with the marker genotypes   is an incidence matrix that relates genotypes to individuals  and  is the vector of additive effects for the markers  which is estimated by each method. The Bayesian Model (BM) used was proposed by Meuwissen and Goddard []. In this model  the additive effects of the markers are considered as independent random normal variables. The additive effect of markers which are considered to be associated to a QTL are sampled from a N(0  ) distribution. The additive effects of markers with are considered not to be associated to a QTL are sampled from a N(0  /100) distribution  which has a lower variance. The method requires a prior for the number of QTL and a prior for QTL variance . The prior for the number of QTL was set at 50 in all scenarios  regardless of the true number of QTL in that simulation scenario. The prior for QTL variance was set at 0.20  regardless of the simulation scenario. BM uses Gibbs sampling to numerically integrate over the posterior distribution of the model. The sampler was run for 10 000 iterations and the first 1 000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. Regression coefficients of the markers were calculated as the means of their posterior distributions. Least Angle Regression is a penalized regression method where predictor variables are included sequentially in the model []. Regression coefficients of all markers are zero at the start of the algorithm. LARS builds the model in sequential steps  in each step the marker that has the highest correlation with the residual is added to the model and the model proceeds in a direction of equal angle between all markers included in the model and the sequentially added marker []. After n steps  there are n markers in the model. We used the  function in the lars package [] of R and used cross validation on the training data to find the number of markers that minimized prediction error. Partial Least Square regression reduces the dimensions of the regression model by building orthogonal linear combinations of markers that have a maximal correlation with the response variable []. The trait is subsequently regressed on the linear combinations of markers  or components. Cross validation was used to find the number of components that minimized the prediction error. To reduce the computation time required to fit the PLSR models  the algorithm to find the optimal number of components was modified as follows. In a first step  a model was fitted with ten components. Cross validation was used to find the optimal number of components. If the optimal number of components was below ten  this optimal number of components was used and the algorithm was stopped. If the optimal number of components was ten  a next iteration was performed with 20 components. If the optimal number of components  found by cross validation  was below 20  this number of components was used. Otherwise  the procedure was repeated with 30 components  and so on  until the number of components was equal to the number of observations or to the number of marker loci. The  function in the pls package [] of R was used to fit and cross validate the models in each iteration. Cross validation was performed on the training data. The performance of each method was assessed based on the accuracy and the Mean Square Error of Prediction (MSEP) of MEBV. Accuracy of MEBV is the correlation between MEBV and TBV. Mean Square Error of Prediction is the average of the squared prediction errors of MEBV. Accuracy and MSEP were calculated based on individuals in the evaluation population. Computation time of each method was recorded in all six QTL scenarios for ten replicates. The time recorded included the time required to fit the model on the training population  the time required for cross validation when using LARS and PLSR  and the time required to calculate MEBV for the evaluation population. Average heterozygosity was equal to 0.0110 in generation 1 000 and stabilized after 4 000 generation at 0.0076  corresponding to 304 heterozygous markers. This is slightly below the expected number based on Equation . The average number of biallelic markers in the data was 1 431 (Table ). Eighty percent of these markers had a MAF below 0.10  reflecting an L-shaped distribution of MAF. Average LD between all adjacent markers  measured as r  was 0.048 (Table ). Expected LD  based on Equation 7 of Sved []  is 0.31 (assuming an average distance between markers of 4/1431 Morgan). When markers with a MAF lower than 0.10 were excluded from the data  average LD between adjacent markers increased to 0.146 (Table ). The expected LD based on Sved [] is 0.11  however  does not account for mutations. To compare the LD obtained in our simulations with its expectation  we calculated the average LD between adjacent markers which were introduced in generation 0 and remained polymorphic in generation 5 000. On average  there were 174 of these markers and average LD between these markers was 0.036 which is close to the expected LD of 0.052 (assuming an equal distance between markers of 4/174 Morgan). The average number of QTL was 35 in the scenarios with a low number of QTL and increased to 343 in the scenarios with a high number of QTL (Table ). The average coefficient of determination of the QTL (R) was 0.80 when all markers were used and 0.71 when markers with a MAF above 0.10 were used to calculate R (Table ). Based on the average number of QTL (Table )  the estimated number of QTL accounting for 90% of the total genetic variance ranged from 3  in scenario 1 (low number of QTL  unequal QTL variance)  to 309  in scenario 6 (high number of QTL  equal QTL variance). The number of QTL accounting for 90% of the genetic variance in scenario 3 (high number of QTL  unequal QTL variance  approx. 31 QTL) was similar to that in scenario 4 (low number of QTL  equal QTL variance  approx. 35 QTL). The average accuracy of MEBV calculated with BM and LARS decreased when the number of QTL increased and was stronger in the scenarios of unequal QTL distribution than in the scenarios of equal QTL distribution (Table  and Figure ). The highest accuracies using BM and LARS were in scenario 1 (low number of QTL and unequal distribution of QTL variance) (Table ). The highest accuracy using PLSR was in scenario 4  but with this method there was not a clear trend of accuracies between scenarios (see Table  and Figure ). Overall  accuracies of BM were highest except in scenario 3 (Table ). . The plots display the accuracies of 60 replicated simulations for number of QTL around 35  172 and 343 plus the accuracies of 10 replicated simulation with number of QTL around 227 and 285 in the scenarios of unequal QTL variance. The variance of every tenth QTL was 81 times larger than variance of remaining QTL (unequal QTL variance) or equal for all QTL (equal QTL variance). The line is a LOESS smoother through accuracies on. Additional simulations were done with a number of QTL ranging between the intermediate and high number of QTL and using an unequal distribution of QTL variance to investigate the strong decrease of accuracies of BM from scenario 2 to scenario 3 (Table ). Results of these additional simulations  confirm the decrease of accuracy of MEBV with BM between scenarios 2 and 3 (Figure ). The accuracy of MEBV decreased when heritability was reduced from 0.50 to 0.25 in the three methods (Table ). In the scenarios with a low number of QTL (scenarios 1 and 4)  BM was the most accurate (combining Tables  and ). In the scenarios with an intermediate and high number of QTL  PLSR was the most accurate (combining Tables  and ). The accuracy of MEBV calculated with all methods increased when the size of the training population was increased from 500 to 1 000 individuals (Table ) and BM was the most accurate method in all scenarios (combining Tables  and ). The accuracies of MEBV calculated with BM and PLSR decreased when markers with a MAF lower than 0.10 were excluded from the data  except for BM in scenario 3 (Table ). Accuracies of MEBV calculated with LARS were not clearly affected by excluding markers with a MAF lower than 0.10. There was no clear effect of QTL scenario on the change of accuracies due to this exclusion (Table ). The decrease of accuracies calculated with BM and PLSR when markers with a MAF lower than 0.10 were excluded was in line with the decrease of R (Table ). Mean Square Error of Prediction of MEBV calculated with the three methods increased when the number of QTL increased (Table ). The average MSEP of MEBV calculated with BM were low in all scenarios  except in scenario 3 where it was highest (Table ). The additive genetic variance increased when the number of QTL increased and was higher in the scenarios with unequal distribution of QTL variance (Table ). This is due to the fact that the variance of 10% of the QTL was made 81 times larger than in the scenarios of equal QTL variance. The variance of MEBV calculated with the three methods was lower than the simulated additive genetic variance in all scenarios. The variance of MEBV calculated with PLSR was highest in all scenarios (Table ). The variance of MEBV calculated with the three methods increased when number of QTL increased  except for the variance of MEBV calculated with BM in scenario 3 (Table ). If MEBV were unbiased  then the variance of MEBV would be equal to r  where r is the squared accuracy of MEBV (Table ). The variance of MEBV calculated with BM was lower than this expected variance in all scenarios (combining Tables  and ). The variances of MEBV calculated with LARS and PLSR were higher than the expected variance in all scenarios and this difference was greatest for method PLSR (combining Tables  and ). The average computation time required by the three methods increased when the size of the training population increased and when the number of markers included in the data increased (Table ). In a normal situation  where the size of the training population was 500 individuals  all the markers were included in the data  and the heritability was equal to 0.50  PLSR required approximately 4 seconds to fit  cross validate and evaluate the models. LARS required approximately 211 seconds and BM required approximately 430 seconds (Table ). The accuracies of MEBV calculated with the BM method in this study were compared to accuracies obtained by Calus et al. [] and by Solberg et al. []. The approximate number of QTL was 75 in the simulations of Calus et al. []  and 55 in the simulations of Solberg et al. []. Based on their descriptions  approximately seven QTL would account for 90% of the total genetic variance in both studies. Therefore  the simulations of Calus et al. [] and Solberg et al. [] are most comparable to scenario 1 (low number of QTL  unequal QTL variance)  where an average of three QTL accounted for 90% of the total genetic variance. The average accuracy of MEBV for individuals without performance data of their own by Calus et al. [] was 0.75. The accuracy reported by Solberg et al. [] in the scenario with a low number of markers was 0.69 with BM and 0.61 with PLSR. Accuracies in both studies  but especially in Solberg et al. []  were lower than accuracies in scenario 1 of this study (Table ). A lower LD between markers and QTL in the study of Solberg et al. [] might be the reason for this lower accuracy. The average LD between adjacent markers provides an indication for LD between markers and QTL because QTL are necessarily located somewhere between the markers. Average LD between adjacent markers can not be compared directly to expected LD based on Equation 7 of Sved [] because mutations are expected to have a very strong impact on this LD. This strong impact is expected because a mutation will generally introduce a new marker between two markers which were previously considered adjacent. We calculated LD between adjacent markers that were polymorphic in generation 0 and still polymorphic in generation 5001. This LD can be compared to expected LD based on Sved [] because newly mutated markers are not used and the effect of mutations on specific markers is negligible. Linkage disequilibrium  calculated in this way  was very similar to expected LD  providing evidence for the adequateness of our simulations. Simulated QTL scenarios were numbered from 1 to 6  according to the number of QTL accounting for 90% of the genetic variance. The total number of biallelic QTL in the data is often used to describe simulations [      ]; we think that the number of QTL accounting for a specific proportion of the genetic variance is a more appropriate description of the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying the trait. In this context  we expected similar results in scenarios 3 and 4 since the number of QTL accounting for 90% of the genetic variance were similar (34 in scenario 3 and 31 in scenario 4). Average accuracies of MEBV calculated with LARS and PLSR confirmed this expectation but accuracies with BM did not. With method BM  higher accuracies were expected in QTL scenarios which more closely resembled the prior distributions for QTL number and distribution of QTL effects. The high accuracies with BM in scenario 1 were in line with this expectation but the stronger decrease of accuracies in scenarios 1 to 3 compared to the decrease of accuracies in scenarios 4 to 6 was not. The consistency of the decline in scenarios 1 to 3 was confirmed by additional simulations  with a number of QTL ranging between that in scenario 2 and in scenario 3. Accuracies of MEBV in these simulations confirmed this decrease (Figure ). To investigate whether accuracies of MEBV calculated with BM were affected by the prior distribution for QTL effects  we reanalyzed the data using a prior that more closely resembled the QTL scenarios that were simulated. In each scenario  the prior for number of QTL was set equal to the average number of QTL in this scenario (Table ) and the prior for the variance of individual QTL was set equal to the average simulated genetic variance divided by the average number of QTL in this scenario (Tables  and ). Comparison of these accuracies (Table ) to the accuracies in Tables  and  shows that using a prior which is more correct does not improve average accuracy of MEBV. The accuracies of MEBV calculated with method BM in the different scenarios indicate that the highest accuracies are obtained with this method in situations were a small number of QTL accounts for a large proportion of the total genetic variance. The results in Table  indicate that the accuracies with BM did not depend on the correctness of the prior for QTL distribution and  furthermore  that a prior which was closer to the actual QTL distribution even led to lower accuracies in scenarios with a high number of QTL. These results contrast the results of Goddard []  who found higher accuracies when a exponential prior for QTL effects was compared to a normal prior for QTL effects when the QTL effects were exponentially distributed. In this study  however  we compared accuracies obtained with different prior parameters  while using the same kind of distribution. Combining the results of Goddard [] and of this comparison  it can be stated that using a correct kind of distribution as prior of QTL effects can be important for accuracy of BM but that the exact parametrization of this prior is not important. The number of QTL contributing to a trait is unknown in real situations. The scenarios of unequal QTL variance were motivated by the real situation where a few QTL contribute an important proportion of the total genetic variance. Examples of these situations include the DGAT1 gene and the SCD gene on bovine chromosomes 14 and 26 which contribute a large proportion of the genetic variation of milk fat content [  ] and the IGF2 gene on porcine chromosome 2  which contributes a large proportion of the genetic variation of muscle mass in pigs []. Simulations and analyses that use a distribution similar to the one estimated by Hayes and Goddard [] implicitly assume this situation. The scenarios with an equal QTL variance were motivated by the situations where many QTL contribute a small proportion of the total genetic variation of an individual trait  e.g. height in humans [–]. This study shows that accuracy and MSEP of distinct methods to calculate MEBV are affected by the distribution of QTL underlying a trait. Results of this study also show that the good performance of a method in one specific QTL scenario does not guarantee a good performance in other QTL scenarios. Characteristics of the methods used to fit the MEBV models differed. Methods BM and LARS attempt to identify markers highly correlated with QTL and estimate effects for these markers. Results confirmed that the approach used by both BM and LARS  was advantageous when few QTL accounted for a large proportion of the total genetic variance. Method PLSR builds orthogonal  linear combinations of the predictor data (marker genotypes) that are highly correlated with the response and regresses the response on these components. The advantage of this method was that accuracies were almost not affected by the QTL scenario that was simulated; this was especially clear when comparing the decline of accuracies obtained with BM in scenarios 1 to 3 to the constant level of accuracies obtained with PLSR in scenarios 1 to 3 (Table ). In this study  PLSR was advantageous over BM and LARS in situations where a large number of QTL contributed to the genetic variation of the trait of interest but methods BM and LARS performed better than PLSR in situations where few QTL contributed to the trait. An alternative method  not evaluated in this study  is GBLUP [  ]. In this method  markers are used to estimate the relationship matrix of the individuals in the data and this relationship matrix is subsequently used to estimate breeding values with BLUP. Daetwyler [] have reported that accuracy of GBLUP is not affected by the number of QTL in the data. In situations where few QTL contribute to the trait  accuracies obtained with BM are higher than accuracies obtained with GBLUP but at high number of QTL these accuracies are identical [] suggesting that BM will always perform equally or better than GBLUP. When [] derived accuracies for GBLUP and BM he showed that higher accuracy can be obtained with BM because this method better takes into account the variable contribution of individual QTL. Based on this  BM should be preferred over GBLUP. Since the number of QTL contributing to the trait is generally unknown  using the method PLSR can be a secure alternative for method BM. A pragmatic solution to overcome the problem of ignoring the number of QTL is cross validation []. For cross validation  a subset of individuals with highly reliable EBV can be used to evaluate the accuracy of MEBV obtained with BM  LARS and PLSR. The method which gives the highest accuracies can subsequently be used for the genetic evaluation of individuals with unknown breeding values. Assignment of QTL by giving additive effects to biallelic loci was deferred to generation 5001. There were two reasons for not doing this earlier in the simulations. The first reason was to control the number of QTL that contributed to the trait. With QTL assigned in generation zero  the number of QTL will vary between replicates due to drift and mutations. The second reason was to reduce computing resources required for simulation. Simulating QTL is computationally more expensive than simulating loci because QTL require handling the additive effects in addition to the biallelic genotypes. The six QTL scenarios were created after all generations were simulated  to ensure that QTL variance was the only difference between scenarios of equal and unequal QTL variance. The QTL scenarios were designed with the objective of identifying the effect of number of QTL and distribution of QTL variance on accuracy of MEBV with the distinct methods. A deterministic approach was used to assign the number of QTL contributing to the trait and to calculate the additive effect of each QTL contributing to the trait. This approach was very different from the random approach used to simulate QTL in other simulation studies (for example [          ]) where QTL effects were drawn from a distribution similar to the gamma distribution for QTL effects estimated by Hayes and Goddard []. An important disadvantage of drawing QTL effects from any distribution is that randomness is introduced in the simulations that does not contribute to the research question because it is difficult to control the resulting distribution of QTL effects. The research question in our study concerned the effect of QTL distribution on the estimation of MEBV; hence distinct QTL scenarios covering a range of QTL distributions were simulated. Strength of LD between a pair of loci is constrained by the difference between MAF of both loci []. In addition  variance of QTL with a low MAF is likely to be low  because the variance of QTL is a function of the allele frequency []. Excluding markers with a MAF below a specific threshold from the data  as done by Calus et al. []  therefore seems reasonable. Results of this study  however  show that accuracy of MEBV was consistently lower when markers with a low MAF were excluded from the data (Table ). These lower accuracies were supported by the lower R when markers with a MAF below 0.10 were excluded (Table ). Based on results of this study  using all markers to calculate MEBV is recommended. This study reveals that method BM should be recommended in situations were few QTL are expected to account for a large proportion of the total genetic variance. When the number of QTL accounting for the genetic variance is larger or unknown  method PLSR is recommended. Schaeffer LR: Strategy for applying genome-wide selection in dairy cattle.

We have shown that variance components in the residual variance part of a linear mixed model can be estimated using a DHGLM approach. The method enables analyses of animal models with large numbers of observations. An important future development of the DHGLM methodology is to include the genetic correlation between the random effects in the mean and residual variance parts of the model as a parameter of the DHGLM. In linear mixed models it is often assumed that the residual variance is the same for all observations. However  differences in the residual variance between individuals are quite common and it is important to include the effect of heteroskedastic residuals in models for traditional breeding value evaluation []. Such models  having explanatory variables accounting for heteroskedastic residuals  are routinely used by breeding organizations today. The explanatory variables are typically non-genetic []  but genetic heterogeneity can be present and it is included as random effects in the residual variance part of the model. Modern animal breeding requires animals that are robust to environmental changes. Therefore  we need methods to estimate both variance components and breeding values in the residual variance part of the model to be able to select for animals having smaller environmental variances. Moreover  if genetic heterogeneity is present then traditional methods for predicting selection response may not be sufficient [  ]. Methods have previously been developed to estimate the degree of genetic heterogeneity. San Cristobal-Gaudy et al. [] have developed an EM-algorithm. Sorensen & Waagepetersen [] have applied a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate the parameters in a similar model  which has the advantage of producing model-checking tools based on posterior predictive distributions and model-selection criteria based on Bayes factor and deviances. At the same time  Bayesian methods to fit models with residual heteroskedasticity for multiple breed evaluations [] and generalized linear mixed models allowing for a heterogenetic dispersion term [] have been developed. Wolc et al. [] have studied a sire model  with random genetic effects included in the residual variance  by fitting squared residuals with a gamma generalized linear mixed model. However  Lee & Nelder [] have recently developed the framework of double hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLM). The parameters are estimated by iterating between a hierarchy of generalized linear models (GLM)  where each GLM is estimated by iterative weighted least squares. DHGLM give model checking tools based on GLM theory and model-selection criteria are calculated from the hierarchical likelihood (h-likelihood) []. Inference in DHGLM is based on the h-likelihood theory and is a direct extension of the hierarchical GLM (HGLM) algorithm []. Both the theory and the fitting algorithm are explained in detail in Lee  Nelder & Pawitan []. HGLMs have previously been applied in genetics (e.g. [  ]) but animal breeding models have not been studied using DHGLM. A user-friendly version of DHGLM has been implemented in the statistical software package GenStat []. To our knowledge  DHGLM has only been applied on data with relatively few levels in the random effects (less than 100)  whereas models in animal breeding applications usually have a large ( 100) number of levels in the random effects. The situation is most severe for animal models  where the number of levels in the random genetic effect can be greater than the number of observations  and the number of observations often exceeds 10. Thus  a method to estimate genetic heterogeneity of the residual variance in animal models with a large number of observations is desirable. The aim of the paper is to study the potential use of DHGLM to estimate variance components in animal breeding applications. We evaluate the DHGLM methodology by means of simulations and compare the DHGLM estimates with MCMC estimates using field data previously analyzed by Sorensen & Waagepetersen []. In this section we start by defining the studied model. Thereafter  we review the development of GLM-based algorithms to fit models with predictors in the residual variance. The DHGLM algorithm is presented and we continue by showing how a slightly modified version of DHGLM can be implemented in ASReml []. Thereafter  we describe our simulations and the data from Sorensen & Waagepetersen [] that we reanalyze using DHGLM. We consider a model consisting of a mean part and a dispersion part. There is a random effect  in the mean part of the model and a random effect in the dispersion part (subscript  is used to denote a vector or a matrix in the dispersion part of the model). The studied trait  conditional on  and is assumed to be normal. The mean part of the model is with a linear predictor The dispersion part of the model is specified as with a linear predictor Let  be the number of observations (i.e. the length of )  and let  be the length of  and the length of . Normal distributions are assumed for  and   i.e.  ~ (0  ) and ~ (0  )  where and  are identity matrices of size  and   respectively. The fixed effects in the mean and dispersion parts are  and   respectively. In the present paper   and are treated as non-correlated so that We allow for more than one random effect in the mean and dispersion parts of the model. Furthermore  it is possible to have a random effect with a given correlation structure. The correlation structure of  can be included implicitly by modifying the incidence matrix []. If we have an animal model  for instance  the relationship matrix  can be included by multiplying the incidence matrix  with the Cholesky factorization of . Cholesky factorization of  may  however  lead to reduced sparsity in the mixed model equations. Distributions other than normal for the outcome  can be modelled in the HGLM framework  as well as non-normal distributions for the random effects  but these will not be considered here. HGLM theory in a more general setting is given in the Appendix. We start by considering a linear model with only fixed effects both in the mean and dispersion parts. Using GLM to fit these models has been applied for several decades []. Maximum likelihood estimates for the fixed effects in the dispersion part can be achieved by using a gamma GLM with squared residuals as response. The basic idea is that if the fixed effects  in the mean part of the model were given (known without uncertainty) then the squared residuals are  (for observation )  i.e. gamma distributed with a scale parameter equal to 2 (with  = and ). The squared residuals may be fitted using a GLM [] having a gamma distribution together with a log link function. Hence  a linear model is fitted for the mean part of the model  such that where are estimated from the gamma GLM with However   is estimated and we only have the predicted residuals . The expectation of  is not equal to and a REML adjustment is required to obtain unbiased estimates. This is achieved by using the leverages from the mean part of the model. The fitting algorithm gives REML estimates [] if we replace eq.  by and use weights (1 - )/2  (since []). The leverage for observation  is defined as the :th diagonal element of the hat matrix [] Here   is the weight matrix for the linear model in eq.   i.e. = 1/. The estimation algorithm iterates between the fitting procedures of eq.  and eq.   and the diagonal elements in  are updated on each iteration using   the predicted values from the dispersion model. Note that this algorithm gives exact REML estimates and is not an approximation [    ]. Here  a linear mixed model with homoskedastic residuals is considered. Lee & Nelder [] have shown that REML estimates for linear mixed models can be obtained by using a hierarchy of GLM and augmented linear predictors. An important part of the fitting procedure is to present Henderson's [] mixed model equations in terms of a weighted least squares problem. This is achieved by augmenting the response variable  with the expectation of   where () = . The linear mixed model may be written as an augmented weighted linear model where The variance-covariance matrix of the augmented residual vector is given by The estimates from weighted least squares are given by This is identical to Henderson's mixed model equations where the left hand side can be verified to be The variance component  is estimated by applying a gamma GLM to the response /(1 - ) with weights (1 - )/2  where the index  goes from 1 to . Similarly   is estimated by applying a gamma GLM to the response /(1 - ) with weights (1 - )/2  where the index  goes from 1 to  and comes from the last  leverages of the augmented model. The augmented model gives leverages equal to the diagonal elements of Leverages with values close to 1.0 indicate severe imbalance in the data. For the last  diagonal elements in   1-is equivalent to the reliabilities [] of the BLUP values of . This algorithm gives exact REML estimates for a linear mixed model with normal  and []. Since the linear mixed model can now be reformulated as a weighted least squares problem  we can use the fitting algorithm for weighted least squares described above to estimate    together with the fixed effects in the dispersion part of the model   as well as the variance component in the mean part of the model . This HGLM estimation method has previously been used in genetics to analyse lactation curves with heterogeneous residual variances over time []  where it was shown that the algorithm gives REML estimates. A recently developed R [] package [] is also available on CRAN   which enables fitting of fixed effects in the residual variance. Now we extend the model further and include random effects in the dispersion part. A gamma GLM is fitted using the linear predictor By applying the augmented model approach similar to eq.  also to the dispersion part of the model we obtain a double HGLM (DHGLM) where Here   denotes a vector of ones so that its logarithm matches the expectation of   where () = 0 (see Table 7.1 in []). The mean part of the model is fitted as described in the previous section. The dispersion part of the model is fitted by using an augmented response vector based on the squared residuals from eq.  with weights The vector of individual deviance components is subsequently used to estimate  by fitting a gamma GLM to the response /(1 - ) with weights (1 - )/2  where is the :th component of and is the :th element of the last leverages. The fitting algorithm is implemented as follows. Initialize    and . Estimate  and  by fitting the model for the mean using eq.  (i.e. Henderson's mixed model equations) and calculate the leverages  . Estimate  by fitting a gamma GLM to the response /(1 -  ) with weights (1 -  )/2  where  are the last  diagonal elements of the hat matrix . Estimate  and  from eq.  (using Henderson's mixed model equations) with   and calculate the deviance components  and leverages   Estimate  by fitting a gamma GLM to the response  /(1 -  ) with weights (1 -  )/2 Update the weight matrix  as  Iterate steps 2-6 until convergence We have described the algorithm for one random effect in the mean and dispersion parts of the model but extending the algorithm for several random effects is rather straightforward []. The algorithm has been implemented in GenStat [  ] where the size of the mixed model equations is limited and thus could not be used in our analysis. Hence  we implemented the algorithm using PROC REG in SAS  but found that it was too time consuming to be useful on large data sets. A faster version of the algorithm was therefore implemented using the ASReml software []. As described below  the ASReml implementation uses penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation in a gamma GLMM. PQL estimates  for a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)  are obtained by combining iterative weighted least squares and a REML algorithm applied on the  (which is calculated by linearizing the GLM link function) []. For instance  the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS iterates between several runs of PROC MIXED and thereby produces PQL estimates. By iterating between a linear mixed model for the mean and a gamma GLMM for the dispersion part of the model using PQL  a similar algorithm as the one described above can be implemented. If the squared residuals of the adjusted dependent variable were used in the DHGLM (as described in the previous section) to calculate  instead of the deviance components  the algorithm would produce PQL estimates []. Both of these two alternatives to estimate  in a gamma GLMM give good approximations [  ]. Hence  both methods are expected to give good approximations of the parameter estimates in a DHGLM  but  to our knowledge  the exact quality of these approximations has not been investigated  so far. ASReml uses PQL to fit GLMM and has the nice property of using sparse matrix techniques to calculate the leverages . Although we used ASReml to implement a PQL version of the DHGLM algorithm  any REML software that uses sparse matrix techniques and produces leverages should be suitable. Let be the  calculated in ASReml and stored in the .yht output file. They are defined in the [] as the diagonal elements of [  ]( ) [  ]. So  the leverages  are equal to where is the diagonal matrix of prior weights specified in ASReml and  is the estimated residual variance. The PQL version of the DHGLM algorithm was implemented as follows. Initialize  =   Estimate    and  by fitting a linear mixed model to the data  and weights  Calculate  = /(1 -  ) and  Estimate     and  by fitting a weighted gamma GLM with response  and weights  . Update  = ()  where  are the predicted values from the model in Step 4. Iterate steps 2-5 until convergence. Convergence was assumed when the change in variance components between iterations was less than 10. The algorithm is quite similar to the one used by Wolc et al. [] to fit a sire model with genetic heterogeneity in the residual variance  except that they did not make the leverage corrections to the squared residuals. Including the leverages in the fitting procedure is important to obtain acceptable variance component estimates in animal models and also for imbalanced data. To test whether the DHGLM approach gives unbiased estimates for the variance components  we simulated 10 000 observations and a random group effect. The number of groups was either 10  100 or 1000. An observation for individual  with covariate belonging to group  was simulated as: = 1.0 + 0.5+ +   where the random group effects are iid with ~ (0  )  and the residual effect was sampled from (0   ()) with:  () = (0.5 + 1.5+ )  where is a covariate. The covariates and were simulated binary to resemble sex effects. Furthermore  ~ (0  ) with (  ) = . The simulated variance components were  = 0.5 and  = 1.0  whereas the correlation  was either 0 or -0.5. The value of  = 1.0 gives a substantial variation in the simulated elements of   where a one standard deviation difference between two values and increases the residual variance 2.72 times. The simulated value of  was chosen to be quite large  compared to the residual variance  because large values of  should reveal potential bias in DHGLM estimation using PQL []. The average value of the residual variance was 3.5. We replicated the simulation 20 times and obtained estimates of variance components using the PQL version of DHGLM. Pig litter size has been previously analyzed by Sorensen & Waagepetersen [] using Bayesian methods  and the data is described therein. The data includes 10 060 records from 4 149 sows in 82 herds. Hence  repeated measurements on sows have been carried out and a permanent environmental effect of each sow has been included in the model. The maximum number of parities is nine. The data includes the following class variables: herd (82 classes)  season (4 classes)  type of insemination (2 classes)  and parity (9 classes). The data is highly imbalanced with two herds having one observation and 13 herds with five observations or less. The ninth parity includes nine observations. Several models has been analyzed by Sorensen & Waagepetersen [] with an increasing level of complexity in the model for the residual variance and with the model for the mean  =  +  +  +  varying only through the covariance matrix  (). Here  is litter size (vector of length 10 060)   is a vector including the fixed effects of herd  season  type of insemination and parity  and  is the corresponding design matrix (10 060 × 94)   is the random permanent environmental effect (vector of length 4 149)   is the corresponding incidence matrix (10 060 × 4 149) and  () =    is the additive genetic random effect   is the corresponding incidence matrix (10 060 × 6 437) and  () =  where  is the additive relationship matrix. Hence the LHS of the mixed model equations is of size 10 680 × 10 680. The residual variance  was modelled as follows. where  is a common parameter for all . In this model each parity and insemination type has its own value for the residual variance where is a parameter vector including effects of parity and type of insemination  and is the :th row in the design matrix . where is the :th row of  and is a random animal effect with ~. where is the :th row of  and is a random permanent environmental effect with ~. These four models are the same as in [] with the difference that we do not include a correlation parameter between  and in our analysis. The DHGLM estimation produced acceptable estimates for all simulated scenarios (Table )  with standard errors being large for scenarios with few groups  i.e. for a small number of elements in  and . In animal breeding applications  the length of  and is usually large and we can expect the variance components to be accurately estimated. The estimates were not impaired by simulating a negative correlation between  and although a zero correlation was assumed in our fitting algorithm. The DHGLM estimates and Bayesian estimates (i.e. posterior mean estimates from []) were identical for the linear mixed model with homogeneous variance (Model I) and were very similar for Model II where fixed effects are included in the residual variance part of the model (Table ). For Model III and IV  including random effects in the residual variance part of the model  the DHGLM estimates deviated from the Bayesian point estimates for the mean part of the model. Nevertheless  the DHGLM estimates were all within the 95% posterior intervals obtained by Sorensen & Waagepetersen []. The differences were likely due to the fact that the genetic correlation  was not included as a parameter in the DHGLM approach. The correspondence between the two methods for the variance components in the residual variance was very high. The data was unbalanced with few observations within some herds  i.e. two herds contain only single observations. The observations from these two herds have leverages equal to 1.0 (Figure ) and do not add any information to the model. Leverage plots can be a useful tool in understanding results from models in animal breeding and our results show that they illustrate important aspects of imbalance. . Leverages for the 10 060 observations of pig litter size for Model IV with both permanent environmental and animal random effects included in the residual variance part of the model. For Model IV  the DHGLM algorithm implemented using ASReml converged in 10 iterations and the computation time was less than 3 minutes on a Linux server (with eight 2.66 GHz quad core CPUs and 16 Gb memory). We have shown that DHGLM is a feasible estimation algorithm for animal models with heteroskedastic residuals including both genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore  a fast version of the algorithm was implemented using the ASReml [] software. Hereby  estimation of variance components in animal models with a large number of observations is possible. We have explored the accuracy and speed of variance component estimation using DHGLM but the algorithm also produces estimated breeding values. It is important to consider heteroskedasticity in traditional breeding value evaluation  because failing to do so leads to suboptimal selection decisions [    ]  and models with genetic heterogeneity is important when aiming at selecting robust animals []. Variance component estimation and breeding value evaluation in applied animal breeding are typically based on large data sets  and we therefore expect that the proposed DHGLM algorithm could be of wide-spread use in future animal breeding programs. Especially  since breeding organizations usually have a stronger preference for traditional REML estimation than in the previously proposed Bayesian methods [–]. We have focused on traits that are normal distributed (conditional on the random effects). The HGLM approach permits modelling of traits following any distribution from the exponential family of distributions  e.g. normal  gamma  binary or Poisson. Equation  is then re-formulated by specifying the distribution and by using a link function (.) so that () =   (see Appendix). In this more general setting  the individual deviance components [] are used instead of the squared residuals to estimate the variance components. HGLM gives only approximate variance component estimates if the response is not normal distributed. For continuous distributions  including gamma  the approximation is very good. For discrete distributions  such as binomial and Poisson  the approximation can be quite poor  but higher-order corrections based on the h-likelihood are available []. Kizilkaya & Tempelman [] have developed Bayesian methods to fit generalized linear mixed models with heteroskedastic residuals and genetic heterogeneity. This method is more flexible  since a wider range of distributions for the residuals can be modeled  but it is much more computationally demanding. An important feature of the DHGLM algorithm is that it requires calculation of leverages. Wolc et al. [] have fitted a generalized linear mixed model to the squared residuals of a sire model without adjusting for the leverages. However  for models with animal effects it is essential to include the leverage adjustments. The effects of adjusting for the leverages  or not  are similar to the effects of using REML instead of ML to fit mixed linear models  where ML gives biased variance component estimates and the estimates are more sensitive to data imbalance []. Moreover  the leverages can be a useful tool to identify important aspects of data imbalance (as shown in Figure ). DHGLM estimation is available in the user-friendly environment of GenStat [  ]. Fitting DHGLM in GenStat is possible for models with up to 5 000 equations in the mixed model equations (results not shown). Hence  the GenStat version of DHGLM is suitable for sire models but not for animal models if the number of observations is large. An advantage of GenStat  however  is that it produces model-selection criteria for DHGLM based on the h-likelihood. Nevertheless  it does not include estimation of the correlation parameter . Simple methods based on linear mixed models have been proposed [  ] to estimate   but an unbiased and robust estimator for animal models still requires further research. To our knowledge  methods to estimate  within the DHGLM framework has not been developed yet. An important future development of the DHGLM is  therefore  to incorporate  in the model and to study how other parameter estimates are affected by the inclusion of . Another essential development of such a model would be to derive model-selection criteria based on the h-likelihood (see []). Here we summarize the h-likelihood theory for HGLM according to the original paper by Lee & Nelder []  which justifies the estimation procedure and inference for HGLM. H-likelihood theory is based on the principle that HGLMs consist of three objects: data  fixed unknown constants (parameters) and unobserved random variables (unobservables). This is contrary to traditional Bayesian models which only consist of data and unobservables  while a pure frequentist's model only consists of the data and parameters. The h-likelihood principle is not generally accepted by all statisticians. The main criticism for the h-likelihood has been non-invariance of inference with respect to transformation. This criticism would be appropriate if the h-likelihood was merely a joint likelihood of fixed and random effects. However  the restriction that the random effects occur linearly in the linear predictor of an HGLM is implied in the h-likelihood  which guarantees invariance []. Let  be the response and  an unobserved random effect. A hierarchical model is assumed so that | ~(  ) and  ~(  ) where and are specified distributions for the mean and dispersion parts of the model. Furthermore  it is assumed that the conditional (log-)likelihood for  given  has the form of a GLM likelihood where  is the canonical parameter   is the dispersion term   is the conditional mean of  given  where  = ()  i.e. (.) is a link function for the GLM. The linear predictor for  is given by  =  +  where  = . The dispersion term  is connected to a linear predictor given a link function (.) with () = . It is not feasible to use a classical likelihood approach by integrating out the random effects for this model (except for a few special cases including the case when and are both normal). Therefore a h-likelihood is used and is defined as where (; ) is the log density for  with parameter  and  = () for some strict monotonic function of . The estimates of  and  are given by  = 0 and  = 0. The dispersion components are estimated by maximizing the adjusted profile h-likelihood where  is the Hessian matrix of the h-likelihood. Lee & Nelder [] showed that the estimates can be obtained by iterating between a hierarchy of GLM  which gives the HGLM algorithm. The h-likelihood itself is not an approximation but the adjusted profile h-likelihood given above is a first-order Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood and gives excellent estimates for non-discrete distributions of . For binomial and Poisson distributions higher-order approximations may be required to avoid severely biased estimates []. Here we present the h-likelihood theory for DHGLM and refer to the paper on DHGLM by Lee & Nelder [] for further details. For DHGLM it is assumed that conditional on the random effects  and   the response  satisfies (|  ) =  and (|  ) = ()  where () is the GLM variance function  i.e. () = where the value of  is completely specified by the distribution assumed for |  []. Given  the linear predictor for  is () =   +    and given the linear predictor for  is () = + . The h-likelihood for a DHGLM is where (; ) is the log density for with parameter and = () for some strict monotonic function of . In our current implementation we use an identity link function for (.) and a log link for (.). Furthermore  we have  =  and = such that  =   +   and () = + . We restricted our analysis to a normally distributed trait for (|  ) such that (|  ) =   and we also assumed  and to be normal. The performance of DHGLM in multivariate volatility models (i.e. multiple time series with random effects in the residual variance) has been studied in an extensive simulation study []. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for this multivariate normal-inverse-Gaussian model were available and the authors could therefore compare the MLE with the DHGLM estimates. The estimates were close to the MLE for all simulated cases and the approximation improved as the number of time series increased from one to eight. Hence  for the studied time-series model  the DHGLM estimates improve as the number of observations increases  given a fixed number of elements in . These results highlight that DHGLM is an approximation  but that the approximation can be expected to be satisfactory when |  is normally distributed.

MACE methods developed to combine separate within-country genomic evaluations were compared to direct  multi-country analysis of combined genotypes using simulated genomic and phenotypic data for 8 193 bulls in nine countries. Reliabilities for young bulls were much higher for across-country than within-country genomic evaluations as measured by squared correlations of estimated with true breeding values. Gains in reliability from genomic MACE were similar to those of multi-trait evaluation of genotypes but required less computation. Sharing of reference genotypes among countries created large residual correlations  especially for young bulls  that are accounted for in genomic MACE. International genomic evaluations can be computed either by modifying MACE to account for residual correlations across countries or by multi-trait evaluation of combined genotype files. The gains in reliability justify the increased computation but require more cooperation than in previous breeding programs. Today  selection in many countries uses genotypes in addition to phenotypes and pedigrees [  ]. More than 50 000 dairy cattle worldwide have been genotyped for 50 000 markers. Breeders can select globally from the best animals if national evaluations with similar properties can be compared fairly and accurately. Changes from genetic to genomic evaluations for dairy cattle at the national level will require corresponding changes to international evaluations. Phenotypes are collected  stored  and evaluated independently by each country  and the resulting estimated breeding value (EBV) files are exchanged and combined by Interbull. Multi-trait across-country evaluations (MACE) for nearly 30 traits are provided routinely using the methods developed by Schaeffer []. Results are distributed only for proven bulls with daughters in at least 10 herds. New methods are needed to exchange and combine genomic EBV (GEBV) files that include young bulls and perhaps also females. National evaluations are deregressed to separate information from parents and progeny and provide a vector of observed phenotypes () within each country. These are combined by MACE in a weighted analysis. Statistical analyses of national evaluations are simpler after separating these sources of information by deregressing the prior information that already regressed the phenotypic deviations toward the parent average  and toward the population mean  or toward 0. Daughter yield deviations may be available even if the full data vector is not  or  may be approximated by backsolving from the traditional evaluations  using the reliabilities and the pedigree file (a list of each animal and its parents). Deregressed EBVs can be obtained using either sire-maternal grandsire [] or sire-dam [] pedigrees. Deregressed EBVs are recommended as the  variable in genomic evaluations []. Methods are developed here to deregress GEBVs for use as the  variable in international evaluations. Genetic by environmental interactions can be predicted by genotyping each animal just once instead of obtaining phenotypes for each animal in each environment with traditional evaluation. High reliability requires very large data sets to estimate the small effects of individual genes []. Thus  breeders should consider combining or exchanging genomic data across countries to increase reliability. Advantages of international selection programs are large if genetic correlations among countries are high  if populations are genetically similar  and if markets for genetic material are already well established. National evaluations often use linear models for normally distributed traits or nonlinear models for traits with non-normal distributions  but international evaluations are usually restricted to linear models for simpler computing. Examples are national threshold models for categorical traits such as calving ease that are then combined by the International Bull Evaluation Service (Interbull) using standard linear mixed models. Linear model equations for genomic selection were first developed by Nejati-Javaremi et al. [] and are nearly as accurate as nonlinear equations for most traits []. The objectives of this paper are to 1) summarize methods for computing and deregressing national GEBVs  2) compare methods for incorporating national EBVs and GEBVs into international GEBVs  and 3) illustrate benefits from exchanging GEBVs or exchanging genotypes. Traditional national EBVs () are often computed by animal model methods [] and for a single trait (e.g. milk yield) can be represented approximately using a vector of daughter deviations ()  a diagonal matrix containing daughter equivalents ()  an additive relationship matrix ()  and a variance ratio () as: Genomic EBVs () within each country can be represented approximately by replacing the pedigree relationships from  by the genomic relationship matrix ()  giving Matrix  can be computed from genotypes as a quadratic form and can also include polygenic variation from  that is not linked to the markers []. Ratio  is a function of heritability () and was defined as  by []derivation or as  by Fikse and Banos []  with mate breeding values assumed known or unknown  respectively. Elements of   known as daughter equivalents or effective daughter contributions  must match the definition of . For traditional MACE  elements of  and pedigree files are provided to Interbull  and elements of  are backsolved from these. In the simplest case   could be obtained by pre-multiplying  by (+). However  vector  should contain solutions from all ancestors including unknown parent groups  but some are not included in the exchange formats  and the MACE model also includes an additional fixed effect of the country mean  all of which must be solved using either iterative or other methods. Elements of  equal 0 for the ancestors and group effects because these are not observed directly  and matrix  contains coefficients that link animals with observations to ancestors and unknown parent groups. For genomic MACE (GMACE)  diagonal matrix can contain the extra daughter equivalents from genomic data. Diagonals of can be calculated in at least three ways (    and ). The first method calculates diagonals of from the difference between genomic reliability () and traditional reliability () for each bull simply as The second method obtains elements of by reversing standard reliability formulas like those of Misztal and Wiggans [] such that the diagonals of the matrix (++) equal or approximate the diagonals of (+k). The third method is the simplest and sets all diagonals of equal to the same constant. When  becomes too large for inversion  this simple strategy will still be affordable. Traditional  expressed as decimals rather than percentages are summed and reliabilities of the corresponding parent averages () are subtracted for all genotyped animals. This result is multiplied by variance ratio  and divided by factor  to determine average daughter equivalents from genomic data. A value of  equal to 1500 for Holsteins  1200 for Brown Swiss  and 700 for Jerseys is used to match estimated reliabilities to those observed from truncation studies in US breed evaluations []. An interpretation of  is the number of high reliability bulls needed to obtain 50%   and a larger  is needed for breeds with greater effective population size []. Algebraically  Equality of approximate and published genomic reliabilities is an advantage of the second method. If the first or third method is used in GMACE  will be biased upwards for genotyped animals with many relatives because genomic information in is counted twice  once directly and once via relatives. Matrix  is not expected to be available to Interbull for the Holstein breed  whereas vector  is available. In North American evaluations   is already a 30 000 × 30 000 dense matrix and is rapidly growing larger. Let contain deregressed evaluations derived from the national   which includes both the traditional and the genomic information. Vector is obtained from  using equations The equations are solved iteratively because elements of equal 0 for unknown parent groups whereas corresponding elements of  must be estimated. As was the case for national models   and must now match the international definition [] used for variance ratio   which may or may not be the same definition that was used nationally []. Matrix  distributes the genomic information in to close relatives in the same way that phenotypic information is distributed. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) can be decomposed into the parent average ()  the deviation of traditional EBV from PA (estimated Mendelian sampling)  and the deviation of GEBV from EBV (additional genomic information): The total daughter equivalents () can be similarly partitioned into: Furthermore  the extra daughter equivalents from genomics () can contain daughter equivalents from foreign daughters used to estimate SNP effects that are not included in the domestic daughter count . The traditional reliability from domestic daughters () is Deregression uses matrix algebra  but can be represented approximately for bull j as division by to obtain the original daughter average before regression. The approximate formula  = ()+ (1-) can be rearranged to solve for as: Variance of vector  is partitioned into additive relationship matrix  and diagonal matrix  containing variance of residuals: Diagonals of  for each bull are  or equivalently . Traditional MACE combines information from domestic and foreign relatives to increase reliability. Information from daughters contributes directly to  and  whereas information from ancestors and sons contributes indirectly through . MACE equations are very similar to those used for deregression with the following exceptions: diagonals and  from all countries are stored together in the same vector  genetic correlations across countries are accounted for using the Kronecker product of  with the genetic covariance matrix inverse ()  use of  instead of  requires dividing the diagonals of  by   and vector  includes an  for each bull on each country scale obtained using equations: Genomic MACE includes genomic information by applying deregression to national GEBV instead of EBV to obtain elements of  + and . Vectors and matrices are extended to include data from multiple countries  and vector  includes international GEBVs on each country scale obtained using equations If any countries have used foreign data to estimate marker effects  then errors in are no longer independent and should be modelled using the more general matrix  instead of  + . Approximate formulas to compute  are proposed in the next section. Exchange of genomic data between countries introduces additional correlations among their national evaluations that need to be modelled in GMACE. Residual effects can be correlated with residuals in other countries for two reasons: 1) multiple evaluation centers may include genomic and phenotypic data from foreign animals in national estimates of marker effects  and 2) genomic predictions act as repeated measures of the same portion of genetic merit rather than independent measures of genetic merit  especially for major gene marker(s). As an example of 1)  marker effects in Canada and the United States may be highly correlated because the countries share genomic data and include MACE evaluations as input to the genomic equations in each country. As an example of 2)  multiple countries could each test a bull for DGAT1  a gene with major effects on milk yield and components []  and these repeated tests in different countries would not provide independent information about the bull's total breeding value. Residuals are independent in traditional MACE because each daughter is measured in only one country  but may be correlated in GMACE for the reasons described above. In genomic MACE  diagonals of  should be  and off-diagonals can be non-zero due to residual correlations that depend on the ratio  in each country. Correlations are nonzero when more than one country submits GEBV for the same genotyped bull. Let d and d be the ratios  in country 1 and country 2  respectively  and let c be the fraction of genotyped bulls in common. For countries that share all genotypes  c may be 1 whereas c may be close to 0 for country pairs that only include genotypes of domestic bulls. The correlation of residuals e and e may be approximated using the additive genetic correlation  the fraction of common bulls  and the proportions of genomic information as: The genetic correlation corr(a  a) between true breeding values (BVs) in countries 1 and 2 is routinely estimated by Interbull and acts as an upper limit for the residual correlation corr(e  e) because marker effects differ in different environments  just as BVs differ. MACE equations may need just a few changes to accommodate GEBV. A bull's diagonal in country  () depends as above on  instead of only : Off-diagonals for the same bull in country  and  (R) are obtained by multiplying corr(e  e) by   giving: A world population was simulated and evaluated to test the ability of multi-country methods to combine information from genotypes or GEBV computed separately within each country. Genotypes and phenotypes were simulated using pedigrees and reliabilities for all 8 073 proven Brown Swiss bulls in the April 2009 Interbull file. Genotypes and true BV for another 120 young bulls born and sampled in the United States with no progeny records yet were simulated to test the predictions. Brown Swiss genotypes were simulated because Interbull is conducting research with actual genotypes for this breed. Genotypes for 50 000 markers and 10 000 QTLs were simulated using the same methods as VanRaden []. Markers and QTL were in equilibrium in the earliest generation and transmitted to descendants with recombination from crossovers on 30 chromosome pairs. To make QTL effects correlated across countries  independent normal effects within each country were multiplied by the Cholesky decomposition of the genetic correlation matrix among countries. Then  QTL effects were transformed from standard  normal distribution () to heavy tailed distribution () using  =  (1.9)such that the largest  explained 1-4% of genetic variation. Genetic correlations in the simulation were set equal to official estimates from Interbull []. Official correlations differ from correlation estimates due to post-processing to ensure positive definiteness and averaged about 0.90 but were lower for New Zealand than for the other countries. Phenotypes equalled true BVs plus an error with variance determined from each bull's  for protein yield. The 10 000 QTL effects were summed to obtain true BV. Only one replicate was simulated to demonstrate the computations. For both proven and young bulls  observed reliabilities were computed as squared correlations of estimated with true BVs on all nine country scales. Actual genotypes for 10 129 Holstein bulls and cows that had either daughters or records for protein yield in North America were also used to test multi-country models. Of these Holsteins  7 928 had information only in the United States  1 730 only in Canada and 471 in both countries. Evaluations on both scales were also computed for 11 815 young bulls and heifers  for a total of 21 944 genotyped animals. Results for the 2-country US-Canada Holstein test are not presented because MACE rather than Canadian national EBV were used as input data. Thus  only timing and convergence tests are presented. Countries that share common genotype files could model foreign evaluations as correlated traits by computing a direct multi-trait genomic evaluation. Instead of converting foreign evaluations to the domestic scale and then assuming that foreign and domestic information measures the same trait  deregressed EBVs from multiple countries can each remain on the original scales. Information is combined in a multi-trait evaluation using genomic rather than pedigree relationships and the published genetic correlations. GEBVs for each bull on each scale are obtained using The analysis uses genotypes directly to form  but not phenotypes directly because deregressed national EBVs are the input data rather than raw phenotypes. Residuals are then independent for the  vector in this analysis. Matrix  is larger than in national evaluations because it includes genomic relationships among all bulls genotyped internationally. Five evaluation systems were applied to the simulated Brown Swiss data. The five models were 1) national evaluation using pedigrees and phenotypes within countries  2) MACE using pedigrees and phenotypes across countries  3) genomic evaluation using genotypes and phenotypes within countries  4) genomic MACE using genetic correlations to combine the within-country GEBVs into across-country GEBVs  and 5) multi-trait genomic evaluation using genotypes and phenotypes across countries. For all five systems  the young bulls predicted were domestic on US scale but were foreign on all other scales  which would affect the observed reliabilities. Evaluation system 5 was applied to the North American actual Holstein genotypes only to determine if the computation required was reasonable; gains in reliability were not tested. The deregression methods were also tested on actual US Holstein data  and the resulting daughter equivalents from genomics and deregressed EBVs were compared. The iterative  nonlinear program used to compute US official genomic evaluations required only a slight modification to compute a multi-country genomic evaluation. Inverses of genetic correlation matrices have large off-diagonals that are multiplied by the square root of the product of the variance ratios for each country pair in the mixed model equations. Convergence was nearly as fast for multi-country as for single-country analysis if a block-diagonal solver was used. Reliability of GMACE evaluations will also be affected by residual correlations. Genomic information increases reliability  but if genotypes are shared by some countries  \"double-counting\" of this shared information should be avoided. Methods to approximate reliability of GMACE evaluations and account for the residual correlations are being developed. A possibility is to use multi-country deregression to backsolve for independent  from each country so that the current formulas to compute MACE  can also be used for GMACE . Reliabilities for direct multi-country GEBVs can be obtained by including genomic relationships in matrix inversion  but computing costs for multi-trait equations may be too large. Reliability increases with the number of genotyped animals that also have phenotypes. Reliabilities for GMACE can be approximated by accumulating information chronologically to ancestors then progeny [  ]  but by using multiple-trait rather than single-trait equations when accumulating information [  ]. Software used currently to approximate reliabilities for regular MACE uses single-trait equations but could be modified for GMACE to use multiple-trait equations instead. Deregression of national genomic evaluations was tested on the US Holstein data. Differences between calculated from the three methods were small in proportion to  for sires with many genotyped progeny because those sires also generally had many daughter records. For the genotyped bulls with daughters  mean diagonals of and were 19.4 and 19.1  respectively  both with SD of 11.3  and a correlation of 0.992. However  for young bulls without daughters  the differences were slightly larger. Means of and were 23.5 and 22.9  respectively  with SD of only 1.2 and 1.4  and a correlation of 0.81. The very simple approximation does not account for the number of close relatives genotyped and instead assigned the same constant of 22.3 to all bulls. Any of the three methods could be useful because of their similar properties. The deregressed GEBVs in vector were very similar when computed using the three different . Correlations exceeded 0.999 among each of these for both proven bulls and young bulls. Means and SD were also nearly identical  except that the SD was about 1% higher for young bulls in computed using instead of or . Results indicate that the choice of deregression methods might not affect GEBV but will affect computed slightly. Young bulls tested in more than one country can have large residual correlations in GMACE  and these correlations need to be accounted for to prevent inflation of the resulting GEBV and reliabilities. Numerical values of corr(e  e) are shown in Table  for young bulls (those with = 0 in both countries) and for proven bulls (those with > 0 in at least 1 country). Tables  and  show observed reliability as measured by squared correlation of estimated and true BV for old and young bulls from the five evaluation systems tested. Countries are listed by population size in both tables  and traditional  tend to be higher for large populations because more progeny are obtained per bull. Traditional national reliabilities for young bulls in Table  were the observed and were fairly low because the US bulls had no daughters in any country and may have had few close relatives in other countries. Also  information was contributed only by sires and maternal grandsires and not dams. Traditional MACE increased for the young bulls  but only a little. National genomic were higher than traditional  in the larger countries but not in the smaller countries  and were lower in some cases in Table  with very small numbers of proven bulls. Application of GMACE to the simulated Brown Swiss data revealed large gains in for young bulls. Gains from GMACE were small for old bulls because traditional  was already high. In the GMACE evaluation  all countries had genotypes of young US bulls available  and computed the national GEBV for the same set of young bulls  but did not share the genotypes of reference bulls. This may not be realistic  but provided a simple test that the GMACE software can effectively combine genomic information across countries using GEBVs instead of genotypes. The time required for GMACE was less than 15 min on a single processor. Within-country genomic evaluations were required as inputs to GMACE  however the times required to compute these were much less than for multi-country evaluation because genotypes of foreign proven bulls were not included. Actual correlations among GEBV from different countries should be documented as these become available. Ability of GMACE to model residual correlations could be tested with simulated Brown Swiss data  but application to real data is needed to reveal potential problems or refinements needed. Such studies are planned for the near future. Observed reliabilities from direct  multi-trait evaluation of simulated genotypes in Tables  and  were similar to those from GMACE evaluation for both proven and young Brown Swiss bulls. All countries benefited from multi-country analysis. The countries with smaller populations such as Canada  Netherlands  and New Zealand had the largest gains in reliability for both young and old bulls. Countries with larger populations such as Germany and Switzerland also benefit and may gain the most by ensuring that their breed keeps pace with gains in other breeds instead of falling behind due to lack of cooperation. Times required for 250 iterations were tested using two compilers. With the Absoft compiler and automatic parallel option (-apo)  nine processors took 30 h for the 9-country Brown Swiss genomic evaluation and two processors took 11 h for the 2-country Holstein evaluation. With the Intel compiler  a single processor took 71 h for the Brown Swiss analysis and 6.5 h for the Holstein analysis. Total processor time increased linearly with number of countries with Absoft compiler but less than linearly with Intel. For both compilers  time required for iteration increases linearly with the number of bulls that have daughters. Time required for exact reliability calculation may increase dramatically  in proportion to the number of countries cubed  because dimensions of the matrix to invert are multiplied by the number of countries in the analysis. Matrix sizes might be reduced by including multiple equations only for the bulls with data in multiple countries rather than for all bulls. Approximate reliability formulas will be needed if inversion times are eight times larger with two countries than with one. Correlations assumed in multi-country evaluation had very little effect on convergence rate but can have large effects on the direct genomic values (DGV)  particularly on scales where large proportions of bulls are foreign and have converted information. Genetic group effects were not simulated and unknown parent groups were not included in the Brown Swiss test  but will be needed to account for selection in actual data. Reliability of selection for young animals greatly increased when national and international genomic evaluation models were applied to simulated data. Traditional MACE increased reliability for young animals by transferring pedigree information across countries. Genomic evaluations within country increased reliability  especially for countries with large populations. Multi-country evaluation of combined genotypes increased reliability further  especially for countries with small populations. Genomic MACE produced reliabilities almost equal to those from the combined genotype evaluation for the special case where the young bulls had GEBV on each country scale even though countries did not share genotypes of proven bulls. Thus  genomic information can be transferred by combining either GEBVs or genotypes. Computing time was much faster for GMACE than the combined genotype evaluation. For GMACE  genomic predictions were computed using only the domestic proven bulls rather than all 8 073 proven bulls. Then  the within-country predictions were combined across countries in only 15 min using matrix  which is sparse whereas matrices  and  are dense. Thus  GMACE should be computationally feasible for the world Holstein population. Software for GMACE is in C rather than Fortran and was compiled with generic gnu compiler 'gcc'. Future research should focus on including both genotyped and non-genotyped bulls in multi-country analyses  incorporating animal model pedigree for the non-genotyped bulls  accounting for dams' evaluations that may be biased  and perhaps including multiple traits per country. The approximations that account for correlated residuals among GEBV in GMACE need to be validated for applications involving many countries with different patterns of genotype sharing. Marker effects may be highly correlated if countries share the same genomic data and include traditional MACE evaluations as input to their genomic equations. Countries could compute independent  less accurate GEBVs from only domestic data for exchange within Interbull  but such evaluations are not needed if the official GEBVs that contain both domestic and foreign data can be exchanged using genomic MACE. Correlations caused by repeated tests of major genes are not specifically accounted for in this approximation. High-density chips such as 50 000 or 500 000 SNPs may not completely explain all the genetic variance because true QTL effects are between the markers. Partitioning the genetic variance into explained and unexplained components may require more complex models including polygenic effects. To compute national GEBV  countries still need to receive conventional MACE EBV as input data for any foreign bulls whose genotypes they include. If MACE GEBV were used as input data  genomic information would be counted twice. The MACE programs revised as above could be used to evaluate both EBV and GEBV. The GEBV analysis simply reduces to the conventional MACE EBV if all countries supply EBV. The proposal is for all countries that report GEBV to also report EBV in a separate file and for Interbull to process and report both GEBV and EBV back to member countries. This can be achieved using the current formats  perhaps including a code to indicate which bulls have been genotyped. Genomic selection will cause selection biases in conventional national evaluations. About three to four years after implementation  average Mendelian sampling will no longer equal 0 for bulls with progeny. To avoid EBV bias  simultaneous analysis of phenotypic  genomic  and pedigree data may be needed to properly account for selection on genotypes  rather than solving for EBV and then GEBV in a two-step process []. Countries may need to provide phenotypic summaries such as daughter yield deviation (DYD) instead of only GEBV to help users understand data sources. Accurate blending of genomic and non-genomic information is important because many animals are not genotyped. Reliability can be improved directly by genotyping an animal or indirectly by genotyping close relatives. The extra information from genotyped parents can be transferred to non-genotyped descendants using the same formulas that adjust traditional evaluations for foreign parent data. Propagation from genotyped progeny to non-genotyped parents is more difficult because the extra information from genotyped progeny should not exceed the direct gain from genotyping the parent. Simultaneous evaluation of national phenotypic and genomic data such as proposed by Legarra et al. [] could increase reliabilities for genotyped animals and for their non-genotyped ancestors and descendants. Multi-trait  combined genotype evaluation required solving effects for more than one country scale together in the same program. Total computing time was nearly the same for combined as for separate country analyses. Instead of one computer doing US evaluations and another doing Canadian evaluations  two computers could each process half of the traits to complete the combined evaluation in the same time. The multi-trait genotype evaluation has the theoretical advantage that domestic proofs from both countries could be used directly instead of using domestic proofs from one country plus MACE proofs from the other. The exact multi-country analysis of shared genotypes will be useful to judge properties of these approximations and can be implemented to increase reliability among sets of countries that do share genotypes. Use of different SNP chips by different organizations may make genotype sharing more difficult unless efficient methods to impute genotypes are found. A potential problem with genotype sharing is that countries or organizations that invest little in genotyping or phenotyping may benefit as much as those that invest more  which will reduce incentives to collect and provide additional data. The political decisions regarding genomics may be more important than the mathematical formulas and computer methods derived here. Genetic progress increases if national and international evaluations include genomic information. Previously  international evaluations did not include young bulls and females but at present  they should because of their increased reliability and because maximum progress requires shorter generation intervals. Methods were developed to combine GEBV files using GMACE or to compute multi-country evaluations if genotype files are shared. Advantages of GMACE are: similarity to the current MACE system  ability to account for residual correlations when countries include foreign phenotypes in domestic genomic estimates  and computational feasibility for many countries and traits. Advantages of direct multi-country genomic evaluation over GMACE are: more complete use of genomic information and more appropriate weighting of phenotypes from foreign animals. Computation was feasible for the world Brown Swiss evaluation but would require many processors and more computer memory than GMACE. Reliability gains for young bulls were large from combining genotype files  especially for the smaller populations.

For the maternal effects  the average CD per herd increased if the maternal effects had a high genetic correlation with the direct effects  but the percentage of connected herds for maternal effects was very low  less than 12%. The degree of connectedness in a bovine population bred by natural service mating  such as Bruna del Pirineus beef cattle  measured as the CD of comparisons among herds  is high. It is possible to define a pool of animals for which estimated breeding values can be compared after an across-herds genetic evaluation  especially for highly heritable traits. The best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of breeding values allows meaningful comparisons between animals  but only when genetic links exist between the different environments (e.g. []). Connectedness  in a statistical sense  relates to the estimability of all contrasts involving fixed-model effects []. However  connectedness is not required in order to predict random breeding values []  and disconnected subsets of records do not lead to biased predictions of breeding values so long as breeding values of base animals (i.e. the animals present at the start of performance recording) are distributed randomly and identically across the entire population []. This assumption is violated  however  if selection or genetic drift occurs before pedigree and performance recording begin and cause genetic means of the herds to differ []. The isolated herds (not highly connected i.e. for which the accuracy of comparison is low) are likely to have different genetic means. In such a case  the environment and genetic effects are partially confounded and the genetic differences between animals in different environments are underestimated. Laloë and Phocas [] have shown that decreases in both accuracy and potential bias in a genetic evaluation are due to this phenomenon of regression towards the mean. Laloë [] has defined disconnectedness for random effects in terms of \"non-predictability\" of contrasts: a contrast is not predictable if its coefficient of determination (CD) is null. Several other methods developed to evaluate connectedness have been based on prediction error (co)variances (e.g.  [–]). The prediction error variance (PEV) of a contrast of mean differences can be obtained using matrix absorption [] and has a strong relationship with CD; it is thus a potential alternative measure of connectedness. These statistics have been used to measure connectedness in dairy cattle []  swine [    ]  and beef cattle []. However  CD was found to combine data structure and amount of information better []. It also provides a balance between the decrease of PEV and the loss of genetic variability due to genetic relationships between animals. Laloë et al. [] have concluded that CD was the best method for judging the precision of a genetic evaluation or optimising corresponding designs  especially when genetic relationships among animals are to be accounted for through a relationship matrix. However  CD is difficult to calculate for routine genetic evaluation due to storage and the processing time required to calculate the inverse of the coefficient matrix and the (non-inverted) relationship matrix []. Kuehn et al. [] have advocated measuring connectedness using other criteria  highly correlated to CD  but easier to compute. Another way to circumvent this drawback is to turn to methods of approximated estimation of variance-covariance matrices. Garcia-Cortes et al. [] and Fouilloux and Laloë [] have proposed sampling methods that  theoretically  allow the estimation of entire variance-covariance matrices  and  as a result  the estimation of the CD of contrasts among genetic levels of herds. Based on these methods  Fouilloux et al. [] have described a new two-step process to analyze connectedness among herds: the first step involves computing the CD of comparisons between groups of animals using a sampling method  while in the second step  clusters of well-connected groups are formed based on a \"criterion of admission to the group of connected herds\" (CACO) that reflects the level of connectedness of each herd. The procedure accounts for known pedigree and data structure efficiently when measuring connectedness among herds. This clustering method was appropriate in condensing the relevant information of large matrices of similarities (here  the CD of contrasts between genetic levels of herds). It meets the requirement to construct sets of well-connected herds  and may handle large problems very quickly []. This method was applied by Fouilloux et al. [] to beef cattle breeds that use artificial insemination. In this case  links between herds come through reference sires that have progeny in different herds and a sire model can be sufficient to establish connectedness among herds. However  in many local beef cattle breeds  natural service is almost exclusively used. In this case  links due to reference sires are not so important and it is necessary to consider the connection due to maternal and paternal grandsires []. Thanks to the simplicity of the CACO method  different models of analysis may be easily adapted to account for these connections []. The choice of the best model for the sampling method depends on the size of the analyses and the knowledge of the pedigree. Hence  application of single- or multi-trait analyses using an animal model with or without maternal effects will be possible for small-sized evaluations  while sire or sire-maternal grandsire models can be used for large-sized evaluations  depending on the number of unknown sires or grandsires in the pedigree files []. Bruna dels Pirineus is a local beef breed selected from the old Brown Swiss (derived from the Canton Schwyz)  which is similar to the American Braunvieh. The herds are located in the Pyrenean mountain areas of Catalonia (Spain). Genetic differences among beef herds are likely. Herd sizes are generally small  relative to other livestock species  and artificial insemination (AI)  an effective tool for connecting herds of other beef and dairy cattle  is practically nonexistent in this breed. In contrast to other countries  cooperative breeding schemes  designed to create such genetic links []  have been rarely used in Spain. The objective of this study was to measure the connectedness among herds of beef cattle bred by natural service. In particular  the CD of comparisons between Bruna dels Pirineus herds will be computed using a sampling method based on an animal model and clusters of well-connected herds will be formed. This study should permit the determination of the risk of bias when comparing and selecting animals from different herds on estimated breeding values (EBV)  and the results obtained can then be used as a reference for other beef cattle breeds  which are almost exclusively bred by natural service. Data of the on-farm beef cattle evaluation for the Bruna dels Pirineus breed were used in this study. The dataset consisted of 28546 records and the total number of animals in the pedigree file was 35546. The genetic evaluation model was an animal model that included sex (2 levels)  parity (10 levels)  twins (2 levels)  herd effect (76 levels)  month (12 levels) and year (26 levels) as fixed effects. The connectedness was studied among the 76 herds that had calf performances recorded during the last five years. The method presented by Fouilloux and Laloë [] to estimate CD of estimated breeding values in a sire model has been applied to an animal model to approximate the CD of contrasts between herds. The procedure is as follows: 1- Starting from the pedigree of the population  the animals involved in the simulation are sorted from the oldest to the youngest. An animal model  including pedigree with full relationships  was used for the simulation. The same one was used in the EBV prediction model. 2- The direct genetic value of the animal i is calculated according to the status of its sire (j) and dam (k). If j and k are unknown  is generated from . If j is known and k is unknown  is calculated by = 0.5+ where is drawn from . The same if k is known and j is unknown  is calculated by = 0.5+ where is drawn from . Finally  if j and k are both known  is calculated by = 0.5(+ ) + where is drawn from . 3- Performance of each performance-tested animal = + + was simulated using its generated breeding value and a residual drawn from . Herd effects were simulated multiplying a value drawn from [0 1] by twice the phenotypic standard deviation. The remaining fixed effects were set to 0. 4- The vector of BLUP estimated breeding values  is obtained by solving the mixed model equations using . BLUP was estimated using PEST software  ceasing iteration when the convergence criterion was less than 10. This process repeated n times leads to vectors of true (simulated) {}and estimated breeding values . 5- The CD of contrasts of interest are estimated by computing their empirical variances and covariances (quoted with *) following Fouilloux et al. []: with and Typically  a given contrast can be written as a linear combination of the breeding values (). For instance  on one hand  the CD of the breeding value of a single animal (i.e. its reliability) is obtained by using a vector  null except a 1 in the appropriate position corresponding to this breeding value. On the other hand  the CD of contrasts among herds i and j is obtained by using a vector  null except a  or a  in the appropriate position corresponding to animals from herd i and j respectively. Here  and were respectively the number of animals in herd i and j. The estimated values of the CD of comparison among herds were computed by performing 1000 replicates of the re-sampling method. The main practical goal of connectedness studies is to identify sets of connected herds. Two herds are considered connected if its CD is greater than an  threshold  say <U+03C7>. A set of connected herds should then be built in such a way that any pairwise CD between herds of the set is greater than <U+03C7>. This was achieved through an agglomerative clustering procedure proposed for Fouilloux et al. []  which was designed explicitly for building compact clusters and is suitable for large-sized datasets. At the start of the process  each herd begins in a cluster by itself  and each step involves aggregating herds one by one into appropriate clusters: Each herd begins in the cluster by itself: [{ } { }  ...  { }]. The two herds linked by the highest CD  say   and    are clustered together  leading to the following partition: [{    }  ...  { }]. 2. A similarity index is calculated for each herd outside the cluster {    }. The similarity index of a given herd is equal to its lowest CD with the herds currently in the cluster. The herd with the highest similarity index is added to the cluster. The CACO of this new clustered herd is equal to its similarity index at this step. Supposing  for the sake of simplicity  that this herd is { }  then  the new partition is the following: [{       }  ...  { }]. The process stops either when all herds are clustered  or when the CD of comparison between the clustered herds and each of the remaining herds are all below the fixed  threshold <U+03C7>. In that latter case  the algorithm is applied to the remaining herds to build other possible clusters. Finally  two herds within the same cluster are ensured to be compared with a CD > <U+03C7>. When applying this method  a decision needs to be made on the threshold <U+03C7> for the CD to be achieved before a herd is considered to be connected. Such a decision is and will always be a subjective matter. The threshold <U+03C7> was chosen to be equal to 0.4  as in Fouilloux et al. []. However  a more informed choice is possible using CD as a criterion of accuracy and potential bias  and by considering the relationships between CD  the amount of information  and the quality of design. For the sensitivity analysis  three different heritabilities were simulated  first representing low (0.10)  moderate (0.25) and high (0.40) genetic variations. Second  the results of an animal model were compared with results from a sire model. In such a case  the data were simulated using an animal model with pedigree but the genetic evaluation was done using a sire model. Here  two models were evaluated: (i) the sire model does not take into account the pedigree  i.e. the sire effects follow a  where  was a quarter of the genetic variance  and (ii) the sire model includes a pedigree  i.e. the sire effects follow a  where  was a quarter of the genetic variance and was the relationship matrix of sires. Third  the estimation of CD was implemented for multi-trait animal models where the genetic values were simulated in Step 2 as  = [  ] ~ () and the residual values were simulated in Step 3 as  = [  ] ~ (). The genetic and residual (co)variance matrices were respectively: Two different multi-trait scenarios were simulated: (i) a lowly heritable trait (0.10) with a moderate negative genetic correlation (-0.25) and moderately heritable trait (0.40); and (ii) a lowly heritable trait (0.10) with a high negative genetic correlation (-0.50) and highly heritable trait (0.40). First  these two scenarios were simulated with a null residual correlation but  as a null residual correlation was not always realistic  the effect of a non-null residual correlation was checked by simulating residual correlations with the same magnitude of the genetic correlations. The simulated data were analyzed jointly in Step 4  but the CDs were estimated separately for each trait in Step 5. Fourth  the estimation of CD was implemented for models with maternal effects  where the direct and maternal genetic values were simulated in Step 2 as [] ~ (). The genetic and residual (co)variance matrices were  respectively: Two different scenarios with maternal effects were simulated: (i) a trait with a lowly heritable maternal effect (0.10)  moderate negative genetic correlation (-0.25) and moderately heritable direct effect (0.25)  and (ii) a trait with lowly heritable maternal effect (0.10)  high negative genetic correlation (-0.50) and highly heritable direct effect (0.40). Both scenarios were compared in the case of a null genetic correlation among maternal and direct effects. In Step 3  the performance of each performance-tested animal = + + + was simulated using the herd effect   its generated direct breeding value   the maternal breeding value of its dam and a residual drawn from . The simulated data were analyzed using a model with maternal effects in Step 4  but the CDs were estimated separately for the direct and maternal effect in Step 5. First  the sampling method to estimate CD (reliabilities) of estimated breeding values was applied to an animal model. The mean reliability of the 28546 animals with data decreased from 0.51 to 0.22 as the heritability decreased from a high (0.40) to a low (0.10) value (Table ). This reliability was 0.37  with a standard deviation of 0.08 when the simulated heritability was 0.25. The reliability of sires in the first breeding season (with 0 to 30 progeny) was under the minimum reliability determined by Interbull [] to publish bull indexes (0.50-0.75). This reliability became sufficiently high for publication of breeding values after the first breeding season  i.e. 0.69 for sires with 30 to 60 progeny  and increased up to 0.86 for sires with over than 150 progeny (Table ). The reliabilities of sires were 0.07 to 0.09 points higher with an animal model than with a sire model  although they increased only between 0.01 and 0.03 points if the pedigree is not taken into account in the sire model. These differences were lower for the lowly heritable traits and increased for the highly heritable traits. In the multiple trait scenario with a null residual correlation  the mean reliability of the 28546 animals with data on lowly heritable traits increased from 0.22 to 0.23 and 0.29 in the multiple trait models with moderate (-0.25) and high (-0.50) genetic correlation respectively (Table ). The increase in reliability was higher as reliability of the animal decreased. However  these gains were not so important when the magnitude of the residual correlation was equal to the genetic correlation (Table ). In models with maternal effects  reliabilities of the animals for the direct effects were similar to those obtained from single-trait evaluations (results not shown); in particular  the reliability of dams for maternal effects was 0.21. This reliability increased if a genetic correlation with the direct effects existed. The increase was equal to 0.04 point if the genetic correlation was high (-0.5) with a highly heritable trait (0.40) (Table ). However  the reliability only became high enough to publish breeding values for maternal grandsires with more than 30 dam progeny (Table ). Once the 76 × 76 matrix of CD of contrasts among herds was estimated  the average CD per herd was calculated as the mean of the 76 CD values of each herd column. Later on  mean  standard deviation  minimum and maximum of the 76 average CD per herd were calculated. The mean of average CDs per herd in the single-trait animal model decreased from 0.53 to 0.31 as the simulated heritabilities decreased from 0.40 to 0.10. The percentage of herds contrasts with CD higher than 0.4 decreased with the heritability from 85.93% to 25.54% (Table ). The average CD per herd ranged between 0.243 and 0.644 when the simulated heritability was 0.25  with a mean of 0.455 and a standard deviation of 0.087 (Table ). This average CD was about double than that obtained using a sire model with unknown and known pedigree (0.22 and 0.24  respectively). The percentage of connected herds was also much higher with an animal model (70.70%) than with a sire model (16.62%). The percentage of connected herds using a sire model was very poor even for highly heritable traits (Table )  while  the degree of connection evaluated with an animal model was important for moderately and highly heritable traits but still poor for lowly heritable traits. In the multiple trait scenario with a null residual correlation  the mean of the approximated CD of contrast for the lowly heritable traits increased from 0.31 in the single-trait evaluation to 0.35 in the multi-trait evaluation with a high genetic correlation and highly heritable trait  increasing the percentage of connected herds from 25.54% to 34.03% (Table ). However  the increase in the percentages was not so high if there was residual correlation with the same magnitude as the genetic correlation. In models with maternal effects  the average CD per herd for the direct effects were similar to those obtained from single-trait evaluations (results not shown)  but the average CD for maternal effects were lower than in the single-trait evaluation  i.e. 0.19 vs. 0.31 respectively (Table ). The percentage of connected herds for maternal effects was very low  less than 10% (Table ). The mean of average CD per herd increased from 0.202 to 0.251 if the maternal effects had a high genetic correlation with the direct effects  but the percentage of connected herds only increased from 8.25% to 11.82% (Table ). The clustering procedure was applied to the 76 × 76 matrix of CD of contrasts among herds. In the moderate heritability scenario (0.25)  a big cluster was found including 48 herds (Figure ). Two more clusters were found by grouping two and three herds. The rest of the herds up to 76 could not be included in any cluster. The number of herds in the big cluster was even bigger (up to 58) when the simulated heritability was high (0.40) (Figure ). However  the number dropped to 18 herds for low heritabilities (0.10)  although it still contained the larger herds of the breed because a higher number of animals per herd allowed a better comparison of the genetic level among herds. . The heritabilities used were h = 0.10 (Thin black line)  h = 0.25 (dotted black line) and h = 0.50 (thick dashed line). The BLUP of breeding values allows comparisons between animals if the reliability is high enough  but the individual reliability is not a sufficient measure of risk in comparing animals across herds  and does not reflect potential bias in models that exclude genetic groups or increased error associated with fitting genetic groups []. A better criterion to assess this risk is the CD of comparisons between animals (or groups of animals) from different herds []. Generally  a low CD corresponds to a contrast estimated without accuracy due to some confusion between environmental and genetic differences []. The CD of comparisons depends on three factors: (1) the amount of information  through the number of progeny per herd; (2) the quality of the design through the proportion of progeny from reference sires within a herd; and (3) the heritability []. In this study  the CDs of comparisons between herds of beef cattle bred by natural service have been computed using a sampling method. These CDs were low when the genetic evaluation was done using a sire model  even for highly heritable traits. When the simulated heritability was 0.25  the mean of average CD per herd in the Bruna dels Pirineus breed (0.244) using a sire model was slightly lower than that found by Fouilloux et al. [] in the Bazadais breed (0.294) and much lower than that of the Charolais breed (0.54). These two beef cattle breeds use artificial insemination. In these cases  links between herds come through reference sires that have progeny in different herds and a sire model can be sufficient to establish connectedness among herds. However  in many local beef cattle breeds  breeding is performed almost exclusively by natural service. The Bruna dels Pirineus breeders had never attempted a formal exchange of bulls among herds  although some amount of exchange is believed to have taken place through purchases of bulls from prominent breeders and at national shows and auctions. Because of the lack of artificial insemination and of an active exchange program  connectedness was expected to be more limited in the Bruna dels Pirineus breed than in the Bazadais breed and  especially  the Charolais breed. The reliability of comparisons among herds increased using an animal model because more pedigree information was added  especially the connections due to maternal and paternal grandsires. In the Bruna dels Pirineus breed  Tarres et al. [] found that the genetic similarity of connected herds was higher through maternal grandsires and paternal grandsires (25.91% and 38.91%  respectively) than through sharing sires (20.87%). As a result of including this pedigree information  the degree of connection evaluated with an animal model in the Bruna dels Pirineus breed was considerably high for moderately and highly heritable traits. However  the connectedness levels for lowly heritable traits  e.g. functional traits  were still poor. Connectedness in genetic evaluations for lowly heritable traits can be improved by performing joint evaluations with more heritable and highly correlated traits  especially if the residual correlation among these traits is nearly null. Our results agree with Schaeffer []  in the sense that the capacity of a multiple trait analysis to increase CD depends on residual and genetic correlations used for the analysis. First  the percentage increment of CD was dependent on the difference between error and genetic correlations. The greater the absolute difference in correlations  the greater the increment of CD for both traits []. Second  when the residual correlation is less (greater) than the genetic correlation  in absolute terms  then the trait with the lower (higher) heritability achieves the greatest percent increment of CD []. For traits with direct and maternal effects  the CDs of comparisons among herds were considerably high for direct effects. In the case of maternal effects  they can be better evaluated if a high genetic correlation exists with the direct effects. This favors the evaluation of the maternal effects for birth weight that had a heritability of 0.10 and a high negative genetic correlation (-0.5) to the highly heritable direct effect (0.40) []. For weaning weight  the maternal effects had a low heritability of 0.10 and a moderate negative genetic correlation (-0.25) to the moderately heritable direct effect (0.25) []. However  even if high genetic correlation is used in the evaluation  the comparisons among herds for maternal effects had a low reliability. As a result of these links  most of the herds of the Bruna dels Pirineus breed were well connected  especially for moderately and highly heritable traits. The herds of this breed were located primarily within the same region: the Pyrenean area of Catalonia (Spain). Because almost all of the matings in this beef population were by natural service  the close proximity of these herds has made bulls' and heifers' exchanges more feasible. Furthermore  because they are a one-purpose breed raised for meat production  Bruna dels Pirineus breeders participating in the YRS have similar breeding objectives  creating the potential for many herds to purchase and to use related individuals. This can explain the fact that many of the herds were well connected. According to the results of the connectedness study and although all performances must be included in the genetic evaluation  only genetic values of animals coming from connected herds should be published at a \"racial level \" while genetic values of animals coming from disconnected herds should be used only within herds or provided with a warning that comparisons between poorly connected herds may be biased. By using sires from well-connected YRS herds  the disconnected herds should  quickly  become strongly connected with other Bruna dels Pirineus herds in the YRS. New herds entering the YRS can  therefore  become rapidly connected to the entire breed by purchasing sires from herds that are already well connected. Exchange of bulls and purchase of bulls from other herds can increase connectedness effectively and reduce the risk of bias when EBVs of animals from different herds are compared []. The own dynamics of a beef cattle population bred by natural service could imply an important exchange of breeding animals between herds (connections) that could explain the high CD of comparisons found among herds. It was worthwhile to use an animal model when performing the sampling method to estimate the CD because adding pedigree information and  especially  considering the connections due to the dams  increased the CD values. Connectedness in genetic evaluations for lowly heritable traits can be improved by performing joint evaluations with more heritable traits with a high genetic correlation. Maternal effects can also be evaluated better if a high genetic correlation with direct effects exists. As a result of these links  most of the Bruna dels Pirineus herds were well connected and the genetic evaluation will allow producers to identify breeding animals that are potentially better than their own  especially for moderately and highly heritable traits.

The data set used to investigate these questions consisted of 3 863 German Holstein bulls genotyped for 54 001 SNPs  their pedigree and daughter yield deviations for milk yield  fat yield  protein yield and somatic cell score. A cross-validation methodology was applied  where the maximum additive-genetic relationship () between bulls in training and validation was controlled.

GEBV accuracy of current selection candidates varies due to different additive-genetic relationships relative to the training data. Accuracy of future candidates can be lower than reported in previous studies because information from close relatives will not be available when selection on GEBVs is applied. A Bayesian model averaging approach exploits LD information considerably better than G-BLUP and thus is the most promising method. Cross-validations should account for family structure in the data to allow for long-lasting genomic based breeding plans in animal and plant breeding. The development of high-throughput genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has enhanced the use of genome-wide dense marker data for genetic improvement in livestock. Meuwissen et al. [] presented a two-step approach to predict genomic breeding values (GEBVs): First  SNP effects are estimated using genotyped individuals that are phenotyped for the quantitative trait (training)  and then GEBVs are predicted for any genotyped individual by using only its SNP genotypes and estimated SNP effects. This prediction and selection on GEBVs was termed genomic selection (GS). The acceptance of GS by cattle breeders and thereby the potential to reduce generation intervals depends mainly on the accuracy of GEBVs. Assuming that cosegregation is not modeled  GEBV accuracy is higher than the accuracy of standard pedigree-based BLUP-EBVs only if there is linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and quantitative trait loci (QTL). LD is defined here as the dependency between the allele states at different loci of all individuals in the available data set. In case of linkage equilibrium  the accuracy of GEBVs is not necessarily zero but will approach the accuracy of pedigree-based BLUP-EBVs as the number of SNPs fitted in the model increases. The reason is that SNPs capture additive-genetic relationships irrespective of the amount of LD in the population as demonstrated by Habier et al. [] and Gianola et al. []. In those studies as well as here  additive-genetic relationships are defined as twice the coefficient of coancestry given by Malécot []. Note that this does not require that the training individuals are related  but only that individuals for which GEBVs are estimated are related to the training individuals. This is demonstrated in detail in additional file  in this paper. In practice  LD exists in cattle populations [–] and thus two types of information are utilized to estimate GEBVs: LD and additive-genetic relationships. If cosegregation is modeled  then a third type of information can be utilized. However  cosegregation was not modeled in this study. The persistence of the accuracy of GEBVs over generations  and therefore the potential of GS to reduce future phenotyping [  ]  depends largely on the amount of LD  which originates in outbred populations from historic mutations and drift  cosegregation  migration  selection and recent drift. In simulations  Habier et al. [] estimated the accuracy of GEBVs that is only due to LD (in short  accuracy due to LD)  which was considerably smaller than the GEBV accuracy resulting from both LD and additive-genetic relationships in the offspring of the training individuals  but it was fairly persistent over generations. Furthermore  the ability to exploit LD information by the statistical methods used to estimate SNP effects varies. Meuwissen et al. [] proposed a Bayesian model averaging approach termed BayesB  which fits only a small proportion of the available SNPs in each round of a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and models SNP effects with a t-distributed prior. They further used Ridge-Regression BLUP (RR-BLUP)  which fits all SNP effects with a normal prior. Habier et al. [] showed that BayesB was more able to exploit LD information and less affected by additive-genetic relationships than RR-BLUP. Accuracy of GEBVs from real cattle data has been reported for Holstein Friesian populations from North America []  Australia  the Netherlands and New Zealand [  ]. In those studies  accuracies of GEBVs for milk performance  fertility and functional traits ranged from 0.63 to 0.84  and depended on the size of the training data  heritability and SNP density. These accuracies confirmed those found in simulations [      ] quite well  but RR-BLUP was only slightly inferior compared to methods that fit only a fraction of the available SNPs such as BayesB. VanRaden et al. [] and Hayes et al. [] concluded that  unlike in most simulations  only a few QTL with a large effect and many with a small effect contribute to genetic variation. These studies  however  did not show the dependency of the GEBV accuracy on additive-genetic relationships  which is a function of the number of relatives in training  the degree of relationship with training individuals [] and heritability. Thus  a lower accuracy with decreasing training size [] could be the result of a lower number of relatives in training  meaning that the more persistent accuracy due to LD and the GS method that exploits LD information best remains to be evaluated for real cattle data. More important  the dependency of GEBV accuracy on additive-genetic relationships as well as the accuracy due to LD must be known to develop future breeding programs  because close relatives that were progeny tested for quantitative traits may not be available when GEBVs are applied to select animals early in lifetime. The objectives of this study were to analyze the impact of additive-genetic relationships between training and validation data sets on the accuracy of GEBVs and to estimate the accuracy due to LD in the German Holstein Friesian population. Thereby  the accuracy of GEBVs for current and future selection candidates as well as for individuals that are unrelated to the population were estimated. Furthermore  the comparison of BayesB and RR-BLUP based on the accuracy due to LD will show which statistical model has the potential to reduce future phenotyping. A total of 3 863 German Holstein Friesian bulls  progeny tested with at least 30 daughters in the first lactation and genotyped for 54 001 SNPs distributed over the whole genome  were available. The proportion of missing genotypes for any bull was lower than 5%  at an average of 1%. The distribution of genotyped bulls by birth year and the average number of daughters per bull are shown in Table . The family structure of these bulls  consisting of paternal half and full sib families as well as genotyped fathers and sons  are summarized in Table . DNA was extracted either from frozen semen  leukocyte pellets or fullblood samples. The BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA) was used to obtain SNP genotypes for all bulls. A detailed description of the SNP content was given by []. Only SNPs with less than 5% missing genotypes and minor allele frequency greater than 3% were used  resulting in 40 588 SNPs. Minor allele frequencies of the selected SNPs were nearly uniformly distributed with a mean = 0.27. Genotypes of SNPs located on the X chromosome  but outside the pseudo-autosomal region  were set to missing if the genotype of a bull was heterozygous. Missing genotypes were imputed by  []. Furthermore  the haplotypes obtained by  were utilized in Haploview [] to estimate  as a measure of LD between SNPs. Haplotypes of all genotyped bulls were used in this calculation  because the aim was to evaluate the LD that can be utilized to estimated SNP effects  and this LD may have also been caused by cosegregation  recent drift and selection. The pedigree consisted of genotyped bulls as well as their ancestors born between 1950 and 1998  yielding a total of 21 591 individuals. This pedigree was used to generate training and validation data sets with a specified maximum additive-genetic relationship between bulls in both data sets and to estimate breeding values with the standard BLUP-methodology. Daughter yield deviations (DYDs) [] for the quantitative traits milk yield  fat yield  protein yield and somatic cell score were available for both genotyped bulls and their male ancestors in the pedigree. They were estimated from the test-day yields of daughters corrected for fixed and permanent environmental effects as well as half the breeding value of the daughter's dam []. Phenotypes and estimated effects were taken from the April 2009 evaluation for the German Holstein Friesian population. Additive-genetic and residual variances   and   used as prior information in the statistical analyses  were estimated by ASReml [] utilizing all phenotyped bulls in the pedigree. A sire model was used for this purpose in which residual terms were weighted by the reliability of a bull's DYD. Three statistical models were used to evaluate the impact of additive-genetic relationships on the accuracy of GEBVs. These were 1) BayesB []  2) BLUP animal model using the genomic relationship matrix []  which is equivalent to RR-BLUP [    ]  and 3) BLUP animal model using the numerator relationship matrix [  ] to estimate standard BLUP breeding values. These models are described in more detail below. The statistical model for BayesB can be written as where is the DYD of bull  in training   is an intercept   = 40  588 SNPs  is the SNP genotype  is the effect and is a 0/1-indicator variable  all for SNP   is the residual effect with mean zero and variance   and is the reliability of . SNP genotypes are coded as the number of copies of one of the SNP alleles  i.e. 0  1 or 2. The prior for  was 1  for  scaled inverse chi-square with degrees of freedom = 4.2 and scale   and for the probability that SNP  is fitted in the model   = Pr(= 1)  which was set to 0.01. SNP effects are treated as random and are sampled from  (0  )  where  has a scaled inverse chi-square prior with = 4.2 and . The variance  was calculated as   where is the allele frequency at SNP . MCMC-sampling was used to infer model parameters  where   and  were sampled with Gibbs steps and and  with a Metropolis-Hastings step. The MCMC-sampler was run for 50 000 iterations with a  of 40 000 rounds. The GEBV of bull   either in training or validation  was estimated as where  is the estimated SNP effect of locus . The BLUP animal model used to estimate genomic or pedigree-based EBVs is where   and are defined as before   is the overall mean  and is the breeding value of bull  in training. Genomic BLUP (G-BLUP) EBVs of both training and validation bulls were obtained by mixed-model equations using the genomic relationship matrix  whereas pedigree-based BLUP (P-BLUP) EBVs were obtained by using the numerator relationship matrix [  ]. The elements of the genomic relationship matrix were calculated as  following [  ]  where is a column vector containing the SNP genotypes of training and validation bulls at locus . Training and validation data sets were generated systematically using the additive-genetic relationships between bulls derived from the pedigree in order to study the impact of additive-genetic relationship information on accuracy of GEBVs by cross-validation. The aim was to control the maximum additive-genetic relationship between bulls in training and validation denoted by ; That is  given   no bull in training was allowed to have an additive-genetic relationship larger than with a bull in validation. This criterion allows to divide the family structure present in the data set such that validation bulls are allowed to have close relatives in training or not. Furthermore  the decay of additive-genetic relationships over generations  similar to that in simulation studies [      ]  can be mimicked. A sampling algorithm was implemented to generate training and validation data sets  which assigned bulls to both sets in a way that was not exceeded. For small values this can only be achieved by removing completely some bulls from the analysis  where the algorithm was optimized to exclude as few bulls as possible. In general  the lower the   the smaller the number of bulls in validation. Therefore  several pairs of training and validation data sets were sampled  where repeated sampling of a bull into validation was not accepted. In addition  no more than two bulls out of one half sib family were allowed to be in validation in order to reduce the dependency between validation bulls in each pair of data sets. Furthermore  fathers of training bulls were not allowed to be in validation  because the accuracy of those bulls is not representative for the prediction of the GEBVs of future individuals as demonstrated by []. Four different scenarios with = 0.6  0.49  0.249 and 0.1249 were generated. These values were selected to exploit the family structure in the data as follows: The training data set contained fathers  full- and half sibs of the bulls in validation with = 0.6  only half sibs with = 0.49  and neither of those close relatives with = 0.249 and 0.1249. All scenarios had the same training size in order to exclude the effect of different sizes on the accuracy of GEBVs. Because of difficulties to obtain large training data sets for the lowest in a structured dairy cattle population  the training sizes for the other scenarios were reduced to the average size of = 0.1249 by removing bulls randomly. Note  however  that for the scenarios with = 0.6 and 0.49 the half and full sibs or fathers of the bulls in validation were not removed from the training data. The training size for = 0.1249 was 2 096 bulls on average in 15 sampled pairs of training and validation data sets  hence the training size for the other scenarios was fixed at 2 096 bulls. Validation data sets of each sample for the first three scenarios were required to have at least 30 bulls  and for = 0.1249 at least 11 bulls. The correlation between EBVs and DYDs was also estimated for training bulls and denoted as scenario = 1. To study the effect of the size of the training data on accuracy at different values  training data sets were halved to a size of 1 048 by removing bulls randomly  except for fathers as well as full and half sibs of the bulls in validation. Thus  the number of close relatives between training and validation was kept constant in order to analyze the impact of the precision of SNP effects on accuracy rather than the number of relatives  which can already be observed with decreasing . The correlation between true and estimated breeding values   and   was estimated by the following formula: where  denotes DYD   the heritability of DYDs and  the correlation between the true breeding value and DYD averaged over bulls in validation. The latter was estimated from the accuracy of DYDs using the selection index formula   where is the number of daughters of a bull  and  the heritability of a daughter record of trait  known from parameter estimations by Liu et al. [  ]. The heritabilities for milk  fat and protein yield as well as somatic cell score were 0.53  0.52  0.51 and 0.23  respectively. The correlation  was calculated using the validation bulls from all replicates of a specified   after their EBVs were corrected by the mean EBV of their respective validation data set. The accuracy due to LD was estimated using a regression approach as suggested by Habier et al. []. In that study  the authors estimated the accuracy due to LD of generation     by using the accuracy of GEBVs obtained from four generations and the model where is the accuracy of GEBVs in generation   is the accuracy of P-BLUP in generation  divided by the accuracy of P-BLUP in generation   which models the decay of P-BLUP accuracy due to the decline of additive-genetic relationships  is the difference between the accuracy of GEBVs and the accuracy due to LD in generation   is the decay of LD over generations and is a residual term. In this study  accuracies of GEBVs from different generations were replaced by those from different values. Furthermore  the accuracy due to LD was assumed to be constant with different values  because the average birth year of training and validation bulls was nearly the same for all values and thus is always 1. The equation used here was where  is the accuracy of GEBVs for (i.e.  0.6  0.49  0.249 and 0.1249) estimated by BayesB or G-BLUP   is the accuracy of P-BLUP for divided by the accuracy of P-BLUP for = 0.6   is the difference between the accuracy of GEBVs for = 0.6 and the accuracy due to LD and  is a residual term. Figure  shows average  between syntenic SNP pairs against map distance of up to 1 megabase (Mb)  which is roughly 1 centimorgan  as well as standard deviations of the average  values across all 30 chromosomes. Average  decreased exponentially with increasing distance between SNPs and was equal to 0.29  0.23  0.15 and 0.07 at distances of 0.02  0.04  0.1  and 1 Mb  respectively. Average distance and  of adjacent SNPs were 0.064 Mb and 0.22  respectively.   . Table  summarizes the number of bulls used for training in each sampled pair of training and validation data sets as well as the total number of validation bulls over all samples for the specified values. Fifteen pairs of training and validation data sets were generated for each scenario with an average validation size of 33 bulls per sampled pair for = 0.6  0.49 and 0.249  and 11 bulls for = 0.1249. To better understand the differences in the accuracy of GEBVs between values in the following description of the results  the distributions of additive-genetic relationships between bulls in training and validation depending on are depicted in Figure . The scenarios = 0.6  0.49 and 0.249 only differed in the upper parts of their distributions  whereas mean (not shown)  median and quartiles were nearly identical. The training data for = 0.49 contained half sibs which were not in the training data sets for = 0.249 and 0.1249  and the scenario with = 0.6 had also full sibs and fathers of bulls in validation which were not in the scenario 0.49. A validation bull had on average 10 half sibs in training in both scenarios with = 0.6 and 0.49  but numbers varied largely between 1 and 58. Only a few validation bulls had a full sib or father in training in the scenario with = 0.6.  . Figure  depicts the accuracy of EBVs depending on for milk  fat and protein yield as well as somatic cell score obtained by BayesB  G-BLUP and P-BLUP utilizing 2 096 training bulls. For = 1  accuracies were close to unity for G-BLUP and P-BLUP  but somewhat lower for BayesB. The reason is that accuracies for = 1 describe goodness of fit rather than prediction ability and it is well known that the coefficient of determination  which is related to this accuracy  increases with the number of explanatory variables. G-BLUP used all available SNPs  whereas BayesB fitted only 400 in each round of the MCMC-algorithm. Accuracy of P-BLUP decreased with as expected  where the overall level for milk and protein yield was higher than for fat yield and somatic cell score. P-BLUP was outperformed by both GS methods  where the absolute difference between the latter and P-BLUP was higher for fat yield and somatic cell score compared to milk and protein yield. The highest accuracies of GEBVs were found for = 0.6 and 0.49 and equal to 0.68  0.65 and 0.60 for milk  fat and protein yield  respectively  and 0.58 for somatic cell score. BayesB and G-BLUP gave similar results in all traits except for milk yield for which BayesB performed notably better. Interestingly  the accuracy of GEBVs from both GS methods was very similar for values = 0.6 and 0.49  although a decay was found from 0.6 to 0.49 for P-BLUP in most traits. No plausible reason could be found for that  especially as the decay of accuracy of the GS methods resembled that of P-BLUP quite well otherwise.     . Accuracy of GEBVs clearly decreased from = 0.49 to 0.1249 in all four traits and for both BayesB and G-BLUP (Figure ). The decay of accuracy was similar for both GS methods in somatic cell score  but smaller with BayesB for the yield traits. As a result  the accuracy of the yield traits at = 0.1249 was higher with BayesB than with G-BLUP. Furthermore  the smallest decay of accuracy was found for fat yield  followed by somatic cell score. With a training size of only 1 048 bulls  the accuracy level of all methods decreased (Figure  and ). Because the number of fathers  half and full sibs of validation bulls was identical for both training sizes analyzed  accuracy of GEBVs for the yield traits decreased by only 0.03 to 0.05 for values = 0.6 and 0.49. The loss in accuracy with decreasing was similar for both training sizes from = 0.49 to 0.249  but considerably larger from 0.249 to 0.1249 with only 1 048 training bulls. The differences between BayesB and G-BLUP were comparable for the two training sizes  except for = 0.1249 where differences tend to decrease with the smaller training data set.     . Table  shows the accuracy due to LD estimated by equation () for the two sizes of training data sets and the four traits analyzed. With 2 096 training bulls  the accuracy due to LD is always higher for BayesB than for G-BLUP  where the largest difference of 0.2 and 0.12 between methods was obtained for milk and protein yield  respectively  and smallest for somatic cell score. With only half the training size  both the accuracies due to LD and the differences between the two GS methods decreased considerably. The absolute decay of accuracies was similarly high for milk yield  fat yield and somatic cell score  but notably smaller for protein yield  which had the smallest accuracy of all traits with 2 096 training bulls. Furthermore  BayesB and G-BLUP gave very similar accuracies for fat yield and somatic cell score using 1 048 training bulls  whereas BayesB was consistently better for milk and protein yield. In comparison to the accuracies of GEBVs with 2 096 training bulls (Figure )  differences between BayesB and G-BLUP became more distinct for the accuracies due to LD. In addition  the ranking of the traits according to their accuracies is different. Milk and protein yield had clearly higher accuracies of GEBVs than fat yield and somatic cell score  whereas fat yield had the highest accuracy due to LD and protein yield the lowest. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of additive-genetic relationships between bulls in training and validation data sets on the accuracy of GEBVs and to estimate the accuracy due to LD. The accuracy of GEBVs obtained by both BayesB and G-BLUP decreased with maximum additive-genetic relationship between bulls in training and validation () for all four traits analyzed. The decay of accuracy tended to be larger for G-BLUP and when training size was smaller. The differences between BayesB and G-BLUP became more evident considering the accuracy due to LD. BayesB clearly outperformed G-BLUP in sets of 2 096 training bulls. The LD found here is comparable to that reported by De Roos et al. [] for the Dutch and Australian Holstein populations making the results of this study meaningful for other Holstein populations. Results of this study demonstrate that the accuracy of GEBVs is not constant for all selection candidates but can vary depending on the number of relatives in training and the degree of additive-genetic relationships with training individuals (Figure  and ). The impact of additive-genetic relationships also depends on the method used to estimate SNP effects []  because the more SNPs fitted  the more additive-genetic relationships are captured by them. This may explain why G-BLUP tended to decrease more with than BayesB. In principle  the decay of accuracy with additive-genetic relationships is also expected to be higher with increasing heritability  but this could not be observed here. The accuracies of GEBVs reported in this study are representative for the prediction of GEBVs of future generations  in that fathers with offspring in training were not used for validation. Otherwise the accuracy would be higher because their Mendelian sampling terms could be inferred by utilizing the additive-genetic relationships captured by SNPs. In conclusion  the additive-genetic relationships between training individuals and a selection candidate must be known in order to provide a reliable GEBV accuracy of that candidate in practical application. As was shown with Figure   the average additive-genetic relationship for the scenarios 0.6  0.49 and 0.249 did not differ  and thus is not helpful to describe the impact of additive-genetic relationships on accuracy  but rather . This criterion was selected here to exploit the family structure in the data  but other criteria should be found that are more useful in practice. One possibility  which should be tested in subsequent studies  could be the expected accuracy of P-BLUP obtained from theoretical calculations. To evaluate the expected variation in accuracy for young selection candidates  was calculated for bulls born in 2007 with respect to the full training data set of 3 863 bulls. Fortunately  all selection candidates have = 0.125  83% have = 0.25  and one third even have ancestors and full sibs in training. The reason for these high genetic relationships are the long generation intervals in cattle and the low effective population size of 40-50 (personal unpublished studies  estimated from pedigree). This shows that the accuracy of GEBVs for current selection candidates is expected to vary due to different additive-genetic relationships with the training data. Accuracy due to LD ranged between 0.29 for protein yield to 0.48 for fat yield using 2 096 training bulls and BayesB. With this number of training bulls  accuracy due to LD  which is expected to be fairly persistent over generations  appears to be too small to reduce trait phenotyping  and progeny testing in particular if GS is applied. However  accuracy due to LD improved considerably with increasing training size and thus further studies are necessary to evaluate the accuracy due to LD with the current training size of 3 863 bulls and beyond. Further improvements may be possible by varying the strong prior probability of fitting a SNP locus into the model    or by treating it as another variable model parameter. The accuracy due to LD may be a lower bound for the accuracy of an individual that is unrelated to the training population. However  if LD is primarily due to selection and recent drift rather than historic mutations  the accuracy for unrelated individuals might be even lower. This could be the case if selection candidates descend from a population having an LD structure that is different from that in the training data. This may apply to individuals either from families that did not contribute to the actual German Holstein Friesian population or from Holstein populations of other regions  such as Australia  New Zealand or the United States. The classical inheritance model in quantitative genetics divides the breeding value into parent average and a Mendelian sampling term. The advantage of GS is that the latter can be inferred without its own or progeny performance []. In general  LD information contributes to both parts of the breeding value  and thus the accuracy due to LD is not necessarily the accuracy to predict Mendelian sampling terms. This accuracy is of great interest in order to evaluate future inbreeding and effective selection intensity when selecting on GEBVs. For this purpose and to test to what extent the accuracy due to LD obtained in this study corresponds to the accuracy to predict Mendelian sampling  cross-validations should be conducted with Mendelian sampling terms estimated from DYDs of bulls and yield deviations of dams. The persistence of the accuracy due to LD over generations might depend on the source of LD that is utilized in estimating SNP effects  which should also be analyzed in further studies. Muir [] showed that accuracy of GEBVs is not only persistent due to historic mutations and drift  but also when LD originates only from recent drift and selection. Furthermore  when selecting on GEBVs both the extent of LD between SNPs and QTL and the size of the QTL effects determine the fixation of QTL alleles [] and thereby a possible decay of accuracy due to LD over generations. The number of QTL affecting a quantitative trait was estimated by Hayes et al. [] to be in the range of 100-200. Goddard []  however  pointed out that there are probably many more  because there is a limit to the size of the effect that can be detected. These findings are consistent with conclusions from GS studies [  ]  namely  that there are only a few major genes  but many with a small effect. Results of this study confirm these conclusions because BayesB did not perform much better than G-BLUP in the accuracy of GEBVs. BayesB was even inferior to G-BLUP for somatic cell score with a training size of 1 048 bulls. In simulations [  ]  however  in which the genetic variance was mainly determined by a few QTL with a large effect  BayesB utilized LD information considerably better than G-BLUP. The question arises why G-BLUP was mostly as good as BayesB and superior to P-BLUP despite the underlying prior assumptions for SNP effects  causing strong shrinkage. Goddard [] pointed out that GS works in part by using deviations of the realized relationships from that expected from the pedigree  where these deviations are only useful if there is LD between SNPs and QTL or cosegregation. Those deviations seem to be estimated better if more SNPs are fitted in the model and therefore G-BLUP has advantages compared to BayesB if SNP effects and/or LD are small. This may explain why G-BLUP worked better than BayesB for somatic cell score with 1 048 training bulls. However  if more SNPs are fitted in BayesB  e.g. by altering  to 5 or 10%  that difference may disappear. The accuracy due to LD gives more insight into the differences of the genetic determination of quantitative traits. Because this accuracy was higher for fat and milk yield than for protein yield and somatic cell score  milk and fat yield are determined either by QTL with larger effects or the LD between SNPs and QTL is higher than for protein yield and somatic cell score. However  heritability of somatic cell score is lower than that of the yield traits []  reducing the ability to detect QTL. One reason for the difference between protein and the other two yield traits may be  [  ]  but this locus is already well estimated with the lower training size and thus the increasing difference with more training individuals results most likely from the fact that more QTL are detected. Meuwissen et al. [] fitted 2-SNP haplotypes with BayesB and obtained an accuracy for the offspring of training individuals of 0.85 and 0.75 based on 2 200 and 1 000 training individuals  respectively. Solberg et al. [] and Habier et al. [  ]  in contrast  fitted single SNPs and found an accuracy of 0.7 with 1 000 training individuals  where the accuracy due to LD was estimated to be 0.55 []. Although training data sets were comparable in size to this study  accuracies from simulations tended to be higher  which might have two main reasons. First  in simulations every offspring had two parents in the training data set so that the additive-genetic relationship information between training and validation data sets is expected to be higher at first sight  but more half sib relationships are present in real cattle populations. Second  there might be a discrepancy between the simulated genetic models and the genetic architecture (number of QTL  distribution of QTL effects  LD structure) in real populations  which might explain the lower accuracy due to LD estimated in this study. To analyze the causes of the different results between simulations and real experiments in more detail  simulations should be conducted using the real pedigree  as done by [  ]. The decay of accuracy with   especially for BayesB  was similar to that observed in simulations over generations without further phenotyping after training [    ]. In simulations  the additive-genetic relationship with training individuals is halved each generation and therefore values of the first four simulated generations after training correspond to those specified in this study. Thus  the decay of accuracy with might point to the decay of accuracy in generations after training when phenotyping is stopped. Note  however  that the number of relatives in training at a certain is different from simulations. The differences between BayesB and G-BLUP in accuracy due to LD confirm simulation results []  but they tended to be higher in this study than in []. The reason may be that 40 588 SNPs were utilized here to calculate the genomic relationship matrix used in G-BLUP  whereas only 1 000 SNPs were used in []. This indicates that too many SNPs dilute LD information as shown by Fernando et al. []. Thus  as SNP density increases in the future  the genomic relationship matrix may be less valuable than using the current density unless the training data size increases largely (see also Goddard []) and/or SNPs are pre-selected based on other methods such as QTL fine mapping approaches that exploit both LD and cosegregation []. GEBVs were combined in other GS studies analyzing real data with pedigree-based EBVs by using selection index theory []  which increases the proportion of additive-genetic relationship information in GEBVs. In this study only direct GEBVs were considered to determine the impact of additive-genetic relationships captured by SNPs. Accuracies of combined GEBVs in those studies should be higher  but conversely the decay of accuracy with is also expected to be larger. Further difficulties for meaningful comparisons are different numbers of training bulls and that no information about the additive-genetic relationships between training and validation bulls was provided by the other authors. However  VanRaden et al. [] also presented squared correlations between GEBVs and DYDs using 3 500 training bulls. For the traits milk yield  fat yield  protein yield and somatic cell score correlations obtained by G-BLUP were 0.68  0.65  0.68 and 0.61  respectively. Correlations found for = 0.6 and 0.49 (Figure ) were somewhat lower  which may be due to a smaller training size of 2 096 bulls. However  Hayes et al. [] reported an accuracy of 0.67 for protein yield using G-BLUP and only 798 training bulls. Because the accuracy for protein yield with G-BLUP and 1 048 training bulls was 0.6 in this study  the relatively high accuracy estimated in [] might indicate the contribution of additive-genetic relationships either captured by SNPs or from pedigree-based EBVs. In contrast to this study  VanRaden et al. [] found a lower correlation for somatic cell score with G-BLUP than with a non-linear method similar to BayesB. The fact that SNPs capture additive-genetic relationships has to be taken into account when genomic breeding values are combined with pedigree-based EBVs in practice. Otherwise the advantages of GS with respect to inbreeding and effective selection intensity may be lower. The acceptance of GS by breeders depends to a large extent on the level of accuracy of GEBVs. Until now  breeders mainly use progeny tested bulls with a high accuracy above 0.9  which is not yet achieved with GEBVs without information from relatives. The most realistic scenario at this moment is to use GEBVs for pre-selection of young calves in combination with a subsequent progeny testing. The latter will continuously provide relatives for training and thereby ensure the highest accuracy of GEBVs. This also means that SNP effects should be re-estimated in short time intervals to always include the latest phenotypic data. The combination of GEBVs with pedigree-based EBVs might not be the only criterion for selection as deviations from expected relationships provide additional and specific information. However  the accuracy of future cohorts can be lower than for the current ones because if bulls are selected on GEBVs and mated to the breeding population as soon as they are sexually mature  the progeny test results will not be available before the next generation is ready to be selected on GEBVs (Kay-Uwe Götz  personal communication). Consider the following situation of a possible breeding program: Suppose sons of a progeny tested bull are just born. After 1.5 years  these sons can be selected on GEBVs and then mated to the population to produce both the next breeding generation and test progeny. The accuracy of their GEBVs is expected to be as high as for = 0.6 or 0.49. Another 2.5 years later  the grand-sons become selection candidates  but the accuracy of their GEBVs should be at least as low as for = 0.249  because progeny testing lasts four years in cattle and therefore no half and full sib information will be available for these grand-sons. Consequently  the GEBV accuracy of future candidates may be lower than reported in previous studies. Most likely breeders would not accept these low accuracies  meaning that the generation interval cannot be decreased at this stage of the GS developments. However  as statistical methods improve and both SNP density and training size increase  the currently expected accuracy of future candidates may also be higher. The better approach to predict GEBVs in the future is probably BayesB rather than G-BLUP  because as SNP density and data size increase  BayesB may be able to address more QTL such that the accuracy due to LD is higher and additive-genetic relationship information becomes less important. This was demonstrated here at least for training data size (Table ). Furthermore  there were many adjacent SNPs with  close to zero and thus QTL in between might not be picked up by SNPs. VanRaden et al. [] compared several SNP densities by removing SNPs from the 54K panel and found an increase in accuracy with density. Another option to increase both the level of accuracy and the persistence with decreasing additive-genetic relationships might be to model cosegregation in addition to LD as proposed by [–]. For an average  of 0.225 between adjacent SNPs  which is identical to this study  Calus et al. [] found no clear differences in the accuracy of GEBVs between a model similar to BayesB and the approach of [] using simulated data. The question remains  however  whether this simulation result holds in practice  because the real genetic model seems to be different from the simulated one. This can be suspected from the high accuracy of 0.8 for the offspring of 1 000 training individuals in the simulations by [] compared to the accuracies of this study. Therefore additional information from cosegregation should be useful in practice. Additive-genetic relationships between the training individuals and a selection candidate captured by SNPs affect the GEBV accuracy of that candidate. Thus  accuracy of current candidates can vary in practice. These additive-genetic relationships must be known to provide the accuracy along with GEBVs  and SNP effects should be re-estimated in short time intervals to include the most recent phenotypic data from relatives. The accuracy of future selection candidates can be smaller than reported in previous studies because information from relatives might not be available when selection on GEBVs is possible and they can be used for breeding. The decay of accuracy with decreasing additive-genetic relationships is higher with a smaller number of training individuals. Differences in accuracy of GEBVs between G-BLUP and BayesB are small  but BayesB is much more able to exploit LD information than G-BLUP. Therefore  as SNP density and training data size increase a Bayesian model averaging approach is more suitable for GS than G-BLUP. Further studies are needed to analyze the source of LD  its possible persistence with selection and the accuracy to predict Mendelian sampling terms. Cross-validations that do not take into account the structure of the data  and additive-genetic relationships in particular  are not meaningful enough for problems in plant and animal breeding.

The impact of two known  mutations was examined in a field experiment with Norwegian White Sheep. The joint effect of the two  mutations on live weight gain and weaning weight was studied on 644 lambs. Carcass weight gain from birth to slaughter  carcass weight  carcass conformation and carcass fat classes were calculated in a subset of 508 lambs. All analyses were carried out with a univariate linear animal model. The most significant impact of both mutations was on conformation and fat classes. The largest difference between the genotype groups was between the wild type for both mutations and the homozygotes for the c.960delG mutation. Compared to the wild types  these mutants obtained a conformation score 5.1 classes higher and a fat score 3.0 classes lower  both on a 15-point scale. Both mutations reduced fatness and increased muscle mass  although the effect of the frameshift mutation (c.960delG) was more important as compared to the 3'-UTR mutation (c.2360G>A). Lambs homozygous for the c.960delG mutation grew more slowly than those with other  genotypes  but had the least fat and the largest muscle mass. Only c.960delG showed dominance effects. In Norwegian White Sheep (NWS)  two  () mutations affecting conformation and fat classes are segregating: the 3'-UTR mutation creating an illegitimate microRNA site (c.2360G>A) that was identified in Texel sheep [] and a frameshift mutation explained by a deletion of one base pair in nucleotide position 960 (c.960delG)  identified in NWS []. While c.2360G>A reduces the level of circulating myostatin to approximately one third  c.960delG generates a completely non-functional protein. Initially  the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of the c.960delG mutation on growth and carcass traits in NWS under ordinary commercial management conditions. NWS is a synthetic crossbreed  composed of the Dala  Rygja  Steigar and Texel breeds []. However  during the course of this experiment  another  mutation (c.2360G>A) was published []. Since the Texel breed is one of the NWS founder breeds [  ]  the ongoing study was expanded in order to include this new mutation. Here we present data on how the two mutations affect weight gain and lamb carcass classification. Genotyping of the two  positions  c.960 and c.2360  was carried out as described by Boman et al. []. First  the animals were genotyped only at position c.960  and then retyped at position c.2360  after publication of the second mutation. The field experiment comprised two experimental years in the Vesterålen area  in the north of Norway. The first year  all ewes of ten commercial NWS flocks were genotyped at the c.960 position. In essence  for each ewe homo- or heterozygous for c.960delG  an age-matched control ewe without the mutation from the same flock was also included in the study. All ewes were mated to a ram without the mutation (n = 34). Two flocks were excluded from the study due to the low numbers of ewes carrying the mutation (4 and 6  respectively). The remaining flocks were genetically well tied  since six belonged to the same ram circle  one was a former member of the circle and one had a history of rams purchased from the circle. A total of 200 ewes (100 case/control pairs) were included in the study  and each flock was represented with 18 to 28 ewes. In six flocks  ultrasound scanning to count the number of foetuses had been performed  thus only pregnant ewes were included in the experiment. The first priority was to include all homozygous ewes  thereafter the youngest heterozygous ewes within each flock. The numbers of ewes and rams per genotype are given in Table . The selected ewes' lambs born this year were genotyped. It was decided to replace two of the flocks from year 1  by another flock. This flock was in an adjacent ram circle  having genetic ties to the original experimental flocks because common AI rams had been used and local elite rams had been exchanged. Basically  the same sampling strategy as in year 1 was followed; 100 ewes with the c.960delG mutation and 100 without were included. In both groups  ewes with a low estimated overall breeding value were sampled  since these are not relevant for producing replacements. Prediction of the breeding value  is described by Eikje et al. []. Each flock was represented with 20 to 30 ewes. In addition  we balanced the groups with respect to age and flock as in year 1. All ewes were artificially inseminated with frozen semen from rams heterozygous for the c.960delG mutation (n = 7). For the ewes that returned  a local ram carrying the mutation was used. The numbers of ewes and rams per genotype are given in Table . The selected ewes' lambs were also genotyped in year 2. The experiment did not interfere with normal management; for example  the farmers were allowed to move lambs to a foster mother or providing supplemental feeding. In year 1  the farmers decided if and when to slaughter the lambs  while in year 2 all experimental lambs were intended to be slaughtered. At approximately four months of age  the lambs were gathered and transferred from the rough grazing pasture to the farm. Subsequently  the weaning weight of the lambs was measured and the farmers selected the lambs to be sent directly for slaughter  and those to be kept on rich pasture  for finishing. Live weight was used as a guide to decide when to slaughter the lambs according to common practise. Some farmers shipped lambs only twice in the season  while others shipped them more frequently  depending on management choices and flock size. The lambs were all slaughtered in the same commercial abattoir  and carcass classification was carried out according to the EUROP classification system in Norway []  which is on a 15-point scale  a value of 15 being the meatiest or fattiest class  respectively. Data on growth and carcass traits were retrieved from the national sheep recording system (SRS). The data were analysed univariately for weight gain per day from birth to weaning  weaning weight  carcass weight gain per day from birth to slaughter  carcass weight  carcass conformation class and fat class (Y)  with the following linear model  using DMUAI in the DMU software package []: where G is the fixed effect of the ith genotype class (1  ...  6; see Table )  GD is the fixed effect of the jth genotype class of the dam (1  ...  5; as in Table   except the class homozygous for c.960delG)  S is the fixed effect of the kth sex class (male or female)  R is the fixed effect of the lth rearing class (1  2  =3 or bottle lamb)  AD is the fixed effect of the mth age of dam class (1  2  3  4 or =5)  fy is the random effect of the nth flock-year class (1  ....  15)  i is the random additive genetic effect of the oth animal and e is the random residual term. The pedigree file comprised a total of 3292 animals  a pruned subset retrieved from the SRS for the experimental animals  comprising all known ancestors in six generations. In the statistical model  the effects of sex  rearing class and age of dam were factors that we  believed to affect the traits since they are taken into account in the national prediction of breeding values for traits recorded in the autumn. An equivalent model  analysing the same data with the same software  was used to estimate the allelic effects rather than the genotype class effects: where the regression coefficients for the additive and dominant allelic effect of c.2360G>A (a  d) and c.960delG (a  d) are given as well as their interaction (int)  while the x'es are indicator (dummy) variables; x is the number of c.2360G>A alleles (0  1  2)  x is 1 if heterozygous in c.2360 and 0 otherwise  x is the number of c.960delG alleles (0  1  2)  x is 1 if heterozygous in c.960 and 0 otherwise  x is 1 for compound heterozygotes and 0 otherwise  and the other terms are defined as in the model above. To test the impact of the two -mutations in the first model  the wild type individuals (GG_GG  for cDNA position 960 and 2360  respectively) were used as reference. We also wanted to test the impact of the genotypes carrying the c.960delG-mutation  against the group GG_AA. Hypothesis testing was done by the following contrasts  using V3.1 of PEST []  with variance components from the DMUAI run as input: 1. H: MSTN-genotype - GG_GG (wild type) = 0  where MSTN-genotype is GG_AG  GG_AA  G(delG)_GG  G(delG)_AG or (delG)(delG)_GG against H: MSTN-genotype - GG_GG (wild type) <U+2260> 0. 2. H: MSTN-genotype - GG_AA = 0  where MSTN-genotype is G(delG)_GG  G(delG)_AG or (delG)(delG)_GG  against H: MSTN-genotype - GG_AA <U+2260> 0. Hypothesis testing for the allelic effects in the second model was done by the following contrasts  using the same software and variance components: 1. H: regression coefficient = 0  where regression coefficient is the additive  dominance and interaction terms a  d  a d and int  against H: regression coefficient <U+2260> 0. 2. H: a - a = 0  against H: a - a <U+2260> 0. Note that since the two models are equivalent  some of the tests are identical. Estimation of variance components for daily carcass weight gain did not converge due to little information in the data. The heritability was therefore set to 15%. The number of homozygous c.960delG ewes was low (Table )  and thus their progeny were omitted from the analysis. In the autumn  644 lambs (50.9% females) were recorded with weaning weight (Table ) and 508 were slaughtered. However  due to recruitment  only 41.2% of the slaughtered lambs were females. The mean age of the dams was 3.1 years  ranging from 1 to 7 years. The average number of lambs weaned was 2.3  ranging from 1 to 4. Eleven lambs were bottle fed. None of the animals homozygous for either mutation carried the other mutation  implying that no crossover had occurred between the two mutations. The lambs could therefore be divided into six genotype groups  depending on which combination of mutations and wild type allele they carried (Table ). Homozygous c.960delG-lambs were only produced the second year  since the rams used the first year did not carry this mutation. The group of homozygous individuals for c.960delG was significantly different from the reference groups  both the wild type (GG_GG) and GG_AA for three of the observed traits (Table ). The homozygous c.960delG animals had lower daily weaning weight gain (312 g per day)  lower weaning weight (44.6 kg)  but higher carcass weight (23.3 kg). Daily gain of slaughter weight was very similar for all groups  ranging from 134 to 143 g per day  with no significant differences. For carcass conformation and carcass fat  both mutations increased or decreased  respectively  scores in comparison to those of the reference  groups numerically (Table ). For both traits  all genotype groups differed significantly (P < 0.05) from the wild type group (GG_GG)  except GG_AG for carcass conformation. For both carcass conformation and carcass fat  the genotype G(delG)_GG was not significantly different from the genotype GG_AA  while the genotypes G(delG)_AG and (delG)(delG)_GG resulted in significant (P < 0.001) effects  towards more meaty and less fatty animals. The wild type group had a carcass conformation class and fat class of 7.4 and 6.0  respectively; homozygotes for the c.2360G>A mutation had 8.1 and 5.1 respectively; and homozygotes for the c.960delG mutation showed the largest effect with 12.5 and 3.0  respectively (for illustration; see Figure ). .

The effect of the ewe's -genotype on her lamb(s) was close to zero and non-significant for all traits (results not shown). The allelic effects are given in Table . The mutation in c.2360 showed a significant additive effect only on carcass conformation (0.3) and fat class (-0.4)  and no significant effect of dominance. The mutation in c.960 significantly affected all traits  except for daily carcass weight gain. For this mutation  there were also significant dominance effects for four of these traits. For carcass conformation class  a significant interaction between the mutations was estimated. The results show that both the c.2360G>A and c.960delG mutations affect conformation and fat class in NWS lambs  yielding a carcass with less fat and increased muscle mass (Table  and ). The effect of the c.960delG mutation is larger than that of the c.2360G>A mutation. This is in line with the results obtained by Boman et al. []  who suggest this is most likely due to the different functional impact of the two mutations. The effect of the c.2360G>A mutation  as compared to the wild type  is slightly more pronounced in this experiment  compared to the material reported by Boman et al. []. However  in the experiment reported here  we were able to study more than one flock environment  a larger number of lambs in all -groups  and the farmers only partially decided which lambs to slaughter. In addition  the statistical model also accounted for the proper number of lambs following the ewe at weaning  rather than the number of lambs born. There were no overlap between rams and years. It is possible that the genetic contribution from the rams and the flock-year effects may have been confounded  but this will not affect the relative size of effects of genotype classes. Also  lambs homozygous for the c.960delG mutation were only produced the second year. As the five other genotype classes were produced both years  this lack of complete cross classification should not be a problem. Since the c.2360G>A-mutation is already segregating in NWS at a medium frequency (Table )  we hypothesise that in the future this mutation will reach near-fixation in NWS  as in the Texel breed [  ]. Therefore we tested the other  groups against the group homozygous for c.2360G>A  in addition to testing against the wild type. In Norway  live weight is the most important criterion for deciding when to slaughter lambs. Thus  the higher carcass weight for the homozygous c.960delG mutation group may be explained by enlarged dressing percentage  indicated by the enhanced carcass conformation class for this group (Table ). The reduced weaning weight and weaning weight gain per day (Table ) also show that the group homozygous for c.960delG grows slowly. However  it is likely that a possibly enlarged dressing percentage  together with the fact that slaughter information was discarded for slow growing lambs in this group (Table )  explain why the carcass weight gain per day is closer to that of other groups than expected from live weight gain. The effects of the c.2360G>A mutation have also been examined in other studies. Before this mutation was reported  Laville et al. [] had investigated the effect of the corresponding QTL in Belgian Texel sheep. They reported a QTL effect that increased conformation scoring and carcass weight  and reduced the fat score. Kijas et al. [] had found that under Australian conditions  the g.+6723G>A mutation (equals the c.2360G>A mutation) had significant effects on slaughter measurements of muscling and fatness  but only minor impact on live weight and growth. These results correspond well with our findings. Similarly  Hadjipavlou et al. [] had studied the effect of the c.2360G>A mutation on Charollais lambs  and did not find any effect on live weight. With an animal model  AA animals were found to have significantly larger muscle depth than AG and GG animals  while AG and GG animals were not significantly different. None of the fat depths were significantly different. They concluded that the effect on phenotype depended on the genetic background  a point that is clearly demonstrated in our material for carcass conformation class  showing that animals heterozygous for the c.2360G>A mutation are strongly influenced by the genotype at the c.960 position. In NWS  increased muscle mass and reduced carcass fat are caused by the c.960delG and the c.2360G>A mutations. The impact of c.960delG is more important compared to c.2360G>A  and displays dominance effects. In the rough grazing environment of this experiment  lambs homozygous for the c.960delG mutation experienced reduced growth rate.

"Validation of models for analysis of ranks in horse breeding evaluation"	"Authors: Anne Ricard and Andrés Legarra"	"INRA  UMR 1313  78352  Jouy-en-Josas  FranceAnne Ricard INRA  UR 631  31326  Castanet-Tolosan  FranceAndrés Legarra"	"No Co-Author"	"28 January 2010"	"BackgroundRanks have been used as phenotypes in the genetic evaluation of horses for a long time through the use of earnings  normal score or raw ranks. A model  (\"underlying model\" of an unobservable underlying variable responsible for ranks) exists. Recently  a full Bayesian analysis using this model was developed. In addition  in reality  competitions are structured into categories according to the technical level of difficulty linked to the technical ability of horses (horses considered to be the \"best\" meet their peers). The aim of this article was to validate the underlying model through simulations and to propose a more appropriate model with a mixture distribution of horses in the case of a structured competition. The simulations involved 1000 horses with 10 to 50 performances per horse and 4 to 20 horses per event with unstructured and structured competitions.ResultsThe underlying model responsible for ranks performed well with unstructured competitions by drawing liabilities in the Gibbs sampler according to the following rule: the liability of each horse must be drawn in the interval formed by the liabilities of horses ranked before  after the particular horse. The estimated repeatability was the simulated one (0.25) and regression between estimated competing ability of horses and true ability was close to 1. Underestimations of repeatability (0.07 to 0.22) were obtained with other traditional criteria (normal score or raw ranks)  but in the case of a structured competition  repeatability was underestimated (0.18 to 0.22). Our results show that the effect of an event  or category of event  is irrelevant in such a situation because ranks are independent of such an effect. The proposed mixture model pools horses according to their participation in different categories of competition during the period observed.

A model  (\"underlying model\" of an unobservable underlying variable responsible for ranks) exists. Recently  a full Bayesian analysis using this model was developed. In addition  in reality  competitions are structured into categories according to the technical level of difficulty linked to the technical ability of horses (horses considered to be the \"best\" meet their peers). The aim of this article was to validate the underlying model through simulations and to propose a more appropriate model with a mixture distribution of horses in the case of a structured competition. The simulations involved 1000 horses with 10 to 50 performances per horse and 4 to 20 horses per event with unstructured and structured competitions. The underlying model responsible for ranks performed well with unstructured competitions by drawing liabilities in the Gibbs sampler according to the following rule: the liability of each horse must be drawn in the interval formed by the liabilities of horses ranked before  after the particular horse. The estimated repeatability was the simulated one (0.25) and regression between estimated competing ability of horses and true ability was close to 1. Underestimations of repeatability (0.07 to 0.22) were obtained with other traditional criteria (normal score or raw ranks)  but in the case of a structured competition  repeatability was underestimated (0.18 to 0.22). Our results show that the effect of an event  or category of event  is irrelevant in such a situation because ranks are independent of such an effect. The proposed mixture model pools horses according to their participation in different categories of competition during the period observed. This last model gave better results (repeatability 0.25)  in particular  it provided an improved estimation of average values of competing ability of the horses in the different categories of events. The underlying model was validated. A correct drawing of liabilities for the Gibbs sampler was provided. For a structured competition  the mixture model with a group effect assigned to horses gave the best results. Ranks in competitions have been used in genetic evaluation of sport and race horses for a long time. Langlois [] used transformed ranks to predict breeding values for jumping horses. Ranks were used through earnings; these are  roughly  a transcription of ranks into a continuous scale. Later  Tavernier [  ]  inspired by the model proposed by Henery [] for races  used a model including underlying liabilities (\" underlying model\" hereinafter). This model explains the ranks as the observable outcome of a hierarchy of underlying normal performances of horses in competition. These underlying performances serve to estimate breeding values for jumping horses. The parameters of this model were difficult to compute (numerical integration has to be used)  and thus simpler models were proposed with different transformations of ranks  like the squared root of ranks []  Snell score [] or normal scores []. These became the most frequent criteria used in Europe for sport horse breeding value prediction []. These secondary approaches are similar to the direct use of discrete numerals instead of underlying liabilities in the analysis of discrete variables []. Still  the model with underlying liabilities seems to be the most appropriate. In its original formulation  variance components [  ] were estimated by the joint mode of their marginal posterior distribution. This might be inappropriate with low numbers of data per level of effects  because numerical computations rely on some asymptotic approximations. Recently  Gianola and Simianier [] proposed a full Bayesian approach to estimate variance parameters for the underlying model for ranks (the so-called Thurstonian model)  where computations are achieved via MCMC Gibbs samplers. In Gianola and Simianer []  \"events\" were included as linear effects underlying the liability. However  it is easy to see that event effects  even if they are real (say  some tracks are more difficult than others) do not affect ranks  just because ranks are relative performances from one horse to another; this will be argued verbally and formally later. Thus  for rank analysis  event effects . However  it is well known that competitions are structured  and horses considered to be the \"best\" go to the \"best\" races and meet their peers who are supposed to be the \"best\". This causes a disturbance in predicting breeding values. The aim of this paper was to validate the performance for genetic evaluation of the Bayesian approach in finite samples  and in particular the Gibbs sampler  through simulations. The criteria that we have considered are those usually found in horse breeding evaluation: fit to a normal score  raw ranks  and the proposed underlying model for ranks. Further  a second aim was to suggest a better model for structured competitions organised into different technical levels  as they really exist and is explained above. Data from sport competitions or races are the ranks of the horses in each event. The model used to analyse these results includes an underlying variable responsible for ranks. Let be the vector of ranking in the race  (or jumping event) and  the vector of complete data  i.e. all ranks in all events  with  the total number of events. Suppose an underlying latent variable  responsible for ranks  which follows a classical animal model: where  is the horse   fixed effects   vector of random additive genetic effects   vector of random permanent environmental effects (common to the same horse for different events)   vector of random event effects   vector of residuals and     incidence vectors. Let us note: The conditional probability of a particular ranking in one race  is given by: where () is the subscript of horse ranked  in the race   the number of horses present in the event  and  the density of standard normal distribution. For complete data: Define T = [      ] a vector of location parameters and   a vector of variance parameters. The residual variance  was fixed to 1 to achieve identifiability  since liabilities were on an unobservable scale. The density of the joint prior distribution of T and <U+039B> has the form [] Above   (|  ) is the density of a scaled inverted chi-square distribution on degrees of freedom  with  interpretable as a prior guess for  and  = [            ] is a set of known hyper-parameters.  is the relationship matrix. The density of the joint posterior distribution is then The Bayesian analysis and the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling were performed according to Gianola and Simianer [] except for the drawing of liabilities. The parameter vector was augmented with the unobserved liabilities  the location parameters T were drawn from multivariate normal distributions  and conditional posterior distributions of the dispersion parameters were scale inverted chi-square. Flat priors were used for fixed effects and variance components. The suggested procedure to draw liabilities in Gianola and Simianer [] was the following: drawing of the liability  of the last horse ranked from  drawing of the liability  of the horse ranked just before the last one from a truncated normal distribution  etc. In fact  this algorithm is not a correct Gibbs sampler  and indeed did not converge in practice to correct rank statistics. The reason is that in step (1)  for a Gibbs sampler  the liability  above has to be conditioned on all other parameters of the model  including information from the other horses. At step (1) this information exists from a previous MCMC cycle and is condensed in the liability of the previous horse   so that . The correct procedure is thus the following: drawing the liability  of the last ranked horse in the interval] - 8   [  i.e. a lower liability than the liability of the horse ranked just before in the previous MCMC cycle  so in the truncated Normal distribution:  drawing the liability  of the horse ranked just before the last one in the interval given by liabilities of the last horse ranked and two before the last:  so in the truncated Normal distribution:  etc. The marginal density of each liability knowing all other parameters was therefore the probability to be between the liability of the horse ranked before and the liability of the horse ranked after the particular horse and not only the probability to be before the particular horse. These drawings must be performed several runs to converge to the joint distribution  i.e. a set of liabilities which corresponds to the overall ranking of the event. The use of a previous drawing from the preceding iteration accelerates the convergence. This procedure was validated by checking the distribution of performances obtained: their mean and variance must correspond to the mean and variance of order normal statistics when the underlying model involved the same for all horses. These moments are available in usual statistical libraries. The core of the program was the TM software developed by Legarra [] where drawing of liabilities according to ranks were added. Competition in jumping as well as in races is structured according to the technical level of the event  for example the height of the obstacles and their positions. A natural choice to take into account the differences between events is to include an event effect as in model (1). The event is conceived as having a true additive effect on the underlying scale. Whereas this might be true  this is irrelevant as far as only ranks are analyzed. Consider for example a race with effect 0 where times to arrival were 20  10 and 30 s. Rank is of course 2  1  3. Now assume that race had a true effect of 5  everything else being identical. Times were 25  15  35 and ranks were identical. Therefore  event has no effect on ranks  and there is no way of estimating an event effect from rank information. Thus  it might be fixed to zero to achieve identifiability with no loss of information. This will be demonstrated now. The probability of the ranks observed in an event given the parameters (eq. 2) can be rewritten as []: with = -    the covatiance matrix with = 2  = = -1 and = 0 for all other     and = - for  = 1  ...  -1. So that  for  = 1  ...  - 1: Since the event effect is the same for all horses in the same event  it disappears from : As a result  the probability of the ranks observed in an event given the parameters is independent of the event effect so that the joint posterior distribution only depends on the prior distribution of the event effect. The event effect is  as a consequence  not identifiable  whatever the distribution of other effects (especially genetic effects) in the event. This is the same for all fixed or random effects which have the same effect on all horses in the event  for example a category of event effect. The presence of genetic effects (as sires) cross classified with events do not change this fact. So  an equivalent model to (1) is the following: The reasoning that was followed in this work to include some effect linked to the competition effect is somewhat different from the event effect. Since competition is structured according to the technical level of the event  several categories of events are defined from the low level to the high level. Horses participate in the different categories roughly according to their expected competing abilities (genetic and environmental ones)  with  of course  incertitude. Thus  the relationship between the true ability of the horse and category is not complete. The idea is to attribute a group to those horses that follow more or less the same circuit  i.e. roughly the same number of events in each category. The group is linked to the horse rather than to the event and so  in the same event  horses from different groups may meet. This makes it possible to estimate the effect  even if horses of different groups meet less often than horses of the same group  by definition. Thus  horses belong with some probability to different groups. This can be applied to genetic effects as well as permanent environmental effects. Therefore  the sum of the genetic and permanent environmental effects of a horse has the following  mixture distribution: where is the number of groups with  expected values and probabilities of assignment to a group . Performances thus follow a mixture of normal variables of these different groups with the same variance but different means. So  the group effect has a genetic interpretation and depends on the horse  not on the event. Therefore  it is the same for the horse across all its competing events  which is not the case for the simple \"event\" effect. A full analysis would compute posterior probabilities for   by MCMC or Expectation-Maximization algorithms. For simplicity  in this paper  a horse was assigned  to a group without computing the   according to the frequency of the different categories performed by the horse during the period studied. Therefore  because horses in the same event may have participated in competitions of different levels of competition and so belong to different groups  the group effect may be identified in (2) and (3). In the following  this model will be referred to as the mixture model. The objective of this paper was to check if  by using the underlying model and computations as in []  ranks are suitable phenotypes to estimate the aptitude of the horse to compete: genetic and environmental abilities. For this work  and without loss of generality  the distinction between genetic and environmental effects is not necessary to verify the model  since all previous formulas have been derived with the complete model  showing no influence of distribution of genetic and environmental effects on the probability of ranking of an event. Further  the fact that horses have repeated performances provides the connections across events and categories and with other horses and  in that sense  the model with repeatability compares to a sire model with unrelated sires. So  for simplicity  we simulated the so-called \"competing ability\"   which can be seen as the sum of random additive genetic plus permanent environmental effects  = + . A horse population was simulated. The competing ability of the horse   was drawn from the normal distribution assuming: without any relationship between horses. Several performances were simulated for each horse. Residuals for each performance were drawn from a normal distribution with fixed residual variance of 1 ( = 1). The repeatability of performances was thus defined as the following: The ranking was obtained by the hierarchy of performances in each event. Two structures of competition were analysed: one where the distribution of horses among events was random and another one where  as it is in reality  different levels (3)  i.e. categories of competition  were simulated. In the first structure  horses were assigned to events at random. In the second structure  the higher the simulated ability of the horse  the higher the probability to participate in the highest level. This pretends to mimic what happens in reality  where horses with \"better\" expected ability compete together in \"better\" races. To simulate such a situation  an estimated value of the competing ability of the horse was simulated with a supposed accuracy of  from the simulated true competing ability. Then according to these values  the rules of probability of Table  were used to assign horses into events with 3 different categories. The simulated population included 1000 horses. Different numbers of horses per event and numbers of events per horse were simulated. For the unstructured competition  10 to 40 performances per horse with 4 to 20 horses per event were simulated  with an equal or variable number for all events. For the structured competition  10 to 50 events per horse were simulated with an equal number of horses per event (10). Each scenario was repeated 20 times except for the scenario with structured competition and 10 events per horse which was repeated 50 times. The first model used to estimate repeatability and competing ability of horses in simulations was the underlying model proposed in (1) in its equivalent form (4). The model was then: Estimates were obtained with the Gibbs sampler from the joint posterior distribution in (3). The Gibbs sampler consisted of 1 000 iterations (with 150 of burn-in) with sampling of location parameters (  ) and variance components (  ). Within each iteration  100 (only in the first iteration) or 10 iterations were run to draw liabilities. Autocorrelation between iterations were insignificant for lags greater than 13. Thus  samples were taken every 15 iterations. Convergence of chain was checked by the Geweke diagnostic []. In addition  three other models were used to analyse the simulated data. First  the simulated performances were analysed as a continuous trait; this provides an upper bound of the quality of the estimates because it is the best inference that could ever be done. Second  we included  for comparison with the underlying model  traditional measurements attributed to ranks in literature and used in genetic evaluation: raw ranks and normal scores. Normal scores are expected values of ordered multiple identical normal distributions. For these three pseudo-traits  a mixed linear model was used: with the normal score of horse  according to its rank and number of horses in the event or raw ranks (1 2  ...  ). In the structured competition  normal scores were used first in a single trait model whatever category of event  and second  with a multiple trait model  i.e.  one trait for each category of event. The estimates of repeatability were obtained with REML using SAS proc mixed [] for the analysis of true underlying performances  normal score and ranks and by Gibbs sampling using one chain with 50 000 iterations for the normal score with the multiple trait model. The last model was the mixture model proposed in the previous section. For the underlying mixture model the horse group was defined by the rounded mean value of grades affected to ordered categories of its competing events. For example: if there were 3 categories of competition with grades (1  2  3)  a horse performed 10 events  3 of grade 1  2 of grade 2 and 5 of grade 3. This horse was assigned to the second group of horses because the mean value of the grades was 2.2. The model  written in terms of competing abilities  now becomes: with  the new vector of \"competing ability\" of the horse  a normal distribution defined as the following: where  the vector of mean values of the 3 groups of horses  a design vector which allocated the group to the horse. So that the mean of the redefined \"competing abilities\" is: with the proportion of each groups in population. The variance is: Variance  includes extra variation due to equating a mixture by a linear expectation. The repeatability was defined as: All parameters were estimated with the same Gibbs sampler as the first underlying model and  was estimated as a fixed effect. As proposed in the method section  the algorithm used to draw performances knowing ranks was validated by comparing results with first and second moment of normal order statistics. The results are given in Table . For comparison  moments of normal scores were computed using sub-routines of NAG []. Table  summarizes the results of simulations with different numbers of horses per event and different numbers of events per horse. The repeatability estimated was compared to the one obtained directly on the underlying performance as data. These results showed that the model and the procedures used to estimate parameters performed well: the estimates of repeatabilities were close to those simulated and regressions of competing ability of the horses on estimates were close to 1  as expected. The same simulations were used to estimate competing ability of the horses using the other traditional criteria in horse breeding evaluation. All traditional criteria  (Table ) underestimated the repeatability  especially when a variable number of horses per event was simulated. According to the standard deviation between replicates  the differences between simulated and estimated repeatability were still significant with 20 horses per event. Thus  there is a great loss of information by using normal scores or raw ranks. The probability law used to construct the structured competition gave the proportions of horses in the different levels of competition reported in Table  (averages over 50 replicates). These proportions were similar to those obtained in jumping competition in France for example (if dividing the level of competition into 3 parts). Thus  these simulations mimicked real data well. In this case (Table )  with the underlying model for the ranks  repeatability was clearly underestimated (0.184 versus 0.250 simulated) due to underestimation of the differences between the average values of competing abilities of horses that participated in different categories of competitions (Table ). This is because the assumption of normality of competing abilities tends to shrink these differences towards 0. This bias decreases with more information  but even with a very large number of events (50) per horse  the estimates of repeatability are still biased (0.215). The other criteria also underestimated the repeatability even more than the underlying model for ranks and  on the contrary  with no decrease of bias for increasing number of events per horse. With the multiple trait model  as in the single trait model  the repeatability was always underestimated  and the differences of average values of horses in each level were still underestimated. So  this model is not well suited to a structured competition. Estimates with the mixture model are also shown in Tables    and . Even with a low number of events per horse (10)  repeatability was close to the value estimated from true underlying performances (0.253 versus 0.250). This better estimation was due to a better estimation of average values of competing ability of horses in each category of event (Table ) and thus  in each defined group of horses (Table ). This is shown in Figure   where solutions are plotted against true values (75 horses randomly selected from each group). The model with the underlying variable responsible for ranks gave a superposition of values in each group of horses whereas the mixture model gave a hierarchy between groups. . The results validate the underlying model responsible for ranks used to measure performances in competition [  ] as long as there is a correct estimation of parameters via the MCMC algorithm. The new algorithm proposed to draw underlying performances in agreement with ranking gave satisfactory results. Convergence may be accelerated by best sequences in the successive Gibbs sampler steps. However  our implementation was sufficient to give correct results for unstructured competition: correct repeatabilities and regression coefficients of 1 of true or estimated values for horses. All other criteria for estimating breeding values and variance components underestimated the repeatabilities  in particular when the number of horses per event was variable  because in that case  the supposed variance in each event is largely conditioned by the trait chosen (normal score or ranks). All these results were validated by the repeatability obtained from the true underlying performance  which is the best possible inference that could ever be done. With a structured competition  the underlying model with no mixture required a very large number of events per horse in order to have a large enough number of comparisons between horses of different levels to converge to the simulated repeatability  because these meetings are rare in structured competition  by definition. So  in practice  the mixture model developed is the best  also because it does not need a large number of events per horse. Low heritabilities of traits related to ranking in jumping can be found in the literature: from 0.05 to 0.11 for those used in official breeding evaluation []. These values come from various studies. In Germany  for the squared root of rank  Luhrs-Behnke et al. [] found 0.03. Higher estimates were obtained with the logarithm of earning in each event (with an event effect  so corresponding to a linear function of rank): 0.09 []. In Ireland and Belgium  normal scores were used as different criteria according to category of event and low heritabilities were also estimated: from 0.06 to 0.10 [  ]. A higher heritability was found by Tavernier []: 0.16 with an underlying model  but employing a sire model and an estimation based on the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of the variances. These results are in agreement with ours. Criteria related to ranks  used as raw data  underestimate the horse variance. The same will happen including a genetic effect and as a consequence the heritability of the underlying performance will be underestimated. This is similar to what happens in the threshold model  where the heritability in the observed scale is lower than that in the underlying scale and not invariant to transformation []. These results are an illustration of a scale problem and unsuitable models rather than a low heritability of jumping ability as often postulated [] The most recent proposition to deal with structured competition was the use of normal scores with multiple traits according to categories but it did not perform well in our simulations. With the appropriate model  i.e. the underlying mixture model  higher heritabilities should be found in real data analysis. The sport competition or race programs are always structured in different categories according to the level of technical difficulty. So  there have to be differences between the means of the true underlying performances obtained in these different categories  whatever the ranking. These differences between means of performances can not be estimated by an event effect when ranks are the only phenotype available. We have shown that this is because such an effect is not involved in the probability function of the ranking in one event conditional on the parameters in the model. One could expect that the comparisons between horses in lots of events would enable to correctly estimate the genetic as well as the environmental effect and then  that the averages of genetic and environmental effects in each event are correct. But in fact  even with 50 events  the repeatability was underestimated. Adding genetic effects through the use of the relationship matrix would have the same influence as increasing the number of events per horse: increasing the number of comparisons between horses. With a genetic effect  horses that do not compete in the same events may be compared through their relationship. However  the problem still exists: the best genetic values and the best sires will compete in the highest level of competition. So even if genetic links allow more comparisons  the problem of non-random allocation to categories of events remains. It will never be possible to ascertain that the number of comparisons will be sufficient to reach the correct values since this depends on the distribution of sires across categories of competition. The aim of this study was not to estimate the level of connectedness necessary to estimate correctly genetic values but to correctly implement the model to analyze the phenotype (ranks) recorded and used to estimate breeding values. Adding groups of horses in the mixture model seems to give the suitable response. By adding an estimable effect  linked to the categories of event but not confounded with it  representing a summary of possible comparisons between categories of event  the phenotype is correctly modeled. Then  whatever the other effects are in the model  supposing different levels are present in at least some events  they will be correctly estimated  like the genetic effect. In our simulations  the simplest method used to assign horses to categories was good enough to obtain good estimates of repeatability and moreover  good estimates of mean values of competing ability of horses in the different categories of events. A better model would fit a true mixture model by computing posterior estimates of assignment of animals to groups. In any way  this mixture model seems to be a good basis to improve the underlying model responsible for ranks to correctly account for the level of competition in the model. The full Bayesian analysis proposed by Gianola and Simianer of the Thurstonian model of Tavernier [  ]  i.e. the model of underlying unobservable liabilities responsible for ranks of an event  was validated. In addition  the algorithm in [] for drawing conditional liabilities from ranks was corrected. In an unstructured competition  repeatability of performances was correctly estimated with this model. All other usual phenotypes such as normal score and raw ranks underestimated repeatability. For the realistic case of a structured competition  however  the underlying model model was unable to estimate the correct repeatability unless there was a cross-classified design of horses and categories of events. This does not happen in practice. Rather than trying to estimate an event effect  which makes no sense since these cannot be estimated  we suggest to use a mixture model assuming that  the horse population is a mixture. This model performed well  and the repeatability and the average level of each category of event were correctly estimated. More work must be done in the modelling of the mixture distribution.

In practice  not all animals are genotyped  and the methods have to be adapted to this situation. In this paper we provide an extension of a linear mixed model method for genomic prediction to the situation with non-genotyped animals.

The extension of the method to non-genotyped animals presented in this paper makes it possible to integrate all the genomic  pedigree and phenotype information into a one-step procedure for genomic prediction. Such a one-step procedure results in more accurate estimated breeding values and has the potential to become the standard tool for genomic prediction of breeding values in future practical evaluations in pig and cattle breeding. Genomic selection [] has become the new paradigm in animal breeding programs using marker-assisted selection. It may increase the rate of genetic improvement  reduce the generation time  and provide higher accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBVs). Genomic prediction of breeding values can be based on a linear mixed model using matrix computations or a non-linear mixture type of model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) procedures. In this paper we provide a natural extension of a linear mixed model to the situation with non-genotyped animals. A marker-based relationship matrix has been used by a number of authors  in particular VanRaden in [] and []  but also Gianola and van Kamm [] in a dual formulation of their model. The types of genomic relationship matrices studied here are on the form as in VanRaden []  but other types of genomic relationship matrices are discussed in the discussion section. In VanRaden [] it is assumed that all animals are genotyped  which is unlikely to be a common scenario. In particular  in pig breeding it is probable that only boars or other selection candidates are genotyped  and in cattle breeding  traits being recorded for millions of animals it is very unlikely that all will be genotyped. We present an extension of matrix (1) in the situation where not all animals are genotyped. The approach presented here combines the relationship matrix (1) with a model for the markers. By marginalisation of the markers of non-genotyped animals a natural extension of (1) is obtained. The resulting extension of the genomic relationship matrix is the same as the one derived in Legarra et al. []  but the details in the derivation are somewhat different and the derivation therefore sheds more light on this result. To capture genetic variation not associated to the markers in a given SNP-panel  the model can also contain a polygenic genetic effect with the usual pedigree derived additive relationship matrix  as considered by [  ] among others. The extension of the genomic relationship matrix to non-genotyped animals together with the addition of the polygenic effect provide a natural one-step procedure to blend the information from relatives and the genomic information into a combined genomically enhanced breeding value (GEBV). Genomic prediction with both a polygenic effect and with incomplete genotyping has been considered by a number of authors. Using a joint model for phenotypes and markers and using Bayesian inference  a general solution to sample missing markers in each McMC iteration has been suggested [  ]. However  with a large number of SNP markers and many animals without genotypes such a solution seems computationally unfeasible in practice. In Gianola et al. [] bivariate models are suggested  where the two traits are the traits of the genotyped and non-genotyped animals  respectively  and the genetic effect for a genotyped animal is the sum of a polygenic effect and a genomic effect whereas the genetic effect for a non-genotyped animal is just a polygenic effect (correlated with the polygenic effect of the genotyped animals). Since the model does not contain a genomic genetic effect for the non-genotyped animals  the phenotypic information from non-genotyped animals closely related to a given genotyped animal does not propagate properly into the estimate of the genomic genetic effect for this animal. Alternatively  the approach by Baruch and Weller [] involves several steps  where first  expected genotypes are computed for non-genotyped animals  then marker effects are estimated (using expected genotypes for non-genotyped animals)  phenotypes are adjusted by known or expected marker effects  and finally polygenic EBVs are computed from adjusted phenotypes. Although somewhat similar in idea to the approach taken here  the approach in [] does not propagate any uncertainty from one step in the procedure to the next step  and the effects are not estimated simultaneously. We assume that markers are summarised into a gene content matrix   (= -1  when the SNP  of individual  is 11  = 0 for 12  and = 1 for 22)  and we use capital letters to denote when the markers are random variables. For the genomic relationship matrix (1)  the matrix  is the expectation of   i.e. the entries in column  are = 2(- 1/2) with being the allele frequency of the second allele at loci   and  is a diagonal matrix chosen such that E[()] =   the usual pedigree derived additive relationship matrix. In VanRaden [] three different genomic relationship matrices are presented  where the first two are on the form in (1)  and here  we focus on the first one with  = <U+2211>2(1 - ). The model is as follows where  is phenotype   and  are incidence matrices   denotes fixed effects   is error   is the polygenic genetic effect  and  is the genomic genetic effect. Here  is the usual pedigree derived additive relationship matrix  and *() is the extension of (2) to be derived in the following section. In the following sections  first  we derive the extension of the marker based relationship matrix  *()  and second  we study the variance-covariance matrix of the combined genetic effect  + . Then procedures for parameter estimation using AI-REML  and breeding value estimation are presented. Finally  a simulation data set is described. Gengler et al. [] suggested that missing genotypes could be modelled using the usual mixed model methodology with relationship matrix . We now combine that idea with the genomic relationship matrix on the form (1). For simplicity  the derivation is made for the form (2)  but it is straight-forward to generalise to (1) also. The model for the genomic genetic effect is as follows where  is the gene content matrix. We assume that E[] = 1  Var() =   with  the usual relationship matrix  = 2(1 - )  and  = <U+2211>. The covariances of   and for two different loci  <U+2260>  are on the form Cov(  ) =  where the s are unspecified since they are cancelling in the derivations that follow. We split  into two sub-matrices containing the animals with observed genotypes and those without  respectively  and in the following we distinguish between small letter  (observed realisation of random variables ) and capital letter (unobserved markers are random variables). In Appendix A  the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix of the conditional distribution [|] (with marginalised out) are shown to be Where When all animals have been genotyped  *() = ()  and when no animals have been genotyped  *() =   which makes the extension in (4) rather elegant. We assume that the distribution of [|] is multivariate normal  which for the non-genotyped animals is not strictly true  but an approximation. The inverse of the genomic relationship matrix may be obtained from the inverse of   Using some algebra  the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix becomes Considering the terms in (6)  because of the low dimension of () and  a direct inversion of these matrices should be possible for practical computations  and  is a sparse matrix which can be computed directly without constructing  itself and using standard techniques. To compute  there might be cases where most of the  matrix has to be computed  potentially causing a memory storage problem. Alternatively   = (()) may be computed using the formula (5) on  and using sparse matrix computation. The formula (6) requires that () is invertible which may not actually be the case. In the next section this problem is automatically solved by combining the genomic genetic effect  with the polygenic effect . We also note that the determinant equals where  -  is easily obtained from   and the determinant can be computed using sparse matrix computation. The combined genetic effect is the sum of the genomic genetic effect and the polygenic effect   = g + a  and using this notation the model (3) may now be written as where . Introducing the notation  and   then with  = (1 - )*() + . Substituting (4) and rearranging the terms  we obtain where The parameter  is interpreted as the relative weight on the polygenic effect  and it may be estimated from data as shown in the next section or be chosen to equal a small value. Similar to the previous section the inverse equals and here is necessarily invertible when  > 0 (even when () is singular). Here we consider parameter estimation using average information (AI)-REML based on the mixed model equations [  ] where . We will not enter into details  but just note that the sparse structure of the left hand side matrix in (9) is the cornerstone for the fast computation of the AI-matrix used in the numerical maximisation of the REML likelihood. Considering the terms in this matrix  then  is a sparse matrix  and from (4) we see that  has some sparse structure  although  is a dense matrix. Depending on the proportion of animals genotyped it may in some cases not be necessarily advantageous to compute the AI-matrix using (9)  but instead an AI-REML algorithm based on the inverse phenotypic variance-covariance matrix    could be used  see []. Here  we assume that the majority of animals are not genotyped and use the sparse structure of *() for AI-REML based on the mixed model equations. The AI-REML method based on the mixed model equations is implemented in software DMU [] and requires input in the form of the vector of phenotypes  the nonzero entries of  and the log-determinant log(det()) = log(det()) + log(det( - )). For a given  the software provides estimates of  and   values of the REML log-likelihood at the maximum and (when required) BLUE solution  and BLUP solution . Here  the parameter  is estimated by using a grid of values  i.e.  = 0.01  0.03  ...  0.19  and computing the REML log-likelihood for each value. The resulting profile likelihood curve  log   has a peak at the estimate   and a measure of the associated uncertainty is the interval {|log  > log  - 3.84} where 3.84 is the 95% quantile of a (1)-distribution. Here we consider estimation (prediction) of breeding values. For animals included in the parameter estimation (animals with phenotypes  and some additional animals whose markers provide information about the unknown markers for non-genotyped animals with phenotypes)  the GEBVs are the solution vector  to (9) with the parameter values being the estimated ones from the previous section. The software DMU provides these GEBVs and their precision. For animals not included in the parameter estimation  then denoting this subset of animals by index 3 the GEBVs  are obtained by solving where   and  now contain all animals. Again software DMU provides these GEBVs and their precision. For a scenario with a large number of genotyped animals whose marker information does not provide information for the parameter estimation  Appendix B presents a method for breeding value estimation where only part of the  needs to be computed. The simulated data set is inspired by a pig nucleus breeding program  but is formulated in a simplified form. We assume  10 chromosomes each 160 cM long  and a panel of  = 5000 equidistant SNP markers is used. It is assumed that 500 QTLs affect the phenotype  and the size of these effects is simulated from a Gamma(5.4  0.42)-distribution. First  a base population consisting of 150 boars and 1500 sows is generated by assuming random mating for 50 generations in a population with an effective population size of 100. Then the following mating and selection scheme is followed for five generations. In each generation  150 boars are mated with 1500 sows to produce 15000 offspring (half of them males). For the next generation  the 150 boars with the highest value of their own phenotype are selected  and 1500 sows are selected randomly. It is assumed that family records are available for all five generations  phenotypes of all boars available for all five generations (35000 records)  and the selected boars in the last three generations are genotyped (450 animals). In addition  to estimate the allele frequencies required for the method  the 150 boars in the base population are genotyped (and the allele frequencies used are the estimated frequencies from these 150 boars). For prediction  it is assumed that 300 selection candidates (without phenotypes) for generation 6 are genotyped. To evaluate the method advocated in this paper (one-step)  two other methods are investigated. The first method (ped) computes traditional EBVs using the pedigree based relationship matrix (without using markers). The second method (two-step) is a two-step procedure similar to methods used in practical genomic selection [  ] and is based on genotyped animals only using the model where is the vector of traditional EBVs  and  with = 0.99() + 0.01. For the one-step method  the genotypes of the selection candidates provide information about the genotypes of their (non-genotyped) mothers and hence information about other non-genotyped animals further back in the pedigree. Therefore they also provide some information about the genotypes of the boars without offspring  and since these boars have phenotypes but not genotypes then the selection candidates should be included in the parameter estimation. However  to investigate how important it is to include these animals  a second analysis (one-step-2) is also performed where they are not included. Finally  to investigate the importance of obtaining the allele frequencies in the base population  the scenario where the boars in the base population have not been genotyped is also studied. The use of three different allele frequencies are compared: 1) true allele frequencies (obtained from the 150 boars in the base population)  2) estimated allele frequencies for boars used in generation 3  3) allele frequencies estimated using the approach by Gengler et al. []. For the one-step method  the profile likelihood curve for  is shown in Figure . It is seen that the data do not support a large polygenic effect  with the estimate being about zero and the 5% confidence interval being about [0; 0.06]. For computational reasons  we decided to use  = 0.01.  . The dotted line corresponds to a the 95% quantile for a (1) distribution  and provides a 5% confidence interval of [0; 0.06] for . The parameter estimates and the correlation between GEBVs and true breeding values (BVs) are shown in Table . For comparison  the prediction using the pedigree based relationship matrix (ped method) and the genomic prediction using (10) based on genotyped animals (two-step) are also shown. We observe that the two methods using a marker-based relationship matrix perform better than the method using the pedigree based relationship matrix  but as expected the one-step method performs the best. Column four in Table  shows the result obtained when ignoring the genotypes of the 300 selection candidates in the parameter estimation (one-step-2). Even though the parameter estimates are somewhat different betweeen one-step and one-step-2  only a minor difference in the correlation between GEBVs and the true breeding values is seen. Hence  for this data set this specific computational short-cut performs well. Finally  the results from the analyses where the boars in the base population are not genotyped show that the choice of allele frequencies is very important for parameter estimation. When using the true allele frequencies   ˜ 0 is obtained  whereas when using allele frequencies estimated from the observed genotypes   = 1 is obtained for both methods estimating the allele frequencies. Since  = 1 corresponds to the usual animal model  no further results from this comparison are shown here. We conclude that for this data set the parameter estimation is sensitive to the allele frequencies used in the one-step method. For genomic prediction an extension of a linear mixed model to non-genotyped animals has been derived here. The extension of the method makes it possible to integrate in an optimal way the genomic  pedigree and phenotype information into a one-step procedure for breeding value estimation. Due to the simplicity of the method  the fact that it extends the traditional breeding value estimation method in a natural way  and the possibilities of handling large populations  such a one-step procedure has the potential to become the standard tool for genomic prediction of breeding values in practical pig or cattle evaluations in the future. The practical implementation of the approach uses an existing software DMU  and therefore the approach can be easily extended to other types of models implemented by that software  in particular multivariate analysis and generalised linear mixed models. For such a one-step procedure to become the standard tool for computing GEBVs in practical pig or cattle evaluations  some technical issues of the method need further development. First  computing times necessary for the construction and the inversion of () are proportional to  and   respectively. These computations seem to be the computational bottle-necks for the method  and for a very large number of genotyped animals the method may not be feasible. Further research on efficient computation of () seems necessary. Second  some computational short-cuts in the method could be imagined  as illustrated in our results by the good performance of the one-step method even when the marker information from selection candidates is ignored in the parameter estimation. Investigations by extensive simulation studies may reveal the benefits of other potential short-cuts. Third  the allele frequencies in the base population are considered known  or at least easily accessible. As illustrated in the results  the parameter estimation seems to be sensitive to the choice of these allele frequencies in a scenario with selection and where the base population itself has not been genotyped. To investigate whether the problems may be related to the strong selection on phenotype for the simulation data set  this analysis was repeated for a simulation with boars selected randomly. Here more sensible parameter estimates were obtained in the sense that  ˜ 0 when allele frequencies were estimated from observed genotypes. For practical dairy cattle evaluations  Misztal et al. [] investigated the use of a number of different allele frequencies and obtained the best results by using = 1/2 for all  but replacing  = 2<U+2211>(1 - ) = /2 with a another scaling  which in practice was larger than /2. Of course  whether that result is due to selection in this real data set is not known. Further research on the effect of selection and on how to handle appropriately the issue with allele frequencies is needed. An assumption behind the genomic relationship matrix (2) is that all regions of the genome are equally important for the trait of interest. It is possible to instead use ()  ( - )( - )where  is a diagonal matrix with known weights =  with s being estimated SNP effects (estimated using for example a non-linear mixture type of model as in []). However  incorporating uncertainty on such estimated SNP effects into the method seems less straight-forward. Considering other types of marker based relationship matrices  then with correlation parameter   corresponds to the method in [] in it's dual formulation as a linear mixed model. For this choice of marker-based relationship matrix  the derivation of *() = Var [|] is also possible  but as shown in Appendix C the form of the result differs from (4) in a number of ways. The implication is that using (4) and (6) with a marker based relationship matrix defined by (11) is possible  but lacks theoretical justification. Here the mean and variances of the conditional distribution [ | ] (with marginalised out) are derived using formulas for conditional expectations  variances and covariances. The mean vector and the variance-covariance matrix where and with and subdivision corresponding to (  ). Using that <U+2211>=   we obtain Var [ | ] = *() where In the calculations above it is assumed that the conditional mean  and the conditional variance-covariance   and this is correct since when Var() =   . In the main text we assume where *() is defined in (4). However  this is not strictly correct for a non-genotyped animal  where |  ~ (0  ) with  here being a random variable with distribution [<U+2211>(- )|]. This conditional distribution will never lead to a marginal normal distribution for (the only exception is when  is a constant). The normal distribution of |is therefore only an approximation. In some scenarios the number of genotyped animals not included in the parameter estimation may be large  for example if phenotypes are expensive to obtain and therefore only observed on a small subset of the population. To reduce the computational burden of creating the whole () for all animals  a procedure is presented where only a part of this matrix needs to be computed. For genotyped animals used in the parameter estimation  let  be the corresponding sub-vector of . Estimated breeding values of other genotyped animals not included in the parameter estimation (denoting this subset of animals by index 3) are obtained by Where   and  and  = () are sub-matrices of the full (containing all animals) genomic and polygenic relationship matrix  respectively. The matrices with index 32 are similarly defined. Since  does not influence directly  Considering the polygenic effect  then the assumption that does not influence is equivalent to  -  = 0. Using this relation we obtain Hence  and therefore by using (8) and (5) the following form is obtained This shows that the GEBVs of such genotyped animals only depend on . It also shows that only a part of the full genomic relationship matrix for genotyped animals is necessary to compute  since = (1 - )() +  does not enter into (12). In some cases the matrix  may be prohibitive to compute directly due to a large number of animals. In such a case    where  is computed directly and  may be obtained as the solution to the sparse system of equations where () is sparse and is computed directly  and  and  are dummy variables. Here follows the derivation of the extension of the marker-based relationship matrix to non-genotyped animals. The extension of the genomic relationship matrix is As written in the discussion  the form of this matrix differs from (4) in a number of ways. First  all diagonal elements *()= 1  and hence *() does not simplify to the  matrix when no animals are genotyped. Second  the resulting matrix depends on the off-diagonal elements of   since for non-genotyped animals  and  the derivation requires that  ...  are statistically independent (implying that  is a diagonal matrix). Third  the conditional expectation  depends on the distributional assumptions of the model for   not just first and second moments. Fourth  assuming a multivariate normal distribution of   then with  and  where these expectations and variances can be computed from the conditional expectations and variances given in Appendix A. The form exp(-/(1 + ))/ with the variance  occurring in two places  implies that that the elements in *() cannot be expressed in matrix form as in (4) but are on a more complicated form.

The aim of this paper is to illustrate how these models can be applied in animal breeding to achieve parameterizations of different levels of complexity and  more specifically  to model phenotypic recursion between three calving traits: gestation length (GL)  calving difficulty (CD) and stillbirth (SB). All recursive models considered here postulate heterogeneous recursive relationships between GL and liabilities to CD and SB  and between liability to CD and liability to SB  depending on categories of GL phenotype. Four models were compared in terms of goodness of fit and predictive ability: 1) standard mixed model (SMM)  a model with unstructured (co)variance matrices; 2) recursive mixed model 1 (RMM1)  assuming that residual correlations are due to the recursive relationships between phenotypes; 3) RMM2  assuming that correlations between residuals and contemporary groups are due to recursive relationships between phenotypes; and 4) RMM3  postulating that the correlations between genetic effects  contemporary groups and residuals are due to recursive relationships between phenotypes. For all the RMM considered  the estimates of the structural coefficients were similar. Results revealed a nonlinear relationship between GL and the liabilities both to CD and to SB  and a linear relationship between the liabilities to CD and SB. Differences in terms of goodness of fit and predictive ability of the models considered were negligible  suggesting that RMM3 is plausible. The applications examined in this study suggest the plausibility of a nonlinear recursive effect from GL onto CD and SB. Also  the fact that the most restrictive model RMM3  which assumes that the only cause of correlation is phenotypic recursion  performs as well as the others indicates that the phenotypic recursion may be an important cause of the observed patterns of genetic and environmental correlations. Structural equation models () are well established and widely used in the social sciences. In quantitative genetics  these models were first suggested by Sewall Wright [] but were ignored for many years. Recently  Gianola and Sorensen [] suggested a model in which recursive and simultaneous relationships between phenotypes are considered in the context of a multiple-trait Gaussian model. This stimulated application of SEM in animal breeding and genetics (e.g.  de los Campos et al. [  ]  Varona et al. []  López de Maturana et al. []  Wu et al. []). SEM can be used  for example  to explore potential relationships between variables of interest or to evaluate the plausibility of different hypotheses []. In addition  SEM facilitate comparisons between alternative nested path analysis models []. López de Maturana et al. [] applied SEM to study relationships between three calving traits (gestation length ()  calving difficulty () and stillbirth ()). SEM were found useful for detecting heterogeneous correlations between residual  contemporary group  or genetic effects affecting GL and liabilities to CD and SB. However  a comparison between their model and nested models with different restrictions on relationships between variables has not been addressed yet. The present work complements the study of López de Maturana et al. [] by comparing  in terms of goodness of fit and predictive ability  a sequence of SEM with different restrictions on the (co)variance matrices among model parameters. The data consisted of a sample of primiparous US Holstein cows calving from 2000 to 2005 that were recorded as part of the National Association of Animal Breeders (Columbia  Mo) Calving Ease Program. After editing  the data set contained GL  CD and SB records from 90 393 cows  sired by 1 122 bulls  mated to 567 service sires  and distributed over 935 herd-calving year combinations  as described in López de Maturana et al. []. The general specification of the model is given in López de Maturana et al. []. The model allows for recursive effects that change according to categories of GL (261-267 d  268-273 d  274-279 d  and 280-291 d). The observable phenotypes were ; for CD and SB threshold links were used; and the measurement models for these traits were  where ()  and () denote liabilities and thresholds for CD (SB)  respectively. For identification purposes  the first thresholds for CD () and SB () were set to 0 and the second threshold for CD () was set to 1. A multivariate normal model was assumed for . The reduced-form equation for  was: In the above   denotes the category of GL; = b+++ is the contribution to the linear predictor of systematic effects  including sex of calf (2 levels)  age at first calving (4 levels)  and year-season (12 levels);    and  represent the contributions of herd-year (935 levels)  sire (567 levels with progeny)  and maternal grandsire effects (1 122 levels with progeny)  respectively; and is a 3 × 3 matrix defining recursive effects of the following form: where    and describe rates of change of the liabilities to CD and SB with respect to GL  and of the liability to SB with respect to the liability to CD  respectively. As noted before  recursive coefficients were allowed to vary across categories of GL   = {1  if  = 267 d; 2  if 267 d < = 273 d; 3  if 273 d < = 279 d; 4  otherwise}  to account for non-linearity of the relationship between GL and the two calving traits. Model residuals    were assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID) across animals  that is    where  is a 3 × 3 residual (co)variance matrix  with its last diagonal entry (i.e.  the residual variance of the liability to SB) restricted to 1 for identification purposes. The prior distribution was factorized as follows: where  = (                t);  and  are (co)variance matrices of genetic  herd and residual effects  respectively; is a vector containing the non-null recursive effects; and  is the vector with the thresholds. The reduced model (2) implies that the (co)variance matrices due to genetic  permanent environmental effects and model residuals are  With        and   where  for example   is the between-sire variance for GL   is the (co)variance between sire effects of GL and CD   and  are the herd-year and residual variances for GL  and  and  are the herd-year and residual covariances between GL and CD  respectively. Additive direct and maternal genetic (co)variances were calculated according to Willham []: Where        are the variances of additive direct genetic effects  additive maternal genetic effects  sire  and maternal grandsire effects  respectively; and are the covariances between additive direct and maternal genetic effects and between sire and maternal grandsire effects  respectively. The genetic (co)variances were computed following []: Without imposing further restrictions  the model described in (2) considering the recursive relationship is under-identified. Identification can be attained by imposing restrictions on dispersion  location parameters or on the matrix of recursive effects. For computational convenience and due to the difficulty to assure identification through the location parameters  only restrictions on dispersion or recursive parameters were considered. A sequence of models was obtained by changing the prior specifications for (<U+03BB>)  ()  ()  and () This model assumes that the correlation between residuals in the reduced models    is solely a consequence of the phenotypic recursion.  is assumed to be diagonal  i.e.  ()is the product of two independent scaled inverted Chi-square distributions (for GL and CD  because  was set to 1 to ensure identification)  and () and () are assumed to be distributed a priori as inverted Wishart distributions. The number of unknowns in the dispersion parameters and the matrix of recursive effects is 41: 6 in    and   9 in   2 in   and 3 in each . This model results from adding to RMM1 the restriction that  is also diagonal. This restriction implies that the correlations between residuals and between contemporary groups in the reduced model are exclusively due to recursive relationships. Thus  the number of parameters entering in [] in RMM2 (38) is smaller than those entering in [] in model RMM1 (number of parameters equal to 41). RMM2 is obtained by assigning an inverted Wishart distribution to  and independent scaled-inverted Chi-square distributions to the unknown diagonal elements of  and . Note that  as in RMM1   is set to 1 to ensure identification. This model assumes that the only cause of correlations between any of the random effects in the reduced model is the phenotypic recursion. That is         and  are diagonal  and the priors for the unknown diagonal components are independent scaled-inverted Chi-square distributions. The number of unknowns in dispersion parameters and in the matrix of recursive effects is now 26. This model is defined by setting and  =   and by treating     and  as unstructured (co)variance matrices. As prior distributions  inverted Wishart distributions are assumed to  and  and a conditional inverted Wishart distribution to  ((|| = 1)) (see [] for details). The sum of unknowns in the (co)variance matrices is 32 (6 in   5 in  and 21 in ); there are no recursive parameters in this model. With the a priori assumptions described above  the fully conditional distributions of all unknowns in all models have closed forms  and draws from the posterior distribution can be obtained via Gibbs sampling. The SirBayes software [] was used to implement the models. The length of the chain and the burn-in period were assessed by visual examination of trace plots of posterior samples of selected parameters; additional diagnostic checks were employed. After a preliminary analysis  it was decided to run 5 independent chains  each consisting of 10 000 iterations. In each chain  the first 1 000 iterations were discarded as burn-in  and one of every 10 successive samples was retained. Thus  4 500 samples were used to infer the posterior distributions of unknown parameters. Features of the marginal posterior distributions of interest  the convergence analysis  and estimates of Monte Carlo error  were obtained using the BOA software . The performance of the SMM and the three RMM considered was investigated in terms of both goodness of fit and predictive ability  under the consideration that a model that fits current data very well may fail to provide accurate predictions of future (independent) observations []. The mean squared error of a calving trait phenotype    and Pearson's correlation between fitted and observed data    were evaluated at the posterior means of the unknowns ()  to assess goodness of fit. Predictive ability was assessed with MSE and Pearson's correlation  using a 3-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure. The full data set was randomly partitioned into three disjoint subsets  each with approximately one-third of the records. The CV procedure used two of the three subsets for model fitting and prediction (i.e.  the training set)  and predictive ability was evaluated in the remaining subset (i.e.  the testing set). MSE and Pearson's correlation were computed as before  but in this case by concatenating results from the three cross-validation sets. The predicted or fitted values for CD and SB were computed as: where the probability that observation  falls in category  was calculated as: Above  (·) is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal variate;  is the assumed (or estimated) value of the appropriate threshold for CD and SB  and  is the posterior mean of the liability to CD or SB for individual . Small Monte Carlo errors (~10-10) were obtained for all the parameters that were estimated in each model; this suggests that convergence was achieved  and that a sufficient number of Gibbs samples was used. Posterior means (standard deviations) of structural coefficients obtained from the analyses of the recursive models (RMM1  RMM2 and RMM3) are shown in Table . Similar estimates were found in the three models. For gestations within 261-267 d  an extra day of gestation did not increase CD. Calving problems did increase for the remaining groups of GL  because the rates of changes were positive  and the HPD (Highest Posterior Density at 95% of probability) region did not include 0. Different rates of change of the liability to SB for different categories of GL were found as a consequence of direct () and indirect recursive effects (× ): the liability to SB was expected to decrease in the two first categories (261-273 d)  not to change in the third category (274-279 d) and to increase in the fourth category (280-291 d). Positive estimates (similar across categories of GL) were found for the effect of the liability to CD on the liability to SB  indicating that cows that are more likely to suffer calving difficulty are more likely to have stillborn calves. More details regarding the recursive relationships between GL  CD and SB can be found in López de Maturana et al. []. Additional file   Table S1 shows the posterior means (standard deviations) of direct and maternal heritabilities of GL and liabilities to CD and SB for each model. Posterior distributions of direct and maternal heritabilities for the three calving traits were similar across categories of GL and between models (RMM1  RMM2 and RMM3) and were also similar to their counterparts from the SMM. The posterior mean of direct heritability of GL was higher than that for maternal heritability (0.39 vs. 0.08-0.07); corresponding estimates for CD (0.08-0.10 vs. 0.07-0.08) and SB (0.05-0.08 vs. 0.08-0.11) were smaller than those for direct heritability and similar between them. Heritability estimates were within the range of values reported in previous studies [–]; estimates for CD and SB were higher than those used in routine genetic evaluations of CD and SB in US Holsteins  except for the direct heritability of CD [  ]. Features of the posterior distributions of genetic correlations in the four categories of GL from the SMM and RMM models are shown in Additional file   Tables S2  S3  S4 and S5. In general  estimates of genetic correlations obtained from the SMM were within the ranges of values obtained for each category of GL from the RMM analyses. All of the recursive models evaluated in this study detected a heterogeneous correlation between direct and maternal effects of GL and between direct and maternal liabilities to CD and SB  as expected. Similar estimates were found in the analyses of RMM1 and RMM2. Regarding the correlation between direct effects of GL and CD  positive posterior means were obtained from both SMM and RMM by category of GL. For all categories of GL  RMM3 gave lower estimates than the other models  due to restrictions placed on . Similarly  positive estimates (although slightly lower) were found between maternal effects of GL and CD. Slightly stronger correlations between direct effects of GL and SB were found using RMM3  compared with those using RMM1 or RMM2  for all categories of GL. Relatively high  positive  and similar estimates were obtained for the genetic correlation between direct effects for CD and SB in each of the four categories of GL  with lower estimates from RMM3. A similar pattern  although with slightly lower estimates  was found for the genetic correlation between the maternal effects of CD and SB. Similar posterior means of the genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects for the same trait were found in SMM and RMM  and across categories of GL: moderately negative for GL and SB  and close to 0 for CD. The 90% highest posterior density intervals for genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects for different traits obtained with RMM included 0 or had an almost null posterior mean  and were similar to their counterparts from the SMM. This suggests that effects of genes controlling direct effects for one calving trait are not associated with those controlling maternal effects for another calving trait  and vice versa. The estimates of previously genetic correlations were within the range of values reported in the literature [–]. Additional file   Table S6 shows the posterior means of correlations between contemporary groups and between residuals. Almost null estimates of the correlation between contemporary groups of GL and CD were found in SMM and RMM for all categories of GL. Regarding GL and SB  small positive estimates were obtained from the analyses of SMM and RMM1. Results from RMM1 suggest that the correlation changes across categories of GL. Estimates from the other recursive models (RMM2 and RMM3) also suggested that the correlation changes across categories of GL  including a modification of sign: slightly negative in the first two categories of GL (-0.10 and -0.05  respectively)  nil in the third  and slightly positive in the fourth (0.06). Posterior means of the correlation between herd-year effects of CD and SB were nil in the analyses of models SMM and RMM1; however  those from models RMM2 and RMM3 were moderate and positive (0.54). Differences in sign and magnitude between estimates were a consequence of the different assumptions regarding the covariances between herd-year effects in SMM and RMM1  those in RMM2 and RMM3. The RMM detected heterogeneous correlations between residuals of GL and both CD and SB that were solely due to the recursive relationship between GL and liabilities to CD and SB residuals. Estimates from SMM were in the interval of values from RMM. Similarly  positive and moderate correlations between residuals of CD and SB were found in all RMM models (0.38-0.40)  whereas the estimate from SMM was much lower (0.09). Among the variety of model comparison methods  MSE and Pearson's correlation between observed and estimated/predicted phenotypes were chosen based on their ease of interpretation and weaker dependence on priors' choice. Mean squared error is a measurement related to the bias-variance trade-off of a model  either for fitting or predictive ability  whereas Pearson's correlation indicates the accuracy of estimations/predictions. The use of these criteria provides information on the model performance for each analyzed trait  but they lack an overall measure of the multivariate model performance. Bayes Factor or DIC could be alternative model selection criteria to provide such information. However  due to their disadvantages  which will be briefly described below  we have discarded them in favor of MSE and Pearson's correlation. Bayes Factor is based on marginal likelihood  and therefore provides a measure of model goodness of fit. This criterion indicates whether the data increased or decreased the odds of model  relative to model  []. However  it depends on prior input  and this dependence does not decrease as sample size increases  unlike parameter's estimation based on posterior distributions []. In addition  BF does not indicate which hypothesis is the most probable  but it shows which hypothesis would make the sample more probable  if the hypothesis is true and not otherwise. Regarding DIC  it makes a compromise between goodness of fit and model complexity  and in some contexts  it can agree with measures of predictive ability. However  this is not always the case. Additionally  DIC is based on an approximation that may not be appropriate in the class of non-linear models considered here. Figure  displays scatter plots of the expected GL () and the posterior mean of expected liabilities to CD and SB ( and ) obtained with SMM against those obtained with RMM. As expected  similar posterior means of  were obtained from SMM and RMM (Pearson's correlation near 1)  because the model for GL is not affected by the structure imposed in recursive models. The correlation between the posterior means of liability to CD from the SMM and each of the RMM were also close to 1  with very slight differences between them. However  a weaker association was found between the posterior means of liabilities to SB estimated with SMM and each of the RMM (Pearson's correlations around 0.69-0.70). Plots and Pearson's correlations between the posterior means of expected gestation length () and of expected liabilities to calving difficulty () and stillbirth () obtained with standard mixed models SMM versus those obtained with recursive mixed models (RMM) Figure  shows the plots of the posterior mean of the expected GL and liabilities to CD and SB obtained with one of the RMM against those of the remaining recursive models. Again  the posterior means of the estimated phenotype of GL and the liabilities to CD obtained from the different RMM were similar  with correlations of = 0.99. Estimated liabilities from RMM2 and RMM3 were also similar  with a correlation of 0.99. Correlations between estimates from RMM1 and RMM2 and estimates from RMM1 and RMM3 were slightly lower (0.98). Plots and Pearson's correlations between the posterior means of expected gestation length () and of expected liabilities to calving difficulty () and stillbirth () obtained with the recursive mixed models (RMM) Table  shows the average MSE and Pearson's correlation between fitted and observed phenotypes of GL  CD and SB  by model. The goodness of fit measures did not change across models  with differences at the third decimal place. The differences observed between the posterior mean liabilities to SB from SMM and those from RMM (see Figure ) did not occur when the goodness of fit of these models was evaluated in terms of MSE and Pearson's correlation between predicted and observed SB score. Table  presents the average MSE and Pearson's correlation between predicted and observed phenotypes of GL  CD and SB  by model. Both RMM and SMM had similar predictive abilities of GL and CD. Regarding SB  the model with best predictive ability was RMM1  with a 2.2% higher Pearson's correlation than other RMM. The differences in predictive ability among RMM were very small. The negligible differences in terms of goodness of fit and predictive ability between models might be explained by the small differences in estimated genetic correlations between SMM (off diagonals of    and ) and RMM (off diagonals of ). The larger differences observed in correlations between contemporary groups for GL and liability to SB and between liabilities to CD and SB  as well as their counterparts between residual effects from SMM and RMM  were not reflected in goodness of fit and predictive ability. Thus  a very restrictive model (RMM3  with 26 parameters) provided similar fit and predictive ability as less parsimonious models. This paper illustrates how SEM can be used to achieve parameterizations with different levels of complexity that represent different genetic models. For example  recursive relationships can be used to generate models in which the genetic parameters are themselves subject to genetic variation. The applications examined in this study suggest the plausibility of a recursive effect from GL onto CD and SB. Also  as reported in previous studies  this relationship is not linear. The fact that the most restrictive model (RMM3)  which assumes that the only cause of correlation is phenotypic recursion  performs as well as the others indicates that the recursion may be an important cause of the observed genetic and environmental correlations.
