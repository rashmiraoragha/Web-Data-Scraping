"Genetic diversity  introgression and relationships among West/Central African cattle breeds"	"Authors: Eveline Mengwi Ibeagha-Awemu  Oliver Carl Jann  Christina Weimann and Georg Erhardt"	"Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics  Justus-Liebig University  Giessen  Ludwigstrasse 21b  35390  Giessen  GermanyEveline Mengwi Ibeagha-Awemu  Oliver Carl Jann  Christina Weimann & Georg Erhardt"	"No Co-Author"	"15 November 2004"	"Genetic diversity  introgression and relationships were studied in 521 individuals from 9 African  and 3  cattle breeds in Cameroon and Nigeria using genotype information on 28 markers (16 microsatellite  7 milk protein and 5 blood protein markers). The genotypes of 13 of the 16 microsatellite markers studied on three European (German Angus  German Simmental and German Yellow) and two Indian (Nelore and Ongole) breeds were used to assess the relationships between them and the African breeds. Diversity levels at microsatellite loci were higher in the zebu than in the taurine breeds and were generally similar for protein loci in the breeds in each group. Microsatellite allelic distribution displayed groups of alleles specific to the Indian zebu  African taurine and European taurine. The level of the Indian zebu genetic admixture proportions in the African zebus was higher than the African taurine and European taurine admixture proportions  and ranged from 58.1% to 74.0%. The African taurine breed  Muturu was free of Indian zebu genes while its counter Namchi was highly introgressed (30.2%). Phylogenic reconstruction and principal component analysis indicate close relationships among the zebu breeds in Cameroon and Nigeria and a large genetic divergence between the main cattle groups – African taurine  European taurine and Indian zebu  and a central position for the African zebus. The study presents the first comprehensive information on the hybrid composition of the individual cattle breeds of Cameroon and Nigeria and the genetic relationships existing among them and other breeds outside of Africa.

The PROSPER method was developed to overcome possible factors that may contribute to this low success  using (1) a variable base population and high number of breeders ( > 100)  (2) selection within groups with low non-genetic effects and (3) repeated growth challenges. Using calculations  we show that individual selection within groups  with appropriate management of maternal effects  can be superior to mass selection as soon as the maternal effect ratio exceeds 0.15  when heritability is 0.25. Practically  brown trout were selected on length at the age of one year with the PROSPER method. The genetic gain was evaluated against an unselected control line. After four generations  the mean response per generation in length at one year was 6.2% of the control mean  while the mean correlated response in weight was 21.5% of the control mean per generation. At the 4th generation  selected fish also appeared to be leaner than control fish when compared at the same size  and the response on weight was maximal (˜130% of the control mean) between 386 and 470 days post fertilisation.

Linkage can also be tested by assessing whether the marginal genotypic distribution conforms to its expectation  a  test. We developed a class of joint tests that  by constraining intercepts in regression-based analyses  capitalize on the information available in both  and  tests. We simulated data corresponding to the null hypothesis of no QTL effect and the alternative of some QTL effect at the locus for a backcross and an F2 intercross between inbred strains. Regression-based and marginal-based tests were compared to corresponding joint tests. We studied the effects of random sampling  selective sampling from a single tail of the phenotypic distribution  and selective sampling from both tails of the phenotypic distribution. Joint tests were nearly as powerful as all competing alternatives for random sampling and two-tailed selection under both backcross and F2 intercross situations.

Linkage can also be tested by assessing whether the marginal genotypic distribution conforms to its expectation  a  test. We developed a class of joint tests that  by constraining intercepts in regression-based analyses  capitalize on the information available in both  and  tests. We simulated data corresponding to the null hypothesis of no QTL effect and the alternative of some QTL effect at the locus for a backcross and an F2 intercross between inbred strains. Regression-based and marginal-based tests were compared to corresponding joint tests. We studied the effects of random sampling  selective sampling from a single tail of the phenotypic distribution  and selective sampling from both tails of the phenotypic distribution. Joint tests were nearly as powerful as all competing alternatives for random sampling and two-tailed selection under both backcross and F2 intercross situations. Joint tests were generally more powerful for one-tailed selection under both backcross and F2 intercross situations.

The data consisted of 204 397  655 989 and 40 242 lactation records of milk flow in Brown Swiss  Simmental and Holstein cattle  respectively (4 to 22 years). Separate genetic analyses of first and multiple lactations were carried out for each breed. The results show that genetic parameters especially polygenic variance and heritability of milk flow in the first lactation were very similar under both mixed inheritance (polygenes + major gene) and polygenic models. Segregation analyses yielded very low major gene variances which favour the polygenic determinism of milk flow. Heritabilities and repeatabilities of milk flow in both Brown Swiss and Simmental were high (0.44 to 0.48 and 0.54 to 0.59  respectively). The heritability of milk flow based on scores of milking ability in Holstein was intermediate (0.25). Variance components and heritabilities in the first lactation were slightly larger than those estimates for multiple lactations. The results suggest that milk flow (the quantity of milk per minute of milking) is a relevant measurement to characterise the cows milking ability which is a good candidate trait to be evaluated for a possible inclusion in the selection objectives in dairy cattle."

"A genetic and spatial Bayesian analysis of mastitis resistance"	"Authors: Solve Sæbø and Arnoldo Frigessi"	"IKBM  Agricultural University of Norway  PO Box 5003  1432  Ås  NorwaySolve Sæbø Section of Medical Statistics  University of Oslo  and Norwegian Computing Center  Oslo  NorwayArnoldo Frigessi"	"No Co-Author"	"15 September 2004"	"A nationwide health card recording system for dairy cattle was introduced in Norway in 1975 (the Norwegian Cattle Health Services). The data base holds information on mastitis occurrences on an individual cow basis. A reduction in mastitis frequency across the population is desired  and for this purpose risk factors are investigated. In this paper a Bayesian proportional hazards model is used for modelling the time to first veterinary treatment of clinical mastitis  including both genetic and environmental covariates. Sire effects were modelled as shared random components  and veterinary district was included as an environmental effect with prior spatial smoothing. A non-informative smoothing prior was assumed for the baseline hazard  and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) were used for inference. We propose a new measure of quality for sires  in terms of their posterior probability of being among the  say 10% best sires.

The data base holds information on mastitis occurrences on an individual cow basis. A reduction in mastitis frequency across the population is desired  and for this purpose risk factors are investigated. In this paper a Bayesian proportional hazards model is used for modelling the time to first veterinary treatment of clinical mastitis  including both genetic and environmental covariates. Sire effects were modelled as shared random components  and veterinary district was included as an environmental effect with prior spatial smoothing. A non-informative smoothing prior was assumed for the baseline hazard  and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) were used for inference. We propose a new measure of quality for sires  in terms of their posterior probability of being among the  say 10% best sires. The probability is an easily interpretable measure that can be directly used to rank sires. Estimating these complex probabilities is straightforward in an MCMC setting. The results indicate considerable differences between sires with regards to their daughters disease resistance.

Because of the statistical problems in analytically deriving the standard errors and the distributional form of the estimates and because the use of resampling techniques is not feasible for several linked QTL  there is the need to perform large-scale simulation studies in order to evaluate the accuracy of multiple interval mapping for linked QTL and to assess confidence intervals based on the standard statistical theory. From our simulation study it can be concluded that in comparison with a monogenetic background a reliable and accurate estimation of QTL positions and QTL effects of multiple QTL in a linkage group requires much more information from the data. The reduction of the marker interval size from 10 cM to 5 cM led to a higher power in QTL detection and to a remarkable improvement of the QTL position as well as the QTL effect estimates. This is different from the findings for (single) interval mapping. The empirical standard deviations of the genetic effect estimates were generally large and they were the largest for the epistatic effects. These of the dominance effects were larger than those of the additive effects. The asymptotic standard deviation of the position estimates was not a good criterion for the accuracy of the position estimates and confidence intervals based on the standard statistical theory had a clearly smaller empirical coverage probability as compared to the nominal probability. Furthermore the asymptotic standard deviation of the additive  dominance and epistatic effects did not reflect the empirical standard deviations of the estimates very well  when the relative QTL variance was smaller/equal to 0.5. The implications of the above findings are discussed."

The asymptotic standard deviation of the position estimates was not a good criterion for the accuracy of the position estimates and confidence intervals based on the standard statistical theory had a clearly smaller empirical coverage probability as compared to the nominal probability. Furthermore the asymptotic standard deviation of the additive  dominance and epistatic effects did not reflect the empirical standard deviations of the estimates very well  when the relative QTL variance was smaller/equal to 0.5. The implications of the above findings are discussed. Correspondence to                 .  Mayer  M.  Liu  Y. & Freyer  G.

"Should genetic groups be fitted in BLUP evaluation? Practical answer for the French AI beef sire evaluation"	"Authors: Florence Phocas and Denis LaloN"	"Station de génétique quantitative et appliquée  Institut national de la recherche agronomique  78352  Jouy-en-Josas Cedex  FranceFlorence Phocas & Denis LaloN"	"No Co-Author"	"15 May 2004"	"Some analytical and simulated criteria were used to determine whether  genetic differences among groups  which are not accounted for by the relationship matrix  ought to be fitted in models for genetic evaluation  depending on the data structure and the accuracy of the evaluation. These criteria were the mean square error of some extreme contrasts between animals  the true genetic superiority of animals selected across groups   the selection response  and the magnitude of selection bias (difference between true and predicted selection responses). The different statistical models studied considered either fixed or random genetic groups (based on six different years of birth)  ignoring the genetic group effects in a sire model. Including fixed genetic groups led to an overestimation of selection response under BLUP selection across groups despite the unbiasedness of the estimation   despite the correct estimation of differences between genetic groups. This overestimation was extremely important in numerical applications which considered two kinds of within-station progeny test designs for French purebred beef cattle AI sire evaluation across years: the reference sire design and the repeater sire design. When assuming  genetic differences due to the existence of a genetic trend of around 20% of genetic standard deviation for a trait with h = 0.4  in a repeater sire design  the overestimation of the genetic superiority of bulls selected across groups varied from about 10% for an across-year selection rate p = 1/6 and an accurate selection index (100 progeny records per sire) to 75% for p = 1/2 and a less accurate selection index (20 progeny records per sire). This overestimation decreased when the genetic trend  the heritability of the trait  the accuracy of the evaluation or the connectedness of the design increased.

A short-term divergent selection process was designed to estimate the genetic parameters of these two traits. Two flocks  including 100 Romanov ram lambs each  were challenged in 1990 when they were 6 months old. One flock received three artificial infections with 20 000 third-stage  larvae  at intervals of 7 weeks. Faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed on Days 22  25 and 28 post infection (p.i.) and the animals were drenched on Day 28 p.i. The other flock was grazed for 5 months on a pasture contaminated with the same species. Faecal samples were taken from the lambs at similar ages. About 5 rams with the lowest FEC and 5 with the highest FEC were selected in each flock and mated with unselected ewes. Their offspring (200 animals) were challenged in 1992  half in the same way as their sires  and the other half by the other method. Because of a drought in the summer of 1990  it was necessary to repeat part of the experiment  and in 1992 the 5 and 8 rams with the lowest and highest FEC  respectively  were selected from the offspring challenged on the pasture in 1992 and were mated with unselected ewes. Their progeny (about 80 animals) were challenged in 1994  half by natural infection  half by artificial infection. The mean FEC of the flock increased from the first to the third artificial infection. The natural infection was highly variable in different years  reflecting the difficulty of assessing resistance using this mode of challenge. Genetic parameters were estimated using animal models and REML solutions. The repeatabilities of the FEC following artificial and natural infection were 0.49 and 0.70 respectively within a period of one week  and 0.22 and 0.41 respectively for periods separated by intervals of 7 weeks; the heritabilities of the single egg count were 0.22 and 0.38 respectively. The genetic correlation was 0.87: the FEC recorded under natural or artificial infection appear to depend on the same genetic potential."

Most publications (45 out of 55 reviewed) reported QTL for the major milk production traits (milk  fat and protein yield  and fat and protein concentration (%)) and somatic cell score. Relatively few QTL studies have been reported for more complex traits such as mastitis  fertility and health. The collated QTL map shows some chromosomal regions with a high density of QTL  as well as a substantial number of QTL at single chromosomal locations. To extract the most information from these published records  a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain consensus on QTL location and allelic substitution effect of these QTL. This required modification and development of statistical methodologies.

Most publications (45 out of 55 reviewed) reported QTL for the major milk production traits (milk  fat and protein yield  and fat and protein concentration (%)) and somatic cell score. Relatively few QTL studies have been reported for more complex traits such as mastitis  fertility and health. The collated QTL map shows some chromosomal regions with a high density of QTL  as well as a substantial number of QTL at single chromosomal locations. To extract the most information from these published records  a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain consensus on QTL location and allelic substitution effect of these QTL. This required modification and development of statistical methodologies. The meta-analysis indicated a number of consensus regions  the most striking being two distinct regions affecting milk yield on chromosome 6 at 49 cM and 87 cM explaining 4.2 and 3.6 percent of the genetic variance of milk yield  respectively.

"The efficiency of designs for fine-mapping of quantitative trait loci using combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage"	"Authors: Sang Hong Lee and Julius HJ van der Werf"	"School of Rural Science and Agriculture  University of New England  Armidale  NSW  2351  AustraliaSang Hong Lee & Julius HJ van der Werf"	"No Co-Author"	"15 March 2004"	"In a simulation study  different designs were compared for efficiency of fine-mapping of QTL. The variance component method for fine-mapping of QTL was used to estimate QTL position and variance components. The design of many families with small size gave a higher mapping resolution than a design with few families of large size. However  the difference is small in half sib designs. The proportion of replicates with the QTL positioned within 3 cM of the true position is 0.71 in the best design  and 0.68 in the worst design applied to 128 animals with a phenotypic record and a QTL explaining 25% of the phenotypic variance. The design of two half sib families each of size 64 was further investigated for a hypothetical population with effective size of 1000 simulated for 6000 generations with a marker density of 0.25 cM and with marker mutation rate 4 × 10 per generation. In mapping using bi-allelic markers  42~55% of replicated simulations could position QTL within 0.75 cM of the true position whereas this was higher for multi allelic markers (48~76%). The accuracy was lowest (48%) when mutation age was 100 generations and increased to 68% and 76% for mutation ages of 200 and 500 generations  respectively  after which it was about 70% for mutation ages of 1000 generations and older. When effective size was linearly decreasing in the last 50 generations  the accuracy was decreased (56 to 70%). We show that half sib designs that have often been used for linkage mapping can have sufficient information for fine-mapping of QTL. It is suggested that the same design with the same animals for linkage mapping should be used for fine-mapping so gene mapping can be cost effective in livestock populations."

In pigs  genetic variability at the cytochrome B gene and the D-loop region has been used as a tool to dissect the genetic relationships between different breeds and populations. In this work  we analysed four SNP at the cytochrome B gene to infer the Asian (A1 and A2 haplotypes) or European (E1 and E2 haplotypes) origins of several European standard and local pig breeds. We found a mixture of Asian and European haplotypes in the Canarian Black pig (E1  A1 and A2)  German Piétrain (E1  A1 and A2)  Belgian Piétrain (E1  A1)  Large White (E1 and A1) and Landrace (E1 and A1) breeds. In contrast  the Iberian (Guadyerbas  Ervideira  Caldeira  Campanario  Puebla and Torbiscal strains) and the Majorcan Black pig breeds only displayed the E1 haplotype. Our results show that the introgression of Chinese pig breeds affected most of the major European standard breeds  which harbour Asian haplotypes at diverse frequencies (15–56%). In contrast  isolated local Spanish breeds  such as the Iberian and Majorcan Black pig  only display European cytochrome B haplotypes  a feature that evidences that they were not crossed with other Chinese or European commercial populations.

In pigs  genetic variability at the cytochrome B gene and the D-loop region has been used as a tool to dissect the genetic relationships between different breeds and populations. In this work  we analysed four SNP at the cytochrome B gene to infer the Asian (A1 and A2 haplotypes) or European (E1 and E2 haplotypes) origins of several European standard and local pig breeds. We found a mixture of Asian and European haplotypes in the Canarian Black pig (E1  A1 and A2)  German Piétrain (E1  A1 and A2)  Belgian Piétrain (E1  A1)  Large White (E1 and A1) and Landrace (E1 and A1) breeds. In contrast  the Iberian (Guadyerbas  Ervideira  Caldeira  Campanario  Puebla and Torbiscal strains) and the Majorcan Black pig breeds only displayed the E1 haplotype. Our results show that the introgression of Chinese pig breeds affected most of the major European standard breeds  which harbour Asian haplotypes at diverse frequencies (15–56%). In contrast  isolated local Spanish breeds  such as the Iberian and Majorcan Black pig  only display European cytochrome B haplotypes  a feature that evidences that they were not crossed with other Chinese or European commercial populations.

For large pedigrees with many missing markers  however  it is not feasible to calculate the exact gametic variance covariance matrix required to construct HMME. The objective of this study was to investigate the consequences of using approximate gametic variance covariance matrices on response to selection by MABLUP. Two methods were used to generate approximate variance covariance matrices. The first method (Method A) completely discards the marker information for individuals with an unknown linkage phase between two flanking markers. The second method (Method B) makes use of the marker information at only the most polymorphic marker locus for individuals with an unknown linkage phase. Data sets were simulated with and without missing marker data for flanking markers with 2  4  6  8 or 12 alleles. Several missing marker data patterns were considered. The genetic variability explained by marked quantitative trait loci (MQTL) was modeled with one or two MQTL of equal effect. Response to selection by MABLUP using Method A or Method B were compared with that obtained by MABLUP using the exact genetic variance covariance matrix  which was estimated using 15 000 samples from the conditional distribution of genotypic values given the observed marker data. For the simulated conditions  the superiority of MABLUP over BLUP based only on pedigree relationships and trait data varied between 0.1% and 13.5% for Method A  between 1.7% and 23.8% for Method B  and between 7.6% and 28.9% for the exact method. The relative performance of the methods under investigation was not affected by the number of MQTL in the model."

For large pedigrees with many missing markers  however  it is not feasible to calculate the exact gametic variance covariance matrix required to construct HMME. The objective of this study was to investigate the consequences of using approximate gametic variance covariance matrices on response to selection by MABLUP. Two methods were used to generate approximate variance covariance matrices. The first method (Method A) completely discards the marker information for individuals with an unknown linkage phase between two flanking markers. The second method (Method B) makes use of the marker information at only the most polymorphic marker locus for individuals with an unknown linkage phase. Data sets were simulated with and without missing marker data for flanking markers with 2  4  6  8 or 12 alleles. Several missing marker data patterns were considered. The genetic variability explained by marked quantitative trait loci (MQTL) was modeled with one or two MQTL of equal effect. Response to selection by MABLUP using Method A or Method B were compared with that obtained by MABLUP using the exact genetic variance covariance matrix  which was estimated using 15 000 samples from the conditional distribution of genotypic values given the observed marker data. For the simulated conditions  the superiority of MABLUP over BLUP based only on pedigree relationships and trait data varied between 0.1% and 13.5% for Method A  between 1.7% and 23.8% for Method B  and between 7.6% and 28.9% for the exact method. The relative performance of the methods under investigation was not affected by the number of MQTL in the model. Correspondence to                 .  Totir  L.R.  Fernando  R.L.  Dekkers  J.C.
