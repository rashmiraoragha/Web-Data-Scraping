The scores on a scale from 0 to 10 were given for conformation and basic quality of gaits  resulting in 14 SBI traits which were used for the correlation analyses. The radiographic findings considered included osseous fragments in fetlock (OFF) and hock joints (OFH)  deforming arthropathy in hock joints (DAH) and distinct radiographic findings in the navicular bones (DNB) which were analyzed as binary traits  and radiographic appearance of the navicular bones (RNB) which was analyzed as a quasi-linear trait. Genetic parameters were estimated multivariately in linear animal models with REML using information on 24 448 horses with SBI and/or RR records. The ranges of heritability estimates were h = 0.14–0.34 for the RR traits and h = 0.09–0.50 for the SBI traits. Negative additive genetic correlations of r = -0.19 to -0.56 were estimated between OFF and conformation of front and hind limbs and walk at hand  and between DNB and hind limb conformation. There were indications of negative additive genetic correlations between DAH and all SBI traits  but because of low prevalence and low heritability of DAH  these results require further scrutiny. Positive additive genetic correlations of r = 0.37–0.52 were estimated between OFF and withers height and between OFH and withers height  indicating that selection for taller horses will increase disposition to develop OFF and OFH. Selection of broodmares with regards to functional conformation will assist  but cannot replace possible selection against radiographic findings in the limbs of young Warmblood riding horses  particularly with regards to OFF."

"Comparison of methods for analysis of selective genotyping survival data"	"Authors: Joseph P McElroy  Wuyan Zhang  Kenneth J Koehler  Susan J Lamont and Jack CM Dekkers"	"Department of Animal Science and Center for Integrated Animal Genomics  Iowa State University  Ames  USAJoseph P McElroy  Susan J Lamont & Jack CM Dekkers Department of Statistics  Iowa State University  Ames  USAWuyan Zhang & Kenneth J Koehler"	"No Co-Author"	"28 November 2006"	"Survival traits and selective genotyping datasets are typically not normally distributed  thus common models used to identify QTL may not be statistically appropriate for their analysis. The objective of the present study was to compare models for identification of QTL associated with survival traits  in particular when combined with selective genotyping. Data were simulated to model the survival distribution of a population of chickens challenged with Marek disease virus. Cox proportional hazards (CPH)  linear regression (LR)  and Weibull models were compared for their appropriateness to analyze the data  ability to identify associations of marker alleles with survival  and estimation of effects when all individuals were genotyped (full genotyping) and when selective genotyping was used. Little difference in power was found between the CPH and the LR model for low censoring cases for both full and selective genotyping. The simulated data were not transformed to follow a Weibull distribution and  as a result  the Weibull model generally resulted in less power than the other two models and overestimated effects. Effect estimates from LR and CPH were unbiased when all individuals were genotyped  but overestimated when selective genotyping was used. Thus  LR is preferred for analyzing survival data when the amount of censoring is low because of ease of implementation and interpretation. Including phenotypic data of non-genotyped individuals in selective genotyping analysis increased power  but resulted in LR having an inflated false positive rate  and therefore the CPH model is preferred for this scenario  although transformation of the data may also make the Weibull model appropriate for this case.

In this paper we derive and implement a bivariate quantitative genetic model for a threshold character and a survival trait that are genetically and environmentally correlated. For the survival trait  we considered the Weibull log-normal animal frailty model. A Bayesian approach using Gibbs sampling was adopted in which model parameters were augmented with unobserved liabilities associated with the threshold trait. The fully conditional posterior distributions associated with parameters of the threshold trait reduced to well known distributions. For the survival trait the two baseline Weibull parameters were updated jointly by a Metropolis-Hastings step. The remaining model parameters with non-normalized fully conditional distributions were updated univariately using adaptive rejection sampling. The Gibbs sampler was tested in a simulation study and illustrated in a joint analysis of calving difficulty and longevity of dairy cattle. The simulation study showed that the estimated marginal posterior distributions covered well and placed high density to the true values used in the simulation of data. The data analysis of calving difficulty and longevity showed that genetic variation exists for both traits. The additive genetic correlation was moderately favorable with marginal posterior mean equal to 0.37 and 95% central posterior credibility interval ranging between 0.11 and 0.61. Therefore  this study suggests that selection for improving one of the two traits will be beneficial for the other trait as well."

In this study  the effect on genetic variability of selection for increasing the  allele frequency was estimated in the Latxa breed. Two sources of information were used  pedigree and genetic polymorphisms (fifteen microsatellites). The results based on the genealogical information were conditioned by a low pedigree completeness level that revealed the interest of also using the information provided by the molecular markers. The overall results suggest that no great negative effect on genetic variability can be expected in the short time in the population analysed by selection of only  males. The estimated average relationship of  males with reproductive females was similar to that of all available males whatever its genotype: 0.010  0.012 for a genealogical relationship and 0.257  0.296 for molecular coancestry  respectively. However  selection of only  males implied important losses in founder animals (87 percent) and low frequency alleles (30 percent) in the ram population. The evaluation of mild selection strategies against scrapie susceptibility based on the use of some  heterozygous males was difficult because the genetic relationships estimated among animals differed when pedigree or molecular information was used  and the use of more molecular markers should be evaluated."

The results presented here for the first time in mice may suggest a genetic basis for variability of the evaluated traits  thus opening the possibility to be implemented in selection schemes.

In order to estimate these effects  which are particularly important for sire lines  it is necessary to fit an animal model. However this can be computationally very demanding. We show how direct and maternal genetic effects can be estimated with a simpler analysis based on the reduced animal model and we illustrate the method using farrowing survival information on 118 193 piglets in 10 314 litters. We achieve a 30% reduction in computing time and a 70% reduction in memory use  with no important loss of accuracy. This use of the reduced animal model is not only of interest for pig breeding but also for poultry and fish breeding where large full-sib families are performance tested."

In order to estimate these effects  which are particularly important for sire lines  it is necessary to fit an animal model. However this can be computationally very demanding. We show how direct and maternal genetic effects can be estimated with a simpler analysis based on the reduced animal model and we illustrate the method using farrowing survival information on 118 193 piglets in 10 314 litters. We achieve a 30% reduction in computing time and a 70% reduction in memory use  with no important loss of accuracy. This use of the reduced animal model is not only of interest for pig breeding but also for poultry and fish breeding where large full-sib families are performance tested.

A new design  established from the same pure lines  produced 407 F2 progenies (males and females) from 4 F1-sire families. Body weight and abdominal fat were measured on the F at 9 wk of age. In each sire family  selective genotyping was carried out for 48 extreme individuals for abdominal fat using seven microsatellite markers from GGA5. QTL analyses confirmed the presence of QTL for fatness on GGA5 and identified a QTL by sex interaction. By crossing one F1 sire heterozygous at the QTL with lean line dams  three recombinant backcross 1 (BC1) males were produced and their QTL genotypes were assessed in backcross 2 (BC2) progenies.

A new design  established from the same pure lines  produced 407 F2 progenies (males and females) from 4 F1-sire families. Body weight and abdominal fat were measured on the F at 9 wk of age. In each sire family  selective genotyping was carried out for 48 extreme individuals for abdominal fat using seven microsatellite markers from GGA5. QTL analyses confirmed the presence of QTL for fatness on GGA5 and identified a QTL by sex interaction. By crossing one F1 sire heterozygous at the QTL with lean line dams  three recombinant backcross 1 (BC1) males were produced and their QTL genotypes were assessed in backcross 2 (BC2) progenies. These results confirmed the QTL by sex interaction identified in the F2 generation and they allow mapping of the female QTL to less than 8 Mb at the distal part of the GGA5.

The need to conserve genetic diversity is widely accepted but involves in general two questions: (i) is the expected loss of diversity in a set of breeds within a defined future time horizon large enough to establish a conservation plan  and if so (ii) which breeds should be prioritised for such a conservation plan? The present study uses a marker assisted methodology to address these questions. The methodology combines core set diversity measures with a stochastic method for the estimation of expected future diversity and breed marginal diversities. The latter is defined as the change in the total diversity of all breeds caused by a one unit decrease in extinction probability of a particular breed. The stochastic method was validated by means of simulations. A large field data set consisting of 44 North Eurasian cattle breeds was analysed using simplified determined extinction probabilities.

The need to conserve genetic diversity is widely accepted but involves in general two questions: (i) is the expected loss of diversity in a set of breeds within a defined future time horizon large enough to establish a conservation plan  and if so (ii) which breeds should be prioritised for such a conservation plan? The present study uses a marker assisted methodology to address these questions. The methodology combines core set diversity measures with a stochastic method for the estimation of expected future diversity and breed marginal diversities. The latter is defined as the change in the total diversity of all breeds caused by a one unit decrease in extinction probability of a particular breed. The stochastic method was validated by means of simulations. A large field data set consisting of 44 North Eurasian cattle breeds was analysed using simplified determined extinction probabilities. The results show that the expected loss of diversity in this set within the next 20 to 50 years is between 1 and 3% of the actual diversity  provided that the extinction probabilities which were used are approximately valid. If this loss is to be reduced  it is sufficient to include those three to five breeds with the highest marginal diversity in a conservation scheme. Correspondence to                 .  Bennewitz  J.

A number of scenarios were simulated with different power to identify QTL by varying family size  heritability  QTL effect and map density  and three threshold levels for cofactor were considered. Generally cofactor analysis did not increase the power of QTL mapping in a half-sib design  but increased the type I error rate. The exception was with small family size where the number of correctly identified QTL increased by 13% when heritability was high and 21% when heritability was low.

With a liberal threshold level of 10% for cofactor combined with a low heritability  the number of correctly identified QTL increased by 14% but there was a 41% increase in the number of false positives. Also  the power of QTL mapping did not increase with cofactor analysis in scenarios with unequal QTL effect  sparse marker density and large QTL effect (25% of the genetic variance)  but the type I error rate tended to increase.   cofactor analysis was expected to have higher power than individual chromosome analysis especially in experiments with lower power to detect QTL.

The advantage of quadratic indices was not highly sensitive to the rate of inbreeding for the constraints considered. Correspondence to                 .  Villanueva  B.

"An efficient variance component approach implementing an average information REML suitable for combined LD and linkage mapping with a general complex pedigree"	"Authors: Sang Hong Lee and Julius H.J. van der Werf"	"School of Rural Science and Agriculture  UNE  Armidale  NSW  2351  AustraliaSang Hong Lee & Julius H.J. van der Werf"	"No Co-Author"	"15 January 2006"	"Variance component (VC) approaches based on restricted maximum likelihood (REML) have been used as an attractive method for positioning of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) information can be easily implemented in the covariance structure among QTL effects ( genotype relationship matrix) and mapping resolution appears to be high. Because of the use of LD information  the covariance structure becomes much richer and denser compared to the use of linkage information alone. This makes an average information (AI) REML algorithm based on mixed model equations and sparse matrix techniques less useful. In addition  (near-) singularity problems often occur with high marker densities  which is common in fine-mapping  causing numerical problems in AIREML based on mixed model equations. The present study investigates the direct use of the variance covariance matrix of all observations in AIREML for LD mapping with a general complex pedigree. The method presented is more efficient than the usual approach based on mixed model equations and robust to numerical problems caused by near-singularity due to closely linked markers. It is also feasible to fit multiple QTL simultaneously in the proposed method whereas this would drastically increase computing time when using mixed model equation-based methods."

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) information can be easily implemented in the covariance structure among QTL effects ( genotype relationship matrix) and mapping resolution appears to be high. Because of the use of LD information  the covariance structure becomes much richer and denser compared to the use of linkage information alone. This makes an average information (AI) REML algorithm based on mixed model equations and sparse matrix techniques less useful. In addition  (near-) singularity problems often occur with high marker densities  which is common in fine-mapping  causing numerical problems in AIREML based on mixed model equations. The present study investigates the direct use of the variance covariance matrix of all observations in AIREML for LD mapping with a general complex pedigree. The method presented is more efficient than the usual approach based on mixed model equations and robust to numerical problems caused by near-singularity due to closely linked markers. It is also feasible to fit multiple QTL simultaneously in the proposed method whereas this would drastically increase computing time when using mixed model equation-based methods.

"The power of allele frequency comparisons to detect the footprint of selection in natural and experimental situations"	"Authors: Carolien Gerda Franciska De Kovel"	"Section Theoretical Biology  Institute for Biology Leiden  Universiteit Leiden  The NetherlandsCarolien Gerda Franciska De Kovel"	"No Co-Author"	"15 January 2006"	"Recently  inter-population comparisons of allele frequencies to detect past selection haven gained popularity. Data from genome-wide scans are used to detect the number and position of genes that have responded to unknown selection pressures in natural populations  or known selection pressures in experimental lines. Yet  the limitations and possibilities of these methods have not been well studied. In this paper  the objectives were (1) to investigate the distance over which a signal of directional selection is detectable under various scenarios  and (2) to study the power of the method depending on the properties of the used markers  for both natural populations and experimental set-ups. A combination of recurrence equations and simulations was used. The results show that intermediate strength selection on new mutations can be detected with a marker spacing of about 0.5 cM in large natural populations  200 to 400 generations after the divergence of subpopulations. In experimental situations  only strong selection will be detectable  while markers can be spaced a few cM apart. Adaptation from standing variation in the base population will be hard to detect  though some solutions are presented for experimental designs."
