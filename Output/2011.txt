It is therefore useful to combine closely related populations. Increased accuracies of genomic predictions depend on the number of individuals added to the reference population  the reliability of their phenotypes  and the relatedness of the populations that are combined. This paper assesses the increase in reliability achieved when combining four Holstein reference populations of 4000 bulls each  from European breeding organizations  i.e. UNCEIA (France)  VikingGenetics (Denmark  Sweden  Finland)  DHV-VIT (Germany) and CRV (The Netherlands  Flanders). Each partner validated its own bulls using their national reference data and the combined data  respectively. Combining the data significantly increased the reliability of genomic predictions for bulls in all four populations. Reliabilities increased by 10%  compared to reliabilities obtained with national reference populations alone  when they were averaged over countries and the traits evaluated. For different traits and countries  the increase in reliability ranged from 2% to 19%. Genomic selection programs benefit greatly from combining data from several closely related populations into a single large reference population. Genomic predictions rely on linkage disequilibrium between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) and polymorphisms in genes with effects on traits of interest. Linkage disequilibrium induces associations between SNP genotypes and phenotypes. SNP effects can then be estimated and combined to form genomic predictions. The accuracies of estimated SNP effects are expected to increase with the number and accuracy of available phenotypes. Therefore  the reliability of genomic predictions increases with the size of the reference population (RP) from which the relationship between phenotypes and SNP markers is determined [  ]. Currently  a RP generally consists of genotyped and progeny tested bulls [  ]. Because of the importance of the size of the RP  US and Canadian RP have been combined and it has been reported that exchanging data from reference populations is beneficial [  ]. In European countries  the size of national Holstein RP is moderate  compared to that of the combined North American RP. In September 2009  four regional breeding organizations: UNCEIA (France)  VikingGenetics (Denmark  Sweden  and Finland)  DHV-VIT (Germany) and CRV (The Netherlands  Flanders) created a combined RP by contributing each 4000 bulls. The resulting enlarged joint European RP is expected to increase the reliabilities of genomic predictions considerably. This study reports on the preliminary steps necessary to combine these four RP into a single one. It also assesses to what extent the combined RP improves genomic predictions by comparing the reliabilities of genomic predictions obtained with the combined and individual RP. The joint dataset  hereafter called the EuroGenomics data  comprised 15966 progeny tested bulls. The distributions of the bulls in relation to birth year are plotted in Figure . Bulls provided by DHV-VIT and UNCEIA were predominantly born between 1999 and 2004  whereas those provided by VikingGenetics and CRV were predominantly born before 1999. Overall  the 15966 bulls had 19.4 million daughters  with 1389 bulls having more than 1000 daughters and 939 bulls having daughters in multiple countries. The average number of daughters per bull was 117  85  117 and 153 for bulls provided by DHV-VIT  UNCEIA  VikingGenetics and CRV  respectively. . Genotypes provided by CRV were obtained using two versions of a custom 50 K SNP chip. They shared from 10 to 17 K SNP with the commercial Illumina BovineSNP50 chip [] that was used to genotype the bulls of the three other partners. SNP genotypes unique to each chip were imputed by genotyping 972 influential bulls with both SNP chips  and applying a combination of programs  including DAGPHASE [] and Beagle []. An independent cross-validation within the 972 genotyped bulls indicated that SNP genotypes were imputed with less than 1% error []. Each partner validated its own bulls using the national RP and the EuroGenomics data. Deregressed proofs (DRP  [  ]) calculated from EBV on the scale of the target population obtained from Interbull 2010-01 Multiple Across Country Evaluation (MACE) []) were used to predict and validate genomic predictions (GBV) of domestic bulls for three populations; for French Holsteins  daughter yield deviations (DYD) from the October 2009 national evaluation were used  because QTL mapping was already performed using these data. The national RP and EuroGenomics data were divided into reference and validation datasets by choosing a cut-off date for the birth date of bulls  so that approximately the 25% youngest national genotyped bulls were in the validation dataset. Records were included into the RP if the DRP/DYD had an effective daughter contribution (EDC) [] of at least 20. A previous study [] showed that reliabilities of genomic predictions for bulls whose sires were included in the reference population were much higher than for bulls without sires included. The proportion of bulls with their sires in the reference population differed among the four populations. Thus  to make results comparable  only the bulls whose sires were in the national RP were included in the validation data. In Germany  this criterion led to a significant decrease in the number of validation bulls. Thus  in order to increase the validation dataset for the German predictions  the German validation data included all bulls whose sire was included in the Eurogenomics RP when predictions were based on the EuroGenomics RP. The numbers of animals in the reference and validation datasets are in Table  for Denmark  Sweden and Finland (DFS)  in Table  for Germany (DEU)  in Table  for The Netherlands (NLD) and in Table  for France (FRA). Analyses were carried out for protein yield  udder depth  somatic cell score (SCS)  and for female fertility as non-return rate (NRR) or interval from calving to first insemination (ICF). The degree of genetic correlation for a given trait between countries reflects the importance of genotype by environment interactions. Table  shows for each population and each trait  the average genetic correlation with the three other populations  as obtained from INTERBULL []. These genetic correlations differed among countries and among traits. Among the traits studied here  udder depth had the highest genetic correlation between countries (0.98 on average)  followed by protein yield (0.88) and SCS (0.88). Fertility had the lowest genetic correlation (0.70). The average genetic correlation of one country with the three other countries was highest for DFS and DEU (0.89)  followed by FRA (0.85) and NLD (0.83). The four partners applied different genomic prediction models. The Nordic and German genomic predictions were obtained with a mixed linear model with random regression on coefficients of SNP genotypes  assuming equal variance of SNP effects over markers []. The Dutch/Flemish genomic predictions used a Bayesian mixture model for SNP effects  along with polygenic effects []  assuming that most SNP had small effects and a few SNP had moderate or large effects and the French genomic predictions used a mixed linear model with a polygenic effect and random haplotype effects across the genome []. Included haplotypes were identified in an initial QTL detection step using LDLA [] on the national RP. The QTL detection was carried out also with the EuroGenomics RP  but due to time constraints  the detection procedure used hidden states obtained from the Dualphase [] software. Hence  two lists of QTL differing by the RP in which they were detected were used to estimate haplotype effects for the prediction models using the French or EuroGenomics RP  respectively. In all French analyses  40% of the genetic variance was assumed to be explained by polygenes and 60% by markers. In all the models described above  the weighting factor  w = r/(1-r)  was applied to account for heterogeneous residual variances due to different reliabilities of DRP (r) or DYD. Derivation of the GBV used for validation differed between partners. The Nordic validation was based on direct estimated genomic breeding values (DGV)  as obtained from the genomic prediction model. The German validation combined DGV of the genotyped bulls and EBV of all available progeny-tested bulls to obtain a genomically enhanced breeding value (GEBV) using the approach reported by Ducrocq and Liu []. GBV in the Dutch/Flemish and French validations resembled GEBV  since their models included polygenic effects. The reliability of GBV (i.e. DGV or GEBV) was measured as the squared weighted correlation divided by the weighted mean of DRP (or DYD) reliabilities. The slope and intercept of weighted regressions of DRP on GBV for bulls in the validation dataset were also used to assess unbiasedness of the genomic predictions. The weights for these analyses were the same as those used for genomic prediction  but standardized such that the mean weight equals 1. In addition  reliability of the pedigree index (PI) for bulls in the test datasets was calculated using the data of bulls born before the cut-off date to divide reference and test datasets  but each partner based their calculations on different datasets. Germany and France calculated pedigree index (PI) based on national evaluation data (PI) and on Interbull MACE proofs (PI). The Nordic partner calculated PI from Nordic bulls and PI from all Interbull bulls but using Interbull MACE proofs  in both situations. In the Dutch/Flemish data  PI was calculated from the national reference data and PI from the EuroGenomics reference data  respectively. The gain in reliability attributed by the genomic information (REL) was calculated as the reliability of genomic breeding values (DGV or GEBV) minus the reliability of PI. Realized gains in reliability when the national RP was extended to the EuroGenomics RP were compared to the gains expected based on equations derived in Goddard and Hayes []. Factors such as the size of the national RP  the size of the EuroGenomics RP (which varies between populations)  the average genetic correlations between traits measured within one country and in the other countries  and the reliability of DRP were taken into account. Reliabilities of DRP (or DYD in the case of France) in the reference dataset reflect the amount of phenotypic information available for each genotyped bull (Table ). Although the heritability of SCS was much lower than that of protein yield and udder depth  the reliability of DRP for SCS was similar. Reliability of DRP for fertility was significantly lower than for the other traits  which is consistent with its very low heritability. Fertility is also the trait for which the reliability dropped most from the national RP to the EuroGenomics RP because the correlation between fertility traits among countries is lower than for the other traits. Reliabilities of DRP in the EuroGenomics reference data were generally lower than those in the national reference data. The difference in DRP reliabilities between the national and EuroGenomics data reflects the fact that genetic correlations between countries were less than one. Thus  the difference in DRP reliabilities between two datasets was largest for fertility. For the DFS reference population  substantial increases were observed in REL  when using the EuroGenomics data instead of the national data (Table ). On average  the reliability of DGV was 20% higher than the reliability of PI in the DFS reference population. The average increase in REL obtained by going from the national to the EuroGenomics data was 11%. The largest benefits from using the EuroGenomics instead of the national data were observed for protein yield  udder depth and SCS. The coefficients of regression of DRP on DGV ranged from 0.82 to 1.08  and the intercepts were between -1.02 and 2.80 genetic standard deviation units. Averaged over all traits  the reliability of GEBV from the German RP was 21% higher than the reliability of PI (Table ). The smallest increase was observed for NRR. The reliability of GEBV from the EuroGenomics data was 32% higher than the reliability of PI. REL from the EuroGenomics data averaged over all traits was 11% higher than REL from the national reference dataset. The coefficients of regression of DRP on GEBV varied from 0.83 to 1.01  and the intercepts ranged from -0.16 to 0.29 genetic standard deviation units. REL computed from the EuroGenomics data were on average 8% higher than those from the national data (Table ). Reliabilities of GEBV were on average 20% higher than reliabilities of PI. In line with the Nordic validation  the largest benefits from using the EuroGenomics data were observed for protein yield  udder depth and SCS. The coefficients of regression of DRP on GEBV were around unity (0.94 - 1.06). In genetic standard deviation units  the intercepts ranged from -0.06 to 0.10. The reliability of GEBV was significantly higher than the reliability of PI for all traits (Table ). Averaged over the four traits  the reliability of GEBV obtained from the EuroGenomics data was 9% higher than that from the national data. The latter was 20% higher than the reliability of PI. The coefficients of regression of DRP on GEBV were between 0.79 and 0.98; the intercepts were in the range of -0.07 to 0.25 genetic standard deviation units. Realized and expected gains in reliabilities of genomic predictions when going from national to EuroGenomics data varied between traits and populations (Table ). Expected gains increased over traits from fertility (lowest)  protein yield  SCS to udder depth. Averaged over the four populations  the realized gains followed the same order  except for protein yield  which ranked second for expected gain but realized the lowest gain. This low outcome was observed in all the populations  except for DFS. For udder depth  high gains were generally achieved  especially for DEU and NLD. For SCS  the increase was generally high and was larger for DFS and DEU than for NLD and FRA. For fertility  DEU and FRA achieved larger gains than DFS and NLD. Averaged over traits  the expected gains by population increased in the following order: NLD  DFS  FRA  and DEU. The order of the realized gains was the same  except for FRA  which had the second largest expected gain  but only ranked third highest in realized gain. Combining reference datasets  the reliability of genomic predictions  averaged over four populations and four traits  increased by 10% compared to genomic predictions using national RP alone. This demonstrates the benefit of combining four European Holstein RP into a single EuroGenomics RP. The size of the RP is one of the most important factors affecting the accuracy of genomic predictions. Currently  the RP generally consists of bulls which have already gone through a progeny test program. Goddard and Hayes [] demonstrated that even for a trait for which the response variable has a reliability of 0.80 (such as DRP of progeny tested bulls for most traits) and a RP with 20000 individuals  reliabilities can be increased by further increasing the size of the RP. At present  no single country has a RP large enough to obtain the maximum accuracy of genomic prediction. The magnitude of the expected increases in reliabilities from combining RP varied between the four partners and the four traits. The factors that explain most of this variation are differences in the actual increase in RP size and differences in reliabilities of DRP/DYD based on national and EuroGenomics data. The differences in reliabilities of foreign DRP are a consequence of differences in genetic correlations between countries (reflecting genotype by environment interactions)  and differences in heritability and the number of daughters in the DRP. In general  the observed increases in reliabilities from combining RP were in line with the expected values (Table ). The average increase in reliability of genomic prediction was 11% for DEU  11% for DFS  9% for FRA and 8% for NLD. This trend was consistent with expectations  except for France  which had the highest expected gain but only the third highest realized gain. The main factor generating the differences in the expected increase in reliability was the increase in the number of bulls in the reference populations. The cut-off points for dividing the EuroGenomics data into the reference dataset and the validation dataset differed between the four partners in order to meet the requirement that the size of the validation data should be about 25% of that of the national dataset. This was due to large differences in the age distribution of bulls in the different populations. Consequently  the differences between the size of national and EuroGenomics RP varied considerably (Tables      and ). This led to increases in the size of RP reaching 10736  7727  9007 and 6073 for DEU  DFS  FRA and NLD  respectively. The expected gain was similar between DFS and FRA even though the RP increased more for FRA. One explanation is that FRA had the lowest average trait genetic correlations with the other three countries. The average genetic correlation between France and the other partners was only 0.57 for fertility. This is a consequence of FRA using CR rather than the NRR that is used by the other partners. These correlations are directly related to the accuracy of DRP of foreign bulls on the national scale  which is causing different gains in reliabilities among the countries. The increase in reliability deviated most from expectations for France  where the gain was less than expected. France uses the most complicated procedure to predict GBV  including a QTL detection step and inclusion of haplotypes for which a likelihood ratio test exceeds a predefined liberal threshold. This detection step was only performed on the national RP  so the EuroGenomics RP was not exploited to select which marker haplotypes were used in the final model. This is probably the main reason why France does not appear to reach the full potential of using the EuroGenomics versus the national RP. Among the four traits in this study  using the EuroGenomics data improved reliabilities of genomic predictions most for udder depth  followed by SCS  protein yield and fertility. This order of improved genomic predictions is consistent with expectations  with the exception of protein yield. The reason why the largest gain was observed for udder depth (12-19%) is largely due to the very strong genetic correlation between countries (0.98) for this trait. Average genetic correlations between countries were 0.88 for both SCS and protein yield but the average gain in reliability from using the EuroGenomics data was 11% for SCS but only 6% for protein yield This might be explained by the fact that the reliability of DRP in the EuroGenomics data was much lower than that in the national data for protein yield  while differences in reliabilities were smaller for SCS. In other words  the EuroGenomics data provide more information for SCS but less information for protein yield. Generally  traits with a low heritability are expected to benefit relatively more from a larger reference population. However  in this study a relatively low gain was observed for fertility. The most likely reasons are that fertility had a low genetic correlation (in part due to differences in trait definitions) between countries and that reliability of DRP was much lower in the EuroGenomics data than in the national data. This is reflected in the calculated expectations of increased reliabilities  which is why fertility was also expected to show the lowest increase. Longevity was not included in the analyses although it is an important trait in all breeding goals  because the definition of longevity differs substantially between countries. Our aim was to study the increase of reliabilities from combining training data for traits with different heritabilities (low for fertility  medium for SCS  and high for udder depth and protein yield) and different ranges of genetic correlations between countries (low for fertility  medium for SCS and protein yield  and highest for udder depth). In the present study  the sizes of the four national reference datasets were almost the same and the reliabilities of DRP were also similar  but prediction models used by the EuroGenomics partners were different. Previous simulation studies e.g. [] showed that variable selection models (e.g.  BayesB) have a greater predictive ability than models allowing for weaker differentiation of variances among markers (e.g.  BayesA)  and the latter were superior to linear BLUP models. However  based on real data from dairy cattle  VanRaden et al. [] reported that the predictive ability of a nonlinear BLUP model (a heavy-tailed prior model) was considerably better than a linear BLUP model for fat percentage and protein percentage  while their predictive abilities were similar for 25 other traits. Cole et al. [] reported that a heavy-tailed prior (analogous to BayesA) provided a slightly higher GEBV reliability for all nine traits than a finite locus model with heavy tails (analogous to BayesB) and higher than a linear model for fat yield  fat % and protein %. Su et al. [] reported that a common prior Bayesian model (analogous to BayesA) exhibited a greater predictive ability than a mixture prior Bayesian model (analogous to BayesB) for fertility  udder health and protein yield  but not for fat %. In the present study  DEU and DFS used a linear BLUP model (random regression on SNP)  NLD applied a Bayesian mixture model including polygenic effects  and FRA used a mixed linear model including pre-selected haplotypes and polygenic effects. Although applying different prediction models  the gains from genomic prediction over a conventional pedigree index using national reference data were similar between countries. Averaged over the four traits  the reliability of predicted breeding values was increased by 20-21% for the four partners. This suggests that the different models used in this study had a similar predictive ability. In this study  reliabilities of DGV  GEBV and PI were measured as the squared correlation divided by reliability of DRP for bulls in the validation data. This measure of reliability is unbiased only if the validation bulls come from a random sample but the bulls in this study were selected on the basis of PI. Directional selection is expected to reduce the correlation between PI (also DGV and GEBV) and DRP. Therefore  the reliabilities reported in this study might underestimate the reliability for a random group of bulls  especially for strongly selected traits. This underestimation could partly explain the difference in the presented PI reliability among the countries  as the selection intensities on the validation data could differ between countries. The amount of underestimation of reliability from the current validation might be similar to the difference (D) between the expected reliability of PI estimated by traditional BLUP based on the whole population and the reliability of PI estimated from the validation-based selected data. Thus  estimates of the reliability of DGV and GEBV for an unselected population are approximately equal to the reported reliability in the current validation plus D[]. This study showed that reliabilities of genomic predictions using EuroGenomics data were considerably higher than those using national reference data alone. The results confirm the importance of the size of reference populations for genomic prediction. A significant improvement of genomic prediction can be achieved through cooperation between countries by combining reference data.

The frequencies of favourable alleles of the significant SNP are moderate in the Finnish Landrace population and these SNP are thus valuable candidates for possible marker-assisted selection. Estimated breeding values (EBV) based on best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) for total numbers of piglets born and farrowing intervals have been available to Finnish pig breeders since 1991 []. The current multi-trait BLUP evaluation and fertility index also includes pig mortality and age at first farrowing []. During the last decade  a favourable genetic trend has been observed in the Finnish Landrace pig population for total litter size in terms of number of piglets weaned per litter (0.1 piglet) []. Selection based on quantitative genetic theory and the BLUP method has been successful in improving female reproduction traits. However  genetic improvement of reproduction traits  which have a low heritability and sex-limited expression  constitutes a real challenge for animal breeders and requires a better understanding of the genetic architecture of these traits to allow selection on genetic variants affecting these traits []. Over the past twenty years  several microsatellite-based linkage studies have been conducted to locate quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect pig reproduction traits. The results are listed in the Pig Quantitative Trait Locus database (Pig QTLdb  ) [  ]. Through a collaborative effort between the International Porcine SNP Chip Consortium and Illumina (CA  San Diego)  researchers in pig breeding have now access to a whole-genome SNP panel  which makes it possible to study in greater detail the genetic architecture of reproduction traits in pigs []. The objective of this study was to identify SNP associated with female reproduction traits in the Finnish Landrace pig breed. Significant SNP can then be incorporated into the national evaluation and selection scheme. The analysis is based on 328 progeny-tested artificial insemination (AI) boars genotyped with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. The study included 328 Finnish Landrace AI boars born between 1996 and 2009. The average and maximum numbers of daughters per sire were 141 and 782  respectively. All boars were related to each other. The data included 114 sires with genotyped sons  for which the average and maximum numbers of sons per sire were 2.2 and 10  respectively. DNA was extracted either from hair follicles or from semen using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen  Helsinki  Finland). For more information on extraction methods see Sironen et al. []. Expected DNA concentrations were 100 ng/µL for semen and 50 ng/µL for hair follicles. For each sample  20 µL of DNA sample was sent out for genotyping at the FIMM (Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland  Helsinki  Finland) using the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. Nine female reproductive traits were studied: total number of piglets born in first (TNB1) and later parities (TNB2)  number of stillborn piglets in first (NSB1) and later parities (NSB2)  piglet mortality between birth and weaning in first (PM1) and later parities (PM2)  age at first farrowing (AFF)  first farrowing interval (FFI)  and second farrowing interval (SFI). EBV for all nine traits were obtained for each genotyped AI boar from the national breeding value evaluation (multi-trait BLUP). The linear model for TNB1  TNB2  NSB1  NSB2  PM1  and PM2 used in the national evaluation includes herd-year  year-month  type of insemination  litter breed  and age at farrowing as fixed effects  and litter sire  permanent environmental effects  and additive genetic (animal) effects as random effects. Additionally  parity number was included as a fixed effect for TNB2  NSB2  and PM2. The linear model for AFF  FFI  and SFI included herd-year and herd-month as fixed effects and animal as a random effect. The models for FFI and SFI also included the effect of dam breed. Prior to SNP association analysis  unstandardized EBV were deregressed and corresponding weights were calculated based on individual and parental EBV and reliabilities []. The proportion of genetic variance not explained by markers  due to partial marker coverage of the genome and incomplete linkage disequilibrium between markers and causal genes  was fixed at 0.5 (parameter c in Garrick et al. []). The association of SNP with deregressed EBV was studied using a mixed linear model  for each SNP separately. The model included a fixed SNP effect and a random polygenic effect to account for residual genetic variance not explained by the SNP in the model and the relationship between animals in the data. The model used was: where y is the deregressed EBV; x is the number of minor alleles (0  1  or 2); b is the corresponding regression coefficient; a is a random polygenic effect with covariance structure a ~N(0   s)  where  is the additive relationship matrix and s is the polygenic variance; and e is a random residual effect with e ~N(0   s/w)  where  is an identity matrix  s is the residual variance  and w is the weight. The analyses were performed using the AI-REML method in the DMU program package []. Variance components were estimated separately for each SNP. The estimated heritabilities based on deregressed EBV were generally smaller than the ones used in national breeding value estimation (e.g. h = 0.07 vs. 0.10 for TNB1) but were quite constant across SNP. Statistical significance of the associations was based on Bonferroni-corrected -values. This method treats individual tests as independent and thus is very conservative for data for which the correlation (linkage disequilibrium) between tests (SNP) is high; the linkage disequilibrium (r) between adjacent SNP in the Finnish Landrace population is 0.43 []. Aiming for an overall false positive rate of 0.05 and considering 50 000 to 25 000 independent tests  the point-wise -value should be between 1.0E-06 and 2.0E-06. In this article  individual SNP with a -value of 2.0E-06 or less were considered statistically significant  and SNP with a -value of 4.0E-06 or less as suggestive. More precise estimates of multiple-test-corrected -values can be obtained by a permutation procedure but this was not possible for this research because of its high computation demand. A total of 390 animals were originally genotyped; 366 animals had a call rate above the commonly used limit of 90% and five samples (DNA extracted from hair follicles) had a call rate of 0. Only the samples with a call rate equal or above to 0.90 and with available national EBV were used in the association analysis (328 animals). The Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip contains 62 163 SNP . One quarter of these had a call rate of 1.0  and 57 868 SNP had a call rate equal to or above 0.9 and were used in the association analyses. A large proportion of the SNP (7 632) were monomorphic (for these  no estimate for SNP effect is available) and 7 642 SNP had a minor allele frequency below 0.05. Most of the SNP with a low frequency were evenly distributed across the genome  but regions with low polymorphism longer than 1 Mb were also detected on different chromosomes. These low-polymorphism regions could be the result of selection  random genetic drift  or a bottleneck effect. Otherwise  the distribution of minor allele frequency was uniform across SNP. The SNP were mapped to pig genome build 9 (Sscrofa9  ). For each trait  animals with a weight of the deregressed EBV less than 1.0 were removed from the analysis. The choice of this limit was arbitrary and subsequent analyses showed that inclusion or exclusion of these animals in the data had no real effect on the association results because of their large residual variance (small weight) in the linear mixed model equations. Figure  describes the distribution of deregressed EBV and weights for TNB1  and Table  gives the number of observations  mean  and standard deviation of the studied traits. Also the mean reliabilities of the original EBV are presented in Table . . Significant associations were observed for TNB1  TNB2  and PM2  and suggestive associations for PM1  NSB2  FFI  and SFI (Table  and Figure ). Two chromosomal regions on chromosome 9 (around 79 Mb and 95 Mb  based on Sscrofa9) were statistically significant for litter size of first and later parities (TNB1 and TNB2). The estimated effect of SNP in these two regions of chromosome 9 was approximately 1 piglet between the two homozygote classes (e.g. SNP DRGA0009645; AA-genotypes vs. GG-genotypes). SNP ALGA0054078  H3GA0027863  MARC0003458  and MARC0027588 (79 Mb) were in complete linkage disequilibrium with each other and in moderate linkage disequilibrium (r = 0.36) with DRGA0009645 (95 Mb) (Figure ). During the last 15 years  the frequency of favourable alleles increased from 0.10 to 0.19 for SNP in the 79 Mb region and from 0.14 to 0.22 for DRGA0009645 (Table ). This positive trend in allele frequencies is in good agreement with the overall increase in litter size observed in the Finnish Landrace breed over the same period.  . The threshold value for significant association is indicated by the blue horizontal line and that for suggestive association by the red horizontal line. 1: SSC9 and total number of piglets born in first parity (TNB1); 2: SSC9 and total number of piglets born in later parities (TNB2); 3: SSC1 and number of stillborn piglets in later parities (NSB2); 4: SSC9 and piglet mortality between birth and weaning in first parity (PM1); 5: SSC7 and piglet mortality between birth and weaning in later parities (PM2); 6: SSC9 and PM2; 7: SSC4 and first farrowing interval (FFI); 8: SSC1 and second farrowing interval (SFI). . A black diamond without a number represents complete linkage disequilibrium between SNP (r = 1). When the two regions were combined in the analysis and the regression variable corresponded to the number of favourable alleles (A) in H3GA0027863 and DRGA0009645 (possible values 0  1  2  3  and 4)  the estimated SNP effect was 0.32  with a  value of 1.69E-08. Thus  animals that are double homozygotes AA for H3GA0027863 and DRGA0009645 are expected to have 1.28 (4*0.32) more piglets than animals that are double homozygotes GG. To test the sensitivity of the analysis  observations with a weight less than 5 were discarded. For this analysis  the estimated SNP effect was also 0.32  with a  value of 1.08E-08. Figure  shows the distribution of the deregressed EBV of TNB1 for animals with different combinations of genotypes for H3GA0027863 and DRGA0009645 (deregressed EBV with a weight less than 5.0 were discarded). . Distribution of deregressed EBV for total number of piglets born (TNB1) against the number of favourable alleles for SNP H3GA0027863 and DRGA0009645; deregressed EBV with weight less than 5.0 were discarded. Another region on chromosome 9 (around 66 Mb  based on Sscrofa9) was statistically significant for piglet mortality before weaning (PM1 and PM2  Table ). SNP in this region were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (r ranging from 0.85 to 0.94) but nearly in linkage equilibrium with the SNP in region 79 Mb on the same chromosome that were significant for litter size (r < 0.01) (Figure ). Moreover  the SNP that gave suggestive evidence for PM2 at 95.4 Mb on chromosome 9 (MARC0023136) was in weak linkage disequilibrium (r = 0.17) with a SNP in the same proximal area (DRGA0009645) that was significant for litter size (Figure ). -values for the association of MARC0023136 on TNB1 and TNB2 were 0.002 and 0.0005  respectively  reflecting the observed linkage disequilibrium between MARC0023136 and DRGA0009645. The low linkage disequilibrium between adjacent DRGA0009645 and MARC0023136  which were located 22 kb from each other  may be due to mapping errors in build 9 (Sscrofa9  ). The frequencies of favourable alleles for pig mortality have increased during the last 15 years. This could be due either to random drift or  given the fact that the SNP are associated with the trait under selection  to selection force (Table ). Suggestive evidence for associations between SNP and female reproduction traits was also observed for number of stillborn piglets in later parities (NSB2) on chromosome 1  for pig mortality in later parities (PM2) on chromosome 7  for first farrowing interval (FFI) on chromosome 4  and for later farrowing interval (SFI) on chromosome 1 (Table ). Good genetic progress for pig reproduction traits has been achieved using a quantitative genetic-based multi-trait BLUP evaluation system. Marker-assisted selection [] was expected to boost selection efficiency to a new level []. As is well known  these promises have not been fulfilled  mainly due to the lack of markers strongly linked to QTL. High-density SNP genotyping technology provides a new tool to select elite animals for breeding. SNP are also more powerful to study the genetic background of traits than microsatellites because they have a better genomic coverage and can provide information on historical linkage disequilibrium with potential QTL  whereas microsatellite linkage studies were based on more recent linkage within families. High-density SNP genotypes are primarily incorporated into breeding programs through the use of genomic selection instead of traditional marker-assisted selection  particularly in dairy cattle breeding []. Marker-assisted selection on known marker-QTL associations and genomic selection on an overall sum of marker effects across the genome both rely on strong linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL. Finnish pig breeds are very suitable for SNP association studies because of their high linkage disequilibrium over the typical distances between SNP in the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip [] and the homogeneity of the population. Other important factors affecting the power of association studies  beyond the actual genetic architecture of the trait  are the number of genotyped animals and the reliability of the observations used in statistical analysis. In this study  over 300 AI boars with an average number of 141 daughters per sire were available for association analyses. Given that the number of genotyped animals is the same in both scenarios  for traits with a low heritability  a half-sib design  as used here is more powerful for association studies than a direct design  in which the same animals are both genotyped and phenotyped []. Given the number of genotyped boars and daughters per sire  a direct design would have required several hundreds to several thousands more genotyped animals to achieve the same power as the half-sib design used here (e.g. with an average number of 40 daughters per sire  h = 0.1  a QTL that explains 5% of the phenotypic variation  and a significance value of 2.0E-06  approximately 650 genotyped sows are needed to achieve the same power (0.8) as 130 genotyped AI boars []). Although a larger number of genotyped sires would have improved the power  the results show that the data size was sufficient to discover three new regions on chromosome 9 with effects on litter size and piglet mortality with very small -values. The reported effects of these SNP are most likely overestimated due to the \"winner's curse\" effect [] that is commonly observed in initial genome-wide association studies. A larger population study is still needed to precisely estimate the effects and gene actions of these chromosomal regions on litter size and pig mortality. Annotation of the SNP was based on the pig genome build 9 (Sscrofa9  ). It is well known that build 9 contains errors in the actual position of the SNP and even in the order of the SNP  as suggested by the linkage disequilibrium pattern of the significant SNP on chromosome 9 in this study. However  single SNP association tests are not sensitive to mapping errors. Thus  results (-values) presented here hold even with an updated pig genome build but the candidate genes that are in the proximity of the significant SNP may change from the ones presented here. The three regions on chromosome 9 (around 65  79 and 95 Mb) that were significant for female reproduction traits in this study are within the same region as that reported for ovulation rate by Rohrer et al. [] (57 to 122 cM  with a peak at 67 cM)  based on their whole-genome microsatellite study of Chinese Meishan × European White composite line crossbreds. A significant region on chromosome 9 was also reported for ovulation rate in another microsatellite-based genome scan of an F2 cross of two selected experimental lines []. However  this 1 cM region does not overlap with the region reported here or by Rohrer et al. []. Yet another microsatellite genome scan of Meishan × Large White F2 population revealed two significant regions on chromosome 9 for female reproduction traits: a region at 127 cM was significant for ovulation rate and one at 36 cM for number of viable embryos and embryo survival []. Neither of these regions overlaps with the significant regions in this study. The suggestive region for NSB2 at the end of chromosome 1 that was found in this study has been reported to carry a QTL for age at puberty [] but not for number of stillborn piglets. The  () gene on chromosome 1 (15186680 to 15450209 bp) is a good candidate gene for all reproduction traits. However  none of the SNP in this region gave significant or suggestive -values for any of the studied traits here. The best SNP (ALGA0000673 for SFI) is located 7 Mb from the  gene. A QTL for number of stillborn has been reported on chromosome 7 [] and a QTL for ovulation rate on chromosome 4 []. It is interesting that the genome regions that reached statistical significance in our study are all on chromosome 9. Without further studies  it is difficult to say whether this is by chance or whether there is some biological or population-based mechanism that explains this result. No linkage disequilibrium was observed between the significant regions on chromosome 9 at the population level  which implies that the regions have segregated independently in the Finnish Landrace population and thus rules out the hitchhiking effect as the most likely explanation. The region on chromosome 9 that is associated with TNB1 and TNB2 contains several potential candidate genes that may contribute to the physiology of variation in sow fertility. The  () gene between positions 81024216 and 81081616 bp is involved in folliculogenesis  gonadotrophin receptor expression  proliferation of granulosa cells  and intraovarian estrogen signalling []. Its well-balanced activity is necessary for normal ovarian function. Additionally  it has been found that  knockout mice have reduced fertility due to disturbed follicle development  with significantly fewer pre-antral and antral follicles and less ovulations compared with wild-type mice []. Another candidate gene for litter size is  ()  which is located on chromosome 9 between positions 85801970 and 85806347 bp. IL6 is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates various aspects of the immune response and is also expressed during the ovulation process []. IL6 has been shown to serve as a potent regulator of ovarian cumulus cell function and cumulus cell oocyte complex expansion  and it may mediate some of its effects []. Furthermore  the  () gene between positions 95427072 and 95467282 bp has been shown to play an essential role in early murine embryogenesis. PTPN12 functions in embryonic vascularization  mesenchyme formation  neurogenesis  and early liver development []  and may thus affect embryo survival. However  identification of the causal genes for litter size and piglet mortality traits in the reported regions on chromosome 9 requires additional work. To conclude  this whole-genome SNP association study using 328 Finnish Landrace AI boars revealed three highly significant regions on chromosome 9 with effects on litter size and piglet mortality. Suggestive -values were also observed on chromosomes 1  4  and 7 for second and first farrowing intervals and for piglet mortality in later parities  respectively. The frequencies of favourable alleles of the significant SNP are still moderate in the Finnish Landrace population.

The results suggest that when analyzing binary data with extreme case problems  bias in the estimation of variance components could be eliminated  or at least significantly reduced by using a g-prior. It is well known that when the binary responses (1 = cases and 0 = controls) associated with a particular level of an effect fall within the same category  being either all ones or all zeros (known as extreme case problems or )  the likelihood is under-identified [] and variance components tend to be biased. Sorensen et al. [] noted that with an increasing number of fixed effects for a constant number of observations  a larger proportion of fixed effect levels will contain ECP. The authors further noted that no information is present in the data to estimate these fixed effects and the likelihood is ill-conditioned. Moreno et al. [] reported that marginal maximum likelihood yielded biased inferences about the variance component  and that the direction of the bias depended on the amount of information associated with either fixed or random effects. Furthermore  when the Gibbs sampler was used to perform the marginalization  positively biased inferences were reported when the amount of data per fixed effect was small []. The authors concluded that the bias persisted when fixed effects were poorly estimated  despite the large amount of information about the variance component. Sorensen et al. [] hypothesized that the choice of the prior distribution for the fixed effects could be the most critical element for dealing with ECP. Hoeschele and Tier [] conducted a simulation study which indicated that a portion of the bias could be alleviated by assuming that fixed effects follow a priori a Gaussian distribution. Likewise  Moreno et al. [] reported a reduction in the bias when a Gaussian probability density function was assigned to the prior distribution of the fixed effects. However  this strategy may not always work as Moreno et al. [] reported that assigning a Gaussian probability density function to the prior distribution of the fixed effects did not reduce the bias for very sparse data structures. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect on inferences of assigning a generalized prior (g-prior) with varying weights to fixed effects  first proposed by Zellner []  for the analysis of binary data in the presence of varying percentages of ECP. A simulation using a sire model was used to test the effect of the g-prior in the presence of ECP. The threshold model is becoming a standard tool to analyze of discrete data in the field of animal breeding and genetics and extensive literature on its theoretical basis  implementation and application has been generated in the last twenty years [    ]. Let  represent the observed binary trait taking values of 1 for cases or 0 for controls  and  is an underlying continuous variable that relates to  through the following relationship: Assuming the following mixed linear model on the liability scale: where    and  are the vectors of liabilities  systematic and random effects  respectively.  is the identity matrix and  and  are known incidence matrices. To complete the Bayesian formulation  prior information for the model parameters must be specified. For the random effects  a multivariate normal distribution was assumed: and a scaled inverted chi-squared density was assumed for  with  and  set equal to 2 and the true value of the sire variance (0.05 or 0.02)  respectively. For the systematic effects  let  where and are the ECP and non-ECP classes. For   the following prior was assumed: For   a generalized or g-prior was assumed. It consists of a special form of a natural conjugate prior distribution for the parameters of multiple regression models  and can be viewed as a reference informative prior []. Its advantage in dealing with the ECP is that it can restrict location parameters from taking extreme large values due to an ill-defined likelihood function. In its original form  a g-prior is defined as a normal distribution with a zero mean and a variance proportional to the standard errors of the least square (LS) estimators of the model parameters. However  a more generalized g-prior allows for a non-zero mean. The general form of a g-prior is given by: and where  is the residual variance and was set to one   is the prior mean for the ECP classes  which could be set equal to the average of the non ECP classes  g is the relative weight given to the prior and ranges between 0 and 1  and is the incidence matrix corresponding to the ECP classes. Following Albert and Chib [] and Sorensen et al. []  all conditional posterior distributions are in closed form  normal for  and   truncated normal for  and scaled inverted Chi square for ?4?. Specifically  for   the conditional distribution is: where  is the estimate of the effects of the ECP classes based on data and assuming that the  is full rank. The vector  is  as indicated before  the mean of the normal prior for the ECP classes. Although it could be set to any reasonable value  including zero  in our case it was set equal to the average of the solutions for the non-ECP classes. Note that when g = 0  the conditional distribution in (5) reduces to that obtained when a flat prior is used. A simulation using a sire model was carried out to investigate methods of analyzing binary data with ECP. Four over-lapping generations were simulated. The base population included 50 unrelated sires and subsequent generations consisted of 150 sires each. Thus  a total of 500 sires were generated. For animals in a given generation  their sires were selected at random from the pool of sires from all previous generations. The dataset consisted of 5000 daughter records from the 500 sires with an average of around ten records per sire. Classes of the fixed effects were randomly assigned to each record. A linear mixed model which included a fixed effect and random effects of sire and residual was used to generate the binary responses. The fixed effect has 200 classes and was drawn from a uniform distribution with on average 25 observations per class. In order to obtain a desired percentage of ECP in the data  the bounds of the uniform distributions were adjusted. For example  by decreasing the lower bound of the uniform distribution (on the negative side of the real line)  more liabilities will have negative values and thus their associate binary responses will be equal to zero which  in turn  will lead to more ECP classes. However  within a given percentage of ECP  only the seed for the random number generator was changed  not the bounds of the uniform distribution. The resulting incidence rate ranged from 9 to 34%  depending on the different simulation scenarios. Transmitting ability of individuals from the base population was sampled from a normal distribution   where  was the identity matrix and . The remaining sire effects were sampled from a normal distribution with a mean equal to one half of the grandsire's transmitting ability and a variance equal to . The residual term was sampled from a normal distribution    where  was the identity matrix and   resulting in a heritability of 0.17 or 0.07. For each daughter record  the liability was calculated as the sum of all effects included in the model. Binary responses were assigned so that if the liability was greater than zero  then  = 1  otherwise  = 0. For each one of the two values used for the sire variance  five datasets with a varying percentage of ECP were simulated: 5% ()  10% ()  20% ()  30% ()  and 75% (). Five replicates were simulated for each level of ECP. Four methods to account for ECP  using a standard threshold model  were investigated: normal prior ()  5% g-prior ()  10% g-prior ()  and 15% g-prior (). All datasets were analyzed using the four methods to account for ECP; i.e.  the 5% ECP data were analyzed using the NP  5%  10%  and 15% g-prior  which are denoted as 5E-NP  5E-5G  5E-10G  and 5E-15G  respectively. The remaining ECP datasets are similarly denoted with the percentage of ECP listed first and then the percentage of g-prior used in the analyses. Convergence diagnostics were based on the method of Raftery and Lewis []  as implemented in the CODA software []. The required burn-in period was always less than 1 300 iterations for all parameters in the analyses. Thus  a total chain length of 75 000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler was run with a conservative burn-in of 25 000 iterations. The remaining 50 000 iterations were retained without thinning for post-Gibbs analysis. Furthermore  point estimates of the mean and standard deviation  and the high posterior density 95% [] interval were obtained from the CODA software [] for all parameters. Summaries of the posterior mean  standard deviation and HPD (95%) interval averaged over five replicates  are presented in Table  (when true sire variance was equal to 0.05) and Table  (when true sire variance was equal to 0.02). Using NP  point estimates of sire variance for 5E  10E  and 20E  were greater than the true values but did not seem to be biased as the true value (0.05 or 0.02) was within the HPD (95%) interval. For 30E and 75E  the sire variance was grossly over-estimated and biased as the true value was outside or barely within the HPD (95%) interval. In general  the sire variances decreased with an increase in the percentage of g-prior used in the threshold analysis. When true sire variance was equal to 0.05  for 5E  the point estimate of the sire variance was 0.068 when NP was used; however  the point estimate decreased to 0.048 when 15G was used. This same trend was also observed for 10E (0.072 decreased to 0.050)  20E (0.082 decreased to 0.055)  30E (0.094 decreased to 0.058); and 75E (0.109 decreased to 0.069). Similar results were observed when the true value of the sire variance was 0.02 (Table ). Analysis 15G yielded point estimates extremely similar to the true value for the 5E (0.048) and 10E (0.050) data. Furthermore  15G yielded point estimates with values most similar to the true value and estimates with the smallest amount of bias for the 20E (0.055)  30E (0.058) and 75E (0.069) data. A summary of the Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed and random effects  averaged over five replicates  are presented in Table . For a heritability of 17%  Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects for 5E (0.82)  10E (0.75)  20E (0.71)  30E (0.67)  and 75E (0.49) were lowest when NP was used. The Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were virtually the same for 5E-5G (0.903)  with 5E-10G (0.909) and 5E-15G (0.909). This same trend was also observed for the 10E  20E  30E  and 75E data. Similar results in magnitude and trend were observed when the heritability was equal to 7%. For the sire effect  Pearson correlations between true and predicted breeding values were virtually the same across g-prior weights within a given percentage of ECP. The results of this study indicate that point estimates of sire variance (Tables  and ) obtained from 5E-NP  10E-NP  and 20E-NP were slightly higher than the true values  although without any indication of noticeable bias. However  point estimates of sire variance obtained from 30E-NP and 75E-NP were severely biased. Depending on the percentage of ECP  biases ranged from 36 to 102% when true sire variance was equal to 0.05 and from 25 to 105% when true sire variance was equal to 0.02 when NP was used. In fact  the true value for sire variance was outside the HPD (95%) interval for 75E-NP  and barely inside the interval for 30E-NP for both heritability values. When a g-prior was used  the bias was reduced and even eliminated  depending on the percentage of ECP and the weight assigned to the g-prior. With 5G  overestimation persisted for all five ECP datasets (Tables  and ). Furthermore  the true value used in the simulation was closer to the lower bound of the HPD (95%) interval  especially for 30E-5G and 75E-5G  indicating that point estimates of sire variance are less likely to be similar to the true value. Thus  point estimates of sire variance are biased upward. In fact  point estimates of sire variance using both heritability values were biased upward by 25 to 85% when 5G was used. Conversely  when 10G was included in the analysis  the bias was eliminated for datasets 5E (0.054) and 10E (0.057) and significantly reduced for datasets 20E (0.063); 30E (0.066); and 75E (0.071). Using 15G  bias was completely eliminated  regardless of the percentage of ECP  and only a slight overestimation was observed for 75E-15G. The true value for sire variance was well centered within the HPD (95%) interval for 5E-15G  10E-15G  20E-15G  30E-15G; and 75E-15G further indicating that a threshold model with a 15% g-prior resulted in more accurate estimation of sire variance for binary data with 5  10  20  30  and 75% ECP. The results of this study prove that when analyzing binary responses in the presence of ECP  a standard threshold model with a normal prior could lead to biased variance components  especially when the percentage of ECP is greater than 30%. Depending on the percentage of ECP in the dataset and on the weight assigned to the g-prior  bias in variance component estimation could be avoided. Although these results are promising  the univariate sire model is not the typical method to analyze a binary trait. Typically  binary traits are analyzed in combination with a continuous trait(s) using an animal model rather than a sire model. Thus  further testing is needed to apply this methodology to a more realistic scenario like the use of an animal model and joint analysis of binary and continuous traits. On the practical side  it is worth mentioning that the normal prior approach could be a viable alternative when the ECP rate is low (below 30%) as reported in previous studies [  ]. Additionally  the results obtained using the normal prior could change if different hyper-parameters or model implementations are adopted. When compared with NP  a substantial increase in the Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were observed  for all percentages of ECP data  when 5G  10G or 15G was used in the analysis to account for ECP (Table ). When a 15% g-prior was used instead of a normal prior  Pearson correlations between true and fixed effects increased by 11  20  23  27  and 60% for 5E  10E  20E  30E  and 75E  respectively. These results suggest that a standard threshold model with a normal prior was not adequate to estimate fixed effects  especially when 30% or more ECP were present. Conversely  when a g-prior was used  Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were virtually the same within datasets of varying percentages of ECP. This result suggests that a standard threshold model with a g-prior provides more adequate estimation of fixed effects. There were no observable differences in Pearson correlations (Table ) between true and predicted breeding values between using NP  5G  10G  and 15G within datasets of varying percentages of ECP. Unlike the correlations for the fixed effects  the increase in correlations between true and predicted breeding values when a 5% g-prior was used instead of no g-prior was less than 1% for 5E  10E  20E  30E  and 75E. This result suggests that the presence of ECP in the fixed effects of binary responses and the weight of the g-prior assigned did not impact prediction of breeding values. However  the effect of ECP on breeding value prediction could be greater in situations where an animal has only one record  which would be the case in an animal model. In this study  the weight of the g-prior was assumed known. A better approach is to estimate this parameter in the model. However  we believe that in practical situations  trying to estimate \"g\" could lead to the original problem of an ill-defined likelihood  unless a somewhat strongly informative prior is used. The results of this study prove that estimates of sire variance using a normal prior could be severely biased when a substantial percentage of ECP is present in binary data. Depending on the percentage of ECP present in the data  these upward biases of estimates ranged from 25 to 105% when a normal prior was used for the fixed effects. However  when a generalized prior was used  the bias was reduced and even eliminated  depending on the percentage of ECP and the weight assigned to the generalized prior. Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were lowest when a normal prior was used for all percentages of ECP. Furthermore  the correlations were similar when a generalized prior was used for all percentages of ECP present in the binary data. The results suggest that when analyzing binary data in the presence of ECP  bias in the estimation of variance components can be eliminated  or at least significantly reduced by using a generalized prior for the fixed effects. 5% extreme case problems 5% generalized prior 10% extreme case problems 10% generalized prior 15% generalized prior 20% extreme case problems 30% extreme case problems 75% extreme case problems extreme case problems generalized prior high posterior density 95% interval normal prior Gelman A  Carlin JB  Stern HS  and Rubin DB: Bayesian Data Analysis. 1995  Chapman and Hall  London  England Sorensen D  Andersen AS  Gianola D  Korsgaard I: Bayesian inference in threshold using Gibbs sampling.

These results suggest that genomic estimates of genetic merit can be produced in beef cattle at a young age but the recurrent inclusion of genotyped sires in retraining analyses will be necessary to routinely produce for the industry the direct genomic values with the highest accuracy. Traditional methods of genetic evaluation depend on the accumulation and analysis of phenotypic and pedigree information to produce estimated breeding values (EBV). For a given selection intensity  response to selection measured in genetic standard deviations is proportional to the ratio of the accuracy of EBV and generation interval. In practice  accuracy increases but the generation interval is extended by waiting until the individual or offspring phenotypic records are available to estimate genetic merit  usually decreasing selection response. Genomic selection is a recently developed technology [] that is beginning to revolutionize animal breeding. It is currently possible to genotype cattle for at least 50 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using a variety of assays  such as the BovineSNP50 []  BovineHD (Illumina  San Diego  CA) or Axiom BOS 1 (Affymetrix  Santa Clara  CA) assays. These SNP panels can be used to produce direct genomic values (DGV)  as proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  via the estimation of marker effects from the analysis of a population with SNP genotypes and trait phenotypes (training set). The resulting estimates of SNP effects are then used in conjunction with SNP genotypes and trait phenotypes from a new group of animals (validation set) to evaluate the performance of the DGV prediction model. The accuracies of the resulting DGV  determined as the correlation between actual and predicted genetic merits  have only recently begun to be reported for traits in beef cattle []  in contrast to numerous results from dairy cattle populations  including New Zealand Holstein-Friesian and Jerseys []  North American Holstein []  Australian Holstein-Friesian []  Norwegian Red cattle [] and Danish Holsteins []. Habier et al. [] indicated that genomic selection uses genetic relationships among individuals and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) to improve the accuracy of DGV. The increase in accuracy of evaluation from using a genomic relationship matrix in traditional animal models comes from replacing an expected relationship matrix  which is conditional on the pedigree  with a realized matrix that is not influenced by missing pedigree information or violation of the assumption that the Mendelian sampling of parental gametes is drawn from a distribution with zero mean. In an earlier study  Nejati-Javaremi et al. [] replaced the pedigree-based relationship matrix with a marker-based total allelic relationship matrix and documented its impact on reducing prediction error variance  hence  increasing the accuracy of evaluation. Saatchi et al. [] and Habier et al. [] have shown that the number of generations separating training and validation datasets influences accuracy  with lower accuracies occurring when this relationship is more distant. The accuracy of DGV is key to the successful application of genomic selection in animal breeding but cannot be assessed in the training set. In practice  cross-validation can be performed in a sample of individuals that are related to those in the training set but that were not themselves included in training. The objective of this study was to investigate accuracies of DGV predicted for 16 economically important traits in US Angus beef cattle. We employed K-means clustering to pedigree estimates of the additive genetic relationships among the 3570 genotyped animals to partition animals into training and validation groups  with the aim of increasing within-group and decreasing between-group relationships for cross-validation. We also compared these results to those achieved from the more common practice of random allocation of individuals to the training and validation groups and from training on old animals and validating in young animals. In a national evaluation  the DGV could be considered as a correlated trait to that for which phenotypes are available for traditional estimation of EBV []  in which case estimates of the genetic correlations between traits and respective DGV are required. We derived prediction equations for DGV and used these to estimate these correlations. A total of 3668 registered Angus bulls were genotyped with the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA) either at the University of Missouri (Columbia  MO) or GeneSeek (Lincoln  NE). Forty animals had genotypes that were inconsistent with the patrilineal pedigree and were removed  as well as 58 additional animals for which the genotype call rate (CR) was less than 95%  leaving 3570 Angus bulls born between 1955 and 2008 (Table ). The DNA for each bull was obtained from cryopreserved semen provided by artificial insemination (AI) organizations  the National Animal Germplasm Program  the University of Maryland Wye herd  and numerous breeders of registered Angus cattle []. Scoring of marker genotypes was performed using Illumina's Beadstudio software (v3.2.23). Genotypes at a particular locus were filtered from further analysis according to the following criteria: (1) CR less than 90% (n = 472); (2) minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 1% (n = 5164); and (3) for autosomal and pseudoautosomal loci  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium Chi-square statistic with 1 degree of freedom greater than 300 (n = 5745). These filters were not independent and resulted in 9360 of the 54 442 loci being removed  leaving 45 082 loci for analysis. Most animals had a few missing genotypes and these were imputed (0.45% of all genotypes) using fastPHASE []. Deregressed estimated breeding values (DEBV) were used as response variables to estimate SNP effects. An appropriate deregressing method  that removes parent average effects and which accounts for heterogeneous variance [] was used to calculate DEBV from the EBV and their reliabilities of genotyped bulls and their sires and dams. Expected progeny differences (EPD) and their Beef Improvement Federation (BIF) accuracies for the genotyped bulls  their sires and dams were obtained from the American Angus Association (AAA) national cattle evaluation in August 2010. The EPD were transformed to EBV by multiplying by 2  and the corresponding reliabilities (R) were obtained as: In total  16 traits were analyzed in this study: birth  weaning and yearling weights; yearling height; mature weight and height; maternal weaning weight (maternal milk); fat thickness; marbling score; rib eye muscle area; carcass weight; direct and maternal calving ease; scrotal circumference; docility and heifer pregnancy rate. The number of genotyped bulls with DEBV varied according to trait because some traits have only recently been introduced (e.g.  heifer pregnancy) or because young bulls did not yet have progeny measurements on some traits (e.g.  carcass composition traits). Heritabilities (reported by AAA  )  number of genotyped bulls with DEBV and their mean DEBV reliabilities for the studied traits are in Table . In this study  all SNP markers that passed the filtering process were used as predictors with weighted DEBV used as response variables to estimate SNP effects. The Bayesian method presented in []  which we will refer to as \"BayesC \" was used to estimate marker effects for genomic prediction. BayesC is related to both the BayesB and BLUP methods presented by Meuwissen et al. []. Like BLUP  BayesC assumes that SNP effects are drawn from a distribution with constant variance  but treats the common variance as unknown with a scaled inverse-chi square prior. Like BayesB  BayesC fits a mixture model that assumes some known fraction of markers (p) has zero effects. It has been shown that BayesC is less sensitive to prior assumptions than is BayesB []. For each trait the following model was fit to the DEBV data for training: where  is the DEBV on animal i   is the population mean  k is the number of marker loci in the panel   is allelic state (i.e.  number of B alleles from the Illumina A/B calling system) at marker j in individual i   is the random effect for marker j  with  (with probability 1 - p) or  = 0 (with probability p)  and  is a residual with heterogeneous variance  depending on the reliability of the information on the bull []. Details concerning estimation of  are described in Kizilkaya et al. []. In this study  parameter p was assumed to be 0.995 for all analyses. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with 41 000 iterations were used to provide posterior mean estimates of marker effects and variances after discarding the first 1000 samples that were used for burn-in. In preliminary analyses  all the genotyped bulls were included in the training set to obtain estimates of genetic and residual variances to construct the priors for the genetic and residual scale parameters. The DGV for individual i within a validation set was derived as the sum of predicted effects of SNP posterior means over all k marker effects estimated in the training set: where DGV is the DGV for individual i in the validation dataset   is the marker genotype of individual i for marker j coded as for training  and  is the estimated posterior mean effect of marker j over the 40 000 post burn-in samples. All analyses were performed using the GenSel software []. The accuracy of DGV was evaluated by pooling estimates using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. Genotyped bulls were first divided into five mutually exclusive groups. In each training analysis  the data excluded one group to train on the remaining four groups to estimate marker effects  which were then used to predict DGV of individuals from the omitted group (validation set). This resulted in every bull having predicted DGV obtained without using its own DEBV  allowing that DEBV to be used in validation. The K-means clustering method was applied to a dissimilarity or distance matrix containing elements of one minus the additive genetic relationship between pairs of animals to partition the genotyped bulls into five groups in which relatedness was increased within each group and decreased between each of the groups. The dissimilarity matrix (D matrix) between genotyped individuals was computed from elements of the pedigree numerator relationship matrix (A matrix): where  is a measure of pedigree distance between individual i and individual j   is the additive genetic relationship between individual i and individual j   (and ) are diagonal elements of the A matrix  which represent the relationship coefficient (including inbreeding) of individual i (or j) with itself. This formulation removes the effects of inbreeding and results in the diagonal elements of D being zero. We used the CFC Package [] to construct the relationship matrix between the 3570 genotyped bulls  using pedigree information for all 109 594 known ancestors. Founder animals that appeared only once in the pedigree were pruned  which reduced the pedigree set to 91 001 animals. These individuals represented up to 64 pedigree generations. We used the Hartigan and Wong [] algorithm  implemented using R [] for K-means clustering. The maximum relationship coefficient (a) was calculated between each animal and all other animals in each of the five partitioned groups  so that each animal had five a values. The density distributions of the five a values for all animals in a particular group were used to quantify the quality of the clustering. For comparative purposes  random clustering was also performed  with 5-fold cross-validation repeated for five replicates for each of the studied traits. In practical livestock applications  training will occur on historical animals  and the target population for implementation of genomic selection may include but not be limited to their offspring. Thus  it has been common to validate DGV on progeny (selection candidates) or in young animals  as in US dairy cattle []  where essentially all historic and currently active AI sires have been genotyped and are used in training. In contrast  many beef cattle sires are used only by natural mating  and cross-validation using less related training sets  rather than immediate progeny  may more appropriately reflect the DGV accuracies achieved in practice. However  for comparison to the dairy results  we also partitioned the genotyped bulls into two groups according to their birth year and trained on the older bulls and validated in the younger animals. Different birth years were used as thresholds for this partitioning for each trait so that about one-fifth of the individuals were always in the validation set. The numbers of individuals in the training and validation sets and the birth year range for individuals in the validation set for each trait are in Table . The accuracy of DGV could be defined as the correlation between true genetic values and   which could be computed as: where  is the accuracy of DGV   is the covariance between true genetic values and DGV   and  are the population additive genetic and the sample DGV variances  respectively. The true genetic values of genotyped animals are not available but the DEBV could be used here with the same expectation of covariance since  if we assume    where  is the covariance between DEBV and DGV. The following formula was used to measure the accuracy of DGV: This formula is a generalization of the approach that would be used when validation occurs in a set of individuals with phenotypes and the correlation between DGV and phenotypes is standardized by dividing by the square root of the heritability. The additive genetic variance  was derived from: where  is the trait heritability as reported by AAA (Table ) and  is the phenotypic DEBV variance estimated from the primary analysis using all genotyped animals in the training set (as the sum of the estimated genetic and residual variances). The genotyped bulls represent birth years from 1955-2008  a period with considerable genetic trend for some traits. We estimated the generation interval in the pedigree of the genotyped Angus cattle to be 4.99 years (data not shown)  which is the average age of bulls within the pedigree born between 1941 and 1990 (the part of the pedigree that captured most animals) at the birth of their progeny. Accordingly  we fitted contemporary groups defined by year of birth (in 5-year intervals) as fixed effects to remove any effects of selection that could inflate correlations. The sample covariance and sample variances from each 5-year interval were pooled according to their respective degrees of freedom. The extent of prediction bias can be judged by comparing the regression of true breeding value (here  DEBV) on predicted breeding value (DGV)  with its expected value of 1 for each trait. Hence  the regression coefficients were calculated for each trait using simple linear regression of DEBV on DGV. Conventional genetic evaluation systems generate parent average (PA) predictions that can be used to facilitate animal selection prior to the measurement of individual or offspring phenotypes. Thus  PA provides an accuracy benchmark for comparison to the accuracy of DGV. However  the available PA information in our dataset does not represent that available on the parents of the genotyped bulls at the time of their birth. Hence  we tried to exclude information of the genotyped bull from the cumulative information available on his parents using the Garrick et al. [] deregression method to create an adjusted PA (PA) for each genotyped bull. Also  genomic-enhanced breeding values (GEBV) blending PA and DGV obtained from K-means clustering and cross-validation  was constructed as: where b and b were estimated using multiple regression with DEBV as the response variable. The accuracies of PA and GEBV were calculated with the same formula as for DGV for each trait. Contemporary groups within each of the five partitioned groups based on 5-year birth intervals were considered as fixed effects to allow for the effects of genetic trends in each trait and fair comparisons with the accuracies of DGV. For each of the 16 traits  we applied a weighted bivariate analysis using DGV of genotyped animals from the five validation sets obtained by K-means clustering and 5-fold cross-validation and their DEBV to estimate variance and covariance components. The model was: where  and   are vectors of fixed effects (only the trait mean for  but class effects of the five K-means partitioned groups for );  and   are vectors of random additive genetic effects for the two traits     and   where A is the pedigree numerator relationship matrix; e and e  are vectors of mutually uncorrelated random residual effects for the two traits   and   where I is an identity matrix and W is a diagonal matrix containing the r-inverse weights according to the reliability of the bulls' DEBV []  which are the same weights as used in the estimation of SNP effects; X and Z are known design matrices for fixed effects and random additive genetic effects  respectively. The purpose of fitting this model was to estimate the genetic correlation between the DGV and the trait ()  which is required to pool DGV and traditional EBV in national genetic evaluation []  the square of which represents the proportion of genetic variance accounted for by the genomic information if the DGV has a heritability of 1. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using the ASReml v3.0 software package []. Table  shows the number of individuals  the average inbreeding coefficients  and a within and between the K-means clustered groups. Figure  shows the density distribution of inbreeding coefficients for each of the five groups. Group 5  with 220 bulls  was characterized with high levels of inbreeding (about 10%) and represents animals from the Wye Angus herd formed from an importation of bulls from the British Isles and then closed to new germplasm in 1958 ()  along with two bulls from Dunlouise Angus ()  a Scottish herd of native origin Angus. Some bulls produced within the Wye herd have been used in artificial insemination within the national Angus herd  leading to nontrivial relationships of group 5 with the other groups. . Table  shows that a values within a group are much larger than the average of the a values of a group with the other four groups. The greatest difference between these a values was for group 5  which had the highest within group a (0.58) and the lowest a with the other groups (0.11). These values indicate that  on average  any animal in group 5 had some relative within the group with an additive relationship exceeding 0.5  the relationship of a non-inbred parent with offspring or with non-inbred full-sibs. In contrast  on average  any animal in group 5 had an additive relationship of less than 0.125 with its closest relative in the four other groups  less than the relationship of a non-inbred individual with its great-grandparent or between cousins. Figure  expands on the information in Table  by showing the density distribution of a of each individual in a particular group with all animals in the same or different groups. The a statistic has high densities within each group around 0.5  representing sire-son or full-sib relationships  and around 0.25  representing grandparent-offspring or half-sib relationships  but a low density in the equivalent regions between groups. Figure  shows that the K-means clustering partitioned individuals into related groups with decreased relationship between groups. These results also show that group 5 is a distinct group that is less related to the other groups. . The density distribution of the maximum additive genetic relationships (a) between each individual in a particular group and all animals in the same or different groups formed by K-means clustering The results from random clustering were markedly different from those from K-means clustering. With random clustering  there were no significant differences between the average within and between group a values  which ranged from 0.34 to 0.37 over the five randomly clustered replicates. Figure  shows the a density distribution for each individual in a particular group with all animals in the same or different groups for one of the randomly clustered groups. There were no significant differences in relationships between the groups. The a statistic has high densities around 0.25 and 0.5  both within and between groups  which indicates that most individuals within each group have at least one close relative in each of the other groups. . The density distribution of the maximum additive genetic relationships (a) between each individual in a particular group and all animals in the same or different groups when groups were formed at random The accuracies of DGV based on training in four groups partitioned by K-means clustering and predicting the other group for birth  weaning and yearling weights and averaged over all 16 traits are in Table . The results show considerable variation in accuracy between groups. Accuracies were lowest for group 5  which was less related to the other groups. Table  presents the pooled accuracy of DGV by K-means clustering and 5-fold cross-validation for all studied traits. Also  phenotypic and genetic variances ( and   respectively) used for standardization of the covariance and the regression of DEBV on DGV for each trait is shown in Table . Accuracies of DGV varied and ranged from 0.22 to 0.69  with an average of 0.44 over all traits. Among the post-natal growth traits  the accuracies of DGV for birth weight and yearling height were higher than for weaning and yearling weight. Accuracies of DGV for carcass traits were generally higher than for growth traits. Marbling and rib eye muscle area had the highest DGV accuracies among all the studied traits. Accuracies of DGV for reproductive and behavioral traits were considerably lower than for other traits. Docility and heifer pregnancy rate had the lowest DGV accuracies (less than 0.3) among all studied traits. Training was generally less accurate for traits with fewer animals with DEBV (Table  and Table ). Traits exhibiting the highest bias  having regressions of DEBV on DGV departing from 1  also exhibited less accuracy  regardless of the number of animals with DEBV. For example  rib eye muscle area and yearling height  which had the highest accuracy  exhibited little bias (deviations from 1 of 0.007 and 0.015  respectively)  while weaning weight and docility  which had low accuracies  had the most bias (0.403 and 0.386  respectively). In general  predictions tended to be biased downwards  as the average regression coefficient was 0.937 across all traits. Table  also presents the average regression coefficients and the pooled accuracy of DGV obtained by random clustering and 5-fold cross-validation in five replicates for all traits. The accuracies of these DGV were considerably higher for all traits than the corresponding accuracies obtained by K-means clustering. The average of DGV accuracies over all traits was 0.65  which is 0.21 higher than the average of DGV accuracies obtained by K-means clustering. The comparison of accuracies of DGV obtained by K-means or random clustering and cross-validation methods with the accuracies of DGV obtained from training on older animals and validating in younger animals is shown in Figure . The accuracies of DGV obtained from training on older animals and validating in younger animals were higher than the accuracies obtained from K-means clustering and cross-validation for all traits except calving ease maternal. However  these accuracies were lower than the accuracies of DGV obtained by random clustering and cross-validation for most traits. .

In general  the genomic prediction accuracies were similar to the PA accuracies for most traits. However  for all growth traits except mature weight and mature height  the accuracy of PA was slightly higher than the accuracy of DGV  while the accuracy of DGV exceeded that of PA for all carcass and some reproductive traits (calving ease direct and maternal). The accuracy of PA was higher than the accuracy of DGV for docility. The accuracy of the GEBV obtained from blending PA and DGV information did not substantially improve the genetic prediction over the more accurate source of information (PA or DGV) for any trait. Regression coefficients and the correlation between PA and DGV are shown in Table . As expected  regression coefficients of DEBV on DGV were greater than the regressions of DEBV on PA for traits for which the DGV was more accurate than PA and  . The regression coefficient for DGV ranged from 0.17 (for docility) to 1.20 (for carcass weight)  while regression coefficients for PA ranged from -0.19 (for carcass weight) to 0.82 (for docility). The correlation between DGV and PA ranged from 0.27 to 0.65  with an average of 0.48 across traits. .

The estimated variance and covariance for heifer pregnancy rate had high standard errors due to an inadequate number of training bulls and are not presented. Heritabilities of DGV for the remaining traits were more than 0.80 and the genetic correlations between trait and DGV ranged from 0.15 (for docility) to 0.80 (for carcass weight). Heritabilities of DGV less than one reflect genotyping errors (<0.5%)  effects of missing pedigree information and within-family selection on the estimation of the pedigree relationship matrix  and differences in the prediction equation between validation groups. Estimates of genetic correlations between the trait and DGV reflect the accuracies of DGV pooled across groups. The estimated heritabilities for traits using the bivariate animal model were lower than the corresponding heritabilities reported by AAA (Table ). The accuracy of DGV is critical to determine the utility of DGV in relation to genotyping costs. In simulation studies  the correlation between DGV and true breeding values (TBV) has been used to represent the accuracy of DGV. However  in field data  TBV are not available and the correlation between DGV and the response variable (phenotype records  EBV  DEBV  etc.) typically underestimate the accuracy of DGV due to the contribution of environmental effects and random error to the response variable. Habier et al. [] estimated marker effects using daughter yield deviations (DYD) of dairy bulls and divided the correlation between DGV and DYD by the average accuracy of the DYD to estimate the correlation between DGV and TBV. Su et al. [] used the average accuracy of EBV to adjust the simple correlation between DGV and EBV (the response variable). VanRaden et al. [] divided the GEBV accuracy by the mean accuracy of the DYD and then added the difference between the published and observed accuracy of PA to calculate the realized genomic accuracy. However  using the mean accuracy as an adjustment factor does not consider the heterogeneous error variance  which is associated with the DEBV of different bulls and this may lead to a bias. In this study  accuracy was obtained by standardizing the estimated covariance between DEBV and DGV using the genetic variance. Reports on the accuracy of DGV for beef cattle are scarce. Rolf et al. [] found low accuracies of about 0.3 for average daily feed intake  residual feed intake and average daily gain  when a genomic relationship matrix was used for 2405 genotyped Angus steers and sires. In dairy cattle  Harris et al. [] reported accuracies of DGV for young bulls with no daughter information ranging from 0.71 to 0.82 for milk production traits  live weight  fertility  somatic cell count and longevity  compared to an average accuracy of 0.58 for PA in a New Zealand Holstein population. In their study  accuracies of DGV for linear type traits were lower than for production traits and ranged from 0.63 to 0.71  compared to an average of 0.56 for PA for these traits. The average accuracy from combining DGV and PA for 27 traits in the North American Holstein population reported by VanRaden et al. [] was 0.71  compared to 0.52 from PA alone. Accuracies for GEBV combining DGV and national EBV for 12 Dutch Holstein traits ranged from 0.52 to 0.82  with an average of 0.71 []. Luan et al. [] reported accuracies of DGV for milk  fat and protein yields  first lactation mastitis and calving ease ranging from 0.12 to 0.62 using a small sample (500 genotyped bulls) of Norwegian Red cattle. Su et al. [] reported simple correlations between DGV and published EBV (as a response variable) ranging from 0.50 to 0.84  with an average of 0.65 and adjusted correlations ranging from 0.70 to 0.85  with an average of 0.74 for 18 traits in a Danish Holstein population. These authors also reported that simple and adjusted accuracies were 0.36 and 0.51 higher than the accuracies of PA. Hayes et al. [] reported accuracies of DGV ranging from 0.37 to 0.74 for five simple and index traits in Australian Holstein cattle. In general  however  it is difficult to compare the accuracies from different studies because of differences in trait heritabilities  data types (phenotypes  EPD  DYD or DEBV)  training and validation set sizes  validation methods (set definition) and statistical methods to estimate marker effects. In general  the DGV accuracies obtained here by K-means clustering and 5-fold cross-validation were lower than reported for dairy cattle for traits with similar heritabilities. For example  Su et al. [] used 5-fold cross-validation in a genotyped group of 3330 bulls (almost the same size as this study) and reported modified accuracies of 0.71 and 0.72 for birth index and calving index traits. Accuracies obtained for similar traits (birth weight and calving ease direct) in our study were 0.55 and 0.49  respectively. The main reason for the lower accuracies observed in our study is the validation method  where we deliberately tried to minimize the relationship between members of the training and validation sets by K-means clustering. Habier et al. [] showed that DGV use realized genetic relationships among individuals to increase the accuracy of DGV (i.e.  the accuracy of a DGV on a selection candidate decreases as the average genetic relationship to the training set individuals decreases). Thus  the accuracies of DGV obtained by random clustering or from training in older animals and prediction in younger animals (which can generate larger genetic relationships between members of the training and validation sets) are higher than accuracies of DGV obtained by K-means clustering. Another reason for the lower accuracies obtained in our study is that the accuracy of genotyped bulls EBV (used to derive the DEBV response variable) is lower in beef than in dairy cattle because artificial insemination is less used []. The average accuracy of EBV for the genotyped bulls across traits was only 0.77 in this study but 0.89 in the study by Su et al. []. The accuracy of DGV will increase as the accuracy of EBV increases because the response variable will be closer to the true breeding value. Another reason for the lower accuracies in comparison to those from dairy cattle studies could be the different extents and patterns of LD  which exist among breeds due to differing population histories and effective population sizes (N). De Roos et al. [] found that  for distances between 100 kb (kilobase) and 1 Mb (Megabase)  Dutch Holstein-Friesian (HF) had the highest LD  followed by Dutch Red and White HF  then Australian Angus and New Zealand Jersey  and finally Australian HF and New Zealand HF  demonstrating that the extent of LD differs between subpopulations within a breed such as HF. The subpopulations have different historical backgrounds and effective population sizes. Prasad et al. [] showed that there are regions of high and low LD across the chromosomes in both the Angus and Holstein breeds and a clear difference was observed in the pattern of LD between the two breeds. A difference in the extent of LD over different chromosomes has also been reported by McKay et al. [] in Angus and other breeds. Another reason for the lower accuracies of DGV observed in this study could be due to different N between breeds. Goddard and Hayes [] showed that more animals are needed for training to obtain the same accuracy with increasing effective population size. De Roos et al. [] estimated an effective population size of about 100 for Dutch black-and-white Holstein-Friesian bulls  Dutch red-and-white Holstein-Friesian bulls  Australian Holstein-Friesian bulls  Australian Angus animals  New Zealand Friesian cows  and New Zealand Jersey cows. An effective population size less than 100 was estimated for the North American Holstein population by Kim and Kirkpatrick []; N = 103 for German Holstein cattle by Qanbari et al. []; and N = 49  53 and 47 for Danish Holstein  Danish Jersey and Danish Red cattle by Sorensen et al. []. Marquez et al. [] reported a high effective population size (N = 445) for American Red Angus beef cattle  whereas a relatively low effective population size (N = 85) was estimated for American Hereford beef cattle by Cleveland et al. []. We estimated a high effective population size N = 654 ± 31 for American Angus beef cattle (data not shown)  which is much higher than that found for North American Holstein and American Hereford beef cattle. DGV were generally less accurate for traits that had fewer animals with DEBV. The importance of training population size on the accuracies of DGV has been shown in several studies [  ]. Although training population size and the accuracy of DEBV have a large effect on the accuracy of DGV  the accuracy also depends on other factors such as the genetic architecture of the trait (assumptions about ) and the LD between markers and with genes that affect the trait  which could differ between traits. Hayes et al. [] showed that the accuracy of genomic predictions is higher for traits with some loci having large effects than for traits with no loci of large effect. The difference in the accuracy of DGV between low and high heritability traits was relatively small. In most studies using simulated data  the phenotype of genotyped individuals is used to estimate marker effects and in this case heritability has been shown to affect the accuracy of genomic prediction [  ]. In this study  we used DEBV to estimate marker effects and DGV. Using DEBV as the response variable is expected to make the DGV accuracy less dependent on heritability and more a function of the EBV accuracy. Here  EBV were predicted from a fairly large dataset  resulting in relatively high accuracies even for traits with a low heritability. Low heritability traits such as fitness traits have been largely ignored in livestock breeding due both to their low heritability and difficulty in recording. However  bulls can have a high accuracy for a low heritability trait if they have sufficient progeny. Thus  these traits could be included in genomic selection programs if suitable training sets could be formed. Comparing the DGV accuracies obtained from K-means clustering and cross-validation to those for PA indicated that the accuracies were similar for most traits. The superiority of DGV accuracies over PA accuracies for carcass traits could be due to the lower accuracy of parental EBV for these traits  which are measured in limited numbers of progeny of these parents at slaughter. The PA accuracies obtained in this study were higher than those reported in other studies [  ] primarily because the available PA information in our dataset does not represent that available on the parents of the genotyped bulls at the time of their birth. The deregression method used here only excluded information for the genotyped bull from the cumulative information available on his parents and did not exclude information from other relatives  including grand-progeny  which are informative for the meioses that produced the bull being deregressed and the majority of the genotyped bulls belonged to large patrilineages. VanRaden et al. [] showed that combined predictions (PA and genomic predictions) were more accurate than PA (0.22 to 0.62 greater with nonlinear genomic predictions) in North American Holstein bulls. In this study  the accuracy of GEBV obtained by combining DGV and PA information did not increase the accuracy for most traits  suggesting that the PA may not be fully independent of the Mendelian sampling effect that produced the bull for which deregression was performed. The gain from combining DGV with PA depends on the accuracy of DGV and PA and the correlation between them. Less gain in accuracy is expected from combined values if the two information sources are highly correlated. In this study  the accuracies of PA were higher than those available at the time of an animal's birth because the older animals in this population were all ancestors of the younger animals. Thus  in practice  the accuracies of PA on young selection candidates would be lower than found here because the PA would not contain information on grand-progeny and more gain could be expected from combining DGV with PA information. In addition  if the animal's own record is available before the selection decision  we have the advantage of that record in addition to PA. In this situation  less gain could be expected from combining DGV with an animal model EBV that included the individual record. However  in beef cattle  the only observation we typically have on a young bull before it is selected (at castration) is birth weight. Estimates of variance and covariance components between traits and their respective DGV indicated that heritabilities of the DGV were greater than 0.80 but less than the expected value of 1  when DGV were obtained by K-means clustering and cross-validation (Table ). The estimated heritabilities for DGV were higher (greater than 0.99) when DGV were obtained by random clustering and cross-validation (data not shown). Heritabilities less than 1 for the DGV obtained by K-means clustering and cross-validation show that the estimated marker effects were not consistent between training sets due to the differences in relatedness between the training and validation groups when five separate models were used to estimate the DGV of animals in each group. However  essentially the same extent of pedigree relatedness is expected when groups are constructed randomly (i.e.  groups do not represent subpopulations) which leads to the heritability of DGV being close to 1. The estimated correlations between trait and respective DGV were higher than those reported by MacNeil et al. [] for the same traits in Angus cattle  because they used a 384 SNP subset derived from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip to obtain DGV and validated in a single group (correlations of 0.68  0.73  and 0.80 in comparison to 0.50  0.65 and 0.54 for fat thickness  marbling and carcass weight  respectively  Table ). Estimates of heritability for traits using the bivariate animal model were lower than the corresponding heritabilities reported by AAA or obtained by the weighted univariate animal model using DEBV (results not shown). This could be due to the dependency between DEBV and DGV when the DGV of animals in one group were predicted from the DEBV of animals in the four other groups. Although five separate models were used to predict DGV  the DGV of individuals in one group are linear combination of the DEBV of individuals in the other groups which makes the covariance matrix between DEBV and DGV close to singular in the bivariate animal model analysis. More studies are needed to overcome this problem. We used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the accuracy of DGV. The advantage of multi-fold cross-validation is that it can retain large training and validation sets. However  in contrast to most previous studies  we used K-means clustering to minimize the genetic relationships between groups. The distribution of a (maximum additive-genetic relationship) for individuals within each group indicated that a has a high density around 0.5 (sire-son relationships) and 0.25 (half-sib relationships) but a low density between groups. The distribution of inbreeding coefficients within each group revealed that the Wye population and its descendants (group 5) was distinct from the other groups  with an average inbreeding coefficient of about 0.10 due to the closing of the herd 10 generations ago and this group had low average relationships to the other groups. Accuracies of DGV were generally lower for this group  although it had a larger training set size. When validation was performed on the younger animals or in groups obtained by random clustering  the accuracies of DGV were much higher than when cross-validation was performed in the K-means defined groups because of the higher genetic relationships between the training and validation set individuals. The lower accuracy of DGV for maternal calving ease in the younger animals is likely the result of low accuracies of EBV (and DEBV) in the younger animals  as these young bulls have few if any daughters of sufficient age to produce calving ease information. The higher accuracy of DGV with random clustering over validation on younger animals is caused by the higher genetic relationships between the training and validation sets within the randomly formed groups. These results demonstrate that validation is sensitive to the choice of the validation sample and to the pedigree relationships between the animals contributing to the validation and training sets  and the accuracies of DGV are dependent on the strength of genetic relationships between the training and validation sets. Thus  on the one hand  a dynamic training population will maintain an approximately constant average genetic relationship between animals in the training set and younger animals available for selection  leading to the largest possible DGV accuracies. On the other hand  future selection candidates  which do not have close relatives in the training set  will have DGV with reduced accuracies. However  we anticipate that there will be greater LD between markers and QTL and thus less dependency of the accuracies of DGV on the genetic relationships between training and validation sets when the recently released Illumina BovineHD and Affymetrix BOS 1 panels are employed for genomic selection. This study applied genomic prediction to US Angus beef cattle. By minimizing the relationships between training and validation groups using K-means clustering  the accuracy of DGV ranged from 0.22 to 0.69  with an average 0.44 across 16 economically important traits. Accuracies ranged from 0.38 to 0.85 with an average of 0.65 when training and validation sets were created by random allocation. Estimates of genetic correlations between traits and their respective DGV (obtained by K-means clustering) ranged from 0.15 to 0.80. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing DGV for Angus beef cattle and show that the accuracy of predictions will deteriorate as the relationship between animals in the training set and selection candidates decreases. This suggests that  when using the BovineSNP50 BeadChip in the American Angus beef cattle population  a dynamic training set will be required to maximize the accuracy of selection in young animals and that the accuracy of DGV for animals in a population will be improved by including their sires in the training set.

Penalized maximum likelihood estimation provides the means to 'make the most' of limited and precious data and facilitates more stable estimation for multi-dimensional analyses. It should become part of our everyday toolkit for multivariate estimation in quantitative genetics. Estimation of genetic parameters  i.e. the partitioning of phenotypic variation into (co)variances due to genetic effects and other sources  is one of the basic tasks in quantitative genetics. Increasingly  livestock improvement schemes consider a multitude of traits. In turn  this requires complex  multivariate analyses that consider more than just a few traits simultaneously. Advances in modelling  improvements in computational algorithms and of corresponding software  paired with the capabilities of modern computer hardware have brought us to a point where large-scale analyses comprising numerous traits and records on tens of thousands of individuals are feasible. For example  Tyrisevä et al. [] recently presented multivariate analyses for 25 traits  more than 100 000 sires and up to 325 parameters to be estimated. However  comparatively little attention has been paid to the problems associated with sampling variation that are inherent in multivariate analyses  which increase dramatically with the number of traits and the number of parameters to be estimated. It has long been known that the eigenvalues of estimated covariance matrices are over-dispersed  i.e. that the largest sample eigenvalues are systematically biased upwards and the smallest values are biased downwards  while their mean is expected to be unbiased []. Moreover  a large proportion of the sampling variances of estimates of individual covariances can be attributed to this excess dispersion []. This is the more pronounced the larger the matrix  the smaller the data set and the more similar the population eigenvalues are. Hill and Thompson [] demonstrated how this affected estimates of genetic covariance matrices and that it resulted in high probabilities of obtaining non-positive definite estimates. While maximum likelihood (ML) based methods of estimation make efficient use of all the data and readily allow estimates of covariance matrices to be constrained to the parameter space []  the problems of sampling variation remain. Even multivariate analyses based on relatively large data sets are thus likely to yield imprecise estimates. Furthermore  we have scenarios where the numbers of records are invariably limited. This includes data for new traits or traits which are 'hard to measure'  e.g. carcass characteristics of meat producing animals. Similarly  evolutionary biologists concerned with quantitative genetics of natural populations are usually restricted to rather small samples. Hence  any avenue to 'improve' estimates  i.e. to obtain estimates which are on average closer to the population values  should be given serious consideration. To begin with  we have accumulated a substantial body of knowledge about genetic parameters for various traits. However  typically this is not used. While the Bayesian paradigm directly provides the means to incorporate such prior information  applications in estimating covariance components often assume flat or uninformative priors []  i.e. do not fully exploit its advantages. Secondly  multivariate covariance matrices can often be modelled parsimoniously by imposing some structure. This decreases sampling variation by reducing the number of parameters to be estimated. Common examples are factor-analytic and reduced rank models or treating covariance matrices as 'separable'  i.e. as the direct product of two or more smaller matrices (see Meyer [] for a detailed review). Finally  statistical techniques are available - often referred to as regularization methods - which substantially reduce sampling variance  albeit at the expense of introducing some bias  and thus yield 'better' estimates. Interest in regularized estimation for multivariate analyses and the trade-off between sampling variance and bias dates back to the 1970's and earlier  stimulated in particular by the work of Stein  e.g. [  ]. Recently  applications involving estimation in very high-dimensional settings have attracted resurgent attention  in particular for genomic data  e.g. []. However  there has been little interest in regularized estimation in estimating genetic parameters. An early proposal  due to Hayes and Hill []  was to shrink the canonical eigenvalues in a one-way analysis of variance towards their mean and thus to reduce sampling variation. This yielded an estimate of the genetic covariance matrix that was a weighted combination of the standard (i.e. not regularized) estimate and the phenotypic covariance matrix multiplied by the mean eigenvalue. The authors thus described their method as 'bending' the genetic towards the phenotypic covariance matrix. A simulation study demonstrated that 'bending' could substantially increase the achieved response to selection based on an index derived using the modified estimates []. However  'bending' has found little application except to force covariance matrices obtained by pooling estimates from multiple sources to be positive definite. Recently  Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] proposed to employ penalized restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate genetic covariance matrices  and showed that imposing a penalty proportional to the variance among the canonical eigenvalues acted analogously to 'bending'. They demonstrated by simulation that this greatly reduced sampling and mean square errors  and  moreover  that this held for animal model analyses with a complicated pedigree structure and many different types of covariances between relatives. This paper extends the approach of Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] to different types of penalties and  based on an extensive simulation study  examines various strategies to determine the amount of penalization to be applied. The quality of a statistical estimator is generally quantified by some measure of the difference between the estimator and the true value  or . A well known quantity is the mean square error which is a quadratic loss  comprised of the sampling variance and the square of the bias in the estimator. We talk about improving an estimator when we are able to modify it in some way so that it has reduced loss  i.e. is closer to the true value. Usually this involves a trade-off between a reduction in sampling variance and additional bias. For covariance matrices  commonly employed measures of divergence are the entropy () and quadratic () loss []: where  and  denote a covariance matrix of size  ×  and its estimator  respectively  and  represents the number of traits. A reduction in loss can often be achieved by regularizing estimators. In broad terms   describes a scenario where estimation for somewhat ill-posed or overparameterized problems is improved through use of some form of additional information. Frequently the latter involves a penalty for the deviation from a desired outcome. For example  in modelling curves using splines a 'roughness penalty' is employed to place preference on simple  smooth functions []. Well known forms of regularization are ridge regression [] and the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) []. Whilst these methods were originally developed to encourage shrinkage of regression coefficients  corresponding applications for the estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices have been described; see Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] for a review and references. In Bayesian estimation  some degree of regularization is 'built in' through the specification of a prior and the associated degree of uncertainty. In a ML framework  either 'full' ML or REML  prior information can be incorporated by penalizing the likelihood. A general way to select a penalty is to specify a prior distribution for the parameters to be estimated for a suitable choice of parameterisation. The penalty is then obtained as minus the logarithmic value of the density of the prior  and a so-called tuning factor determines the relative emphasis to be given to the data and the penalty. In the following  we consider penalized REML estimation for two categories of penalties: those which are a function of the canonical eigenvalues and those which act on a complete covariance or correlation matrix. Consider a simple 'animal model' for  traits   =  +  +  with      and  the vectors of observations  fixed effects  additive genetic and residual effects  respectively  and  and  the corresponding incidence matrices. Let  and  denote the matrices of additive genetic and residual covariances among the  traits. This gives a vector of parameters to be estimated   of length ( + 1)  comprising the distinct elements of  and  . Furthermore  let Var () =   =   where  is the numerator relationship matrix between individuals  and   where 'S' is the direct matrix sum.  is a function of    e.g. for single records per trait it is the sub-matrix of  corresponding to the traits recorded for the -th individual. The phenotypic covariance matrix of the vector of observations is then Var () = ' +  =   and the pertaining REML log likelihood is  apart from a constant  where  is a full-rank submatrix of   e.g. []. Regularized estimates can be obtained by maximizing the  likelihood where the penalty  is a selected function of the parameters  aimed at reducing loss in their estimates  and  is a tuning factor which specifies the relative emphasis to be given to the penalty compared to the unpenalized estimator. For  = 0  this simplifies to the standard  unpenalized likelihood. The factor of 1/2 in (Eq. 3) is for algebraic consistency and could be omitted. Recognition of the systematic bias in the eigenvalues of estimates of covariance matrices has led to the development of various estimators  which modify the eigenvalues whilst retaining the corresponding eigenvectors. As the mean eigenvalue is expected to be unbiased  a specific proposal has been to regress eigenvalues towards their mean to reduce their excessive spread. Hayes and Hill [] proposed to apply this type of shrinkage to the canonical eigenvalues ( )  i.e. the eigenvalues of  with  =  +  the phenotypic covariance matrix. The equivalent to such 'bending' in a (RE)ML framework is obtained by placing a penalty proportional to the variance among the canonical eigenvalues on the likelihood []: for  = Diag { }. The canonical decomposition gives  = ' and  = ( )'  with  an identity matrix and  the matrix of eigenvectors of  scaled by a matrix square root of  . Hence   penalizes both  and  at the same time. Thus  while the motivation for 'bending' appears somewhat   the same penalty can be derived assuming the canonical eigenvalues have a Normal prior []. Penalizing eigenvalues transformed to logarithmic scale  i.e. defining  = Diag{log( )}  yields a related penalty   similar to the log eigenvalue posterior mean shrinkage estimator suggested by Daniels and Kass []. While quadratic penalties on (1 -  ) and  are equivalent  this does not hold on the log scale. Hence  for  = Diag{log( )} and  = Diag{log(1 -  )} (with  a third penalty is For  positive semi-definite  the canonical eigenvalues lie in the interval [0 1]. Hence a natural alternative to a normal prior is the beta distribution  which is usually defined on this domain and is thus frequently used as prior for binomial proportions in a Bayesian setting. It has two shape parameters   > 0 and  > 0  and probability density function with G(·) denoting the gamma function  and mean /( + ). Hence  for  =   () is symmetric with the mean at 0.5. For  > 1 and  > 1  it is uni-modal with probability mass increasingly concentrated at the mean as  and  increase. A restricted domain [  ] (with  and  the lower and upper limits for ) can be taken into account by fitting a four parameter beta function [] or by replacing  in (Eq. 6) with  = ()/( - ). The distribution of estimates of the canonical eigenvalues clearly depends on the population parameters and may well not cover the whole interval [0 1]. As we expect standard estimates of eigenvalues to be over-dispersed  a suitable  if somewhat inflated  estimate of the range may be given by the estimates of the extreme values from an unpenalized analysis (i.e.  = 0)  denoted henceforth by a superscript of 0. Assuming eigenvalues are numbered in descending order of magnitude  this gives  and penalty A suitable choice for the shape parameters might be  =  = 2  3 ...  i.e. a symmetric distribution for  with probability mass somewhat more spread out than a normal distribution. Alternatively   and  can be estimated from estimates . Using the fact that the mean and variance of the standard beta distribution are ( + ) and ( + )( +  + 1)  results in the method of moment estimators  and   with  and  the mean of the []. This may result in estimates of  and  less than unity  implying probability distributions that are U- or J-shaped with a high mass at the extremes. To ensure a uni-modal beta distribution  we add a constant  ( = 0). This gives penalty Penalties considered so far implied that estimated eigenvalues were samples from a distribution with a common mean . However  while quadratic penalties on eigenvalues or eigenvalues transformed to logarithmic scale have been found to be highly effective when the corresponding population values are similar  they resulted in substantial over-shrinkage when population values were spread apart [    ]. Hence  if population eigenvalues are markedly different  it may be advantageous to shrink towards individual targets. Ordering variables according to size introduces a specific distribution. The -th order statistic of a -variate sample is the -th smallest value. Assuming a uniform distribution  the order statistics on the unit interval have marginal beta distributions with scale parameters  and  -  + 1. Treating values  as independent order statistics gives the penalty Again  we allow for a modifying constant  in (Eq. 9). For the distribution of order statistics   = 0. A value of  > 0 causes individual distributions to be 'squashed' together  i.e. yields a compromise between the assumption of a common mean for the  and that of an even distribution over the unit interval. Motivated by the historical emphasis on the role of sample eigenvalues of covariance matrices  we have concentrated on penalties on these characteristics so far. A conceptually simpler alternative is to consider the covariance matrix as a whole and its prior distribution. A standard assumption in Bayesian estimation of covariance matrices is that of an inverse Wishart prior distribution  because  for observations with a multivariate normal distribution  this is a conjugate prior. It has the probability density function  e.g. []  with  denoting the scale parameter and  the degree of belief we assign to the prior. Omitting terms not depending on  or  and taking logarithms gives ( +  + 1) log || +  tr( O). Corresponding to the penalties that 'borrow strength' from the phenotypic covariance matrix considered above  a penalty which regularizes the estimate of  by shrinking it towards  can be obtained by using  as a scale matrix. Adopting an empirical Bayes approach  we substitute the estimate from an unpenalized REML analysis    in place of []. Further  replacing  with the tuning factor   then gives a penalty with  = ( +  + 1)/. If  is approximated with unity   is proportional to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between  and   which is the entropy loss (·) with  and  exchanged []. The relationship between  and  can be seen by rewriting (Eq. 10) in terms of the canonical decomposition  which gives . Assuming that   i.e. that the estimate of the transformation and of the phenotypic covariance matrix are largely unaffected by penalized estimation  gives . This shows that  implies a substantial penalty on the smallest canonical eigenvalues. We can also penalize both  and  simultaneously using weighted by either a joint ( =  ) or separate tuning factors. Based on empirical evidence that estimates of genetic ( ) and phenotypic ( ) correlations are often similar  Cheverud [] proposed to substitute  for  if the data did not support accurate estimation of  . Adopting this suggestion  Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] demonstrated that estimating  and  or  under the assumption of a joint correlation structure resulted in highly parsimonious models and a dramatic reduction in mean square errors when the underlying assumptions were approximately true. Conversely  estimates could be substantially biased if they were not. A more flexible alternative is to penalize the divergence between estimates of the genetic ( ) and phenotypic correlation ( ) matrix  i.e. to shrink the estimate of  towards . Analogous to (Eq. 10)  this can be achieved by using a penalty or More generally  such penalty on the complete matrix can be used to shrink an estimated covariance (or correlation) matrix towards any chosen structure. This allows for a data-driven compromise between the assumed structure and an unstructured matrix. For instance  Chen [] presented an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate a covariance matrix by shrinking towards a prior that was assumed to have a factor-analytic or compound symmetric structure. More recently  Schäfer and Strimmer [] considered shrinkage towards a number of target matrices with diagonal structure or constant correlations. Within our penalized (RE)ML framework  this can be achieved by substituting the structured matrix for the scale matrix  in (Eq. 10). This may be a suitable matrix chosen  or  in an empirical vein  an unpenalized estimate obtained from the data  imposing the structure selected. Data for a simple paternal half-sib design comprising  unrelated sires with  = 10 progeny each were simulated by sampling from appropriate multivariate normal distributions for  = 5 and  = 9 traits. Sample sizes considered were  = 50  100  150  200  300  400  600 and 1000. A total of 90 sets of population parameters  60 for  = 5 and 30 for  = 9 traits were examined. Population parameters for  = 5 were obtained by combining 12 sets of heritabilities (A to L) with five scenarios for genetic ( ) and residual ( ) correlations and phenotypic variances  named  to V. This resulted in 60 combinations  labelled A- to L- in the following. Similarly  10 sets of heritabilities (M to V) for  = 9 traits were combined with correlation scenarios    and  to yield combinations M- to V-. Heritabilities were chosen so that the mean was 0.4 (A to G and M to Q)  0.3 (H) or 0.2 (I to L and S to V)  with values declining with an increasing trait number. There were different degrees of spread in heritabilities  ranging from equal values for all traits (A  I  M and R) to sets of values which spanned a length interval of 0.80 (E  H  and O) and sets with a very uneven distribution of heritabilities (G  H  L  U and V). Sets of population values for the correlations that were used were  =  = 0   = 0.8 and  = 0   = 0.6and  = -0.4+ 0.5   = -0.8+ 0.02 and  = -0.4+ 0.5   = -1  0.05 + 0.5 and  = -1  0.1 + 0.2   = 0.7and  = -1  0.05 + 0.2  and  = -0.8+ 0.02 and  = -0.2+ 0.5  for correlation scenarios  to   respectively. Population phenotypic variances were  for    for    and  for    and   and  and  for  and . This yielded coefficients of variation among the corresponding canonical eigenvalues ranging from 0 to 175%. A total of 1000 replicates per case and sample size were sampled. REML estimates of  and  for each sample were obtained for different penalties and tuning factors by using a method of scoring algorithm to locate the maximum of log  or log   followed by simple derivative-free search steps to ensure that convergence had been reached. This was done using a parameterisation to the elements of the canonical decomposition   and    as described by Meyer and Kirkpatrick []  restraining estimates of  to the interval of [0.0001  0.9999]. A total of 10 penalties were examined  six penalties on the canonical eigenvalues   for  for  = 1 and  for  = 1  and four penalties on matrices   and   as described above. All employed a single tuning factor. In addition  two different tuning factor to the parts of penalties  and  that corresponded to genetic and residual components were employed. To determine the tuning factor () for each analysis  estimates of  and    denoted as  and   were obtained for a range of possible values for . A total of 311 values were used  comprising values of 0 to 2 in steps of 0.1  2.2 to 5 in steps of 0.2  5.5 to 10 in steps of 0.5  11 to 100 in steps of 1  102 to 250 in steps of 2  255 to 500 in steps of 5 and 510 to 1000 in steps of 10. The 'best' value was then chosen using three different approaches. First  as in previous work []  knowledge of the population parameters was used. For each  and estimates  and   the corresponding  log likelihood was calculated as with  and . This requires validation 'data' which  for a paternal half-sib design  can be summarized as the matrices of mean squares and cross-products between ( ) and within ( ) sires  as from an analysis of variance. For strategy V1   and  were obtained by sampling one additional data set from the same distribution as the data used in the analysis. For strategy V8   and  were constructed from the population parameters. This is equivalent to sampling an infinite number of additional data sets  hence the notation V8. For both strategies  the value of  which maximised  was then chosen as the appropriate tuning factor. Secondly  -fold cross-validation (CV) was used to estimate  using only the data available. For this  data were split into  folds of approximately equal size by sequentially assigning complete sire families to subsets. For  = 1    the -th subset was set aside for validation  while all the remaining -1 subsets were used to obtain estimates  and  for all values of  considered. Corresponding values for the unpenalized likelihood   (Eq. 14)  in the validation data were then obtained and accumulated across folds. Finally   was chosen as the value for which the average likelihood    was maximized. Values of  = 3 and 5 were considered  with the corresponding strategies denoted as CV3 and CV5 in the following. The third approach used simply involved choosing  as the largest value of  for which the reduction in the unpenalized likelihood due to penalization from the maximum at   did not exceed a selected value. The limit chosen was the  value  employed in a likelihood ratio test of a single parameter with error probability   1.92 for  = 0.05. This will be referred to as strategy L5%. As suggested by Lin and Perlman []  the effect of penalized estimation was evaluated as the percentage reduction in average loss (PRIAL) due to penalization  where  is the standard  unpenalized REML estimate of  and  the penalized estimate  for  =    and   and  denotes the entropy loss (see (Eq. 1))  averaged over replicates. In addition  the absolute and relative bias (in %) for parameter  were calculated as  and 100   respectively. Mean PRIAL values across all cases for individual covariance matrices and all penalties considered are summarized in Table  for a sample size of  = 100. Using known population values (strategy V8)  achieved reductions in average loss in estimates of  were substantial  ranging from about 60% to more than 72%. The main exception was  (which penalized the canonical eigenvalues rather than their logarithmic values)  for which PRIALs for  were substantially higher than for  . On average PRIAL values were somewhat smaller for  = 9 than  = 5 traits because cases for  = 9 comprised more unfavourable scenarios  i.e. population values with a large and uneven spread of the canonical eigenvalues. As reported earlier []  taking logarithms of the canonical eigenvalues  greatly improved the efficacy of a penalty proportional to their squared deviations from the mean. Because canonical eigenvalues are a function of both  and    all penalties on  yielded marked improvements in estimates of  as well as  . Considering log(1 -  ) in addition to log( ) ( and all ) increased PRIALs for  further without affecting estimates of  detrimentally. Among the penalties based on the beta distribution  those that estimated the scale parameters  performed best. With different underlying assumptions  the similarity of results for   the penalty based on order statistics  and results for penalties that assumed a common mean of all  was somewhat surprising. Whilst achieving comparable PRIAL on    penalizing the difference between genetic and phenotypic covariance or correlation matrices behaved different to penalties on canonical eigenvalues (Table ). As to be expected  considering  only  yielded only small improvements in estimates of  . Adding a corresponding penalty on the residual covariances  increased PRIAL for  to levels comparable to those obtained when penalizing canonical eigenvalues  again without reducing the mean PRIAL for  notably. For  = 9 traits  there was an unexpected but substantial difference between imposing penalties on the covariance versus the correlation matrix. Penalizing both genetic and residual correlations increased the PRIAL for  by 2% (). In contrast  corresponding differences for  = 5 were considerably smaller. It is not clear how much this was an effect of the dimension or due to differences in population values. Allowing for different tuning factors for parts of the penalty that correspond to genetic and residual effects increased the PRIAL for  for  = 5 from 72.9 to 73.7% for   from 70.0 to 72.7% for  and from 72.2 to 74.3% for   i.e. by less than 3%. Corresponding PRIAL for  were 65.6%   64.9%  and 62.7%  i.e. increased by more than 10% for . While non-negligible  the gains for estimates of  were deemed too small to off-set the dramatically increased computational requirements that arose from the two-dimensional search for the optimal tuning factors  and was not given further consideration. Mean PRIAL values discussed so far concealed a considerable range and variation in the ranking of penalties for individual cases. This is illustrated in Figure   which shows the PRIAL for  for  = 9 traits  with individual cases in declining order of the PRIAL obtained using . For strategy V8  penalties on canonical eigenvalues that assumed a common mean performed best when populations values for the  were fairly similar  e.g. for R- and M- all population values were equal. For  = 9  there was little difference in PRIAL for  between penalties that assumed a normal distribution on the logarithmic scale ( and ) or a beta distribution with estimated scale parameters   although some tendency for  to yield slightly higher values for cases where penalized estimation worked least well was evident. Conversely  penalties derived assuming an inverse Wishart matrix prior mostly yielded larger PRIAL for the other cases  in particular when penalizing the difference between genetic and phenotypic correlations. For  = 5  penalties  and  performed best for 35% of the individual cases considered  mainly those for which PRIAL for  were less than average  while  and  yielded the highest values for 37% of cases. For  = 9   yielded the highest PRIAL for 80% of cases - mostly due to population canonical eigenvalues having a substantial spread for the majority of these cases. . Data for  = 9 traits  determining tuning factors on the basis of population values (V8) and by limiting the change in likelihood (L5%);    ¦   <U+25B2>  and    see text of acronyms A crucial part of penalized estimation is the estimation of the appropriate tuning factor to be used. Mean PRIAL values for  for different strategies to determine  are summarized in Table  for selected penalties   = 5 traits and  = 100 sires  together with the average proportion of replicates for which penalization increased rather than decreased the loss in  . Corresponding PRIAL values for all penalties for strategies V8  CV3 and L5% are given in Table . Clearly  mean values well above 70% when using the population values (V8) present an overly optimistic view of the efficacy of penalized estimation. Considering only one additional sample for validation (strategy V1) introduced considerable sampling error and thus reduced PRIAL achieved by about 10%. Examining regularized estimation of a single covariance matrix  Rothman et al. [] reported that strategy V1 yielded similar results to CV. However  in our case  mean PRIAL values using CV to determine  were consistently lower  i.e. suffered from additional noise (Table ). Somewhat surprisingly  PRIAL tended to decrease with the number of folds considered  . This was accompanied by increasing variability of results for individual cases. Clearly  there was a trade-off between the sizes of the training and validation sets. One might expect that a smaller training set (low ) would yield a  that was too high  as it pertained to the sample size of the subset  while a larger number of folds (high ) might off-set potential inabilities to ascertain optimal values for  due to the limited size of the validation set. However  results for CV5 were consistently worse than for CV3. Additional analyses for  = 10 (not shown) yielded even lower PRIAL than CV5. Inspection of the mean tuning factors  did reveal a trend for  to decline with increasing . For penalties  and   values for  from CV were substantially higher than for strategy V8  suggesting that lower PRIALs from CV were due to over-penalization. For  and   results were less consistent: for these penalties  determined using V8 tended to be very high for cases with little spread in the population    while corresponding values using CV tended to be substantially lower  so that the average    from strategies V8  CV3 and CV5 were similar. CV also reduced differences between penalties. Interestingly  penalty  appeared least affected by the 'noise' introduced by estimating . For strategy CV3   yielded the highest PRIAL in  for 35% of the individual cases ( = 5 and  = 100)  compared to 2% for strategy V8. Difficulties in deriving the optimal 'bending' factor theoretically  led Hayes and Hill [] to suggest a choice based on sample size. An alternative in a likelihood framework is to select the tuning factor so that the corresponding reduction in the unpenalized likelihood does not exceed a given limit. When carrying out a likelihood ratio test for the difference between estimates from different models  minus twice the difference in log likelihood is contrasted to a value of the  distribution corresponding to the number of parameters tested and an error probability . The smallest number of parameters which can be tested is  = 1. Hence  choosing  as the largest value for which the resulting change in log  (sign ignored) does not exceed  for one degree of freedom will result in a statistically non-significant change in estimates. While it may not yield the optimal amount of regularization  it allows for selection of a mild degree of penalization without having to justify significant changes in parameter estimates. In addition  computational requirements for such a strategy are considerably less than for CV. As shown in Table  and Table   determining  in this way yielded substantially improved estimates of    with PRIAL consistently higher than for CV. Values for the average tuning factor  (not shown) were markedly and consistently lower than those for V8  indicating that this approach indeed resulted in under-penalization. This held especially for cases with similar population canonical eigenvalues (E-  H-  I-  M- and R-). As illustrated in Figure   choosing  using this strategy also blurred differences between penalties. In a number of cases  in particular for  = 9 traits  PRIAL for  from strategy L5% were higher than those from V8. The effect of sample size on the efficacy of regularized estimation is illustrated in Figure  for  = 5. Clearly  penalization was most advantageous for small samples  with mean PRIAL for  decreasing substantially as the number of sire families increased. There were marked differences between penalties and strategies to determine   especially in the rate of decline of PRIAL with increasing . This rate was least for penalty  and  moreover  choosing tuning factors on the basis of the change in log  performed almost as well as exploiting knowledge of the population values. Using  resulted in the highest PRIAL for both  and  for all sample sizes  when using the change in log  to estimate . . Data for  = 5 traits;  using population values (V8)  ¦ limiting the change in likelihood (L5%) and  using cross-validation (CV3) to determine the tuning factors As noted above  PRIAL in  when using CV to determine the tuning factor were substantially less than for the other strategies. This difference tended to increase with sample size. Whilst consistently performing worst for strategy V8  the penalty on  derived from the distribution of order statistics  resulted in the highest PRIAL in  for strategy CV3. It is not clear what this comparatively larger robustness against noise in estimates of  can be attributed to. The decline in PRIAL with sample size was clearly a function of the number of traits considered  with reductions for  = 9 markedly smaller. For instance  for  and strategy L5% the average PRIAL in  declined from 69.4% for  = 100 to 64.1% for  = 400 and 60.2% for  = 1000. Respective values for  were 67.7%  64.2% and 54.2%. This suggests that mild penalization is advantageous even for larger samples as the dimensions of the covariance matrices to be estimated increase. As emphasized earlier  regularized estimation entails a trade-off between sampling variance and bias. Table  gives the mean relative bias in estimates of canonical eigenvalues for a sample size of  = 100 sires and strategy V8. Figure  further illustrates the relationship between estimates of  and their true values for selected penalties and strategy V8  with the solid line showing a one-to-one correspondence (unbiased estimates) and the dashed line representing the linear regression of estimates on population values. Patterns obtained when selecting the tuning factor using L5% or CV were similar. As expected  without penalization  estimates of the largest values were biased upwards and those of the smallest values biased downwards. Whilst the mean was expected to be estimated without bias  a small upwards bias in the average eigenvalue    together with a clustering of the smallest  at zero were evident  reflecting the effects of constraints on the parameter space. A penalty on canonical eigenvalues tended to result in over-shrinkage  i.e. causing a downward bias of the largest and an upward bias of the smallest values. This was the more pronounced the further the population  were spread apart. Similar results for a single matrix were reported by Daniels and Kass []. While the relative bias was substantial for the smallest    absolute changes tended to be small and penalization clustered estimates closer to the one-to-one line. . Data for  = 5 traits and  = 100 sires  using population values (strategy V8) to determine the tuning factor;  first  ¦ second   third  <U+2666> fourth and <U+25B2> fifth eigenvalue Penalties on matrix divergence clearly acted in a different manner to penalties on canonical eigenvalues  although PRIAL in  were comparable. For   the upwards bias in  was of a similar magnitude and individual estimates exhibited the same pattern (Figure ) as for unpenalized REML estimates  while penalization predominantly affected the smallest values. This was due to  being approximately proportional to the reciprocal of  . Shrinking genetic correlations towards their phenotypic counterparts  yielded the least relative bias in estimates of the leading canonical eigenvalues. However  it should be stressed that bias in estimates of eigenvalues does not directly translate into bias in the corresponding covariance components or genetic parameters. Eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices are systematically over-dispersed and biased  but the sample covariance matrix is an unbiased estimator e.g. []. REML estimates are biased  however  because estimates are constrained to the parameter space. This implies that for scenarios for which no constraints are needed  no bias is notable. Table  gives the mean bias in estimates of selected heritabilities (). Without penalty  a slight bias in estimates that corresponded to the highest and lowest population values was evident  arising from constrained estimation. Penalized estimation biased estimates of   with the pattern of biases and differences between penalties similar to those observed for  . For instance  for  the smallest  were substantially biased upwards  while estimates for the largest values were similar to those from unpenalized analyses. Penalties on the canonical eigenvalues resulted in marked underestimates of the highest . Taking the average of absolute deviations across traits yielded the lowest values for  and   only slightly higher than for unpenalized estimates  whilst mean absolute differences for the other penalties were about twice as high (Table ). The effects of penalized estimation on estimates of genetic correlations are illustrated in Figure  for case T- (with population  of 2 × 0.5  0.2  2 × 0.15  2 × 0.1 and 2 × 0.05) and  = 100. Shown is a box-and-whisker plot of individual estimates across replicates  with correlations in ascending order of their population values  depicted by horizontal bars. Not surprisingly for such small samples  unpenalized estimates were subject to substantial sampling variation and were most variable for pairs of traits with lowest . Again  unpenalized estimates were clearly biased due to constraints on the parameter space  with mean deviations from the population values ranging from -0.504 (8-9) to 0.035 (3-8) and a mean  absolute bias across replicates of 0.064. Penalization dramatically reduced the spread of estimates  but increased bias to a range of -0.734 (8-9) to 0.103 (4-8)  with a mean absolute value of 0.142. In all cases  genetic correlations were shrunk towards the corresponding phenotypic correlations (population values shown as dashed horizontal lines). In spite of the increase in bias  penalized estimation reduced the loss in the estimate of  by 77.3%. The corresponding value for  was less  58.1% for V8  i.e. this was a scenario for which penalization was less effective (Figure ). Across all cases  the mean absolute bias in estimates of genetic correlations for unpenalized estimates for  = 100 was 0.046 for  = 9 and 0.033 for  = 5. Penalized estimation increased this value by a factor of 2 to 3. Again  there was a tendency for the bias to be most pronounced for penalties that were imposed directly on the canonical eigenvalues.          . Data for  = 100 sires and using strategy V8 to determine tuning factors; horizontal bars show population values for genetic (solid lines) and phenotypic (dashed lines) correlations. An extension of current  standard methodology to estimate genetic parameters in a mixed model framework has been outlined that has the scope to yield 'better' estimates  especially for multivariate analyses that comprised more than just a few traits. This is achieved by penalizing the likelihood  the penalty being a function of the parameters that is aimed at reducing sampling variation. A number of suitable penalties were investigated  with emphasis on those that 'borrow strength' from estimates of phenotypic covariance components  which are typically estimated much more accurately than their genetic counterparts. All penalties presented have a Bayesian motivation  i.e. they can be derived assuming certain prior distributions for covariance matrices or their eigenvalues. Simulation results demonstrate that substantial loss reductions  i.e. the (average) difference between true and estimated covariance matrices  can be achieved through penalized estimation. As expected  this reduction in loss is at the cost of increasing bias  over and above that introduced by constraining estimates to the parameter space in standard REML analyses. The magnitude and direction of the additional bias depend on the population parameters and penalty applied but in general  penalization leads to reduced estimates of the highest heritabilities and increases estimates of the smallest heritabilities while estimates of genetic correlations are reduced in absolute value. With comparable (or better) reductions in loss to other penalties  those which shrink the genetic towards the phenotypic correlation matrix ( and ) appeared to result in least bias. Penalized REML estimation for penalties on canonical eigenvalues is best implemented by parameterising to the elements of the canonical decomposition   and []. In contrast to implementations for standard REML algorithms (which usually parameterize to the elements of the Cholesky factors of the covariance matrices to be estimated)  this yields non-zero derivatives of all covariance matrices with respect to all parameters. Furthermore  initial experience with this parameterization has shown that it resulted in slower convergence rates than estimation of covariance matrices or their Cholesky factors  similar to results by []. Moreover  extension to models with additional random effects and penalties on their covariance matrices is not straightforward. However  estimation with penalties on matrix divergence is readily carried out using standard parameterizations  for which calculation of derivatives of the penalty is the only modification to existing REML algorithms required. Furthermore  with this approach penalties on additional covariance matrices can easily be imposed  provided appropriate tuning factors are available. CV is a widely used technique to estimate the tuning factor in regularization problems from the data at hand. For our application  however  it was found to be only moderately successful  with errors in estimating  limiting achieved PRIAL and increasing the proportion of replicates for which penalization was detrimental. These errors appeared especially important for larger samples  i.e. in small samples any degree of penalization is likely to have a substantial effect  while over-penalization becomes more harmful as sample size increases. An added problem with CV for data with a genetic family structure is that of representative sampling of data subsets. In our setting  assigning whole sire families to individual folds was a natural choice and yielded higher PRIAL values than splitting families evenly across folds. In practical data sets with arbitrary relationships and fixed effects  choices are less obvious and guidelines to good sampling strategies in a mixed model setting are scarce. Moreover  CV is laborious and increases the number of analyses required by orders of magnitude. A sequential search for the optimal tuning factor was used in our simulation study. A more efficient strategy would be to use one of the many structured optimization methods available  e.g. a quadratic approximation of the average likelihood from the validation sets. However  this relies on the 'validation' curves to be smooth  increasing monotonically to a maximum and then decreasing again. This was not always the case in the simulations presented - some jagged curves were encountered  in particular for the smallest sample sizes. Presumably this was due to likelihood surfaces being very flat around their maxima  resulting in inaccurate location of these points. Use of such techniques was thus disregarded here. Fortunately  choice of  based on the decrease in the unpenalized likelihood from its maximum at  = 0 can result in penalized estimates that are closely related to those which would be obtained if population values were known. As demonstrated  such strategies yielded average loss reductions for estimates of the genetic covariance matrix that were substantially higher than loss reductions obtained when estimating  by CV  and loss reductions comparable to those achieved when using knowledge of the population parameters for some penalties. Choosing the limit to the change in likelihood so that it was just not statistically significant appeared to be a sensible choice to select a mild degree of penalization. Although this choice did not perform quite as well for individual cases where all population canonical eigenvalues were very similar  this is a scenario which is unlikely to be of practical relevance in quantitative genetic applications. Work so far has considered a balanced scenario  in which all traits in a multivariate analysis were measured for all individuals. However  we often have a substantial discrepancy between the number of observations available for different traits. For instance  we may have a number of traits recorded on a substantial number of individuals whilst records for difficult to measure traits are available for a small subset only. It is then necessary to penalize parts of the genetic covariance matrix corresponding to such groups of traits differently. An extension of the penalties on the divergence between genetic and phenotypic matrices allowing this can be derived assuming a generalized inverse Wishart prior distribution  and will be considered in future work. Even with today's computational resources  there are problems for which analyses that consider all traits of interest are not feasible  so that elements of the complete covariance matrix have to be obtained through a series of analyses of subsets of traits. This yields multiple estimates of variance and some covariance components  which need to be pooled whilst ensuring the resulting matrix is positive definite. Typically  this is done by considering one matrix at a time  using methods such as 'iterative summation of expanded part matrices' []  or by combining simple averaging of components with a regression of the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix towards their mean so that they are positive. Results from this study suggest that considering all matrices of interest simultaneously when pooling estimates from analyses of subsets  together with some shrinkage towards their sum  may be advantageous. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation provides the means to 'make the most' of limited and precious data and facilitates more stable estimation for multi-dimensional analyses  even when samples sizes are larger. We anticipate that penalized maximum likelihood estimation will become part of our everyday toolkit  as truly multivariate estimation for quantitative genetic problems becomes routine. At the present state of knowledge  a mild penalty on the divergence of the genetic from the phenotypic correlation matrix  chosen on the basis of the change in likelihood from an unpenalized analysis  appears the most suitable option for practical applications.

The methods were examined by splitting data into a reference data set of 1375 genotyped animals that were performance tested before October 2008  and 536 genotyped validation animals that were performance tested after October 2008. The traits examined were daily gain and feed conversion ratio.ResultsUsing deregressed EBV as the response variable yielded 18 to 39% higher reliabilities of the genomic breeding values than using EBV as the response variable. For daily gain  the increase in reliability due to deregression was significant and approximately 35%  whereas for feed conversion ratio it ranged between 18 and 39% and was significant only when MIXTURE was used.

The methods were examined by splitting data into a reference data set of 1375 genotyped animals that were performance tested before October 2008  and 536 genotyped validation animals that were performance tested after October 2008. The traits examined were daily gain and feed conversion ratio. Using deregressed EBV as the response variable yielded 18 to 39% higher reliabilities of the genomic breeding values than using EBV as the response variable. For daily gain  the increase in reliability due to deregression was significant and approximately 35%  whereas for feed conversion ratio it ranged between 18 and 39% and was significant only when MIXTURE was used. Genomic BLUP  Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE had similar reliabilities. Deregressed EBV is the preferred response variable  whereas the choice of statistical method is less critical for pure-bred pigs. The increase of 18 to 39% in reliability is worthwhile  since the reliabilities of the genomic breeding values directly affect the returns from genomic selection. Genomic selection in pure-bred pigs can be implemented using a multi-step procedure. Effects of dense genetic markers are estimated using a reference population and these effects are used to predict genomic breeding values (GBV) of selection candidates []. Implementing a multi-step procedure relies on two prerequisites: 1) a response variable that summarises the genetic information for reference animals  and 2) a statistical method that associates the response variable to the marker information. The choice of response variable and statistical method may well depend on the data structure. Therefore  the challenge is to find a suitable response variable and statistical method that can handle pure-bred pig data. Pure-bred pig data often have low and varying reliabilities of estimated breeding values (EBV). Some Duroc pigs in the Danish breeding scheme only have their own records  others only offspring records  while some have both - depending on the trait. Furthermore  only a subset of pigs are genotyped and these pigs tend to be closely related. Therefore  a response variable and a statistical method capable of handling such data are needed. Among the possible response variables  EBV and deregressed EBV are the most promising to date. Garrick et al. [] showed  at least in theory  that deregressed EBV with the parent average removed (hereafter referred to as \"deregressed EBV\") yield more accurate genomic breeding values than EBV for two reasons. First  deregressed EBV as the response variable results in less double-counting compared to EBV  because the proposed deregressed EBV excludes ancestral information. If both an offspring and it's parent are genotyped  the degree of double-counting decreases when using deregressed EBV as the response variable. Second  using EBV as the response variable results in double shrinkage of the genomic breeding values  particularly when the reliabilities of the EBV are low. In dairy cattle  Guo et al. [] compared the two response variables on simulated data and found that deregressed EBV yielded slightly lower reliabilities. However  their simulated data were characterized by low degrees of double-counting. It appears that most pure-bred pig data  with EBV with low reliabilities and high degrees of double-counting  compared to Guo et al. []  are more in line with the theoretical expectations. Therefore  this suggests that deregressed EBV as the response variable may yield higher reliabilities of genomic breeding values than EBV. Three types of statistical models have been widely used in the literature [  ]. These are models that assume the marker effects to be normally distributed  models that assume a thick-tailed distribution of marker effects  and models that assume a mixture of two distributions. The performance of the different models is predominantly affected by the number of QTL  the marker density and the genetic relatedness of the population. However  there is no unambiguous evidence that one model will yield more accurate genomic breeding values for pure-bred pig data for two reasons. First  mixture-distribution models have shown promising results for some traits  in particular traits under weak selection  possibly because these traits can be influenced to a greater extent by a few large QTL [  ]. Second  low genetic relatedness between reference animals and validation animals appears to favour mixture-distribution models []  presumably because mixture-distribution models utilize linkage disequilibrium more efficiently than normal and thick tailed distribution models. Probably for the same reason  Hayes et al. [] concluded that thick-tailed models and models assuming normality were equally good only when data from a single cattle breed were analysed. It appears that for pure-bred pig data  for which there is strong selection on traits of interest and high relatedness between genotyped animals  none of the models would be favoured over the others. Therefore  the models assuming mixture-distribution  thick tailed distribution and normal distribution might yield similar reliabilities of genomic breeding values. In summary  we reasoned that 1) deregressed EBV as the response variable yields higher reliabilities of the GBV compared to EBV  and that 2) normal  thick-tailed and mixture-distribution models yield similar reliabilities. To test these hypotheses  the three models and the two response variables were assessed for the reliabilities by which they could predict GBV for the two traits  daily gain and feed conversion ratio  in Danish Duroc pigs. Two response variables  EBV and deregressed EBV  and three statistical methods with normal  thick-tailed  and mixture-distributions  were assessed for their reliability to predict GBV for daily gain and feed conversion ratio in Danish Duroc pigs. The reliabilities were computed by splitting the genotyped animals into 1375 reference animals that were performance tested before October 2008 and 536 validation animals that were performance tested after October 2008 (further details are given below). The Duroc pigs were part of the genetic evaluation system in Denmark. All data were supplied by the Danish Agriculture and Food Council  Pig Research Centre. A total of 1911 Danish Duroc pigs were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA). A total of 26142 SNP markers and each of the animals met the following requirements. Each animal had a call rate greater than 0.95. Each marker was mapped to an autosome  had a minor-allele frequency greater than 0.05  a call-frequency score greater than 0.95  and a heterozygote frequency that did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg expectations by more than   where  and  are the allele frequencies at the marker. The  corresponds to a 1/4 standard-deviation unit when assuming a binomial distribution of alleles. For each animal and SNP-genotype combination  the GenCall score was greater than 0.65. Genotypes less than 0.65 were defined as missing. Animals with missing genotypes were allocated the population mean for the missing markers. Daily gain (g/day) and feed conversion ratio (feed units/kg gain) were observed in the interval 30-100 kg live weight. Recordings were performed in the period 1992 to 2010. The pedigrees of the animals were traced back to 1984  and consisted of 345686 and 52537 animals for daily gain and feed conversion ratio  respectively. Both pedigrees included 373 unknown parents (base animals). The reference data consisted of available records on October 1st 2008 and included 313068 and 23628 measurements of daily gain and feed conversion ratio  respectively. All of the 1375 genotyped animals in the reference data had their own records for daily gain  whereas only 898 genotyped animals had their own records for feed conversion ratio. There were 680 genotyped animals in the reference data that had more than four offspring records for daily gain and 633 genotyped animals that had more than four offspring records for feed conversion ratio. The full data consisted of records available until May 2010 and included the records from the reference data and additional 32618 and 3344 measurements of daily gain and feed conversion ratio  respectively. All 536 genotyped validation animals were phenotyped for both daily gain and feed conversion ratio after October 1st  2008. The EBV were calculated for daily gain and feed conversion ratio by single-trait animal models  and deregressed EBV were calculated by applying the procedure proposed by Garrick et al. []. The single-trait animal models were based on the routine evaluation model  with the regression effect of start weight  fixed effect of herd-week-section  random effect of pen and a random additive genetic effect. The model fitted to daily gain also included a fixed effect for sex and a random effect for birth litter. The variance components were estimated using REML. The heritabilities for daily gain and feed conversion ratio were 0.27 and 0.21. The 1375 reference animals had mean reliabilities for EBV of 0.62 ( = 0.18) and 0.36 ( = 0.12) for daily gain and feed conversion ratio  respectively. The software DMU [] was used to estimate variances and predict the breeding values. Single-trait animal models were used because preliminary analyses showed that predictions of GBV were not improved with a bivariate model. The deregression procedure of Garrick et al. [] adjusts for ancestral information  such that the deregressed EBV only contains their own and the descendant's information on each animal. The deregression also eliminates shrinkage contained in the EBV  and therefore deregressed EBV behave as though they were observations with a heritability equal to the reliability of the deregressed EBV (reliabilities computed as in Garrick et al. []). Deregressed EBV have unequal variances and should be used in a weighted analysis. To ensure the quality of deregressed EBV  only animals with a deregressed reliability above 0.05 were included in the analysis. This resulted in 35 animals being removed from the analyses with deregressed EBV for feed conversion ratio. The marker effects were estimated by fitting linear  additive models to the response variables. The model was: where  is a  × 1 vector of responses  with  being the number of reference animals. The mean is denoted   which is a scalar. The coefficient matrix for the markers    assume the values -1  0 or 1  and has dimension  ×   where  is the number of markers. The vector of marker effects is denoted  and has dimension  × 1  whereas the vector of residuals    has dimension  × 1  and is distributed   where  is a diagonal matrix with elements   ...  . For the analyses with EBV as the response variable   = . . . =  = 1  whereas for the analyses with deregressed EBV as the response variable  a weighted analysis was performed according to Garrick et al. []. The weight for the  th animal was   where   the part of the genetic variance not explained by markers  was assumed to be 0.1   was the heritability of the trait  and  was the reliability of the deregressed EBV of the  th animal. The statistical models studied differ by the distributional assumptions made on   and by the shortness of presentation they are referred to by the corresponding inferential procedure. A brief description of each method is provided in the following. The model for genomic BLUP (GBLUP) can be described as in equation ()  where the vector of marker effects are distributed . Alternatively  the model could be written as  =  +  +   where the genetic effects   i.e. a model with a genomic relationship matrix []. In this study  the latter form was used  where  for computational reasons was replaced by ( - )( - )  with  containing the row means of  across animals. Variance components were estimated using REML  and the GBV were BLUP solutions from the mixed model equations. Software DMU [] was used to fit GBLUP models. The model for Bayesian Lasso assumes that the marker effects follow a double exponential distribution [  ]  which is a thick-tailed distribution. This is also referred to as a Laplace distribution. Thus   ~ (0  ) where  is a scaling parameter. The MCMC software BayZ [] was used for estimation. A Gibbs sampler was applied and a total of 40000 iterations of sampling was performed  with a burn-in of 10000 iterations. The model for MIXTURE assumes that the marker effects follow a mixture of two normal distributions with similar characteristics as the mixture model in Meuwissen []. The distributional assumption can be described as:   where  = 0.9   = 0.1  and . The MCMC software BayZ [] was used for estimation. A Metropolis-Hastings sampler was applied with a total of 40000 iterations of sampling and a burn-in of 10000 iterations. The predictive ability of each method was evaluated by the reliability of the GBV on the genotyped validation animals. To avoid use of overlapping information between the reference and validation animals []  we based the validation on the own phenotype of genotyped validation animals  adjusted for fixed effects and non-genetic random effects. The computation of adjusted phenotypes for genotyped validation animals was based on the full data  and the adjusted phenotypes were the sum of EBV and the estimated residual errors . The reliability of the GBV    is the squared correlation  between GBV and the vector of genetic effects    for genotyped validation animals. Using that the vector of residual errors    for these animals is independent of the GBV  and that   we obtain a formula for the reliability of the GBV where  is the vector of EBV for validation animals   is the estimated residual vector     is the residual variance and  is the additive genetic variance of the trait. The formula above for the reliability is similar to other formulas shown in the literature [  ]. A test was performed to investigate whether the reliabilities of the GBV from the two methods were significantly different from each other within each trait. The test hypothesis was that the reliability of GBV from method A was equal to the reliability of GBV from method B  i.e. . Since  is simply a constant for each trait  the test hypothesis can be reduced to . However   appears in both correlations and the two correlations are not independent within each trait. This issue of testing equality of correlated correlations was addressed by the Hotelling-Williams -test [  ]  which was applied to each trait with a confidence level of 5%. The response variable  deregressed EBV  resulted in higher reliabilities than EBV for both feed conversion ratio and daily gain (Table ). For daily gain  the reliabilities were on average 35% higher for deregressed EBV with GBLUP  Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE. The reliabilities for daily gain increased from approximately 0.25 to 0.34. For feed conversion ratio  the reliabilities were on average 18% higher for deregressed EBV for GBLUP and Bayesian Lasso  which approached significance (p-values between 0.05 and 0.11). Use of deregressed EBV instead of EBV increased reliabilities from approximately 0.16 to 0.19 for GBLUP and Bayesian Lasso. For the method MIXTURE  the deregressed EBV yielded 39% higher reliabilities than EBV  increasing reliabilities from 0.15 to 0.20. The three statistical methods  GBLUP  Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE did not yield different reliabilities (Table ). For daily gain  the reliabilities ranged from 0.33 to 0.34 for deregressed EBV and from 0.25 to 0.26 for EBV. For feed conversion ratio  the reliabilities ranged from 0.19 to 0.20 for deregressed EBV and from 0.15 to 0.16 for EBV. The hypothesis that deregressed EBV yield higher reliabilities than EBV was supported. The increase in reliability of 18 to 39% for Duroc pigs is worthwhile  since the reliabilities of the genomic breeding values directly affect the returns from genomic selection. The hypothesis that the different statistical methods yielded similar reliabilities was also supported. Therefore  we believe that when applying genomic selection within a pure-bred pig population  deregressed EBV is the preferred response variable  while the choice of the statistical method is less critical. The fact that the increase in reliabilities due to deregression was so large was surprising  since results reported by Guo et al. [] suggested that EBV is the more suitable response variable. There are three possible reasons. In our study less information was available for the reference animals compared to Guo et al. []  which implies that the expected double shrinkage was increased when using EBV as the response variable. The amount of information was more heterogeneous among the reference animals  and this favours deregressed EBV. The heterogeneity in amount of information was larger for daily gain than for feed conversion ratio  which also explains why the effect of deregression was larger for this trait. The combination of less information per reference animal and several parent-offspring relationships within the reference population increases double-counting further. If a genotyped parent has only one offspring  and this offspring is genotyped  the degree of double-counting is much larger than if both the parent and the offspring have many ungenotyped offspring. So  the combination of sire-son relationships with a low and heterogeneous amount of information in the reference data seems to favour deregressed EBV over EBV. There are two reasons why the three statistical methods performed equally well. First  the traits have been subject to strong selection  which suggests that MIXTURE would not have an advantage over the other methods [  ]. Second  we considered only one breed  in which the genotyped animals were closely related  implying that Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE  which utilize linkage disequilibrium more efficiently  have no advantage over GBLUP [  ]. Thus  the small difference between the statistical methods is caused by the pure-bred pig data with its high relatedness between genotyped animals and traits that have been subject to strong selection. The results from this study may only partly apply to other species  traits and data structures. The positive effect of using deregressed EBV as the response variable will depend on the degree of double-counting  and the amount and heterogeneity of information for genotyped animals. However  since the deregressed EBV proposed by Garrick et al. [] are theoretically more appropriate than EBV  we believe that deregressed EBV will be advantageous in most circumstances. In contrast  the conclusion about equal performances of the statistical methods is not generic. For traits controlled by large QTL  data from multiple breeds or distantly related genotyped animals  or when using a denser marker panel  MIXTURE and Bayesian Lasso could outperform GBLUP. The reason for this is that MIXTURE and Bayesian Lasso utilize linkage disequilibrium more efficiently. We believe that the positive effect of using deregressed EBV applies to most situations  whereas choosing the best statistical method is more sensitive to the particular situation. The applied multi-step method has the benefit of being readily applicable in most breeding schemes. EBV with reliabilities are easily predicted  and can then be used to calculate deregressed EBV []. The deregression procedure itself is very simple and only requires little computing power. The association of marker effects with the response variable by GBLUP is relatively simple  since GBLUP is implemented in common breeding value estimation software. Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE are available in various MCMC software  although particularly MIXTURE is sensitive to the prior information given  which makes the use of these methods less appealing. A final step  which has not been examined in the present study  would be to combine the genomic breeding values with the traditional pedigree information [  ].

The number of different causal structures that can be used to fit a SEM is typically very large  even when only a few traits are studied. In recent applications of SEM in quantitative genetics mixed model settings  causal structures were pre-selected based on prior beliefs alone. Alternatively  there are algorithms that search for structures that are compatible with the joint distribution of the data. However  such a search cannot be performed directly on the joint distribution of the phenotypes since causal relationships are possibly masked by genetic covariances. In this context  the application of the Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm to the joint distribution of phenotypes conditional to unobservable genetic effects has been proposed.MethodsHere  we applied this approach to five traits in European quail: birth weight (BW)  weight at 35 days of age (W35)  age at first egg (AFE)  average egg weight from 77 to 110 days of age (AEW)  and number of eggs laid in the same period (NE). We have focused the discussion on the challenges and difficulties resulting from applying this method to field data. Statistical decisions regarding partial correlations were based on different Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval contents and models based on the selected causal structures were compared using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). In addition  we used temporal information to perform additional edge orienting  overriding the algorithm output when necessary.ResultsAs a result  the final causal structure consisted of two separated substructures: BW<U+2192>AEW and W35<U+2192>AFE<U+2192>NE  where an arrow represents a direct effect. Comparison between a SEM with the selected structure and a Multiple Trait Animal Model using DIC indicated that the SEM is more plausible.ConclusionsCoupling prior knowledge with the output provided by the IC algorithm allowed further learning regarding phenotypic causal structures when compared to standard mixed effects SEM applications."

In recent applications of SEM in quantitative genetics mixed model settings  causal structures were pre-selected based on prior beliefs alone. Alternatively  there are algorithms that search for structures that are compatible with the joint distribution of the data. However  such a search cannot be performed directly on the joint distribution of the phenotypes since causal relationships are possibly masked by genetic covariances. In this context  the application of the Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm to the joint distribution of phenotypes conditional to unobservable genetic effects has been proposed. Here  we applied this approach to five traits in European quail: birth weight (BW)  weight at 35 days of age (W35)  age at first egg (AFE)  average egg weight from 77 to 110 days of age (AEW)  and number of eggs laid in the same period (NE). We have focused the discussion on the challenges and difficulties resulting from applying this method to field data. Statistical decisions regarding partial correlations were based on different Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval contents and models based on the selected causal structures were compared using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). In addition  we used temporal information to perform additional edge orienting  overriding the algorithm output when necessary. As a result  the final causal structure consisted of two separated substructures: BW<U+2192>AEW and W35<U+2192>AFE<U+2192>NE  where an arrow represents a direct effect. Comparison between a SEM with the selected structure and a Multiple Trait Animal Model using DIC indicated that the SEM is more plausible. Coupling prior knowledge with the output provided by the IC algorithm allowed further learning regarding phenotypic causal structures when compared to standard mixed effects SEM applications. Structural equation models or SEM [  ] are used to model multiple traits and functional links among them  which may be interpreted as causal relationships. These models were adapted for the context of quantitative genetics mixed models by []  and henceforth applied and extended by a number of authors []. Fitting SEM requires choosing a causal structure . This structure describes qualitatively the causal relationships among traits by determining the subset of traits that imposes causal influence on each phenotype studied. By fitting a SEM  it is possible then to infer the magnitude of each causal relationship pertaining to the causal structure  which is quantified by model parameters called structural coefficients. However  choosing the causal structure may be cumbersome  given the typically very large space of possible causal hypotheses  even when only a few traits are studied. The choice of causal structures for the aforementioned SEM applications that followed the work of [] were performed on the basis of prior beliefs  resulting in poor exploration of structures spaces. Methodologies such as the IC algorithm [  ] make it possible to search for recursive causal structures that are compatible with the joint probability distribution of the variables considered. Therefore  applying these methodologies allows the selection of causal structures without relying on prior knowledge alone. Nonetheless  such algorithms are constructed based on specific assumptions regarding the data  such as the causal sufficiency assumption (for more details  see [  ]). Under this assumption  the residuals of the SEM for which the causal structure will be chosen are regarded as independent between traits. This construction is necessary to establish the connection between the selected causal structures and the joint probability distribution under study  such that d-separations [  ] in causal structures among traits are reflected as null partial correlations. Under this scenario  the IC algorithm takes a correlation matrix as input and searches for causal structures that are capable of producing that matrix  with its conditional dependencies and independencies. However  multiple phenotypes may present unobserved correlated genetic effects which confound such search  as discussed by Valente et al. []. When using mixed effects SEM to represent this scenario  this confounding may take place even if model residuals are regarded as independent. As an alternative  Valente et al. [] proposed a methodology which couples Bayesian model fitting and the application of the IC algorithm to the joint distribution of phenotypes conditional on the genetic effects. With the purpose of validating and illustrating their method  Valente et al. [] applied it to simulated data based on different scenarios. Here  we present the first application of such methodology to a real data set  by exploring the space of causal structures among five productive and reproductive traits in European quail. The discussion is focused on the challenges and benefits resulting from applying this method to field data  as well as on proposing approaches to overcome such challenges. The data refer to 849 female European quail () from six distinguished hatch seasons. The birds were raised in an experimental station  with  access to water and 2  900 kcal/kg and 28% crude protein diet. They were kept on the floor until 35 days of age  and then transferred to individual cages  and provided a laying diet henceforth. Five traits were analyzed: birth weight (BW)  weight at 35 days of age (W35)  age at first egg (AFE)  average egg weight from 77 to 110 days of age (AEW)  and number of eggs laid in the same period (NE). Measurements for all five traits were available for every bird  with no missing data. Means and standard deviations for each trait are presented in Table . Additionally  the analysis considered pedigree information  containing 10  680 individuals. The SEM used to fit the data may be represented as [  ]: with the joint distribution of vectors  and  as: where    and  are  respectively  vectors of phenotypic records  additive genetic effects and model residuals for  traits  sorted by trait and subject within trait;  is a vector containing the (fixed) effects of hatch season for each trait;  and  are incidence matrices relating effects in  and  to ;  is a ( × ) matrix with zeroes on the diagonal and with structural coefficients or zeroes on the off-diagonal (the causal structure defines which entries contain free parameters and which entries are constrained to 0);  and  are the additive genetic and residual covariance matrices  respectively; and  is the genetic relationship matrix  constructed from pedigree information. The model given by (1) may be rewritten as: such that the so-called reduced model is expressed as: Therefore  where  = . Selection of causal structure was performed by following the methods presented by []. As mentioned by these authors  there are algorithms that search for recursive causal structures (i.e. causal structures with no cycles or feedback relationships between traits) assuming that conditional independencies in the joint probability distribution of the studied variables mirror d-separations in the causal structure (for more details  see [  ]). One of such algorithms is the Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm  which is able to search  within typically vast causal structure spaces  for a class of minimal structures that are compatible with the conditional independencies carried by the joint distribution of the data. This class consists of statistically equivalent causal structures that impose the same set of stable conditional independencies in the joint distribution (i.e. they cannot be distinguished on the basis of data evidence) and may be represented by a partially oriented graph  i.e.  a causal structure carrying directed and undirected edges  the latter representing causal connections with unspecified causal direction. The edges that are left undirected by the algorithm may present one direction or the other in different structures within the class  such that no direction results in causal cycles or further unshielded colliders (sub-structures consisting of unlinked vertices with a common child  such as  <U+2192>  <U+2190>    where     and  are indexes indicating three different phenotypic traits  and  <U+2192>  indicates that  directly affects  ). The IC algorithm  when applied to a set  of  phenotypic traits  can be described as follows: Step 1. For each pair of phenotypic traits  and  ( <U+2260>  = 1  2  ...  ) in   search for a set of traits such that  is independent of  given . If  and  are dependent for every possible   connect  and  with an undirected edge. This step returns an undirected graph . Step 2. For each pair of non-adjacent traits  and  with a common adjacent trait  in  (i.e.   -  -  )  search for a set containing  such that  is independent of  conditional on . If there is no such set  then add arrowheads pointing at  ( <U+2192>  <U+2190>  ). Otherwise  continue. Step 3. In the partially oriented graph returned by the previous step  orient as many undirected edges as possible in such a way that it does not result in new unshielded colliders or in cycles. An important point to observe regarding the study of causal structures among phenotypic traits is that even if the residual covariance matrix is considered as diagonal  which is a consequence of the causal sufficiency assumption  unobserved correlated genetic effects act as sources of confounding [  ]. Such feature damages the connection between causal structures and joint probabilities such that d-separations in the former are not expected to be reflected as conditional independencies in the latter. However  conditionally on the genetic effects  this connection is restored. Assessing this conditional probability distribution is possible since such effects can be 'controlled' based on a genetic distance matrix (e.g. a genetic relationship matrix). The conditional covariance matrix of  given  can be obtained by fitting a standard multiple trait animal model (MTAM  []) and obtaining the estimated residual covariance matrix  here represented by . In some systems  other factors (e.g. correlated maternal effects) may also impose confounding in the search  and in these cases they should also be incorporated in the MTAM from which  will be taken as the algorithm's input. Using Bayesian data analysis with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation  the following approach was proposed by []: Step 1. Fit a MTAM and draw samples from the posterior distribution of . Step 2. Apply the IC algorithm to the posterior samples of  to make the statistical decisions required. Specifically  for each query about the statistical independence between phenotypes  and  ( <U+2260>  = 1  2  ...  ) given a set of traits  and  implicitly  the genetic effects: Obtain the posterior distribution of residual partial correlation <U+03C1>. These partial correlations are functions of . Therefore  samples from their posterior distribution can be obtained by computing the correlation at each sample drawn from the posterior distribution of . Compute the highest posterior density (HPD) interval with some specified probability content for <U+03C1>. If the HPD interval contains 0  declare <U+03C1>as null. Otherwise  declare  and  as conditionally dependent. Step 3. Fit a SEM using the selected causal structure (or one member within the class of statistically equivalent structures returned by the IC algorithm) as the 'true' causal structure. More details on causal structure search based on observational data are given by [  ]. Additionally  the approach proposed to select recursive causal structures in the quantitative genetics mixed model context is discussed by [] and reviewed in []. Application of the IC algorithm involves performing a set of statistical decisions about declaring partial correlations as null or not. As the posterior distribution of these parameters becomes flatter  the statistical decisions get poorer  i.e. errors become more likely. In this scenario  using a high content HPD interval (such as 95%) protects against declaring a null correlation as non-null  but the algorithm becomes more prone to declaring non-null correlations as null. However  these two types of errors are equally important when exploring causal structure spaces []  and therefore  in scenarios where posterior distributions of partial correlations are not sharp  results may be better when decisions are made on the basis of HPD intervals with lower content. In this article we applied several HPD content magnitudes (70  75  80  85  90  and 95%)  and compared the final causal structures obtained. This approach may indicate the edges and the structures that are more stable to changes in the magnitude of HPD contents used for the statistical decisions. The models studied were fitted via Bayesian analysis and consisted of SEM with recursive causal structures and a diagonal residual covariance matrix  as described in []. A fully recursive model is represented by a SEM where every entry below the diagonal of  is treated as a free parameter. The likelihood equivalence between MTAM and SEM with fully recursive causal structures [] was explored to make inferences about the parameters of the former model by fitting the latter. The residual covariance matrix of an MTAM  which is needed for the recursive causal structure search  was obtained by fitting a fully recursive SEM and then transforming its residual covariance matrix by: where and are  respectively  a matrix of structural coefficients and a diagonal residual covariance matrix  both associated with a fully recursive model. Such approach allowed all the models studied in this article to be fitted by using the same program. The following joint prior distribution was assumed for location and dispersion parameters of model (1): where (|  ) is a multivariate normal density centered at  and covariance matrix    is an Inverse Wishart density with degrees of freedom and scale matrix   -( |   ) is a scaled inverse-chi-square distribution with  degrees of freedom and scale parameter   and  is the residual variance for trait . Unbounded uniform distributions were assigned as prior distributions for  and for each structural coefficient in . Furthermore        and  were regarded as known hyperparameters of the prior distribution. The following hyperparameter values were used for all SEM considered:  and  = 3 for every entry of the diagonal of ; = 7 and The analyses were carried out using programs written in R []  which are available from the authors upon request. As all fully conditional posterior distributions had closed forms  a Gibbs sampler  as discussed in []  was applied to obtain a single chain of 300  000 iterations for each model fitted. On the basis of visual inspection of a subset of parameters  including the structural coefficients  genetic and residual covariances  the initial 100  000 samples of each chain were discarded as a conservative burn-in. The remaining 200  000 iterations were regarded as samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters. The retained samples were used as basis for recursive causal structure search via IC algorithm  model comparison  and inferences about the parameters of the model fitted conditionally on the selected causal structure. Causal structures within a class of observationally equivalent structures cannot be distinguished on the basis of data evidence because they result in the same set of probabilistic conditional independencies. Therefore  they cannot be compared using criteria that rely on the likelihood function. However  structures from distinguished classes are expected to induce distinct features on the joint distribution  such that they may be compared using data evidence. In the present article  we used the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC  []) to compare models that present causal structures pertaining to distinct classes of structures. Such approach is followed here because different classes of causal structures may emerge from applying the search methodology using different HPD interval contents for statistical decisions. The same criterion was used to check the quality of fit of the SEM conditional on the selected causal structures by comparing them with a standard MTAM  which carries no restrictions on the dispersion parameters. Considering  as a vector containing the model parameters  and D() = -2log((|))  which is called the deviance function  the DIC was obtained as follows: where   which is the posterior mean of   and  were obtained from the posterior samples of . Fitting the fully recursive SEM resulted in posterior means and 95% HPD intervals of each  and  entry as given in Table . These matrices represent residual and additive genetic covariance matrices pertaining to a MTAM  respectively. The posterior distributions of the heritabilities as obtained from the same model are presented in Figure . It shows that the analyzed traits present moderate to high heritabilities  with posterior means ranging from 0.151 (NE) to 0.591 (BW). . BW = birth weight  W35 = weight at 35 days  AFE = age at first egg  AEW = average egg weight from 77 to 110 days  and NE = number of eggs produced from 77 to 110 days. After applying the described approach for causal structure search based on different HPD interval contents  the three undirected graphs depicted in Figure  were selected. The output was completely undirected for each search performed because no evidence of unshielded colliders was detected. It should be stressed that finding unshielded colliders is essential for edge orienting by the IC algorithm. . BW = birth weight  W35 = weight at 35 days  AFE = age at first egg  AEW = average egg weight from 77 to 110 days  and NE = number of eggs produced from 77 to 110 days. As already stated  the undirected or semidirected graphs returned by the IC algorithm represent classes of equivalent causal structures. However  the undirected graph returned when using a 70% HPD interval for the statistical decisions (Figure ) implies a set of observational consequences that  given the algorithm assumptions  cannot result from a SEM with recursive causal structure and independent residuals. Specifically  any attempt to direct the edges of the graph inevitably results in a causal cycle  or in unshielded colliders. Causal cycles belong to structures that are outside the explored space  and adding unshielded colliders diverges from the algorithm's output  which indicated that no evidence of such sub-structures was found from the partial correlations studied in the second step. These types of results indicate that some assumption(s) of the model or of the IC algorithm may not hold. As suggested by [    ]  one may combine the IC algorithm framework with prior knowledge to select causal structures. Here we choose to consider the structure in Figure  as a 'skeleton' and orient its edges according to temporal information. The temporal sequence followed by the phenotypic traits is: (1) BW  (2) W35  (3) AFE and (4) AEW and NE. This information prompted us to propose a causal structure as in Figure   which presents two unshielded colliders that were not detected in the initial search  but carries all the edges that were previously detected. . BW = birth weight  W35 = weight at 35 days  AFE = age at first egg  AEW = average egg weight from 77 to 110 days  and NE = number of eggs produced from 77 to 110 days. Given the HPD contents applied to the IC algorithm  the output in Figure  may be considered as the most stable  since it was consistently selected when using HPD intervals of 75%  80%  85% and 90%. This structure is similar to the one obtained using 70% HPD intervals  except for the absence of the edge connecting BW and NE. Another difference from the previous selected structure is that this slightly sparser undirected graph reflects a set of conditional independencies that could effectively result from a recursive SEM. In other words  this undirected graph represents a non-empty class of recursive causal structures  which is in contrast to the graph previously discussed  which suggested features in the joint distribution that could not result from an acyclic SEM under the causal sufficiency assumption. However  every instance of this class conflicts with the prior knowledge regarding the temporal sequence of the studied traits  i.e. every structure of this class considers that at least one trait is affected by some other trait not yet expressed. More specifically  for every member of this causal structure class  AEW is regarded as a cause of W35  or a cause of BW  or both. Here we allowed the temporal sequence information to override the algorithm output  leading to the oriented structure presented in Figure   which involves adding in the unshielded collider BW <U+2192> AEW <U+2190> W35. Finally  the last selected structure resulted from using the proposed approach based on 95% HPD intervals to make the statistical decisions. As presented in Figure   this structure is also undirected  and consists of two disconnected sub-structures. Unlike the previous outputs  this class of structures carries one structure that is consistent with the temporal information regarding the studied traits  which is depicted in Figure . Moreover  the edges conveyed by this undirected graph were the most stable  as they were present for every HPD interval content that was used in the search methodology. Three distinguished SEM were constructed conditionally on the causal structures presented in Figure  (model A)   (model B) and  (model C). DIC's obtained for each of these models are presented in Table . This criterion indicated that model C  which is the simplest among these models  should be preferred. Models that present extra edges are typically expected to present a better fit. However  DIC may not assign better scores to such complex models if the extra goodness of fit achieved is not sufficient to compensate for the penalty given for model flexibility (number of parameters). Furthermore  it should be observed that models A and B carry unshielded colliders that are not supported by data evidence  i.e. the statistical consequences of their presence in the causal structure were not found when the posterior distribution of  was used as input for the IC algorithm. This may have resulted in extra penalty in the DIC of these models due to decreased goodness of fit  which is suggested by their larger DIC when compared to the MTAM. On the other hand  the smaller DIC of model C when compared to MTAM's indicates that this structure is indeed plausible  presenting a good fit despite having the strongest constraints among the models studied. Inferences about the dispersion parameters of a SEM that carries the selected structure (model C)  as well as its structural coefficients  are presented in Table  and Figure   respectively. According to the causal structure selected and the parameter inferences  W35 imposes a negative causal effect over AFE. The posterior distribution of the magnitude of the change in AFE due to a 1g increase in W35 is given in Figure   with a posterior mean of -0.052 day/g. In turn  AFE also imposes a negative effect on NE  with a posterior mean of -0.113 egg/day and the posterior distribution depicted in Figure . This structure also implies that W35 presents an indirect positive causal effect on NE. Finally  inferences concerning the remaining edge indicate that BW has a negative causal effect on AEW  for which the posterior distribution is depicted in Figure   with posterior mean of -0.408 g/g. At first sight  this result may seem unexpected given that phenotypes for these traits present positive covariance. However  according to the inferences for MTAM dispersion parameters  this positive phenotypic association is due to a strong positive additive genetic association (genetic covariance with posterior mean of 0.30 g). Conditional on the genetic effects  the association between these traits becomes negative  as represented by residual covariance with a posterior mean of -0.12 g. As a consequence  the causal association between BW and AEW could only be negative given that the causal association between BW and AEW is disconnected from the remainder of the causal structure  and given that causal sufficiency is assumed in the causal structure search. . The reduction of a SEM transforms model parameters in parameters of a MTAM. Inferences about heritabilities  residual and genetic covariances from a reduced model based on model C are shown in Figure  and Table . These posterior distributions are quite similar to the posterior distributions obtained for MTAM for the same parameters (Figure  and Table ). This similarity was expected given that the IC algorithm searches for causal structures that are minimal and yet compatible with the distribution of the data (which is in principle described without constraints by a MTAM) and that using the chosen structure resulted in good fit according to the comparison between model C and MTAM via DIC. An opposite scenario with strong disagreements between inferences obtained under both models would indicate that features of the selected causal structure are not coherent with data evidence. This conflict would denote that the selected causal structure is not plausible. . BW = birth weight  W35 = weight at 35 days  AFE = age at first egg  AEW = average egg weight from 77 to 110 days  and NE = number of eggs produced from 77 to 110 days. It should be stressed that one's interpretation of the output provided by the approach proposed by [] must be guided by the (causal) assumptions one is willing to accept. This methodology could be regarded as causal structure inference in situations where the assumptions provided by [] are accepted (namely: (1) causal sufficiency  (2) same causal relations for every individual in population  (3) faithfulness of joint distribution to an acyclic directed graph  and (4) correctness of statistical decisions). Some causal learning may still take place even if we do not accept the strong assumption of causal sufficiency (i.e.  that every variable which affects two or more variables under study is already in the set of the studied variables). Applying this to the results of the present study  the existence of causal influence of AFE over NE could be claimed by simply accepting the Causal Markov Condition (which is not an assumption as strong as causal sufficiency) and by acknowledging temporal information (W35 before AFE  and the latter before NE) []. Nevertheless  structural equation modeling may be used without learning from the causal information carried by it. Under this circumstance  the goal may simply be to represent a joint probability distribution in a more parsimonious fashion. Generally  when a recursive causal structure is applied with this purpose  the residual covariance matrix is constructed as diagonal to achieve parameter identifiability. Nonetheless  this is exactly the statistical consequence of accepting the IC algorithm's causal sufficiency assumption  so that the described methodology may be properly used under this construction. Because the proposed approach searches for minimal causal structures  applying the retrieved structures to fit a recursive SEM would result in parsimonious modeling of joint probability distributions derived from multiple trait models.

Semen stored in a cryobank may be a useful way to redirect selection or limit the loss of genetic diversity in a selected breed. The purpose of this study was to analyse the efficiency of current cryobank sampling methods  by investigating the benefits of using cryopreserved semen in a selection scheme several generations after the semen was collected. The theoretical impact of using cryopreserved semen in a selection scheme of a dairy cattle breed was investigated by simulating various scenarios involving two negatively correlated traits and a change in genetic variability of the breed. Our results indicate that using cryopreserved semen to redirect selection will have an impact on negatively selected traits only if it is combined with major changes in selection objectives or practices. If the purpose is to increase genetic diversity in the breed  it can be a viable option. Using cryopreserved semen to redirect selection or to improve genetic diversity should be carried out with caution  by considering the pros and cons of prospective changes in genetic diversity and the value of the selected traits. However  the use of genomic information should lead to more interesting perspectives to choose which animals to store in a cryobank and to increase the value of cryobank collections for selected breeds. Within the context of farm animal biotechnologies  cryopreservation is one of the most useful tools for selection improvement  dissemination of genetic progress and  conservation. In its Global Plan of Action  the FAO [] recommended the implementation of  programmes to complement  conservation of animal genetic resources. It was also suggested that cryopreserved bio-specimens could be used as a backup material to redirect the selection scheme of a given breed  if needed [  ]. Consequently  several gene banks have been created with different strategies and policies that vary with the breed  species  and country concerned [  ] and methods have been proposed to use  genetic resources to optimise the management of genetic diversity in endangered breeds []. Breeds with large populations are subject to high selection pressures and have rates of inbreeding greater than the desired values []. In these cases  the use of stored semen from male ancestors has seldom been investigated  although breeding organisations could be interested in doing so. For instance  in the dairy cattle breed Abondance (a local selected breed in the French Northern Alps)  the semen of a bull born in 1977 (called Naif)  which was rarely used in the 1980's  was used from 2004 to 2007  to produce 20 young bulls in order to reintroduce some genetic variability in the breed. Depending on the country  different strategies have been implemented to sample individuals for national collections. In the Netherlands  most of the tested bulls are sampled for preservation in the gene bank []  while in the USA  the selection of animals for cryopreservation is aimed at optimizing genetic diversity within the collection  by sampling animals from clusters determined through computed genealogical relationships []. In France  based on the idea that individuals sampled for a cryobank should be as diverse as possible and carry special genotypes []  regulations have been implemented to conserve frozen sperm from three main origins: (I) animals from endangered breeds  (II) original animals from non-endangered breeds (with either extreme positive or negative Estimated Breeding Values (EBV)  carrying rare alleles or representing rare pedigree lines)  and (III) representative animals from non-endangered breeds []. The purpose of this study was to analyse the efficiency of current cryobank sampling methods by investigating the benefits of using cryopreserved semen in a selection scheme several generations after the semen was collected. Based on simulations  we examined two situations in which cryopreserved sperm was used (1) to redirect the selection goal  by including a trait which  in the past  had shown a negative correlated selection response (e.g. fertility in dairy cattle)  and (2) to limit the loss of genetic diversity in the breed. The impact of using cryopreserved sperm was measured by estimating the evolution of two negatively correlated traits and the evolution of the breed's genetic diversity  assessed through pedigree information. A simplified cattle breed was simulated with 13 discrete generations  each consisting of 100 males and 10000 females. In each generation  10 bulls and 50 cows were chosen as parents of the male progeny  and 20 bulls and 10000 cows were chosen as parents of the female progeny (with no selection on the dam to dam path). Mating was random resulting in random variation of progeny size among parents  i.e. the sire and dam of a given newborn were randomly chosen in the corresponding lists of parents. We considered two traits A and B. Trait A corresponded to a production trait which had been recently and intensively selected and improved (such as milk production in dairy cattle). Trait B corresponded to a functional trait which had deteriorated because of a negative correlation with trait A (e.g. fertility or longevity). The genetic standard deviation of each trait (s and s  respectively) was set to 1 and the correlation between traits (<U+03C1>) was set to -0.3. For each trait  an additive polygenic model was assumed and the simulation of correlated genetic values was based on the bivariate normal distribution (see  e.g. []). At generation 0 (base population)  genetic values for trait A were randomly and independently drawn from a  (0  1) distribution. For a given individual ()  the genetic value for trait B () was generated from its value for trait A (): where ß is a  (0  1) random number independent of . In the following generations  genetic values of individual  were simulated from the genetic values of its sire ( and ) and its dam ( and )  taking into account the parent's coefficients of inbreeding ( and   resp.) [  ]: In these equations  <U+03B3> and d are two numbers randomly drawn from a  (0  1) bivariate normal distribution with a correlation equal to <U+03C1>. EBV were directly simulated from genetic values  assuming an evaluation procedure leading to an accuracy ( = square of the correlation between the EBV and the true genetic value) equal to 0.6 for bulls and 0.4 for cows  whatever the trait and the generation considered. Therefore  the EBV of a given individual for trait A () and for trait B () were computed as follows: where e and <U+03D5> are two independent numbers drawn from a (0  1) distribution. Finally  a Total Merit Index () was computed  weighting the two EBV by  and  = 1 -   respectively: Simulations comprised two stages. During stage 1 (generations 0 to 8)  the lists of parents were selected based on their EBV for trait A only  without considering the evolution of the genetic mean for trait B or the average coefficient of inbreeding. During stage 2 (generations 9 to 12)  the bulls were also used to improve trait B or to introduce genetic diversity in the breed. During stage 1  the semen of some bulls was sampled and cryopreserved if the animals fulfilled one of the three following conditions  which correspond to the current sampling rules of the French National Cryobank for type \"II\" (original bulls) []: (i)  is three standard deviations above or below the mean of the generation  (ii)  is two standard deviations above the mean of the generation (trait B is considered as a functional trait and for functional traits  only animals above the average are considered)  (iii) the bull is a sire of sires with no male offspring selected after the evaluation process (these bulls were actually selected with one generation lag). To check the validity of this elaborate sampling method  we tested a simpler sampling method (similar to the one used in the Netherlands)  where the semen of all young bulls is stored in the cryobank. In the simulations performed here  we investigated the impact of a one-time use (i.e. during a single generation) of cryopreserved semen. At generation 9  four bulls with cryopreserved semen were selected (hereafter referred to as 'cryobank bulls')  these bulls fulfilling one of the following conditions either (i) they are the best cryobank bulls for the  or (ii) they have the lowest average kinship with the existing population (males and females taken together). We studied the impact of various selection orientations (use of cryopreserved semen  conservation of male lines  etc.) only on the male path  because applying the above conditions on the female path would be much more restrictive  less effective  and would require a larger amount of semen  all the more since the number of doses is generally limited in cryobanks (200  in France) []. For these reasons  we considered that cryobank bulls were used only to procreate young bulls for progeny testing. The 9 generation of young bulls was then generated using either the bulls from the cryobank or the group of 10 sires selected as described in previous sections. Depending on the scenario (see following section)  0  40 or 80 individuals (among the 100 newborn bull calves) were sired randomly by one of the four selected cryobank bulls. Six simulation scenarios were completed with two main options (Table ). Firstly  in scenario \"b\"  emphasis was put on the selection of both traits B and A. To achieve this goal  three methods were compared: b1: at generation 9  the four bulls with the highest  ( = 0.5) were used to sire 40% of the young bulls  while the selection criterion during stage 2 remained unchanged (improving ). The other young bulls were sired by bulls randomly sampled within the group of 10 sires; b2: at generation 9  no cryobank bull was used  and during stage 2   ( = 0.5) was used as the selection criterion instead of ; b3: at generation 9  the four cryobank bulls with the highest  were used to sire 40% of the young bulls  and during stage 2   was used as the selection criterion instead of . To test more or less drastic selection changes  scenario b3 was tested with an increasing weight given to trait B ( increasing from 0.5 to 1). Secondly  in scenarios \"d\"  emphasis was put on genetic variability while trait A remained the breeding goal. Three methods were also compared: d1: at generation 9  the four cryobank bulls having the lowest kinship with the existing population (scenario b1) were used to sire 40% of the young bulls; d2: at generation 9  no cryobank bull was used  while during stage 2  the progenies on the sire to sire path were given the same size i.e. for each sire of sires  10 male offspring were created among which those with the two best  became the sires of dams and that with the best  became a sire of sires; d3: at generation 9  the four cryobank bulls having the lowest kinship with the existing population (scenario b1) were used to sire 40% of the young bulls  while during stage 2  selection was used to equalise progeny sizes on the sire to sire path. Simulations were performed with 1000 runs for each scenario. For each generation  individual inbreeding coefficients and genetic values were computed and averaged for the entire male and female populations. The individual coefficients of kinship were also computed and averaged over males only and over the entire populations. The proportion of genes originating from cryobank bulls was computed on the basis of the gene dropping procedure (one locus averaged over the 1000 runs). As expected  the results of the different scenarios did not differ significantly for generations 0 to 8 given that in stage 1  the conditions were the same whatever the option chosen  (here we present results averaged over the 1000 runs of one scenario only). With the parameters chosen for the simulation  each sire of sires had on average 10 male offspring (across sires standard deviation s.d. = 2.9) and each sire of dams had on average 500 female offspring (across sires s.d. = 21.6). As expected (see Figure )  selection on trait A during stage 1 led to a major increase in the mean of this trait (+ 6.7 initial genetic standard deviation) from generation 0 to 8  while at the same time  the mean of B decreased to a lesser extent (-2 initial genetic standard deviation). The average coefficient of inbreeding increased simultaneously. Young bulls were slightly more inbred than cows  as they originated from a smaller number of sires and dams. In parallel (generation 0 to 8)  the average coefficient of kinship among the young bulls and among the entire population increased to 8.1% and 6.9%  respectively. . Dotted lines: young bulls; solid lines: whole population; red: trait A  blue: trait B; green: average between A and B; purple: inbreeding F; pink: kinship . An average of 31 cryobank bulls was sampled per replicate  58% being sampled because of outstanding  (see Table ). Table  shows that cryobank bulls chosen for their genetic diversity were generally born earlier than others  which can be explained by the fact that they were chosen with one generation lag compared to other sampling procedures. As shown in Figure   introducing cryobank bulls with exceptional  without changing the selection criterion during stage 2 (scenario b1) had a temporary impact on traits A and B as well as on the diversity indicators of the young bulls. At the whole population level  the impact was negligible  since young bulls sired by cryobank bulls were rarely subsequently selected as sires: three generations after introduction (generation 12)  the cryobank contribution to genetic diversity was less than 3% (Table ). When  was used as a selection criterion (considering  = 0.5)  without using cryobank bulls (scenario b2)  there was a per generation increase in the mean of trait B from generation 9 on (b1: -0.3 vs b2: +0.4)  while the genetic gain for trait A decreased (b1: +1.0 vs b2: +0.4  see additional file ). The change in breeding goals had no impact on diversity indicators. Combining the use of cryobank bulls and  as a selection criterion (scenario b3 for  = 0.5) resulted in a slight but significant ( < 0.001) reduction in average kinship (-0.3% between scenario b2 and b3  with 40% of the males from generation 9 sired by cryobank bulls  see additional file ). Concerning the selected traits  the genetic gain for trait A decreased slightly when cryobank bulls were used (-0.12 between scenarios b2 and b3   < 0.001)  while the genetic gain for trait B increased slightly (+0.06 between scenarios b2 and b3   = 0.02). These tendencies increased slightly when 80% of the males from generation 9 were sired by cryobank bulls (see additional file ). According to the results from Table   cryobank bulls contributed to 6.5% of the diversity three generations after their introduction. It should be noted that the cryobank bulls used were generally sampled in recent generations  their average birth generation being 6.6 (Table ). As a result of the increased weight of trait B within  (see Figure )  there was a per generation increase in genetic gain for trait B  while there was a slightly lower increase or even a decrease in genetic gain for trait A  as well as in average kinship  when trait B accounted for more than 80% of EBV. When only trait B was taken into account for   the genetic value of traits A and B reached 4.7 and 1.37  respectively at generation 12 (versus 8.4 and -0.41 respectively when  = 0.5)  while average kinship reached 8.9% at generation 12 (versus 11.9% when  = 0.5). . Scenario b3 and whole population are considered with the weight  of trait B increasing for computation of the total merit index. Black:  = 0 (scenario ); brown:  = 0.5; red:  = 0.6; orange:  = 0.7; green:  = 0.8; light blue:  = 0.9; dark blue:  = 1; o: genetic value for trait A; <U+2666>: genetic value for trait B; x: kinship . As shown in Figure   the use of cryobank bulls with a minimised kinship with the current generation (scenario d1)  had no impact if the selection policy was not modified  since none of the offspring of the cryobank bulls were selected as sires. Equalising progeny sizes on the sire to sire path alone (scenario d2) decreased diversity a little less (in generation 12   = 12% for scenario d1 and  = 11% for scenario d2)  with an almost negligible impact on genetic progress. Combining this option with the introgression of cryobank bulls (scenario d3) resulted in a significant reduction in average kinship (-2% in comparison to d1). Under such a scenario  the genetic mean of trait B also increased slightly (+0.3 between scenario d1 and d3   < 0.001)  while that of trait A and the average of both traits decreased slightly (-0.08 and -0.02 respectively  between scenarios d1 and d3   < 0.001). It should be noted that most of the cryobank bulls used originated from the founder population  their average birth generation being 0.3 (Table ). . The whole population is considered Brown: no change in selection; cryobank bulls used to produce 40% of male offspring (scenario d1); red: conservation of male lines (scenario d2) (curve overlapping the preceding one); yellow: conservation of male lines and cryobank bulls used to produce 40% of male offspring (scenario d3); o: genetic value for trait A; <U+2666>: genetic value for trait B; dotted line: average genetic value between A and B; x: kinship . Modifying which bulls entered the cryobank by preserving semen for all the young bulls did not significantly alter the results of scenarios b3 and d3  either for the selected traits or for kinship evolution (data not shown). It should be noted that in this case  the average birth generation of the cryobank bulls used was 7  in scenario b3 (instead of 6.6  in the first cryobank sampling method)  and 0  in scenario d3 (instead of 0.3  in the first cryobank sampling method). In this study  we assessed the impacts of using cryopreserved bull semen either to redirect selection or to improve the genetic variability of a selected cattle breed. Simulation parameters were chosen as a compromise between realism in the scenarios  their applicability  and the simplicity of the model. For instance  with respect to the choice of population size  a breed with 20 breeding males and 10000 potential dams could be considered quite small  especially with reference to the FAO endangerment status []. In our simulation  sires and dams were randomly chosen from lists of reproducers. This differs significantly from what occurs in real breeds  in which an unbalanced use of reproducers is frequently the case  leading to a reduced size of the effective population. In terms of effective size  our breed would correspond to a much larger population with a similar inbreeding rate per generation (1.07%) to that found in real dairy cattle breeds e.g. []. Concerning sampling conditions in the simulations  as mentioned above  the procedure chosen to select bulls for cryopreservation is similar to that currently applied in France. This choice was made to test if bulls selected this way could be effectively used in a selected breed. Compared to the case in which all young bulls are sampled for cryopreservation (which corresponds more or less to the current procedure in the Netherlands)  the results were basically the same. This shows that the French sampling procedure is reasonably efficient to select useful bulls  and could be applied in situations when only a limited number of semen samples can be stored in a cryobank (for financial reasons  for instance). One of the main conclusions of this study is that using cryopreserved semen is relevant for a breed for which major changes in selection objectives or practices are considered. Since genetic progress is rapid in dairy cattle breeds (e.g. [])  a bull for which semen has been stored for a few generations  is likely to have a lower genetic value than current bulls  if the selection goals remain the same. Thus the latter's offspring may not be used  as illustrated by scenarios b1 and d1  and using cryobank bulls is then meaningless. The results of scenario b3 demonstrate that using cryobank bulls has a significant impact on the selected traits and on genetic diversity only if a relatively large change is implemented in the selection programme (i.e. introducing a new trait formerly negatively selected but subsequently accounting for more than 50% of EBV). Under that scenario  when trait B accounted for less than 70% of EBV  the cryobank bulls selected were those more recently collected  since they generally had a higher value for trait A than older cryobank bulls  which compensated for a slightly lower value for trait B. When trait B accounted for 80% or more of EBV  most of the cryobank bulls finally used  originated from generation 0 (data not shown)  which explains the sudden decrease in average kinship after introgression of the cryobank bulls (see Figure ). Therefore if managers of a selection scheme want to redirect breeding goals  using cryobank bulls is viable only if the breeding goals are subjected to a major modification (i.e. if the weight of the new trait accounts for more than 50% of EBV). Our results also indicate that cryobank bulls that have been sampled for functional traits with high EBV will tend to be used more frequently than other cryobank bulls  independently of the aim. If the objective is to introduce genetic diversity into the breed  using cryobank bulls appears to be a valid choice. However  it is imperative that other measures are also taken to guaranty that genes are spread within the breed i.e. either conserving male lines (scenario d3)  when their use is promoted among breeders  or setting up more restrictive and effective breeding schemes. Several methods of varying complexity have been proposed to minimise kinship []  or to maximise breeding values for a predefined inbreeding rate []  or to minimise average kinship for a desired average EBV []  usually by optimising the contribution of reproducers. On the one hand  decreasing inbreeding in a selected breed may improve selected traits; for instance  it has been shown that in Holstein cattle  milk production (over 305 days) can decrease by about 20 litres per 1% inbreeding increase []. On the other hand  using semen from cryobank bulls has a negative impact on previously selected traits  as illustrated by our simulations. In the case of local breeds  in which genetic progress is not as effective as in breeds with a larger population size  the difference in EBV between current bulls and bulls from earlier generations should be minimised. This could lead to an effective use of cryobank bulls to reintroduce diversity without overly affecting selected traits. As an illustration in the Abondance breed  one of the male offspring of the bull born in 1977 was found to have quite a high EBV (Vaccin  born in 2003  [])  and was therefore recently confirmed as a sire of dams. Among all the sires of dams  this bull shared the lowest average kinship with the 2004-2007 female cohorts (4.6% vs. 6.5% on average  personal communication). The impact of using this bull on the genetic variability of the breed remains to be assessed. Based on our results  using semen from cryobank bulls should be useful either to introduce drastic changes in selection goals or to reintroduce genetic diversity within a given population. However  it is important to carefully assess the pros and cons of the potential changes in genetic diversity and values of the selected traits. Our simulations were based on a classic quantitative selection scheme. Recent progress in genomic tools should make it possible to identify semen from cryobank bulls that share specific alleles or QTL of interest for selection. This could then be taken into account when choosing cryobank bulls as well as how they will be used. Using such reproducers should be investigated in further studies  which opens exciting perspectives for an improved exploitation of cryobank collections.

In the era of marker density reaching million(s) and whole-genome sequence data  MixP provides a computationally feasible Bayesian method of analysis. Genomic selection (GS) is currently being adopted by the dairy cattle breeding industries around the world []. Genome-wide breeding value (GWEBV) prediction plays a pivotal role for this new technology. Its accuracy depends on the statistical methods used  the genome  the population structure  and trait heritability. GWEBV estimation methods are categorized based on the assumptions of their prior distributions of marker effects. Genome-wide BLUP (GBLUP) methods e.g. []  assume a normal prior distribution for all marker loci with a constant variance. In Bayesian methods  a more flexible prior distribution of SNP effects can be applied that allows for a few but with very large SNP effects whilst most are small or even zero. However  Bayesian methods often use Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) algorithms which make them computationally demanding. Meuwissen et al. [] proposed BayesB for the estimation of SNP effects  which assumes that a fraction (1 - ) of the SNP have no effect and  SNP have an effect with a -distributed prior that is more thick tailed than the normal distribution  i.e. it allows for a few SNP with very large effects and many SNP with small ones. Based on the work of [] and [] suggesting that normal priors give similar results as -distributed priors  Luan et al. [] used a mixture of two normal distributions as a prior  with probability  of the SNP effects coming from a normal distribution with a large variance and with probability (1 - ) from a normal distribution with a small variance. This was also justified by the observation that in practice GBLUP yields high accuracy []  which suggests that the best predictions are obtained if the SNP with small effects are not neglected. This mixture prior distribution has two unknown parameters    the variance of the SNP with large effects. These parameters are difficult to estimate partly because the true distribution of the SNP effects is probably not a mixture of two normal distributions. The Pareto principle  or the 80:20 rule  is often observed in economy and sociology []. It states that  for many events  roughly 80% of the effects come from the 20% biggest causes. This principle turned out to be widely valid in many fields  and can be generalized to (100 - ):   where 0  = 50. If  = 50  the effects are all equal (50% of the effects cause 50% of the variance). In this study  we tried to apply this principle for the prior distribution of the SNP effects  i.e. the % of the SNP with the largest effects cause (100 - )% of the genetic variance (). Given that  (= /100) and using the Pareto principle  the variances of the large and small SNP effects are  respectively: where  is the number of SNP  such that . Thus  assuming the overall genetic variance is known  applying of the Pareto principle reduces the number of unknown parameters of the prior distribution from 2 to 1  i.e. . The aim of this paper is to present this novel approach using the Pareto principle applied on individual marker loci (MixP)  and to compare it with other single SNP based GWEBV prediction methods in a real Norwegian Red cattle (NRF) pedigree  and on a real wheat dataset. For the estimation of SNP effects  we used the Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) algorithm of Meuwissen et al. []. The ICE algorithm is similar to the Iterative Conditional Mode (ICM) algorithm of [  ]  except that it estimates the mean instead of the mode of the SNP effects. The latter is because the posterior of the SNP effects may be bimodal []  in which case estimation of the mode does not make much sense (both modes may be quite far away from the mean). In order to simplify the estimation process  we will use a mixture of two normal distributions  with a 0 mean and variances  and   respectively  as a prior for the SNP effects  instead of the Spike and Slab distribution [  ] that was used by []. The normal and Laplacian distributions are reported to yield similar results [  ]. The latter is a more realistic distribution for gene effects []. Thus  the prior distribution of the SNP effects is assumed as a mixture of normals: where  is the effect of SNP ;  is the probability that the SNP effect belongs to the distribution of larger variance;  is the normal distribution density function with mean  and variance . Variances of the large and small SNP effects are  and   respectively and are known from the Pareto principle (equation ()) given that  is known. The model for the records is: where  is a ( × 1) vector of  records   is the overall mean;  is a ( × 1) vector of the  'standardized' SNP genotypes  i.e.   for SNP genotype '0 0'  '0 1'  or '1 1'  respectively  and SNP allele frequency ;  is the effect of the  th SNP genotype;  is the vector of environmental effects  with ; and summation is over all SNP. The algorithm estimates the effect of every SNP in turn in an iterative manner  where the effects of all other SNP are assumed to equal their current estimates in the iteration. In iteration []  let  denote the records corrected for  and for current solutions of all other SNP effects  except SNP   i.e. The expectation of the effect of SNP  given  is written out as: where  is the likelihood of the data   i.e.   where . Analogously  is defined with  replacing . In the numerator    where  is the standard BLUP estimate of  assuming that the prior variance of  is . Analogously   is calculated assuming a prior variance of . Thus   is the weighted mean of BLUP estimates of  assuming that the prior variance of  is either  or  and where the weights equal the posterior probability of either belonging to the first () or to the second distribution ((1 - )). As described above  the calculation of requires the inversion of the matrix  but the Appendix shows how to avoid this matrix inversion. Equation () is applied to every SNP in turn  whilst updating the values of  for the new solutions using Equation (). The mean is updated by the equation: Iteration is continued until the sum of the squares of the changes become less that 10 times the sum of the squares of the solutions. We refer this method as MixP. Two other estimation methods were compared. BayesB is implemented as in []  where the SNP with a small effect are assumed to come from a normal distribution with a small variance (instead of having no effect as in []). The variance of these small effects is sampled  and thus these small effects may be seen as modeling the polygenic background genes. As in the original BayesB  some SNP are allowed to have a big effect. The number of iterations for BayesB is 10000  and that for burn-in is 3000. The degrees of freedom for the inverse  distribution is 4.2. GBLUP is also used  as described in []. The Norwegian Red cattle pedigree used in this study consisted of 19523 individuals distributed over eight generations kindly provided by GENO AS (). The data also contained an identifier indicating whether a bull was genotyped or not. A total of 2165 bulls were genotyped including 104 imported bulls. We based our simulations on this real pedigree and assumed that the genotyped animals were those in the pedigree. The cattle population data was first sorted out to make sure that the parents were placed before their offspring. The 1915 oldest genotyped bulls were marked as the training set  and the youngest 250 bulls were marked as the evaluation set  i.e. for which EBV are predicted. The total genetic variance  and number of QTL were assumed as known parameters in this study. The parents of unknown origin were sampled from an ideal population of effective size 200 in each scenario  which was simulated for 10000 generations to achieve a mutation drift balance and linkage disequilibrium between the loci. The genome consisted of 1 Morgan/10 base-pairs. The mutation rate was 10 per base-pair per meiosis. Markers and QTL loci were randomly selected amongst those with an allele frequency greater than 0.05. The number of markers corresponded to those inherited from the ideal population  whereas various numbers of QTL and heritabilities were simulated. QTL effects were sampled from a Laplace distribution with a 0 mean and scale parameter = 1. The genotypes of the last generation were gene-dropped into the sorted real population pedigree. No additional mutation occurs at this stage. The 1915 training bulls were genotyped and phenotyped  and the 250 evaluation bulls were only genotyped. The heritabilities    used here should be interpreted as per chromosome heritabilities  i.e. they are about 30 times smaller than the total trait heritabilities (or reliabilities in case of daughter-yield-deviations). Three scenario parameters  i.e.  chromosome heritability   marker density ( = 100  200  500  1000  1500)  and number of QTL per chromosome ( = 5  30  100) varied in the simulation study. QTL were sampled randomly from the mutated loci in the ideal population simulation. Marker loci were then sampled randomly with a minimum allele frequency (MAF) of 0.05. Each scenario was repeated 100 times. The simulated genetic and environmental variances were also used to analyze the data by GBLUP  BayesB and MixP. The  value used for MixP was /  i.e. the ratio of number of QTL simulated to that of markers used. The publicly available wheat dataset as described in [] was used to test the methods on a real dataset. This dataset consisted 599 wheat lines. Grain yields in four different environments were recorded. These lines were typed at 1 447 loci. Markers with an allele frequency between 0.05 and 0.95 were used for the analysis. Ten replicates of a ten-fold cross-validation were done by randomly and evenly dividing the lines into 10 groups. In each replicate  each group was used as a validating set in turn. The correlation coefficients between GWEBV and phenotypes were averaged across all the validation folds and replicates for grain yield in each environment. The estimates of  for method MixP were optimized through a grid search with a step size 0.01 between 0.01 and 0.50. The heritability of grain yields used for the analysis was 0.34  0.30  0.41 and 0.37 for environment 1 to 4  respectively []. Accuracy of GWEBV estimations was measured by the correlation coefficient between GWEBV and true genotype values. Figures  and  show the accuracy of the alternative scenarios. . . From Figures  and   we can see that results from MixP and BayesB were very similar and better than the GBLUP methods. A comparison between Figures  and  showed that the accuracy increased with  and . Accuracy trends on  differed: the accuracy of MixP and BayesB decreased with increasing   as was found by []. The GBLUP method was as good as BayesB and MixP when the number of QTL is 100. It may also be noted that the accuracy of GBLUP was very much independent of the number of QTL  which is expected since GBLUP does not give extra weight to the SNP with big effects. Hence  it does not benefit from the fact that a few genes have a big effect. This can also be seen from the formula for the accuracy of GBLUP  as shown by [] and []  which depends on the number of independent segments in the genome  but not on the actual number of QTL. Table  summarizes the accuracies of the three methods  GBLUP  MixP and BayesB  on the wheat yields in all four available environments and shows that they are very similar. The estimates of   obtained by 10-fold cross-validation  were quite high  indicating that many markers had a large effect on the traits. The curve relating prediction accuracy versus  was fairly flat for values of  0.2 for all four yields (results not shown). Results of  = 0.2 for MixP are also listed in Table . Since  is not known in the wheat data  five alternative values were evaluated (0.05  0.1  0.2  0.3 and 0.4) in the BayesB method. Their accuracies are very flat  i.e.  no accuracy difference is greater than 0.01 within each trait. Estimates of  that give the top estimates for BayesB are also listed in Table . Table  shows the relative computational speeds  measured in CPU time of each method. With an Intel CoreDuo CPU E8500  the computational time needed for the GBLUP method is 0.14  0.34  0.72 and 1.13 seconds for 200  500  1000 and 1500 markers  respectively. Convergence was assumed for MixP and GBLUP when the sum of the squares of the deviations of the estimates of the SNP effects between subsequent iterations relative to the total sum of the squares of the estimates of the SNP effects was smaller than 10. Of all the scenarios  GBLUP is the fastest. The speed of MixP is in the same order of magnitude of that of GBLUP. BayesB is more than two orders of magnitude slower. The MixP algorithm typically converged within 50 iterations  and always converged in more than 4000 datasets. Here we applied the Pareto principle to estimate genome-wide EBV (GWEBV). Because a simple prior distribution was used  i.e. a mixture of normal distributions  an iterative method to calculate the BayesB type of GWEBV was obtained  which was called MixP. MixP yielded accuracies that were very similar to BayesB (Figures  and ). The latter is not surprising because the prior distributions of both MixP and BayesB are mixture distributions  putting a lot of weight on a few SNP with large effects and little weight on many SNP with small effects. For 100 or more QTL per chromosome  i.e. for more than 3000 QTL in a 30 chromosome genome with a marker density of 1500 per chromosome  there was no significant difference between MixP and GBLUP. Thus  the advantage of allowing for large SNP effects decreased when the number of QTL became large  which was also observed by Daetwyler et al. []. Because the estimated  values for grain yield were high (between 0.16 and 0.49)  it appears that grain yield was also affected by many QTL  which explained the small differences in accuracy between MixP and GBLUP (Table ). With the same wheat dataset  Crossa et al. [] reported a slightly higher accuracy by a few percents than that found here  but this may be explained by the fact that they simultaneously fitted a polygenic effect  which was not done here. The use of the Pareto principle reduced the number of hyper-parameters  i.e. parameters of the prior distribution  from 3 (    and ) to 2 ( and the total genetic variance ). We will assume here that the total genetic variance was known. An estimate of  could be obtained easily using the GBLUP model and a variance component estimation  which would provide an approximately unbiased estimate. If the total genetic variance was known  the number of parameters would be reduced to 1 ()  which could be estimated by cross-validation [] in real data situations. The reduction in number of parameters due to the use of the Pareto principle avoids the need for a multi-parameter cross-validation (for     and )  which implies searching through a grid of parameter combinations. If however the multi-parameter cross validation results in a parameter combination that does not adhere to the Pareto principle and is significantly better than the best Pareto principle parameter combination  multi-parameter cross-validation should be preferred to the Pareto principle. The latter will require a very large dataset to clearly demonstrate a significant deviation of the Pareto rule. The mean of the posterior distribution was used here to estimate SNP effects and to predict genetic values  which implemented the ICE algorithm of []. Alternatively  the posterior mode could have been used  which would have resulted in the ICM algorithm [  ]. However  the use of a mixture of normals as a prior may result in a bimodal posterior distribution  see []. In the case of a mixture of Laplacian distributions  bimodality did indeed occur []. In the case of a bimodal posterior  the mode of the distribution depends on which of the two modes happens to have the higher probability density  and may thus differ widely even when the posterior distributions are quite similar. It is well established in statistics that the posterior mean maximizes the accuracy of the SNP effects and consequently yields most accurate GEBV. Since this argument did not depend on the posterior being bimodal or not  we estimated the mean of all the considered posterior distributions  as described by equation (). Figure  shows the accuracy of GWEBV estimation with various . Only the scenarios involving a number of markers of 1500 and  were plotted. The prior  was used from 0.001 to 0.01 with a 0.001 step  and then to 0.50 with a 0.01 step. Accuracies were averaged over 200 repeats. The results show that unless  was not assumed to be much too small and the number of QTL was not small (in which case the QTL might have been mapped directly) the accuracy was not very sensitive to . Similar graphs were obtained for the other scenarios (results not shown).    . Alternatively  the two hyper-parameters (  ) can be estimated by MCMC estimation which 1) increases computation time significantly  and 2) may result in hyper-parameter estimates that are adapted to the current data  and will not perform well when used to predict records outside the current data  as is needed for genomic selection. An advantage of the MCMC algorithm is that the sampling also results in standard errors of the estimates. In the current algorithm  standard errors may be obtained from a parametric bootstrapping approach []. In this approach  replicated simulated data sets are obtained  where the estimates of the real data are to be taken as the true effects and randomly sampled error terms from the normal distribution are added to obtain simulated records. By estimating the SNP effects of the replicated data sets  the standard deviation of the SNP effects is obtained. The Pareto principle assumes a small but non-zero effect for the SNP with small effects  whereas the original BayesB of [] assumed no effect for such SNP. The assumption that the small SNP effects are real  implicitly implies that a polygenic effect is fitted where the marker-based relationship matrix is used to model the relationships between the animals. In the current and other simulation studies  this is usually not needed  as there are no background genetic effects next to the simulated QTL. However in real data  the fitting of a polygenic effect was found to outperform methods that did not allow for such polygenic effects []. In fact  in many cases  the fitting of only one polygenic effect  i.e. GBLUP  was found to yield the highest accuracy []. However  it may be expected that the increasing density of the SNP chips facilitates pinpointing QTL positions and methods such as BayesB and MixP will become relatively more accurate. It may also be noted that with  = 0.5  MixP reduces to GBLUP  i.e. optimizing the value of  can automatically result in GBLUP. The simulation results presented here assumed only one chromosome  whereas most species have many chromosomes. This was however compensated for by simulating only a small (per chromosome) heritability. Using the equation for accuracy from [] and []  we can see that accuracies remain unchanged if the genome size and the heritability are reduced simultaneously and proportionally  i.e.: where  is the number of training records   is the genome size  4 is the actual number of chromosome segments from population genetics results   is the ratio of effective and actual segments  so 4 is the effective number of segments. This proportional reduction of the genome size and heritability can greatly reduce the simulation time  i.e.  only around 1/30 of the computer time was needed here. Thus  using   we can compare the results obtained here with other results using a full genome size. The main advantage of MixP over BayesB is that MixP is more than two orders of magnitude faster (Table ). This is due to the fact that BayesB requires MCMC sampling and thus many cycles in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the mean of the parameters  whereas MixP requires a limited number of iterations. Hence  MixP will be able to handle high density SNP chips such as the currently available bovine 500-800k SNP chips  whereas the MCMC based methods such as BayesB are computationally too demanding to apply to half a million or more SNP and many thousands of training records. Let us assume the following model which fits a single SNP effect: where  is a ( × 1) vector of records;  is a ( × 1) vector of standardized SNP genotypes   is the marker effect of a single SNP (Var() = )  and  is a vector of error effects . The log-likelihood of this model comes from the multivariate normal distribution: where  is a constant and . The determinant of  can be calculated using only scalars: And since []: we have: where  is the BLUP solution of : Thus  the calculation of ' requires only some products of vector (' and ') and the calculation of   which was needed anyway in order to update the solutions in MixP.

After removal of 235 animals with the PAR-OFF test  SIBCOUNT (SIBREL) identified 18 (22) additional inconsistent animals. Seventeen animals were identified by both methods. The numbers of incorrectly deleted animals (Type I error)  were equally low for both methods  while the numbers of incorrectly non-deleted animals (Type II error)  were considerably higher for SIBREL compared to SIBCOUNT. Tests to remove Mendelian inconsistencies between sibs should be preceded by a test for parent-offspring inconsistencies. This parent-offspring test should not only consider parent-offspring pairs based on pedigree data  but also those based on SNP information. Both SIB tests could identify pairs of sibs with Mendelian inconsistencies. Based on type I and II error rates  counting opposing homozygotes between sibs (SIBCOUNT) appears slightly more precise than comparing genomic and pedigree relationships (SIBREL) to detect Mendelian inconsistencies between sibs. Use of many SNP genotypes to apply genomic selection in breeding programs is becoming common practice. With the increasing importance of this new information source  the need for tools to edit and check the quality of this data increases as well. One of the common editing steps for marker (e.g. SNP) data  is to check for Mendelian inconsistencies []. A Mendelian inconsistency occurs when the genotype and pedigree data of two related animals are in disagreement. A clear example is when an animal is homozygous for one allele (e.g. AA)  while its parent is homozygous for the other allele (e.g. CC)  i.e. the two animals have 'opposing' homozygote genotypes []. This may result from an error in the recorded pedigree  from genotyping errors  or from mixing up DNA samples and in very rare cases from mutations. Checking for opposing homozygotes is a commonly used test for example for paternity testing e.g. []. Mendelian inconsistencies are usually identified by comparing the genotypes of one or both parents to the genotypes of their offspring. This comparison is straightforward  since it only involves checking for each locus whether one of the two alleles that the individual has could have been inherited from one of its parents. The expected number of inconsistencies between a genotyped parent-offspring pair and the variance of this expected number is very low when opposing homozygotes only result from genotyping errors []. When two related genotyped animals are separated by more than one meiosis  the expected number of SNP with opposing homozygotes is greater than zero  even in the absence of genotyping errors. The expected number of opposing homozygous genotypes is related to the additive genetic relationship between two animals  since this relationship is equivalent to the expected proportion of identical by descent shared genome [  ]. The variance of the expected number of opposing homozygous genotypes  therefore  depends on the variance of the additive genetic relationship between two animals. The variance of relationships  in turn  was shown to depend on Mendelian sampling (i.e. the number of meiotic events between two animals) e.g. [  ]. A common example  where an animal's closest genotyped relative is separated by more than one meiosis  is when the other animal is a grandparent or a sib. In breeding schemes  only sires may be genotyped  such that the closest genotyped relative on the dam side is a maternal grandsire []. One or more sibs may be the closest genotyped relative(s) when the common parent(s) of the animals are not genotyped. More specifically  breeding populations may contain many genotyped (large) full or half-sib families. Extended pedigrees among genotyped animals provide the opportunity to compare the genotype of an animal to genotypes of multiple relatives  but this also increases the complexity of the comparison []. An alternative approach  compared to counting opposing homozygotes  is to derive relationships between all animals twice  using either pedigree or SNP information. When plotting pedigree and SNP-based relationships against each other  inconsistencies can be detected by identifying pairs of relationships that do not match by visual inspection of the scatter plot []. When  for example  the pedigree information indicates that two animals are full-sibs  with a pedigree-based relationship = 0.5  but the relationship based on the genotype information is close to zero  we can expect a pedigree or sample mis-identification. To allow routine use of this comparative approach  a documented set of rules that can be used in an algorithm is required. Therefore  the objective of this paper was to develop and demonstrate two tests  both comprising a set of rules that allow for the fast identification of sibs with conflicting genotype and pedigree information. The first test identifies sibs for which the number of contrasting homozygous genotypes does not match the expectation. The second test identifies sibs for which the pedigree and genomic relationships do not match. The performance of both tests was demonstrated on a dairy cattle dataset comprising predominantly genotyped cows. In addition  we derived the theoretical expectations and variance of the number of inconsistencies for unrelated animals  half-sibs and full-sibs  using observed allele frequencies. In this study  we compared two statistical tests to detect inconsistencies between pedigree and genotype information of supposed sib pairs. In both tests  the data was first checked for inconsistent parent-offspring pairs. Animals that were inconsistent with a supposed parent or offspring were detected  and problematic animals were iteratively removed  as described directly hereafter. Parent-offspring inconsistencies were detected by considering all pairs of animals that were supposed parent-offspring based either on the pedigree or the SNP information. For each genotyped pair of animals that were parent-offspring according to the pedigree  the number of opposing homozygous loci was counted. Two animals have opposing homozygous loci when one animal is homozygous for one allele  and the other animal is homozygous for the other allele. The realized distribution of the number of opposing homozygotes was used to define the threshold for declaring a parent-offspring pair inconsistent. Based on this distribution  we also identified all pairs of animals that were not parent-offspring pairs according to the pedigree  but that had a number of opposing homozygotes smaller than the threshold used for PAR-OFF similar to Hayes []. To avoid testing monozygotic twins  included pairs had to have different genotypes for more loci than the threshold applied by PAR-OFF for the number of opposing homozygote loci. All parent-offspring pairs that were identified based only on the SNP information  were also declared inconsistent. Inconsistent parent-offspring pairs were removed as follows. Both animals from inconsistent parent-offspring pairs were removed when both animals in the pair had no other 1 degree genotyped relatives. If the parent was already removed  due to inconsistency with its genotyped parent(s)  then the offspring was left in the data. When a parent had multiple genotyped offspring  it was removed only if it was inconsistent with more than 80% of its offspring. In all other cases  the inconsistent offspring were removed. After removing animals  locus-specific inconsistent genotypes of remaining parent-offspring pairs were set to missing for both animals. Then  the Beagle software [] was used to impute all genotypes for SNP with a known position on the 29 autosomes  that were either set to missing due to remaining locus specific inconsistent genotypes  or that were missing because of genotyping failures. An iterative approach was used to discard animals from the dataset that caused inconsistencies between pairs of sibs. In the first step  all inconsistent pairs were identified and in subsequent steps  the animal with the highest number of inconsistencies was iteratively removed from the dataset until no inconsistencies remained. Detection of inconsistent pairs of sibs was either based on differences between pedigree and genomic relationships (SIBREL)  or on the number of opposing homozygous genotypes (SIBCOUNT) between them. For each pair of genotyped animals for which pedigree records indicated that they were unrelated (i.e. that they had a pedigree relationship equal to zero)  half-sibs  or full-sibs  the number of opposing homozygous loci was counted. Empirical distributions of the number of opposing homozygous loci were used to define minimum thresholds for declaring inconsistent pairs of unrelated animals  half-sibs  and full-sibs. Animal pairs that had the same genotype for (almost) all loci were also identified. This last category was expected to contain pairs of monozygotic twins based on the SNP information  but may have been caused by samples being mixed up (e.g. allocating two samples of one animal to two different pedigree entries). In other datasets  this category could also include split embryos used in embryo transfer and clones from nuclear transfer. The empirical distributions of the number of opposing homozygotes were also compared to theoretically predicted distributions. The latter may be used when the number of observed relationships in a population for a given class is too low to obtain a proper empirical distribution. The expected number of opposing homozygous loci between two half-sibs is equal to   considering  bi-allelic loci with allele frequencies  and  . Likewise  the expected number of opposing homozygous loci between two full-sibs is   and between two unrelated animals this is . Derivations for these expected numbers of opposing homozygotes for all three categories  and the expected variance thereof  are given in Appendix A. Empirical distributions of pedigree and genomic relationships were first compared to expected distributions of relationships  which were derived in Appendix B. An algorithm was developed to efficiently compare pedigree and genomic relationships to identify inconsistent sib pairs. This algorithm comprises the following main steps that are explained in more detail below: calculate the pedigree relationship matrix for all genotyped animals with consideration of inbreeding using the complete pedigree information  calculate the genomic relationship matrix for all genotyped animals using genotype information  rescale the genomic relationship matrix such that the average genomic inbreeding coefficient is the same as in the pedigree relationship matrix  empirically derive the threshold for inconsistent pairs of half- and full-sibs  by identifying differences (i.e. lack of overlap) between distributions for different relationship classes  identify half- and full-sib pairs that are inconsistent based on the threshold defined under 4. The pedigree-based relationship matrix  was calculated using the algorithm of Meuwissen and Luo []. Genomic relationships were calculated as described by VanRaden []: where  is the frequency of the second allele at locus   and  is an incidence matrix that stores the genotypes of all animals at all loci.  is calculated as matrix  2( - 0.5). Matrix  contains elements -1  0  and 1 for the three possible genotypes  where 1 codes for the genotype that is homozygous for the second allele. Note that  contains identical-by-state relationships  rather than identical-by-descent relationships. This means that the generation in which the allele frequencies  are calculated  is considered to be the base generation  assuming that animals in that generation are unrelated. One way to put  and  on the same scale  is to estimate  for the considered base generation in  (i.e. the first generation of the available pedigree). For simplicity   were calculated across all genotyped animals  meaning that the current population is the base generation  which implies that the genomic relationships were somewhat underestimated. To deal with this underestimation   was rescaled as follows. The pedigree inbreeding coefficient was calculated for all animals  and averaged (denoted as ). The genomic inbreeding coefficients were assumed to be on average zero since  assumes that the current population forms the base generation. Finally   was obtained as: where  contains relationships relative to the same base as used in   and  is a matrix of all 1's. This formula to adjust  comes from Wright's F-statistics []. Elements of  were used in the comparison of genomic and pedigree relationships. First  all pairs of animals with a genomic relationship > 0.95 were identified. In the present dataset  only monozygotic twins could reach this relationship. Therefore  all such pairs that were not full-sibs according to the pedigree  were declared inconsistent. Secondly  based on the pedigree  all pairs of genotyped half- and full-sibs were identified. A half-sib or full-sib pair of animals  and   based on pedigree  was declared inconsistent  when The threshold <U+03B3> was chosen to be 0.2 for both half- and full-sibs  based on the empirical distribution of  -    as shown in the results section. After identification of inconsistent pairs in step one of methods SIBCOUNT and SIBREL  the removal of animals from the dataset in the subsequent steps was the same for both methods. For each animal  the number of inconsistent half-sibs and full-sibs was counted. Animals that caused inconsistencies were removed using the following steps: count for each animal the number of relationships it has for which the pedigree and genomic information are inconsistent  sort the animals based on descending number of inconsistent sibs  remove the animal that causes the largest number of inconsistencies; if that animal has only one genotyped sib  both animals are removed; when there is more than one animal with the largest number of inconsistent pairs  remove the animal with the lowest number of genotyped sibs  recalculate the total number of inconsistencies for all remaining animals by subtracting the number of inconsistencies associated with the animal that was removed; go back to step 1 and repeat until all inconsistencies are removed. Step 1 is the application of SIBCOUNT or SIBREL. After step 1  steps 2-4 were performed iteratively. In each iteration  the animal contributing the highest number of inconsistent sib pairs was assumed to have a real mismatch between pedigree and SNP genotypes and was therefore removed. The performance of the proposed SIBCOUNT and SIBREL tests was verified based on the type I and II error rates of declared inconsistencies. The type I error rate gives the proportion of false positive inconsistencies  i.e. animals that are deleted due to inconsistencies but for which differences between SNP and pedigree information are not due to errors in pedigree or genotype information. Note that in extreme cases  animals with many genotyping errors  i.e. animals with multiple loci having incorrect genotypes  may be deleted by either test. Applying a stringent threshold for the proportion of missing SNP genotypes  however  ensures detection and deletion of such animals in an earlier step. The type II error rate gives the proportion of false negative inconsistencies  i.e. animals that are not deleted because an inconsistency is not declared  while their SNP and/or pedigree information are incorrect. The type I and II error rates were both investigated as follows. First  all inconsistent animals based either on SIBCOUNT or SIBREL were deleted. This was done  to ensure that no animals were left in the data that could be deleted by either test. Secondly  the pedigree information for randomly selected 1  10 or 25% of the remaining animals was permuted against the SNP information. In this permutation step  the link between animal ID and SNP information was left unchanged  but the pedigree information (i.e. sire and dam ID) was randomly shuffled amongst the permuted animals. This permutation simulated a situation in which possibly existing sib relationships based on the pedigree were not supported by the genotype information and vice versa. Pedigree relationships between all pairs of animals were compared before and after permutation. For all animals with a permuted pedigree  we checked if there was at least one other animal that was either a half- or full-sib  both before and after permuting the pedigree information. Such animals were deleted in this replicate to make sure that permuted animals really had inconsistent SNP and pedigree information. Finally  the type I error rate was calculated as the proportion of animals that were removed although their pedigree was correct (i.e. not permuted) and the type II error rate as the proportion of animals not removed although their pedigree was permuted. This whole process was done twice  once preceded by the PAR-OFF test  and once without doing the PAR-OFF test. When the PAR-OFF test was performed  type I and II error rates for SIBCOUNT and SIBREL were calculated based on the permuted animals that were not removed by PAR-OFF. Average type I and II error rates were calculated across 50 replicates of the permutation. In total  2 359 animals with known pedigree were genotyped using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (54 001 SNP; Illumina  San Diego  CA). This data comprised Holstein-Friesian cows from experimental farms in Ireland  the UK  the Netherlands and Sweden  as well as sires of some of the genotyped cows. The quality control criteria for selecting the final set of SNP were a call rate of > 95%  a GenCall score > 0.2  and a GenTrain score > 0.55 (Illumina descriptive statistics relating to genotype quality)  a minor allele frequency greater than 1% for each country  and a lack of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on a <U+03C7> less than 600 []. Seventy animals with greater than 5% missing SNP genotypes were removed. After these initial checks  the data contained 2 289 animals with SNP genotypes for 36 884 loci. SNP on the X chromosome were not used because males only carry one copy of the X chromosome. The remaining 36 884 SNP had either a known position on one of the 29 autosomes or were not mapped to a chromosome. This edited SNP dataset contained 2 078 cows  and 211 sires. Sires had between 1 and 62 genotyped daughters. In total  the data contained 891 genotyped mother-daughter pairs  1 448 genotyped father-daughter pairs  and 508 animals without any genotyped parent. The number of SNP loci with opposing homozygotes was first calculated between all pairs of animals (Figure ). Based on the distribution of the number of opposing homozygotes between parent-offspring pairs (Figure )  it was assumed that for all parent-offspring pairs with more than 250 opposing homozygous loci  a conflict existed between the pedigree and SNP data. Likewise  the threshold was considered to be 2 150 opposing homozygotes for half-sib pairs (Figure )  and 1 250 opposing homozygotes for full-sib pairs (Figure ). The expected mean and standard deviation of the number of opposing homozygotes were calculated for full-sibs  half-sibs  and unrelated animals (Table )  and the corresponding distributions were plotted together with the empirical distributions (Figure ). The expected distributions of the numbers of opposing homozygotes supported the empirically derived thresholds. This indicates that the derived formulas can be used to derive thresholds instead of the realized distributions  when there are too few values to empirically derive a threshold for a given class of relationships. . Empirical ('bars') and expected distributions (smoothed line) of the number of opposing homozygotes between pairs of: A. all animals  B. parent-offspring pairs  C. half-sibs and D. full-sibs. Relationships were calculated for pairs of half- and full-sibs  using either pedigree or SNP information (Figure  and Table ). The expected mean relationships were smaller than the realized values (Table ) because inbreeding was ignored in the expected values. Variances of genomic relationships were much closer to their expectations than variances of pedigree-based relationships (Figure  and Table )  because genomic relationships track the real common portion on the genome. . Empirical ('bars') and expected distributions (smoothed line) of half-sib (A & B) and full-sib relationships (C & D)  where empirical distributions are based on pedigree (A & C) or genomic information (B & D). To visualize the relationship between the number of opposing homozygotes and the difference between pedigree and genomic relationships  both these variables were plotted against each other across all half- and full-sib pairs (Figure ). Based on Figure  a threshold of 0.2 was chosen for the difference in pedigree-based and genomic relationships to declare a pair of sibs inconsistent. We expected that this threshold would target largely the same pairs of sibs as the thresholds for Mendelian inconsistencies. . Number of inconsistent SNP loci versus difference between pedigree and genomic relationship for half- and full-sibs. Due to parent-offspring inconsistencies  235 animals were removed from the data  of which 12 animals were part of a parent-offspring pair based on the SNP data but which was not supported by the pedigree data. Deleting the 235 animals with parent offspring inconsistencies removed many inconsistencies between the genomic and pedigree-based relationships  as can be seen by comparing Figures  (including all animals) and 4B (after removing those 235 inconsistent animals). Using the SIBCOUNT test  which detects inconsistenties between sibs by counting opposing homozygotes  18 animals were removed. Using the SIBREL test  which detects inconsistencies between sibs by comparing pedigree and genomic sib relationships  22 animals were removed. Seventeen animals were removed by both methods. In Table   the number of declared inconsistencies for each sib class is given for both methods. Results show that for both methods  an inconsistency in half-sib relationships was the main reason to remove animals. The numbers of declared inconsistencies were very similar for the two methods. . Before excluding any animals (A)  after excluding animals based on parent-offspring Mendelian inconsistencies (B)  after excluding animals based on sib relationships (SIBREL; C)  and after excluding animals based on counted opposing homozygotes between sibs (SIBCOUNT; D). Type I and II error rates for SIBCOUNT and SIBREL were evaluated using the permuted data (Table ). Both methods were preceded either by the deletion of inconsistent parent-offspring pairs (by PAR-OFF) or not. The type I error rate  i.e. the proportion of incorrectly deleted animals  was similar for both methods. Both methods showed a clear increase in the type I error rate when a high percentage of the pedigree was permuted (25%). When inconsistent parent-offspring pairs were not deleted  type I error rates were higher for both SIBREL and SIBCOUNT than when they were deleted prior to the test. Type I error rates for PAR-OFF also increased with increasing percentage of permuted pedigree  similar to SIBCOUNT and SIBREL. The type II error rate  i.e. the proportion of incorrectly non-deleted animals  was considerably higher for SIBREL than for SIBCOUNT. Not performing PAR-OFF first  substantially decreased the type II error rates for both SIBCOUNT and SIBREL when 1% of the data was permuted  while they remained similar when 25% of the data was permuted. Type II error rates were quite high when only 1% of the animals was permuted. And for PAR-OFF they were only slightly affected by the percentage of pedigree permuted. To further gain insight on the performance of both tests  the absolute numbers of correctly deleted animals  and the number of type I and II errors were calculated (Table ). The results revealed that PAR-OFF is the most important test to delete Mendelian inconsistencies  as is also the case in the overall raw data. Furthermore  Mendelian inconsistencies not deleted by the PAR-OFF test (type II errors)  were largely deleted by the SIBCOUNT and SIBREL tests  as shown by the number of correctly deleted animals for both tests (Table ). When omitting the PAR-OFF test  the total number of correctly deleted animals decreased slightly  but the decrease was greater for SIBREL than for SIBCOUNT (Table ). At the same time  the total number of type I errors was somewhat different from that for SIBCOUNT or SIBREL alone  but no clear trend was observed in the differences. Clearly  the number of type II errors always increased when SIBCOUNT or SIBREL were performed alone  compared to when PAR-OFF was carried out first. The objective of this paper was to present two tests that comprise a set of rules for fast identification of supposed sib pairs for which genotype and pedigree information are inconsistent  either based on counting opposing homozygotes (SIBCOUNT)  or based on comparing pedigree and genomic relationships (SIBREL). Both algorithms performed similar in terms of type I error rate  but the SIBCOUNT algorithm performed better based on realized type II error rate. Both algorithms can be applied to edit SNP data that are obtained in an experiment or in a practical breeding program. Although we applied the methods to a dataset with relatively large (half-sib) families  both methods are expected to work equally well in populations with smaller (half-sib) families  judging from the clear distributions of the test statistics (Figure ). In the first steps  when removing parent-offspring inconsistencies (PAR-OFF)  the derived threshold of 250 inconsistent SNP was close to the value of 200 used by Wiggans et al. [] and more conservative than the cut-off value suggested from the distribution presented by Hayes [] and the 2% of SNP used by Weller et al. []. Applying a 2% threshold is equivalent to 777 conflicting SNP in the present study. We used 250 SNP  but using 777 SNP as a threshold would not have changed the list of deleted bulls in our data. Generally  SIBCOUNT and SIBREL performed similarly  as expected because the threshold for SIBREL was determined based on the corresponding count of opposing homozygotes (Figure ). Our results clearly indicate that the proportion of animals with 'true' mismatches between pedigree and genotype data had an effect on type I and II error rates. With more true mismatches  the chance increases that an animal is deleted in error because of multiple relatives that can cause observed inconsistencies (type I error)  while the animal that is causing the inconsistencies is not deleted (type II error). Type I error rates of the SIB tests  SIBCOUNT and SIBREL  were higher when they were not preceded by the PAR-OFF test. Type II error rates of the SIB tests were hardly affected by performing first the PAR-OFF test  when 10 or 25% of the data was permuted. However  when only 1% of the data was permuted  the type II error rate substantially increased for the SIB tests when they were preceded by PAR-OFF. Note that the type II error rates for the SIB tests are calculated as the proportion of animals with permuted pedigree that were not deleted. When the PAR-OFF is performed first  the type II error rate for the SIB tests includes animals with permuted pedigree data  which were deleted neither by the SIB test  nor by PAR-OFF. In this case  interpreting type I and II errors may be easier when comparing counts (Table ) rather than rates (Table ). In our data  the inflated type II error rates when using the SIB tests alone  indicate that the SIB tests alone can detect 94 to 99% of the Mendelian inconsistencies that would be detected if preceded by PAR-OFF. This means that the probability of detecting Mendelian inconsistencies for animals without any genotyped parent in our data was only slightly lower than for animals with at least one genotyped parent. The type II error rate for PAR-OFF was between 0.297 and 0.341. Of all genotyped animals that were included to calculate type II error rates  16% had no genotyped offspring or parent. Thus  those animals could not fail the PAR-OFF test and when permuted automatically contributed to the type II error rate. Therefore  it appears that the 'true' type II error rate for PAR-OFF for this data was ~0.14 to 0.18. Given the very high accuracy to detect inconsistent parent-offspring pairs  or to assign animals to parents using 50k SNP []  these type II error rates appear to be high. The most likely reason is that  in our implementation  the PAR-OFF test deleted only one animal of an inconsistent pair when at least one of the animals was linked to more than one inconsistent parent-offspring pair. In some of these cases  an animal that actually caused the inconsistency may erroneously have been left in the data. In this study  we limited the detection of Mendelian inconsistencies to parent-offspring  half-sib or full-sib relationships. Both algorithms presented can  however  be extended to check for Mendelian inconsistencies for other relationships  such as half cousins  double cousins  or uncle-nephew relationships. Extensions with other relationships may help to avoid deleting animals incorrectly  when limited numbers of 1 degree genotyped relatives are available. For the SIBCOUNT algorithm  the formula presented in this study can be extended to predict the expected numbers of opposing homozygotes between two animals with a particular relationship between them. For the SIBREL algorithm  general formulae that predict variances of a range of relationships have been presented by Hill and Weir []. Depending on the structure of the genotyped population  many animals may have e.g. several genotyped male ancestors that can be used instead. Wiggans et al. [] presented a test for opposing homozygotes between animals and their maternal grandsires  using a threshold of 16% opposing homozygotes. In this case  the expectation of the number of opposing homozygotes  comparable to those for sib pairs  is greater than zero because the compared animals are more than one meiotic event apart in the pedigree. With an increasing number of meiotic events between two evaluated animals  both the expected number of opposing homozygotes and the variance of this expected number increases. This in turn implies that the performed test will lose power when the number of meiotic events between two compared animals increases  because the distribution of the tested parameter becomes wider and will more easily overlap with the distribution of this parameter in unrelated animals  just by chance. The same applies for sib relationships used in SIBREL e.g. []. Although both methods presented here can be expanded to test any type of relationship  the question is whether such tests can detect true inconsistencies without jeopardizing the type I and II error rates. As demonstrated in our study  comparing empirically the number of opposing homozygotes against the difference between genomic and pedigree-based relationships provides a straightforward way to get insight into which method is expected to be more accurate for a given class of relationships. In our data  we removed ~10% of the genotyped animals  which is in line with reported values of misidentification in commercial herds of 5 to 13% [  ]. An important reason to remove data with Mendelian inconsistencies is that such errors in the data may reduce the power of subsequent analyses. From earlier studies  it is known that removing records with incorrect pedigree information increases genetic gain and improves the accuracy of traditionally estimated breeding values []. The impact of unidentified inconsistencies depends on what is the objective when using these data. When the objective is to estimate SNP effects that will be used in genomic selection  it is important that the link between genotype and phenotype data is correct. If  however  predictions for parent average are also included in the predicted breeding values  then the link between pedigree and phenotype data should also be correct. Unidentified inconsistencies are also expected to affect results of genome-wide association studies. For instance  Huang et al. [] reported that the power of genome-wide association studies decreases substantially when using imputed genotypes  even at low allelic imputation error rates. They postulated that to maintain power  the sample size should increase ~5% to 13% for each 1% increase in imputation error  in most populations. This study shows that tests for opposing homozygotes and comparison of genomic and pedigree-based relationships are powerful tools to detect sib pairs with inconsistent SNP and pedigree information. Counting the number of opposing homozygotes between pairs of sibs was slightly better at detecting inconsistent animals than comparing genomic and pedigree-based relationships  while both methods were equally likely to remove animals that in reality were consistent. Our results showed that tests to remove Mendelian inconsistencies between sibs should be preceded by a test for parent-offspring inconsistencies. These should be detected in two directions: 1) assuming that the pedigree is correct and test whether the SNP data of considered parent-offspring pairs is in agreement with the pedigree  and 2) assuming that the SNP data is correct and test whether the pedigree of considered parent-offspring pairs is in agreement with the SNP data. In all derivations below  we assume that animals are not inbred. The probability that an inconsistency occurs on SNP locus  between any two animals is equal to the probability that the first animal is homozygous for the first allele and the second animal is homozygous for the second allele  or vice versa. This is hereafter referred to as the probability that two animals have opposing homozygous genotypes. For two unrelated individuals in a population  given a frequency of  of the first (second) allele at locus   this probability is: . The number of expected opposing homozygotes across  loci for two unrelated animals  regardless whether any of the loci are linked to each other  therefore is: . For two half-sibs in a population  the probability that they have opposing homozygous genotypes is equal to the probability that the common parent is heterozygous (2 )  both half-sibs receive different alleles from the common parent (2 × 1/2 × 1/2)  and both half-sibs are homozygous  i.e. receive the same allele from the other parent as from the common parent ( ). This probability therefore is: . The number of expected opposing homozygotes across  loci for two half-sibs is: . For two full-sibs in a population  the probability that they have opposing homozygous genotypes is equal to the probability that both parents are heterozygous   both full-sibs receive different alleles from the first parent (2 × 1/2 × 1/2)  and both sibs receive the same allele from the second parent as from the first parent (1/2 × 1/2). This probability therefore is: . The number of expected opposing homozygotes across  loci for two full-sibs is: . The variance of the expected number of opposing homozygous genotypes at locus   can be derived by considering that this is the variance of a binomial variable: s(number of opposing homozygote genotypes) = (1 - ) where  is equal to the probability that two animals have opposing homozygous genotypes at locus . This probability is derived above for pairs of unrelated animals  half-sibs and full-sibs. The variance of the expected number of opposing homozygotes across  loci  involves both the variance at each of the loci  but also the covariance between any pair of loci. The covariance of the expected number of opposing homozygotes between loci  and  is equal to the probability that two animals have opposing homozygotes both at locus  and . Considering bi-allelic loci  with alleles 1 and 2 segregating at each locus  there are four possible haplotypes for loci  and : 11  12  21  and 22  with probabilities  (11)   (12)   (21)  and  (22). The probability that two unrelated animals have opposing homozygotes at both locus  and  is equal to the probability that the first (second) animal has two haplotypes 11 (22)  or vice versa  plus the probability that the first (second) animal has two haplotypes 12 (21)  or vice versa. The covariance in opposing homozygotes between locus  and  for two unrelated animals is equal to this probability  minus the probability that those animals are inconsistent between locus  and  due to chance rather than linkage disequilibrium between the loci (there are four scenarios  each with a probability of ): 2. For half-sibs  this covariance reduces by a factor 2  because animals need to receive a different haplotype from the common parent (which is only the case in two out of four possible scenarios). For full-sibs  this covariance reduces by a factor 4  because animals need to receive a different haplotype from the common parent (which is only the case in one out of four possible scenarios). Ignoring recombination for closely linked loci  and assuming linkage equilibrium for non-linked loci   (11)   (12)   (21)  and  (22) are simply the frequency of the haplotypes in the population. For unlinked loci  i.e. loci with an (expected) recombination rate of 0.5  E( (11)) =    E( (22)) =    E( (12)) =    E( (21)) =    and therefore the expected covariance in opposing homozygotes between unlinked loci  and  is equal to zero. Therefore  we consider only covariances between pairs of loci that are located on the same chromosome. Thus  the total variance of the number of opposing homozygotes between two unrelated animals is (for 1 chromosome with  loci): The first term is the sum of the variances of all loci. The second term is the sum of all covariances between SNP on the same chromosome. This  after re-arrangement by grouping expressions that contain similar terms  reduces to: And  realizing that  (11) =     (22) =    and  (12) =  (21) = 0  the formula can be more generally written as: Similarly  for two half-sibs  the total variance of the number of opposing homozygotes is And  for two full-sibs  the total variance of the number of opposing homozygotes is The variance of the total number of opposing homozygous loci across the whole genome is the sum of the above variances for all chromosomes. The expected variance of half-sib relationships was calculated using the following formula []:   where  is the genome size   is the number of chromosomes  and  is the length of chromosome . In this study we considered all 29 bovine autosomes. Therefore   was considered to be 30.14 M  using the values for  as reported by Ihara et al. []. For full-sib relationships  the expected variance is ( ) [].

Over-fitting increased estimation time and standard errors of the estimates but did not affect the estimates of genetic correlations or the predictions of breeding values  whereas fitting too few parameters affected bull rankings in different countries. Active international trade of semen and embryos of dairy cattle has created a need for global comparisons of genetic merit of sires. The International Bull Evaluation Service  Interbull  was established in 1983 to respond to this need. International breeding values of dairy bulls are currently estimated three times a year and they are expressed in the units of each member countries and are relative to each country's own base group of animals []. In order to accurately perform the evaluations  reliable genetic parameters  i.e.  variance components and genetic correlations  are required. Daughter groups in different countries are assumed to be genetically correlated but environmentally uncorrelated. Therefore  each biological trait under evaluation is treated as a different trait for each country participating in the international sire evaluation. Typically  some countries are very highly correlated. The multi-dimensionality and high genetic correlations create several problems such as over-parameterized models  increased sampling variances and an increased probability of parameters to be outside the boundaries of the parameter space  e.g. []. For restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation  these  in turn  complicate maximization of the likelihood and thus  exacerbate the time needed to estimate variance components. The number of countries participating in the international Holstein sire evaluation for protein yield in 2011 is 28. This requires estimation of a 28 × 28 (co)variance (VCV) matrix described by 406 parameters  if the genetic (co)variance matrix is considered to be unstructured. The current practice is to estimate this matrix by performing a number of separate analyses considering selected sub-sets of countries [  ]. The resulting estimates are then combined to build up the complete VCV matrix. Typically  this results in a non-positive definite matrix and a \"bending\" procedure is applied to ensure that the overall matrix is valid []. Principal component (PC) and factor analytic (FA) models provide a highly parsimonious structure for the VCV matrix compared to the standard multi-trait model  e.g. [  ] and they have  therefore  attracted considerable interest for their potential to ease the burden of the estimation process for multiple-trait across country evaluations (MACE) []. Both approaches decompose the genetic covariance matrix into pertaining matrices of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Each eigenvector  i.e.  PC  forms a linear combination of the traits  while the corresponding eigenvalue gives the variance explained. PC are independent of each other. The aim of the PC method is to detect all necessary components explaining variation in multi-dimensional data without loosing any important information. The first PC explains the maximum amount of genetic variability in the data and each successive PC explains the maximum amount of the remaining variability. For highly correlated traits  only the leading PC have practical influence on genetic variation and PC with a negligible effect can be omitted without impairing accuracy of estimation. Furthermore  the parameter reduction results in a rank reduction and in a reduction of the dimension of the mixed model equations. The FA method is related to the PC method but its approach is different. The traits studied are assumed to be linear combinations of a few latent variables  referred to as common factors. Any variance not explained by these is modelled separately  i.e. as trait-specific  by fitting corresponding specific factors. Due to the partitioning of variance into common and trait-specific variance  the number of factors needed to explain the variability in the data is normally notably smaller than the number of PC needed in the PC approach. Further  since the factors are assumed to be uncorrelated  substantial sparsity of the mixed model equation (MME) is gained compared to the standard unstructured multivariate analysis. However  the resulting (co)variance matrix is of full rank if all trait-specific variances are non-zero. Furthermore  factor axes can be rotated. Normally  this is done to ease their interpretation  but it also makes it possible to use the Cholesky parameterization that enhances the convergence rate of maximum likelihood estimation  e.g. [  ]. Madsen et al. [] were the first to suggest the use of reduced rank covariance matrices for MACE. Instead of using standard expectation-maximization algorithm for REML estimation of variance components for MACE  they studied the feasibility of exploiting an average-information (AI) algorithm that is known to be fast and effective. They developed an AI-REML algorithm  which evaluates for each round  whether or not the VCV matrix is positive definite. If a non-positive definite matrix is encountered  the original VCV matrix is decomposed and all eigenvalues less than the operational zero are replaced with a small positive number. Thus  their method is not a real reduced rank method in the sense that small or negative eigenvalues would have been removed. In turn  Leclerc et al. [] studied both PC and FA approaches for a sub-set of well-linked base countries  performing dimension reduction for this sub-set and then estimating genetic correlations between the remaining and the base countries  keeping the genetic correlations among the base countries fixed. When applying the approach proposed by Leclerc et al. []  special emphasis should be placed on selection of suitable base countries. Mäntysaari [] introduced a bottom-up PC approach that begins with a sub-set of countries and adds the remaining countries sequentially. By examining in each step whether or not the new country increases the rank of the genetic VCV matrix  the bottom-up approach only fits PC with non-negligible eigenvalues and thus avoids over-parameterized models. While this original study was performed with a simulated dataset  recent work has demonstrated the usefulness of this approach to estimate the variance components for MACE [  ]. Typically  the conventional PC analysis is done after the complete VCV matrix has been estimated. Then  the matrix is decomposed and if possible  its dimension is reduced. Kirkpatrick and Meyer [] suggested the direct estimation of the leading principal components (direct PC). However  this requires the appropriate rank to be known or to be estimated prior to the variance component analysis. Similarly  a VCV matrix imposing a FA structure can be estimated directly []. However  a too stringent parameter reduction should be avoided since selecting too low a rank can lead to biased estimates of genetic parameters [  ]. This is  because the number of available parameters is no longer sufficient to describe the (co)variance structure of the model adequately  and part of the genetic variance will be re-partioned into the residual variance. Furthermore  with more than one matrix to be estimated  the reduced rank estimator can be inconsistent  i.e. pick up the wrong subset of PC []. The risk of this happening when relatively few PC are considered is high. Both direct PC and FA approaches have been applied to beef cattle datasets and have demonstrated their potential to be used for large  multi-trait data sets  e.g. [  ]. In addition  the direct PC approach proved to be an appealing method to estimate variance components for MACE in a recent study []. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the utility of the factor analytic approach for variance component estimation for MACE and to assess the impact of alternative parameterizations  both PC and FA  for practical prediction of breeding values with MACE. Protein yield data from the August 2007 Interbull Holstein evaluation were used. A sire model with sire-maternal grandsire pedigree of 106 003 individuals was employed. The dataset comprised 116 941 de-regressed breeding values from 25 countries []. The number of bulls per country varied from 145 to 23 380  with a mean of 4 678 (Table ). Bulls were mainly used in one country; only 8% of the bulls (7 621) were used in more than one country and 0.3% of the bulls (286) in more than 10 countries. Common bulls were defined as bulls with daughters in both countries  without restrictions on the country of origin. The number of common bulls varied dramatically between countries  ranging from zero to 1 194. The number of common bulls was smallest between the French Red Holstein and other countries (min 0  max 73  mean 9) and largest between the USA and other countries (min 6  max 1 044  mean 410). For a more detailed description of the data  see []. The classical MACE model for the  sire  denoted as: and the random regression (RR) MACE model  denoted as: are equivalent but differently parameterized models. In both (1) and (2)   is a  vector of national de-regressed breeding values for bull  and  is a vector of  country/trait effects. In (1)   is a vector of  different international breeding values for bull  and in (2)   is a vector of  regression coefficients for bull .  and  denote incidence matrices assigning observations to respective effects. Decomposing the  ×  genetic co(variance) matrix of sire effects  Var() =  into  =  with  a matrix of eigenvalues and  the corresponding matrix of eigenvectors  gives Var() = . In (1) and (2)   is a  vector of residuals with Var() = diag(/)  where  is the sire variance   with  the heritability of country  and  the effective daughter contribution of bull  in country . In (2)  the breeding values of bull  have to be back-transformed to get  =  . For the estimation of variance components  we did not group animals with unknown parentage into genetic groups  but for prediction of the breeding values  genetic groups were used. The RR MACE model facilitates parameter reduction  when  has eigenvalues close to zero. Then  the principal components with the smallest eigenvalues can be omitted without impairing the accuracy of estimation. In that case   can be described as   where  is  ×  and contains the  leading eigenvalues and  is the  ×  matrix of the  corresponding eigenvectors  with  < . Now  the  random regression coefficients    are predicted for each bull and the breeding values can be back-transformed: . For the FA approach   is divided into vectors of common factors    with Var() =   and country specific effects    with . This gives  =   +   with  denoting the matrix of factor loadings []. The FA representation of the MACE model is expressed as: The FA approach models  as the sum of two terms: the common (co)variances and the trait-specific variances  i.e.   =  + . The number of parameters can not exceed ( + 1)/2  thus  <  factors explain the common covariances  e.g. []. If all country-specific variances are non-zero  the resulting model will not be of reduced rank  but is described very parsimoniously with  =  +  - ( - 1)/2 []. Contrary to the current practice of data sub-setting for MACE variance component analysis for protein yield in Holstein []  all the data in this study was included in a single VCV analysis for each model investigated. For the PC approach  estimates of  from several fits were obtained from a previous study []. The appropriate fit was chosen by performing several analyses encompassing a first  informed guess of the correct rank  which was obtained by decomposing the (co)variance matrix provided by Interbull and by studying the magnitude of the eigenvalues. Next  we examined Akaike's information criterion (AIC)  log L and behaviour of the PC from analyses using successive numbers of PC to determine the appropriate rank. For the model with an optimal fit  AIC should reach its minimum value and the increase of the Log Likelihood beyond the optimal fit is expected to be marginal. Furthermore  the magnitude of the leading PC and the sum of the eigenvalues should be stabilized  i.e. not change value as the number of PC fitted is increased. If this were not the case  it would be an indication that there was still notable re-partioning of the genetic variance into the residual variance  i.e. that too few PC had been fitted [    ]. For the direct PC approach  rank 19 (PC19) was selected as best [  ]. For comparison  analyses were also carried out using too low a rank (PC15) and full rank (PC25). For the FA approach  successive analyses fitting from seven to 12 factors were carried out and the best model was chosen following the same principles as for the PC approach. A model fitting nine factors (FA9) was chosen as best and results from the model fitting too few factors (FA7) are presented for comparison. In addition   values  defined as the square root of the average squared deviation of the estimated genetic correlations [  ]  were calculated to indicate the differences in the estimates of the genetic correlations between each tested fit and the reference model (PC19) for comparison. where  is the number of traits  is the estimated genetic correlation between traits  and  from an analysis fitting  factors. Estimated factors of the FA9 model were rotated to ease their interpretation. The purpose of rotating factors is to load variables as unambiguously as possible to the factors. In that case  each factor has only a small group of variables with strong loadings. Rotations can be classified into two groups: orthogonal and oblique rotations. In orthogonal rotation  factors do not correlate with each other: where  is an orthogonal transformation matrix. In oblique rotation  axes do not remain perpendicular. In this case  the rotation uses a general non-singular transformation matrix instead of the orthogonal transformation matrix []. By allowing factors to correlate with each other  it is easier to cluster variables and simplify their interpretation. In this study  we performed the oblique promax rotation. Calculations were carried out using the R Stats package []. After rotation  the matrix was sorted and the smallest loadings (with a cut-off of 0.2) were hidden to further ease interpretation. The number of parameters was 271  305  326  180 and 215 for PC15  PC19  PC25  FA7 and FA9  respectively. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood  using an average information algorithm as implemented in WOMBAT []. The genetic correlations obtained from the Interbull test run preceding August 2007 evaluation were used for comparison. Consequences of applying the obtained variance components for the more parsimonious PC and FA models for the practical prediction of breeding values with MACE were studied by monitoring the correlations between estimated breeding values (EBV) from the different PC and FA models. For this  EBV were predicted under the following models: PC25  which is equal to the classical MACE model  PC and FA models with the optimal fit (PC19 and FA9) and PC and FA models with too low a fit (PC15 and FA7). Furthermore  correlations between EBV from PC15 and PC19  from FA7 and FA9  and from PC19 and FA9 for each country were considered for four subgroups: A) bulls used only in their own country  B) bulls used in their own country and abroad  C) bulls used only abroad  and D) imported bulls. Breeding values were obtained using a preconditioned conjugated gradient iteration on data algorithm as implemented in MiX99 []. The information used for model selection for the FA approach is collected in Table . Based on AIC  fitting 9 factors was best  although the difference between FA9 and FA10 was very small. Mean values of the genetic correlations from the different fits were practically identical  although there were some differences in the distributions of the estimates from the different fits. Interestingly  based on the  values  genetic correlations from FA12 were closest to the estimates from the direct PC analysis under the optimal rank 19  but not to the genetic correlations from the optimal fit (FA9). Inspection of the sum of the eigenvalues derived from the variance due to common factors (Table ) and the country-specific variances from the different fits revealed that some re-partioning of the genetic variance occurred with decreasing fit. Part of the variance due to common factors was moved into the country-specific variance. As a consequence  the number of countries with zero country-specific variance decreased from 13 (fit 12) to five (fit 7) and the sum of the country-specific variances increased by 57%. Except for the first eigenvalue  the distribution of the variance due to common factors for the individual eigenvalues remained  however  quite constant between the fits. The first eight eigenvectors from the optimal fit (FA9) and the two bracketing fits  i.e. FA8 and FA10  are shown in Figure . As might be expected from the almost identical AIC values for FA9 and FA10  all their eigenvectors were virtually identical. However  eigenvectors from analyses fitting eight factors started to deviate from those fitting nine and 10 factors from the second eigenvector onwards  with a substantial deviation for the eighth eigenvector. The pattern of the eigenvectors from FA7 deviated even more from those for the optimal fit (results not shown)  indicating that fitting too few factors was associated with inaccurate estimation of the directions of the PC. In addition  overfitting PC had hardly any influence on estimation of the directions. This was not only the case for FA10  but also for FA11 and FA12 (results not shown). Results also indicated that the last eigenvectors of all tested fits were inaccurately estimated since their pattern deviated notably from the patterns of the eigenvectors of the models fitting more PC. Based on the simulation studies by Kirkpatrick and Meyer [] and Meyer []  inaccurate estimation of the last eigenvectors was caused by large sampling variances. However  this is of minor practical importance since the magnitude of the last eigenvalues is negligible compared to that of the leading eigenvalues  i.e. the last principal components contribute little to the estimate of the genetic covariance matrix (Table ). . Country codes: Canada (CAN)  Germany (DEU)  Denmark-Finland-Sweden (DFS)  France (FRA)  Italy (ITA)  The Netherlands (NLD)  United States of America (USA)  Switzerland (CHE)  Great Britain (GBR)  New Zealand (NZL)  Australia (AUS)  Belgia (BEL)  Ireland (IRL)  Spain (ESP)  Czech Republic (CZE)  Slovenia (SVN)  Estonia (EST)  Israel (ISR)  Swiss Red Holstein (CHR)  French Red Holstein (FRR)  Hungary (HUN)  Poland (POL)  South Africa (ZAF)  Japan (JPN)  Latvia (LVA). The matrix of rotated factor loadings is given in Table . Even with the rotation  their interpretation was not easy. In most cases  the possible interpretation seemed to be connected with the active trade of bulls between some countries and thus  with the strong genetic links created between them  see  e.g. []. Israel  South Africa and Japan import bulls predominantly from the USA  whereas the French Red population has only few links with the USA (factor 3). Furthermore  the highest proportion of imported bulls in Estonia  Poland and Latvia comes from Germany (factor 5). USA  France  Italy  Spain and Hungary have  in turn  strong links among others  mainly due to the trade of bulls from USA (factor 7)  whereas the Netherlands is a popular trading partner with countries like Germany  Denmark  Finland  Sweden  Belgium and Ireland (factor 8). New-Zealand  Australia and Ireland were positively weighted countries in factor 9. The common feature for these is that they all are grazing countries. Estimates of genetic variances from FA9  PC19 and PC25 were almost identical (FA9 and PC19 in Table )  except for some differences between approaches for French Red Holstein (PC19: 80.4 ± 9.06  PC25: 80.6 ± 9.16  FA9: 76.9 ± 8.60). The differences in estimates and their high standard errors can be attributed to the low number of the bulls (145) in this population (Table ). For FA9  there was substantial variation in the amount of the country specific variance. On average  the proportion of the total genetic variance attributed to country specific effects was 5%  with the highest proportions for Australia (19%) and Latvia (31%). Under the optimal fit (FA9)  in nine of the 25 countries/populations the genetic variance was totally explained by the common variance. These countries/populations were Switzerland  Great Britain  New Zealand  Czech Republic  Slovenia  Israel  French Red Holstein  South Africa and Japan. As shown in Figure  estimates of the genetic correlations for the FA and the direct PC approaches under the optimal fit were in good accordance. Further  Interbull and the direct PC full rank estimates presented for comparison (Figure )  as well as the estimates from the bottom-up PC approach [  ]  were consistent with these estimates. Standard errors of the estimates from the direct PC full rank model were larger compared to those obtained under the optimal fit PC and FA models. Thus  parameter reduction using factor analytic  direct and bottom-up PC models worked well for variance component estimation for MACE. Furthermore  compared to the analyses using under- or over-parameterized models  optimal fit resulted also in the shortest running times: FA7 14.5 days  FA9 3.5 days  FA11 31.5 days  and PC15 21.5 days  PC19 9 days  PC25 16.5 days. . Summary statistics for Interbull and the PC full fit estimates are presented for comparison. Quant. Refers to quantile. Correlations between EBV from the PC and FA approaches are in Tables  and . Results from the complete data are in Table  and results from the subsets of data in Table . EBV from PC19 and PC25 were identical. This was expected  given that the eigenvalues from 21 to 25 under the full rank model were zero []. The result shows that applying a PC model with the optimal fit has no practical consequences on ranking of the bulls. EBV correlations between PC15 and PC19 were lower than those between PC19 and PC25  demonstrating that the use of too low a rank affected the estimates. Results also indicated that the prediction of the EBV might be more sensitive when using too low a fit under the direct PC approach than under the factor analytic approach (Tables  and ). In most cases  EBV correlations from the FA and PC approaches under the optimal fit were unity or close to unity (Tables  and ). EBV correlations were less than 0.99 only for Slovenia  the French Red Holstein population and Latvia in the complete dataset (Table ). These were the countries/populations with the lowest number of records and weak ties with the other countries. The mean number of common bulls between French Red Holstein and the other countries was as low as 9  and those for Latvia and Slovenia were 29 and 32  respectively. Thus  the results indicate that the use of the FA approach under the optimal fit has no practical consequenses on the ranking of bulls. All EBV correlations were unity in the subgroup A (bulls used only in their own country). In all studied subgroups  EBV correlations from the FA9 and PC19 were unity or close to unity  except in subgroup C (bulls used only abroad) for Slovenia  French Red Holstein and Latvia (< 0.99  Table ). Correlations between EBV from PC15 and PC19 and from FA7 and FA9 tended to be lower than those between FA9 and PC19  but they were still very high. The only exceptions with correlations of 0.99 or greater occurred in subgroup C for Israel  French Red Holstein and Latvia. It was expected that subgroup C would be the most challenging group to analyse since the EBV were predicted based on correlated information only. Results agreed well with a previous study  in which the FA and PC approaches under the reduced rank RR MACE models were applied  but in which the variance components used for the predictions were provided by Interbull []. Using the PC19 model reduced the number of equations in the mixed model by 24% compared to PC25. For simplicity  the FA model was implemented as a standard multivariate model using  with a FA structure  instead of an extended FA model discussed by Thompson et al. []. Due to this  model FA9 provided no advantage of using more sparse coefficient matrix in the MME. Times required for solving mixed model equations ranged from 5 min (PC19) to 7 min (FA9). Thus  differences in the computing times were of no practical significance. The random regression representation of MACE facilitates exploitation of principal component or factor analytic approaches for variance component estimation and prediction of breeding values for international sire evaluations. Both PC and FA allow a reduction of the number of parameters to be estimated  and both methods benefit from the more parsimonious variance structure. Genetic parameters from different approaches were very similar when the optimal number of PC/factors was fitted. Computing time for estimation of variance components was shortest under the optimal fit. Overfitting increased the standard errors of the estimates  but had no visible impact on the estimates or on prediction of the breeding values. Fitting too low a number of parameters affected  in turn  bull rankings in different countries. Interbull.

The French genetic evaluation model takes into account the number of lambs suckled by applying a multiplicative factor (1 for a lamb reared as a single  0.7 for twin-reared lambs) to the maternal genetic effect  in addition to including the birth*rearing type combination as a fixed effect  which acts on the mean. However  little evidence has been provided to justify the use of this multiplicative model. The two main objectives of the present study were to determine  by comparing models of analysis  1) whether pre-weaning growth is the same trait in single- and twin-reared lambs and 2) whether the multiplicative coefficient represents a good approach for taking this possible difference into account.MethodsData on the pre-weaning growth rate  defined as the average daily gain from birth to 45 days of age on 29 612 Romane lambs born between 1987 and 2009 at the experimental farm of La Sapinière (INRA-France) were used to compare eight models that account for the number of lambs per dam reared in various ways. Models were compared using the Akaike information criteria.ResultsThe model that best fitted the data assumed that 1) direct (maternal) effects correspond to the same trait regardless of the number of lambs reared  2) the permanent environmental effects and variances associated with the dam depend on the number of lambs reared and 3) the residual variance depends on the number of lambs reared. Even though this model fitted the data better than a model that included a multiplicative coefficient  little difference was found between EBV from the different models (the correlation between EBV varied from 0.979 to 0.999).ConclusionsBased on experimental data  the current genetic evaluation model can be improved to better take into account the number of lambs reared. Thus  it would be of interest to evaluate this model on field data and update the genetic evaluation model based on the results obtained."

The model that best fitted the data assumed that 1) direct (maternal) effects correspond to the same trait regardless of the number of lambs reared  2) the permanent environmental effects and variances associated with the dam depend on the number of lambs reared and 3) the residual variance depends on the number of lambs reared. Even though this model fitted the data better than a model that included a multiplicative coefficient  little difference was found between EBV from the different models (the correlation between EBV varied from 0.979 to 0.999). Based on experimental data  the current genetic evaluation model can be improved to better take into account the number of lambs reared. Thus  it would be of interest to evaluate this model on field data and update the genetic evaluation model based on the results obtained. The total weight of lambs weaned per ewe is an important component of meat market production and is a function of litter size  lamb survival and lamb growth. Pre-weaning growth is a complex phenotype that is influenced by two distinct components: direct and maternal effects. The maternal effect is a strictly environmental effect on the offspring []; it arises from the mother's ability to produce the milk needed for growth and her maternal behaviour. The direct component corresponds to the suckling behaviour and growth ability of the young. It has been shown that these two components are heritable in sheep (as reviewed by Safari et al. []). The pre-weaning growth of lambs is highly dependent on the number of lambs born and suckled []. The number of suckling lambs modifies both the mother's milk production [  ] and the suckling/competition behaviour of the young []. Based on the work of Ricordeau and Boccard []  the French genetic evaluation model for pre-weaning growth [] accounts for this effect by applying a multiplicative factor () to the maternal genetic effect ( = 1  0.7 and 0.5 for one  two and more than two suckling lambs  respectively)  in addition to including the birth*rearing type combination as a fixed effect  which acts on the mean. However  to date  no other argument justifying the use of this multiplicative model has been reported. Furthermore  the model seems to suffer some drawbacks since it has been reported from the field that the maternal EBV of ewes having previously reared single-suckling lambs decreases very much if they rear two or more lambs in a subsequent year. Consequently  the aim of the present study was to determine 1) whether pre-weaning growth is the same trait in single- and twin-reared lambs; i.e. to determine whether the number of lambs suckling affects the variance components that act on pre-weaning growth  2) whether applying the multiplicative coefficient represents an appropriate solution to account for such heterogeneity  and 3) whether  when the multiplicative coefficient is applied  the maternal EBV of ewes having previously reared single-suckling lambs decreases markedly if they rear two lambs in a subsequent year. To address these objectives  we compared eight models that allowed for heterogeneity of the various variance components for the average daily gain from 0 to 45 days of age in Romane sheep as a function of the number of lambs reared. Data from Romane lambs born between 1987 and 2009 at the experimental farm of La Sapinière (INRA-France) were used in this study. This experimental population is the nucleus flock of the composite sheep strain INRA401 []. Only data from lambs reared as a single or twins were retained for analysis (29 612 observations  18% reared as singles  82% as twins). All animals were bred in the same system. During the 1987-2009 period  ewes were managed under two schemes. The management scheme used during the first part of the period is described in detail in []; briefly  ewes were first exposed to rams in April at 16 ± 1 months of age. Ewes that lambed in September were mated again in October at 22 ± 1 months of age. Then  for subsequent lambings  ewes were mated once a year in July-August. No lambs were retained as replacements from the first two lambings of a ewe. During the second part of the 1987-2009 period  ewes were managed under the following scheme (Figure ): they were first exposed to rams in July at 10 ± 1 months of age. From April to September  the ewes were kept outside and then lambed indoors in December. No lambs from the first lambing were retained as replacements. The ewes were then mated once a year in April and lambed in September. These adult ewes were on pasture from mid-May to mid-July  from November to December and from February to April. Lambs were reared with their mothers from birth to weaning (60 days). . Lambs were weighed at birth and at 45 days of age (on average 44.5 days (± 4.3) for single- and 44.8 days (± 3.7) for twin-reared lambs) using a standardized method (i.e. same animal restraint method  same weight scale). Resulting weights were used to calculate the average daily gain (ADG) between birth and 45 days. The average ADG was 254.9 g.d (± 62.1) for all lambs  304.3 g.d (± 62.7) for single-reared lambs and 243.7 g.d (± 56.2) for twin-reared lambs. The distribution of ADG is shown in Figure . Pedigree information was established for 33 304 animals with minimal sire misidentification. Data are summarized in Table . . Data were analyzed using eight distinct models which were all sub-models of the following \"global\" model: where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to single- and twin-reared lambs  respectively;  is the vector of measured ADG for single- (i = 1) or twin-reared (i = 2) lambs;  is the vector of fixed effects;  is the vector of direct genetic effects;  is the vector of maternal genetic effects;  is the vector of permanent environmental effects for the dam;  is the vector of litter effects;  is the vector of residuals;          are the corresponding known incidence matrices. All random effects were distributed as centered normal distributions with variance covariance matrices equal to  for the genetic effects  where  is the relationship matrix   for the permanent effects   for the litter effect  and  for the residual effects  and where  are identity matrices of appropriate size. The first seven models (mod(1) to mod(7)) assumed no multiplicative coefficient for the maternal genetic effect  regardless of the number of lambs reared  that is . The corresponding tested models differed at the parameter level  the latter being estimated in the covariance matrices (Table ). Mod(1) corresponded to the classical single trait model: regardless of the number of lambs reared  the direct (maternal) genetic effects () and the maternal permanent effects () were identical  and the variance of the litter effect () and the residual variance ( ) did not vary. Mod(2) assumed that the maternal permanent effect depended on the number of lambs reared. Mod(3) allowed the residual variance to differ between single- and twin-reared lambs. It should be noted to allow for identifiability  mod(3) (and  for the same reason  mod(4) to mod(7)) considered no litter effect for observations on single-reared lambs; i.e. . Mod(4) assumed that both the maternal permanent effect and residual variance depended on the number of lambs reared. Mod(5) (mod(6)) assumed  in addition  that the direct (maternal) genetic effect differed between single and twin-lambs. Finally  mod(7) corresponded to the global model  in which all parameters were estimated (except ). The last model (mod(coef)) was derived from the French indexation method of accounting for the heterogeneity between single- and twin- reared lambs. Mod(coef) made the same assumptions as mod(1) but considered  in addition  a multiplicative coefficient for the maternal genetic effect  i.e. . All the fixed effects and one-way interactions of biological relevance included in the models were selected beforehand in a step-wise manner  using nested models that were compared with the likelihood ratio test (including interactions with rearing type). The following effects were tested: type of birth  sex of the lamb  year  season  age of the dam  age of the sire  and age of the lamb at weighing. Models were fitted using the mixed procedure of SAS 8.1 (SAS  version 8  1999). After removal of non-significant effects  the following combinations of effects were retained: type of birth*sex of the lamb  year*season  and age of the dam for each rearing type. All models were fitted using Asreml software []. Estimates of heritability was computed based on resulting estimates of variance and co-variance components  based on  for the maternal effect and  for the direct effect. Models were compared using the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Once the most parsimonious model which best fitted the data had been identified  the estimated EBV were compared to those obtained with mod(coef). Furthermore  the stability of EBV estimations for females having reared single and then twin lambs was compared for mod(coef) and the model which best fitted the data by reanalyzing two data subgroups: data1 included all records prior to 2005 (23 521 records  5 214 dams) and data2 included all records prior to 2006 (25 385 records  5 590 dams). The year 2005 was selected as a cut-off date because it ensured us with a maximal number of \"selected\" females (43)  i.e. females that reared twin lambs for the first time in 2006 after having reared single lambs at least twice before. We then investigated  for all two methods  whether the selected females showed a reduced EBV when compared to the group \"all females\". For these comparisons  we 1) compared maternal EBV obtained with data1 and data2  2) performed the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the distribution of rank between \"selected\" and all other females (i.e. all females excluding selected females)  and 3) compared the number of \"selected\" females in each quartile of the EBV distribution in 2005 and 2006 based on the Chi-square statistic of the 2 × 4 contingency table. The variance components and AIC obtained with the different models are presented in Table . A comparison of the different models shows that both the direct effects and maternal genetic effects were the same for single and twin lambs (AIC between mod(7) and mod(5) or mod(6) and mod(4) for direct effects  and between mod(7) and mod(6) or mod(5) and mod(4) for maternal effects). The maternal permanent effect differed between single and twin lambs (comparison of mod(4) with mod(3)). Heterogeneity was observed between the residual variances for single and twin lambs (comparison of mod(2) with mod(4)). Mod(4) shows the lowest AIC. This model assumed heterogeneity of residual variances and that the dam permanent effect differed between single and twin lambs. Estimates of heritabilities obtained with the different models were consistent (Table ). The heritability of the direct effect was moderate and ranged from 0.12 to 0.16 for single-reared lambs and from 0.14 to 0.15 for twin-reared lambs  depending on the model. The heritabilities obtained for maternal effects were low for all models and ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 for single-reared lambs and from 0.05 to 0.10 for twin-reared lambs. The genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects was low and did not differ from 0 in all models. When the maternal permanent effect was considered to be different for single- and twin-reared lambs (mod(2) and mod(4) to mod(7))  the variance of the permanent effect of dams was higher for single-reared lambs (ranging from 416.21 to 719.60 depending on the model) than for twin-reared lambs (ranging from 211.30 to 219.31  depending on the model). The correlation between the two permanent effects was generally high  ranging from 0.60 to 0.76 depending on the model  but different from 1 (AIC between mod(4) and mod(3)  between mod(2) and mod(1)). The results were consistent for the different models that assumed heterogeneous residual variances (mod(3) to mod(7)). The residual variance was higher for single-reared lambs (1.1 to 1.4 fold) than for twin-reared lambs. Litter variance represented 7 to 12% of the total variance  depending on the model. Correlations between the EBV obtained with the model showing the lowest AIC (mod(4)) and mod(coef) are presented in Table . Correlations were high: 0.979 for maternal effects and 0.998 for direct effects. The percentage of animals in common among animals with the 10% highest or the 10% lowest EBV for the two models was high for the direct effect (93 and 96%) and slightly lower for the maternal effect (79%). In order to determine whether the maternal EBV of ewes that previously reared single-suckling lambs decreases when they subsequently rear two or more lambs (\"selected\" females)  comparisons of EBV obtained in 2005 and 2006 with the model that best fitted the data (mod(4)) and mod(coef) based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the chi-square statistic are presented in Table . For both models  the mean EBV for selected females were not significantly different in 2005 and 2006 (p = 0.45 and p = 0.24 for mod(4) and mod(coef)  respectively). None of the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were significant  indicating that no differences could be observed in the position of the \"selected\" females in comparison to all females  regardless of the model or the year of evaluation. Finally  for both models  the chi-square statistic of the contingency table which compared the number of \"selected\" females in each quartile of the EBV distribution in 2005 and 2006 was not significant (p > 5%). All these results indicate no evidence of a decrease of the maternal EBV of ewes that rear twins for the first time after previously having reared only single lambs. The data we used came from an experimental farm  which provides some advantages over field data. For instance  weight recordings were performed in a standardized manner; weight at birth was measured within 12 h after lambing and weight at day 45 was measured very close to the actual 45 day of life. This avoided approximations by interpolation in the calculation of the ADG. However  the use of such experimental data has the disadvantage of including relatively few records and special attention must be paid to make sure that the data can disentangle direct and maternal effects. In this particular dataset  we are confident that this is the case for single trait analyses (mod(1)) because of the strong genetic relationships between individuals  especially cousin relationships. The mean number of records per dam  sire and maternal granddam for single reared-lambs was low (1.5  6.1 and 8.6  respectively). However  these animals were also parents of twin reared-lambs. Consequently  records from twins provided the necessary information to estimate random parameters for single reared-lambs (if correlated) and helped to disentangle the direct and maternal effects for single reared-lambs when estimated in the case of multiple-trait assumptions. This was confirmed by the consistency of the estimates of heritabilities and correlations between models. We decided to analyze the hypothetical differences between single- and twin-reared lambs by testing for differences between singles and twins for all random components of the model. At present  the results reported in the literature are in favour of a difference between the effects associated with singles and twins. Concerning direct effects  it has been reported that the behaviour of single-reared lambs is different from that of twin-reared lambs. On pasture  single-reared lambs were usually further from their dams than were multiple-reared lambs []. It has also been shown that single lambs suckled less frequently but longer than twins [  ]. In other species  it has been reported that the behavioural mechanisms of sibling competition range from very aggressive interactions  through various milder agonistic interactions  to scramble competition []. Although  to our knowledge  such mechanisms have not been reported in sheep  we can assume that competitive behaviour also exists in this species. With regards to maternal effects  the lactation curve differs between ewes nursing single and twin lambs. Ewes suckling twins have been shown to produce more milk than those suckling single lambs; their peak yield is reached during the 3 week of lactation  compared with the 4 week for ewes with single lambs  and they show higher persistency [  ]. Furthermore  ewes with twins have higher milk fat levels and produce more milk energy than those with single lambs []. From a genetic point of view  these differences could be interpreted as differences in both the ewe's and lamb's environmental conditions depending on the number of lambs reared. However  the results we obtained did not support the hypothesis of a genetic by environment interaction between single and twin lambs  which we evaluated with a multiple-trait model; the genetic correlation between the direct (maternal) effects for single or twin lambs was not significantly different from 1 and their variances did not differ. These results are not consistent with those obtained by Buvanendran et al. []  who reported that genetic variance and heritability were greater for twins  although heritabilities were not significantly different. Our results demonstrate that the maternal permanent effect was not the same when ewes reared single versus twin lambs. The permanent effect of dam accounts for all environmental factors related to the dam that are not explicitly incorporated in the model but which modify the non-genetic component of the maternal environment and therefore influence the growth of the lambs. A difference in permanent effects of dams for single versus twin lambs indicates that some of those unaccounted factors exert different effects depending on the number of lambs reared. One of these factors could be impairment of one quarter due to mastitis  which would have a negative influence on the ability of the ewe to rear two lambs but not on her ability to suckle a single lamb. Our results for the relative importance of the litter effect (7 to 12%) are in the range of those reported in previous studies (0.11 []) or slightly lower (0.26 to 0.31 []). The litter effect is a combination of everything that affects members of a litter in the same way  including environmental conditions that are not accounted for by the other effects included in the model  and maternal temporary environmental effects (ewe*year effect in our case). The results obtained here are in favour of different residual variance for single- versus twin-reared lambs. The raw data showed that single lambs have a higher ADG and a higher standard deviation than twins. The difference in variance was not due to a mean and variance relationship. In fact  the data were normally distributed and the slope of the regression linking the standard deviation of the raw data to the mean (with 10 g steps) was null (3.2.10). Variances of dam permanent and residual effects were higher for single- than twin-reared lambs. One possible explanation for these differences is that  in the case of single-reared lambs  the observed ADG represents the \"optimal\" growth that can be obtained for the corresponding lamb-ewe-environment combination  while the competition between twin-reared lambs results in only part (%) of this optimal growth to be expressed. In other words  if we only consider random factors:  where refer to the observed ADG for the single or twin lamb  of ewe   respectively  and other notations are the same as for the general model. Under this assumption  the variances of all random factors for single lambs are higher than for twins and this is consistent with the results obtained in this study. In fact  although not significantly different from 1 for the genetic effects  the ratio between the variances of random factors for single and twin lambs varied from 0.7 to 0.9 for the different factors in mod(7). Although convenient  this hypothesis oversimplifies the problem because the correlation between the permanent effects of the dam is not equal to 1 between single- and twin-reared lambs. Our estimates of heritability are consistent with most of the heritabilities reported in the literature for pre-weaning ADG in sheep. Bromley et al. [] reported heritabilities varying from 0.07 to 0.20 for direct effects and from 0.04 to 0.05 for maternal effects  depending on the breed. In a review  Safari et al. [] reported an average heritability of 0.15 for the direct effect and 0.05 for the maternal effect. Heritability was also higher for the direct effect (0.21) than for the maternal effect (0.01) in Mousa et al. []. Hagger []  when comparing models in two breeds  obtained heritabilities varying from 0.08 to 0.16 for direct effects and from 0.02 to 0.10 for maternal effects. On the contrary  Snowder and Van Vleck [] reported a low heritability for direct effects (0.03) and a higher heritability for maternal effects (0.28). Estimates of the genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects obtained in previous studies vary to a much greater extent  from -0.52 [] to 0.52 []. Our close to 0 estimate of the genetic correlation is consistent with the review by Safari et al. (-0.02 (0.08)) []. It is a well-known fact that estimates of this correlation are particularly sensitive to data structure [] but  as previously mentioned  working with experimental data from a single herd probably overcomes this bias. The genetic parameters used in the French genetic evaluation model are heritabilities of 0.20 for the direct effect and 0.30 for the maternal effect  and -0.4 for the genetic correlation  (J.P. Poivey  personal communication). The discrepancy between these parameters and those estimated in the present study indicates that it may be of interest to update the parameters for field data. We did not find any spurious changes in the maternal EBV of ewes rearing twin lambs for the first time after having reared single lambs the previous years  as had been reported from the field. One explanation for this result is that problems reported from field data are due to the quality of the data recorded  especially absence of recording lamb deaths which introduces bias in the type of rearing factor. This problem does not exist for the experimental data used for this study. In this study  we focused on the possible heterogeneity of variance components for pre-weaning growth in sheep due to the number of lambs reared in order to check if the multiplicative coefficient assumptions made in the French genetic evaluation system are valid. Several other factors have been reported in the literature to affect early growth but are not included at present in the French genetic evaluation model and can introduce biases. A non-exhaustive list of these factors is the following: an environmental covariance between dam and offspring [  ]  sire*year  sire*herd*year [  ]  sire*dam  dam*number born [] combinations  etc. The importance of these factors should be tested on field data when updating the French genetic evaluation model. The objective of this study was to evaluate the best way to take account for differences in pre-weaning growth between single- and twin-reared lambs in comparison with the method used at present in the French genetic evaluation model. Our results show that the genetic effects do not differ between single- and twin-reared lambs  that the permanent environmental effect of dams depends on the number of lambs suckled  that the residual variance is different for single and twin lambs and that it is better to consider these assumptions than to apply a multiplicative coefficient to the maternal genetic effect. Given these results from experimental data  it would be of interest to compare a model that includes all these new assumptions with the model used at present for the genetic evaluation in other breeds with field data and update the genetic evaluation model based on the results obtained.

A deletion in exon 12 of   so far reported only in Norwegian goats  has been found at high frequency (0.73). Such a high frequency is difficult to explain because the national breeding goal selects against the variant's effect.MethodsIn this study  575 goats were genotyped for 38 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) located within the four casein genes. Milk production records of these goats were obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Goat Control.

A deletion in exon 12 of   so far reported only in Norwegian goats  has been found at high frequency (0.73). Such a high frequency is difficult to explain because the national breeding goal selects against the variant's effect. In this study  575 goats were genotyped for 38 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) located within the four casein genes. Milk production records of these goats were obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Goat Control. Test-day mixed models with additive and dominance fixed effects of single SNP were fitted in a model including polygenic effects. Significant additive effects of single SNP within  and  were found for fat % and protein %  milk yield and milk taste. The allele with the deletion showed additive and dominance effects on protein % and fat %  and overdominance effects on milk quantity (kg) and lactose %. At its current frequency  the observed dominance (overdominance) effects of the deletion allele reduced its substitution effect (and additive genetic variance available for selection) in the population substantially. The selection pressure of conventional breeding on the allele with the deletion is limited due to the observed dominance (overdominance) effects. Inclusion of molecular information in the national breeding scheme will reduce the frequency of this deletion in the population. Under normal conditions  the milk of mammals contains 30-35 g of protein per liter []. In the milk of ruminants  more than 95% of these proteins are synthesized from six structural genes []. The two main whey proteins  a-lactalbumin and ß-lactoglobulin  are encoded by the  and  genes  respectively []. The four acid-precipitated proteins (caseins) - a-CN  ß-CN  a-CN and <U+03BA>-CN - are encoded by four tightly linked casein genes []. These four casein loci are found in the following order:      and  within 250 bp on caprine chromosome 6 [  ]. In goats and other ruminants  casein represents about 80% of the total proteins []. Casein genetic variants have been identified and characterized in different species (for a review see Ng-Kwai-Hang and Grosclaude []). Caroli et al. [] have reported a comparison among casein genetic variants in cattle  goat and sheep. Analysis of caseins in goats is complex due to extensive polymorphism in the four casein loci []. The  gene has a 16.5 kb long transcriptional unit composed of 19 exons  which vary in length from 24 bp to 358 bp []  and 18 introns []. So far  more than 16 alleles have been detected and grouped into four classes based on different expression levels of a-CN in the milk. \"Strong\" variants (               and ) produce around 3.6 g of a-CN per liter of milk []  \"medium\" variants ( and ) produce 1.6 g of a-CN  \"weak\" alleles ( and ) produce 0.6 g of a-CN [  ] and \"null\" alleles (    and ) result in absence of the a-CN fraction in milk [      ]. The ß-casein  which is encoded by the  locus  is the major casein fraction in goat milk []. The  gene consists of nine exons varying in length from 24 bp to 492 bp []. Three  genetic variants (A  B and C) are associated with a normal ß-CN content [  ] and two null alleles (0 and 0') result in absence or a reduced level of ß-CN [  ]. Caroli et al. [] have reviewed the genetic variants of ; seven variants have been identified among which five are associated with a normal a-CN level  one with a low level and one resulting in no a-CN []. At the  locus  15 polymorphic sites have been identified leading to 16  alleles and 13 <U+03BA>-casein variants [    ]. Several studies have analyzed the effects of the polymorphism of casein genes on dairy performance and milk quality in different goat breeds [  ]. They have revealed that polymorphisms in the  locus have significant effects on casein content  total protein content  fat content and technological properties of milk. It has also been reported that <U+03BA>-casein () variants have a significant influence on milk production traits [  ]. Norwegian dairy goat is a landrace  reared throughout Norway and mainly kept for milk production. In this population  38-40 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified within the four casein loci and used in several studies []. Most of these polymorphisms are located in the promoter regions of the genes: with 15 SNP in   six in   five in  and 13 in . A deletion in exon 12 of   so far only reported in Norwegian dairy goats  has been found at a high frequency (0.73  []). This deletion and a deletion in exon 9  at lower frequency (0.08  []) also described in other breeds  are believed to contribute to the unusually high frequency (0.70  []) of \"null\" a-CN in Norwegian goats milk. Three polymorphisms have been identified at this position of exon 12 and coded as allele 1  3 and 6 []  i.e.  allele 1: CTG TAC (deletion)  allele 3: CTG TAC and allele 6: CTG TAC. Allele 1 is associated with a reduced level of dry matter (DM) content in milk and influences the physico-chemical properties of milk [    ]. The primary goal in the national goat breeding programme is to increase DM production per goat and year  but also to increase the DM content in milk to improve milk quality. In light of this breeding goal  the high frequency of allele 1  which decreases DM yield  is difficult to explain. So far  in this population  only the average production per genotype of the daughters of bucks with known genotypes has been studied []. Thus  it has not been possible to identify dominance effects. In this study  milk producing goats were genotyped  and both additive and dominance effects of genes were determined. We investigated the effect of SNP within casein genes on Norwegian goats' dairy performance and milk taste.  Blood samples were collected from goats of six farms located in southern Norway and genomic DNA was isolated according to standard procedures. Genotyping of 38 SNP was performed with the Sequenom MassARRAY genotyping platform [] using the assay and genotyping protocols described by Hayes et al. []. Identities of the SNP and genotyping conditions are included in additional file  (see additional file ). Thirty-eight markers - 36 SNP  one deletion  and another position with a deletion or two alternative bases (A or G) - located over the four casein loci were investigated. The deletion and the A or G are named 'SNP14'  but have three alleles as explained above. Table  presents a summary of the 38 markers (or SNP) used in the study i.e. fourteen SNP in  (seven in the promoter  six in the exons  and one in an intron)  six SNP in  (five in the promoter and one in an exon)  four SNP in  (all in exons) and 14 SNP in  (13 in the promoter and one in an exon). The SNP numbering follows Hayes et al. []. The extent of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these casein SNP was calculated and visualized using the HaploView program []. The LD was measured by  and displayed as shades of grey (the intensity of the grey color relates to the amount of LD between the SNP). Additional information such as the total length of each casein locus and the distances between adjacent casein loci were obtained from literature [  ] and from the bovine genome [].  The Norwegian Dairy Goat Control recording system collects data from all flocks participating in milk recording (74.1% of all goat flocks in 2005 [])  involving both flocks within and outside the buck-circle system []. Records from the six farms with genotyped goats were used for this analysis. In each farm  only genotyped goats with kidding date between August 2004 and August 2005 were considered and the phenotypic records correspond to the 2005 production year.  refers to the test-day amount of milk in kg as the sum of morning and evening milk production for a single goat. DMY is recorded at least five times per farm per year. For this study  a total of 3194 DMY were available from 575 genotyped goats.  includes milk fat content  protein content  and lactose content measured as percent of total milk; somatic cell count (logSCC) and free fatty acids (logFFA) concentration in milk. These measurements are Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra based predictions. Among the test-day milk samples  at least three are analyzed for milk content (for either morning or evening milk or both for a test-day). For this study  2236 milk content measures were available for the 575 genotyped goats.  is an organoleptic evaluation of milk taste by dairy personnel on a scale 1 to 4  depending on how much stale/rancid taste the milk has (\"besk/harsk\" are the Norwegian terms used for the evaluation of milk taste). The scale is defined as 1 - there is no stale/rancid taste  2 - trace of strong stale/rancid taste  3 - a stale/rancid taste detected and 4 - stale/rancid taste is strong. For this study  1352 milk taste scores belonging to 499 genotyped goats were available from five of the six farms.  7325 pedigree records including the 575 genotyped goats were available. The genotyped goats are progenies of 157 bucks. The pedigree file contains full identification of individuals and their parents. A maximum of seven generations back in the pedigree were considered when constructing additive genetic relationship matrix (A).  the variance components used in the analysis are presented in Table . These variance components were obtained from the Norwegian Association of Sheep and Goat Breeders (Norsk Sau og Geit  NSG)  which is responsible for running the goat breeding scheme and calculating breeding values. In this study  variance components estimated in January 2009 based on a large dataset were used (unpublished). To separate the effect of single SNP from additive polygenic effects  a mixed model was fitted to our dataset. Two slightly different models were used to analyze different traits.  a single trait test-day mixed model was used to analyze the individual SNP effect on daily milk production in kg  milk composition traits  somatic cell count (logSCC) and free fatty acid (logFFA). Each SNP effect was fitted as a fixed effect and analysed for one SNP at a time (i.e. the model was run 38 times per trait). Where: trait: test-day measure of a trait µ: fixed effect of the mean DIM15: fixed effect of stage of lactation  defined in 15-days intervals ( 15   where . YS: fixed effect of the kidding season .

Q = [Q Q] was set for  and  effects as follows:  A slightly different model was used to estimate individual SNP effects on milk taste. Due to fewer observations available for this trait compared to other milk production traits  a longer interval (30 days) was used to account for the effect of stage of lactation (DIM). No polygenic effect was included (because milk taste is not included as a breeding criterion and reliable variance component estimates from a large dataset are not available). To account for genetic relatedness  milk taste scores were corrected for bucks' effects prior to modelling. The correction was done through fitting bucks as a fixed effect in a linear model and collecting the residuals. The residuals of the taste scores were then fitted as in model 2. The model components were as defined in model 1. Dominance effects of SNP2  SNP11  SNP18  SNP19  SNP20  SNP24 and SNP29 were not estimated because the number of homozygous goats for the rare alleles of these SNP was either very low or zero. For these SNP  Q was set as 2  1  and 0 if the SNP is homozygous for the major allele  heterozygous and homozygous for the other allele  respectively. Gene substitution effect    for a SNP is the average change of genotypic value that results when one allele is replaced by the other allele of same locus []. Estimated additive (a) and dominance (d) effects of SNP were collected from model 1 and model 2  and gene substitution effects ( ) were calculated ( =  +(1-2  )[]); where p is the frequency of the major allele at l SNP position. In the analysis of single SNP fixed effects  the three alleles at exon 12 of  (SNP14) were first treated as a deletion (allele 1) or a non-deletion (alleles 3 and 6) in both models. In order to quantify the effect of this polymorphism more precisely  the fixed effects of the six possible genotypes ('1/1'  '3/3'  '6/6'  '1/3'  '1/6'  and '3/6') were also analyzed separately. The effects of these genotypes were also estimated using models 1 and 2  replacing the SNP effect term. To determine the significance of the effect of single SNP  the null hypotheses that there is no additive effect of a SNP (a = 0) and the null hypotheses that there is no dominance effect (d = 0) were tested. The student t-distribution was used to test the significance of each SNP effect on each trait. Due to multiple testing  a Bonferroni threshold correction was applied to obtain a 5% overall error rate when testing for the 38 SNP per trait. The effective number of independent tests was determined using a method that takes the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure into account as described in Cheverud (2001) []. If the dominance effect (d) of a SNP was significant  the degree of dominance (k = d/a) was determined for the SNP. If k was greater than 1  the significance of the overdominance effect was checked by testing :  > 0. Also  the null hypotheses that there is no difference between the  genotype '1/1' (homozygous for deletion) and each of the other five exon 12  genotypes were tested. Scripts were written for each model and run in  statistical software (R Development Core Team) []. Figure  is a graphical representation of the extent and distribution of LD within the four casein loci in Norwegian dairy goats. Pairwise LD values used to create the figure are given in additional file  (see additional file ). Figure  includes  SNP 1-14   SNP 15-20   SNP 21-24 and  SNP 25-38. A substantial amount of LD was observed among the casein SNP. The observed LD varied from completely linked (r = 1  black) to no LD (r = 0  white). Figure  shows that  SNP are in stronger LD with  SNP than they are with SNP of the  and  genes. It also shows the  SNP are in strong LD with  SNP. . Each diamond indicates the extent of pairwise LD measured by r between the SNP specified; the darker the color  the higher the r value (white  r = 0; shades of grey  0 < r < 1 and black  r = 1); the r values used to generate this graphical representation are given in additional file  (see additional file ) The test statistics of estimates for the major alleles at each SNP position are plotted in Figures    and . Figures  and  present t-statistics values for additive (a) and dominance (d) effects of single SNP on milk production traits. Individual SNP show a similar pattern of additive effects for protein and fat content in milk (Figure ). At most positions  the observed t-statistics for protein percentage are higher than for fat percentage. Among the SNP within   only SNP14 deletion (allele 1) significantly reduces both fat and protein percentages at the chosen error rate. Two SNP within  (SNP25 and SNP26) had significant negative effects for protein percentage with an opposite trend for milk production in kg. The major allele of  SNP24 was associated with a significantly lower milk yield at the chosen error rate (Figure ). . Test statistics (estimated effects divided by their standard errors) are embedded in the y-axis; the horizontal lines indicate 5% experiment-wise level of significance and any SNP having a test statistic value for a trait above the top line or below the bottom line indicates that it has a significant effect on the trait. .

Test statistics (estimated effects divided by their standard errors) are embedded in the y-axis; the horizontal lines indicate 5% experiment-wise level of significance and any SNP having a test statistic value for a trait above the top line or below the bottom line indicates that it has a significant effect on the trait. A cluster of SNP at  (SNP27-SNP29 and SNP31-SNP34) had a tendency to increase protein % and fat % and to reduce milk production in kg. However  few of these SNP had significant additive effects: SNP28  SNP34  SNP36 and SNP37 for milk production in kg  SNP27  SNP31  SNP33  SNP34  SNP36 and SNP 37 for protein % and SNP34 for fat % (Figure ). Almost all the SNP within  and  loci had opposite additive effects on milk yield and milk content traits. The deletion in exon 9 of  (SNP11)  which results in the absence of detectable a-casein []  did not show any significant additive effect  but also did not follow the pattern of the neighbouring SNP. The dominance effects of casein SNP for milk production in kg  protein %  fat %  and lactose % are presented in Figure . As for additive effects of these SNP  similar patterns of dominance effects was observed for protein % and fat %. Only the deletion in exon 12 of  (SNP14) had significant dominance effects for milk production in kg and milk composition (the heterozygote at this position had significantly higher milk production in kg  and lower protein %  fat %  and lactose % than the average values of the homozygotes). As for the additive effects  all SNP in the  locus had opposite dominance effects on milk yield and milk composition traits (Figure ). For the traits with significant dominance  the degrees of dominance are presented in Table . The ratios are between 0.5 and 1  indicating partial dominance  for protein % and fat % and higher than 1  implying overdominance  for milk production in kg and lactose %. The overdominance effects of SNP14 are significant () for milk production in kg and weakly significant () for lactose % (Table ). Single SNP fixed additive effects on milk taste and free fatty acid (logFFA) concentration in milk are presented in Figure . Additive effects of casein SNP on milk taste follow a pattern similar to that of FFA concentration in milk (Figure ). The deletion in exon 12 of  (SNP14) showed a significant additive effect on milk taste - i.e. was associated with a stronger rancid/stale taste - at the chosen level of significance. However  none of the SNP had significant additive effects on FFA concentration in milk (Figure ). No significant dominance effects on either of these traits were found (results not presented). Figure  presents the gene substitution effect () of SNP14 for the estimated additive (a) and dominance (d) values depending on the different allele 1 (deletion) frequencies. Results of the other SNP are not presented here. Figure  shows that the gene substitution effect of the SNP decreases when the frequency of allele 1 increases for milk yield  and becomes negative for allele frequencies above 0.74. For lactose %  the substitution effect would be zero if the frequency of allele 1 were 0.87 and positive for higher frequencies (Figure ). The magnitude of the gene substitution effect is also reduced for protein % and fat %  becoming less negative with an increasing frequency of allele 1  but remaining negative (Figure ). . Gene substitution effects of SNP14 on milk yield in kg  protein %  fat % and lactose %. The effects are plotted against the frequency of allele 1; the substitution effects are given in kg or % according to the traits. A) Variances due to SNP14 for milk yield in kg  protein %  fat % and lactose %; the variances are plotted against the frequency of allele 1 of SNP14 The contribution of the gene substitution effect of SNP14 to the additive genetic variance is presented in Figure . This Figure shows that the variance increases for fat % and protein %  reaches maximum and then decreases as the frequency of allele 1(deletion) increases. For milk production in kg and lactose % a similar trend of variance is observed  but after reaching zero at 0.74 for milk and 0.87 for lactose there is a small additive variance contribution for higher allele 1 frequencies. The variances reach their maximum values at frequencies for the allele 1 below 0.5 differing somewhat for the four traits (Figure ). The maximum variance contribution of SNP14 might attain approximately half the additive genetic variance given in Table  for protein and fat percentages  and less for lactose percentage and milk yield in kg. The estimated effects of the six genotypes at exon12 of  (SNP14) and the significance tests to compare the differences between the five genotypes and the homozygous genotype for allele 1 ('1/1') are presented in Figures  and . Figure  shows that '3/6' goats produced less milk production in kg () and more lactose () than '1/1' goats. '1/3' goats had a lower lactose % () compared to '1/1' goats. All five genotypes were associated with a significantly higher protein % in milk than that in '1/1' goats. Goats homozygous for allele 1 also had a lower milk fat % compared to '3/3'  '6/6'  '1/6' and '3/6' (Figure ). . The bars indicate ± SE  and asterisks indicate a significant difference from genotype homozygous for the deletion ['1/1'] (***  p < 0.01; **  p < 0.05; *  p < 0.1) . The bars indicate ± SE  and asterisks indicate a significant difference from genotype homozygous for the deletion ['1/1'] (***  p < 0.01; **  p < 0.05; *  p < 0.1) All the five genotypes - '3/3'  '6/6'  '1/3'  '1/6'  and '3/6' - were significantly associated with less strong milk taste compared to genotype homozygous for the deletion (Figure ). This Figure also shows that the '1/1' genotype led to a significantly higher FFA concentration in the milk in contrast with '3/3' '1/3' '1/6' and '3/6' genotypes. In addition  although the '1/1' goats had the highest somatic cell count (logSCC)  the difference was only weakly significant for the '1/6' genotype (  Figure ) The effects of casein polymorphisms on dairy performance of different goat breeds have been reviewed across countries [  ]. A previous study on Norwegian goats [] reported on an association analysis between the casein genotypes of bucks and the daughters' yield deviation (DYD). In this study  both genotype and phenotype information of milk producing goats was used to investigate casein SNP dominance effects in addition to their additive effects. Unlike in the aforementioned study []  we identified single SNP of  and  genes significantly associated with milk production in kg and milk contents (Figure ) and a SNP in the  gene that was significantly associated with milk taste (Figure ). One explanation for the higher significance revealed in our study  could be that family analysis in a segregating population cannot disentangle the fixed additive and dominance effects and thus only gene substitution effects could be studied []. The substitution effect analysis of SNP14 (Figure ) showed that allele 1 had low allele substitution effects on milk and milk composition traits at its current frequency in the population. This contributes to the small effect found in the previous dataset []. Effects of  polymorphism on milk fat content have been reported in several goat populations [  ]. To explain this unexpected effect  rather than a direct genetic cause  it is hypothesised that the absence of a-casein disrupts the intercellular transport of caseins  which in turn disturbs the secretion of milk lipids [  ]. Our observation on the allele with a deletion in exon 12 of   which probably leads to \"null\" a-casein  is associated with a reduced fat content of milk (Figure  and )  is in line with this hypothesis. Hayes et al. [] have proposed that the observed higher SNP effects at  locus might not be due to direct genetic effects  but rather to the fact that the SNP are physically associated with the causative mutation responsible for the observed variation. However  data reported in other breeds strongly confirmed the effect of <U+03BA>-casein polymorphisms on milk production traits [    ]. The observed additive effects of  SNP on protein percentage and milk yield (Figure ) in this study are in agreement with those findings. The single SNP analyses did not detect any significant associations between casein SNP and FFA concentration in milk (Figure ). However  when analyzing separately the six genotypes at SNP14 position  a significant variation in FFA concentration was observed (Figure ). Ådnøy et al. [] have also reported significant association between  genotypes and FFA concentration in milk in goats from two flocks of the same Norwegian breed. FFA are released into the milk through the action of lipase on fat molecules leading to lipolysis [] and this lipolytic activity may affect negatively the sensory quality of the milk and its products [] because of the unpleasant flavor produced during this process. Even though several other factors contribute to the taste of goat milk []  genetic variants at SNP14 position could explain part of the significant variations in milk taste (Figure  and ). This might be related with the FFA concentration in the milk. The results show that genotypes associated with a high concentration of FFA in milk are also associated with a strong milk taste (Figure ). It has been suggested [] that milk from goats with \"weak\"  alleles have higher post-milking lipolytic activity than milk from goats with the \"strong\"  alleles. In our study  the \"weak\" alleles (genotype homozygous for allele 1) tend to be associated with a higher FFA concentration in milk (Figure ) and support the suggestion. For SNP14  dominance effect (d) was significantly greater than additivity (a) for milk yield in kg and lactose % (Table )  implying an overdominance effect for these traits. Based on the estimated a and d  the genetic variances of SNP14 are small at the existing gene frequency (0.73) for milk production in kg  fat  protein and lactose % (Figure ). Lynch and Walsh [] have described that in case of overdominance  there is always an intermediate allele frequency at which genetic variance is equal to zero. Figure  shows that the genetic variance of SNP14 is zero at allele frequencies of 0.74 and 0.87 for milk production in kg and lactose %  respectively. The variances became zero (Figure ) when the respective gene substitution effects cross the x-axis (Figure ). A primary breeding goal of Norwegian dairy goat population is towards high DM production of milk per goat and year at least since 1996. Nevertheless  the frequency of the deletion in exon12 of  gene has remained high (0.73  Table ) despite the negative effects of the allele on DM content of the milk and milk quality [    ]. Our results also confirmed that allele 1 of SNP14 is associated with significantly reduced protein and fat percentages (Figure  and ). In practice  breeding sire evaluations are based on their daughters' performance and therefore use only the gene substitution effect variance []. If a gene has an additive effect only  the gene substitution effect is equal to the additive effect of the gene. With dominance  the gene substitution effect is no longer equal to the additive effect  but includes a function of the dominance effect and the frequency of the gene in the population []. Allele 1 of SNP14 has shown a marked dominance effect on protein % and fat % (Figure ) and exhibits overdominance for lactose % and milk yield (Table ). Figure  shows that the gene substitution effect (a) of the allele is reduced for milk production in kg when the allele frequency increases until 0.74. It also shows that the magnitude of the gene substitution effect decreases for milk contents when the allele frequency increases. With the current frequency of the allele in the population  0.73  the gene substitution effect is almost zero for milk production in kg and close to zero for lactose % and the magnitude of the effect is reduced for protein % and fat %. Similarly  Figure  shows that the variances of the gene substitution effects are reduced at the higher frequencies of allele 1. Traditional selection based on gene substitution effect has a low or no pressure on a major gene segregating in a population where the major gene exhibits non-additive variation and the favorable allele is found at a low frequency - as explained by Dodds et al. []. In the case of allele 1 of SNP14  the observed dominance effects reduce the gene substitution effects and their variances (additive genetic variances available for selection) for the traits included in the breeding goal. This suggests that the selection pressure of conventional breeding on the allele is limited at the current frequency of allele 1. This could be one explanation why the allele frequency has remained high in spite of the fact that selection is directed against the additive effect of the allele for milk content. In this study  single SNP effects are found in separate models  modelling one SNP at a time. This would be adequate if the SNP were independent (in linkage equilibrium). The fact that the four casein genes are found clustered within 250 kb implies that they have high tendency of being in high LD (inherited together as haplotypes). Figure  shows a considerable amount of LD among casein SNP especially at either end of the chromosome segment containing the casein genes. The result suggests that using haplotypes (or multivariate analysis techniques) to account for the observed LD could be beneficial in association studies as well as in breeding. Moreover  the advantage of using casein haplotypes is that it takes into account not only casein variants but also other important polymorphisms within the casein cluster region (for a review look at Caroli et al. []). We have shown that the deletion in exon12 of  found in Norwegian dairy goats is significantly associated with milk quantity and quality  including milk taste. The allele showed overdominance effects for milk yield in kg and lactose percentage and dominance effects for protein and fat percentages. The observed non-additive effect of the allele with the deletion and its high frequency in the population  0.73  will reduce the additive genetic variances of the locus available for selection. This limits the selection pressure of conventional breeding on the allele. Use of molecular information in the national breeding scheme would help reduce the frequency of the allele with the deletion in the population (currently  information about the deletions in exon 9 and exon 12 of  is used for the genetic evaluation).

Estimated breeding values based on genomic information were converted into genomic pseudo-performances and then analyzed simultaneously with actual performances. Using simulations based on actual data from the French Holstein population  bias and accuracy of BLUP evaluations were computed for young sires undergoing progeny testing or genomic pre-selection.

The proposed method can be easily and quickly implemented in BLUP evaluations at the national level  although some improvement is necessary to more accurately propagate genomic information from genotyped to non-genotyped animals. In addition  it is a convenient method to combine direct genomic  phenotypic and pedigree-based information in a multiple-step procedure. In dairy cattle  selection decisions on candidates are now widely based on Genomically Enhanced Breeding Values (GEBV) instead of Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) obtained after progeny testing. Together with the increasing availability of genotypes  further methodological developments are expected to increase the reliability of GEBV and to achieve higher genetic progress. One challenge is to combine genomic and non-genomic information for all the animals  whether they are genotyped or not. Indeed  the number of genotyped animals is still small compared to the number of non-genotyped animals with phenotypes. Having animals with both EBV and GEBV and other animals with EBV only creates some uncertainty for breeding companies and farmers on how to optimally choose among the candidates for selection. It is also desirable to use all available information  whether genomic  phenotypic or pedigree-based  to assess the additive genetic value of any animal. Currently  there are two alternative procedures to combine data  either a multi-step procedure [  ]  which is based on selection index theory  or a single-step procedure (SSP) based on a relationship matrix that blends full pedigree and genomic information to simultaneously evaluate genotyped and non-genotyped animals []. How to correctly propagate information from genotyped to non-genotyped animals without overestimating reliabilities and without biasing breeding values remains an issue [  ]. Including genotyped and non-genotyped animals in a single genetic analysis is also necessary to properly account for biases due to selective genotyping [] or phenotyping [    ]. The latter corresponds  for example  to young sires that are pre-selected based on genomic information: only sires with higher GEBV and hence with a higher Mendelian sampling term receive phenotypes from daughters a few years after pre-selection. BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) assumes that Mendelian sampling terms have zero expectation []. Thus  genomic pre-selection (GPS) leads to biased EBV and reduced accuracy in national genetic evaluations based on a polygenic model []. In France  genomic evaluations became official in 2009. Since then  bulls that were pre-selected according to genomic information have been used. In 2013  the first records of their daughters will be included in the national BLUP evaluation and the resulting EBV might be biased. One concern is that biased EBV and their corresponding daughter yield deviations (DYD) may impact the estimation of SNP effects in subsequent years. This issue is also relevant at the international level  since the trade of bull semen is based on EBV from Multiple Across Country Evaluations (MACE) that are computed assuming unbiased national EBV. With genomic pre-selection more and more widely implemented  accounting for such practices is becoming very important. Ducrocq and Liu [] proposed a method to include genomic information in national BLUP evaluations. The approach consists of de-regressing all GEBV on which pre-selection was based  using the effective contribution of the additional genomic information as the weight. Then  all the genotyped candidates receive a pseudo-record based on genomic information to be included in the mixed model equations (MME)  in addition to the actual phenotypic records. The BLUP model assumption that all sources of information on which selection is based are included is then fulfilled. The aim of this study was to implement such a method and to assess its ability to remove bias due to genomic pre-selection of young sires. In the study of Patry and Ducrocq []  actual data were used to simulate breeding values and mimic genomic pre-selection of the last generation of sires to assess bias in national BLUP evaluations. In the current study  the same population and simulated data as in [] were used to measure bias before and after including genomic information. In addition  the issue of combining genomic with traditional information  i.e. phenotypes and pedigree  is addressed. Data were generated as described in Patry and Ducrocq [] and GEBV were simulated for a cohort of young sires that was considered as a cohort of selection candidates. GEBV were used to retain a proportion of the best candidates  mimicking genomic pre-selection. To account for this selection step in BLUP evaluations at the national level  GEBV were de-regressed to provide genomic pseudo-performances for all the genotyped candidates. A weight derived from the increase in reliability of EBV due to genotype information was associated to each pseudo-performance. Pseudo-performances and their associated weights were included in Henderson's mixed model equations as if they were regular records. Three scenarios were compared to a situation without pre-selection. Each scenario corresponded to a different type and/or amount of information included in the evaluation: actual performances of selected young sires only or combined with de-regressed genomic pseudo-performances  for the selected or all the candidate sires. Bias and accuracy of BLUP evaluations were measured for each scenario. In their study []  Patry and Ducrocq used actual pedigree records and records from the 2008 national type trait evaluations for the Holstein breed in France to simulate breeding values of selection candidates. The animals of interest were defined as the youngest progeny-tested bulls with no second crop daughters  hereafter called young sires (YS). Their daughters and the dams of their daughters were also known. Two populations were considered for BLUP evaluations  one in which progeny testing was carried out (CONTROL population) and one reflecting genomic pre-selection in the last generation (GPS population). To mimic genomic pre-selection among YS  GEBV were generated together with true breeding values (TBV) in the GPS population. GEBV of full-sib families of candidate sires were generated. Among each full-sib family  it was assumed that the sib with the highest GEBV was selected  while the remaining full-sibs were culled. In the CONTROL population  only TBV were simulated for YS. As with the real datasets  only selected sires had daughters  and their performances were simulated. In the current study  as in []  the same cohorts and sets of data were used  including GEBV and TBV for all candidate sires  and performances for their daughters. For young sires  TBV and GEBV were simulated jointly (in the GPS population) from multivariate normal distributions and conditional on parent average (EBV before including progeny information). Variances and covariances of the distributions depended on the genetic variance of the trait and reliabilities of genetic and genomic evaluations. Direct genomic reliability and pedigree reliability were distinguished. Reliability of GEBV was defined as a combination of genomic and pedigree-based information. Pedigree reliabilities were obtained from the true data analysis before including progeny information. Direct genomic reliabilities were computed assuming the genomic contribution contributed  additional daughter records. Various values of  were used in the simulations. Daughter performances were computed using estimated fixed effects from the true data analysis  simulated TBV of YS  and the distribution of dam EBV. For more details  see Patry and Ducrocq []. Simulations were replicated 50 times. Breeding values were estimated for all the animals in both populations  CONTROL and GPS  based on daughter performances and pedigree-based information and using BLUP applied to a single-trait animal model. In the CONTROL population  EBV of YS were unbiased []. In the GPS population  only pre-selected YS had daughters and therefore  only their performances were available for the BLUP evaluation. Genomic pre-selection was not taken into account in the estimation of breeding values by BLUP and EBV of YS were shown to be biased []. To account for the genomic selection step in BLUP evaluations at the national level  GEBV were de-regressed as described in the following paragraph and weighed by the increase in reliability due to genomic information. Estimated breeding values  are usually obtained as solutions of the MME: where  and  are vectors of fixed effects and breeding values   is the additive genetic relationship matrix   and  are incidence matrices assigning observations to effects  and a is the variance ratio between residual and genetic variance . From (1)  EBV  can be computed from: This equation is obtained after correction for the breeding value of their dam and absorption of each daughter equation  such that only equations corresponding to sires and their ancestors are left. In a regular de-regression procedure  as described by Jairath et al. []  the  vector is obtained from the right hand side of: where  is a diagonal matrix of Effective Daughter Contributions with element  representing the amount of information coming from daughter phenotypes for each sire .  is a vector of de-regressed proofs also called Effective Daughter Performances; and  and  are the numerator relationship matrix and the vector of breeding values of the sires and their ancestors. Assuming that  is known from the solution of (1) or (2)  we have: Equation () can be adapted to compute for each genotyped sire   a \"genomic\" pseudo-performance   similar to the effective daughter performance  . Let <U+0394>Rel  be the increase in reliability of DGV(Direct Genomic Value) or GEBV for sire  compared to its classical EBV. It will be referred to as the \"direct genomic reliability\":  or equivalently:  where  is the \"genomic\" effective daughter contribution   and h is the heritability of the trait. Replacing in  equation () by    the vector of GEBV  it follows that the vector  of genomic pseudo-performances is the solution of: Note that vector  does not only include GEBV for genotyped animals but also GEBV for non-genotyped ancestors.  was split into two vectors (    ) distinguishing genotyped animals () from non genotyped ones (). After appropriate reordering of rows and columns  let: Assuming  equal to zero for non genotyped sires  vector  is computed solving the following equation: This de-regression procedure removes the parent average effect. Therefore  either GEBV which include a residual polygenic effect or DGV can be used in  . To be able to include the genomic pseudo-performances in a national genetic evaluation  sire  and  must be adapted to an animal model  where the sire variance used in a sire model is replaced by the additive genetic variance. This is done by multiplying  by 2 and by multiplying  by  []. For the GPS population  three different datasets of performances were created to obtain BLUP evaluations  leading to three scenarios to account for genomic pre-selection at the national level: 1. BLUP evaluations included only one type of phenotypes for the YS  i.e. the simulated performances of their daughters. These \"actual\" phenotypes were available only for the YS which were pre-selected based on their genomic information. Thus culled YS were not included in the evaluation. We called this scenario \"GPS_no\" and has been shown to result in biased EBV []. 2. BLUP evaluations included two types of phenotypes for the YS  i.e. the simulated performances used in scenario GPS_no and the genomic pseudo-performances    i.e. the de-regressed GEBV derived above  but   were only available for the selected candidates. This scenario was called \"GPS_sel\". 3. BLUP evaluations used the same two types of phenotypes available for the pre-selected YS as in the previous scenario but this time  the genomic pseudo-performances   were also included for candidates culled after the genomic pre-selection step. This scenario was called \"GPS_all\". Hence all candidate sires have an associated pseudo-performance. Different levels of trait heritability  different proportions of retained young sires after genomic selection and different accuracies of GEBV were used to define several parameter sets  as in Patry and Ducrocq []. Thus  two type traits  udder depth (UD) and foot angle (FA)  were considered because of their contrasted heritabilities (0.36 versus 0.14). The genetic variance was 0.25 for UD and 0.14 for FA. Seven hundred and ninety-nine selected YS and a total of 40 222 daughters with UD records and 601 selected YS and their 31 976 daughters with FA records were identified. Two proportions of selected YS were tested: 10% and 25%. For example  when 10% of YS were retained after genomic selection  7 990 pairs of TBV and GEBV for UD were simulated to identify  after proper ranking  799 selected YS and 7 191 culled YS. We assumed an initial value of 10 effective daughter records so that the direct genomic reliability was 0.50 for UD and 0.26 for FA. Because of the lower heritability of FA  we also tested a value of 26 EDC to achieve a direct genomic reliability of 0.50  as for UD. See Table  for the definition of all the parameter sets. Depending on the set of parameters and on the scenario (GDP_no  GDP_sel and GDP_all)  a different number of actual daughter performances and genomic pseudo-performances were included  see Table . National BLUP evaluations were performed in the four situations presented in Table . Breeding values were estimated in the CONTROL population and under the three scenarios in the GPS population (GPS_no  GPS_sel  GPS_all). Before further statistical analysis of the resulting EBV  all EBV were expressed in genetic standard deviation units of the trait (s). The mean Mendelian sampling term was estimated as the mean difference between the young sires' EBV and their parent average across all the YS included in each scenario. This estimate indicated how much the usual MME assumption of zero expectation for the Mendelian sampling term was violated. As in Patry and Ducrocq []  three indicators were used to assess the quality of BLUP evaluations and were compared among the four scenarios: bias  true reliability (<U+03C1>²) and mean square error (MSE)  as defined below. Let  and  be respectively the TBV and EBV of each young sire  in each replicate . True reliability and MSE characterize the accuracy of BLUP evaluations. Statistics were computed for two groups of interest  the young sires and their daughters and averaged over the 50 replicates. For both groups and each scenario  they were calculated for all animals actually included in the BLUP evaluations: both eliminated and selected candidates were analysed in the CONTROL and GPS_all scenarios whereas only selected candidates were included in the analysis of GPS_no and GPS_sel scenarios. To illustrate the bias process and the approach to account for pre-selection  only the results for the evaluation of UD (h² = 0.36) when 25% of the YS were retained based on their GEBV will be presented. In the CONTROL population  the EBV of YS were unbiased since all the selection candidates were included in the BLUP evaluation (Table ): both the mean Mendelian sampling estimate and the mean difference between true and estimated breeding values were not significantly different from zero. In contrast  the mean Mendelian sampling estimate and the bias were significantly different from zero  true reliability decreased and MSE increased  when genomic pre-selection of sires was applied (GPS population) but not accounted for in the evaluation (GPS_no scenario). When genomic pseudo-performances were included for selected sires only (GPS_sel scenario)  the true reliability of BLUP evaluations increased compared to the scenario GPS_no due to the explicit addition of genomic information to the traditional pedigree and performance information. The MSE also decreased  indicating that the quality of BLUP evaluations was improved. However  the bias was still significantly different from zero (Table ). The genomic selection process was completely accounted for only when genomic pseudo-performances for culled sires were also included in the evaluation model (GPS_all scenario). In this case  the mean Mendelian sampling estimate and the bias of the cohort of selected sires were not significantly different from zero. Including de-regressed GEBV for all YS in the evaluation model as in GPS_all scenario not only accounted for genomic pre-selection  contrary to the GPS_sel scenario  but also increased accuracy of BLUP evaluations compared to the GPS_no scenario. Previous research showed that  when the trait heritability is lower or the genomic pre-selection intensity is higher  the relative magnitude of the bias due to genomic selection increases when the genomic pre-selection intensity is not accounted for in the evaluation model []. The average bias and MSE are presented in Table  for YS and in Table  for their daughters for different combinations of trait heritability and genomic pre-selection intensity levels and when selection based on genomic information is fully (GPS_all) or not accounted for (GPS_no). For the YS cohort (Table ) in the GPS_no scenario  the bias ranged from -0.146 to -0.338 s  and from -0.03 to 0 s in the GPS_all scenario. In the latter case  the bias was also almost zero in the cohort of daughters (Table ). Regardless of the magnitude of the initial bias for YS or their daughters  including genomic pseudo-performances for all the selection candidates provided the MME with sufficient information on the selection process to effectively reduce the bias. In the previous situations  we considered diagonal values of  of 10 for UD and 26 for FA. In Table   we compared these results for FA with a situation where diagonal values of  were assumed to be 10 instead of 26; hence the accuracy of the genomic evaluations was assumed to be lower. In this case  the expected genetic gain genetic trend was smaller and selection was less efficient. As a result  the bias due to not accounting for pre-selection (GPS_no) was smaller than with an  of 26. However  the bias was also less reduced by including genomic pseudo-performances for selected YS (GPS_sel) when EDCg was equal to 10. This illustrates the fact that the accuracy of GEBV is a key element when including genomic performances for all candidates in the evaluation model to account for bias due to genomic pre-selection. The inclusion of a genomic pseudo-performance  i.e. a de-regressed GEBV  for all genotyped candidates reduced the GEBV bias to (almost) zero in most simulated situations  regardless of the genomic selection intensity. Inclusion of genomic pseudo-performance resulted in a better description of the genetic characteristics of the population of candidates. Consequently  the overall average Mendelian sampling term had a zero expectation and the classical assumptions of the BLUP model were more closely met. However  the results showed that the effectiveness of this approach depended on the quality of genomic evaluations. This approach was more effective for traits with a higher heritability or for genomic evaluations with a higher accuracy. As expected  adding genomic data increased the amount of information contributed to the genetic evaluation and this information was distributed to relatives through the additive relationship matrix. In fact  including genomic pseudo-performance is not as straightforward as adding regular performance to BLUP evaluations []: obviously  accuracy of EBV increases as the number of daughters increases but this is not always the case with an increasing number of genotyped animals. Indeed  genotyped parents correctly add information to non-genotyped progeny and genotyped progeny contribute information to non-genotyped parents but the total amount of additional information from genotyped relatives cannot exceed the gain in accuracy from genotyping the animals themselves []. Furthermore  if a progeny and its sire are both genotyped  the progeny genotype does not provide any additional information to the sire and vice versa []. Thus including without care genomic pseudo-performances for both the sire and its progeny will result in double counting genomic contributions  once directly  and once via relatives through the additive relationship matrix []. Therefore  BLUP evaluations must account for such data redundancy. In this study  only YS were genotyped and we implicitly assumed that none of their sires were from the reference population  hence avoiding the issue of redundant genomic information and overestimated reliability of genomic evaluation []. However  in a more realistic case  the weight of genomic information might be overestimated by  and a tailored reduction of  should be implemented. Nevertheless  despite the simplified assumptions and computations  the approach used was shown to be promising and demonstrated that including information on culled candidates is essential. With the addition of genomic information  inflated reliabilities have been reported regardless of the method used to blend genomic and traditional information: the selection index approach [  ]  the single-step approach []  or the current approach  which was initially proposed by Ducrocq and Liu []. Some strategies have been suggested to prevent the reliability of genotyped animals from approaching 1. Ducrocq and Liu [] have proposed an iterative approach adapted from the information source method [] to compute reliability from genomic information. In their situation  the  were derived under constraints such that the final genomic contribution to reliabilities was bounded. The reliabilities of GEBV appeared to be reasonable. However  the issue was not completely solved since reliabilities were still overestimated for sires with many genotyped progeny []. Mäntysaari and Strànden have proposed to use a multi-trait evaluation to combine DYD and DGV  where DGV are treated as an indicator trait with a high correlation to the considered trait. Then  reliabilities of GEBV are naturally bounded to the square of this correlation so that genomic relationships are less overestimated. Such a correlation between EBV and DGV or GEBV could be estimated following the method proposed by Kachman [] and implemented by MacNeil et al.[]. The single-step approach [  ] offers an appealing solution in the sense that genomic  phenotypic and pedigree information are analyzed simultaneously. However  unless it is assumed that all the genetic variation is described by the SNP markers  these procedures face the problem of finding an appropriate weighting of genomic and pedigree-based information [  ]. In some studies  the lack of independency between the three sources of information (genomic  phenotypic  pedigree based) has been considered through a scaling of the residual variance [  ] but only approximate solutions have been developed so far. Further appropriate developments are necessary to better compute  and to improve the method of including genomic performances in BLUP evaluation to account for bias due to genomic pre-selection. The approach presented here involves an additional step  before running national BLUP evaluations  i.e. computation of genomic pseudo-performances. This step is easy to implement as de-regression is commonly used  like in routine international genetic evaluations []. This method has several key advantages. First  it is independent from the methodology used to predict genomic EBV (GBLUP  Bayesian methods  etc)  secondly  it can be applied to different evaluation models without further developments and  finally  the size of the genotyped population is not a constraint. With the current breeding schemes in dairy cattle  a period of about four years is necessary between the genomic pre-selection step and the introduction of the first records of daughters in BLUP evaluations. Since genomic selection has begun more than two years ago in several countries  the first biased evaluations may occur within the two next years. Thus the need to implement an easy to apply approach to account for genomic pre-selection is urgent. The approach proposed here requires only limited modifications (if any) of the existing national evaluation software. However  further work is needed to control the dependency between BLUP evaluations and genomic evaluations. To account for genomic pre-selection  EBV must include genomic information and these unbiased EBV are then used as input for future equations for genomic predictions. The issue is that genomic information will be double counted when computing GEBV. One way to circumvent this problem would be to iterate between the classical genetic and genomic evaluations. Two alternatives  both potentially problematic  are possible: on the one hand  genomic pre-selection of young sires leads to biased EBV and therefore to biased DYD which are then used to update genomic predictions. On the other hand  incorporating genomic records into national BLUP evaluations inflates the accuracy of BLUP EBV of some animals and makes classical genetic and genomic evaluations dependent from each other. Thus  a compromise has to be found between the use of biased EBV on one side  and double counting of genomic information and overestimation of reliabilities on the other side. In this study  the underlying context was rather optimistic. In particular  it was assumed that all data from selected and culled candidates were available at the national level. For example  the use of pre-selected bulls from foreign breeding schemes was not considered. Moreover  in the context of national and international competition  breeding companies may be reluctant to release information on their selection strategy and objectives  and may not be willing to share data on culled animals. Our study clearly shows that this would be very detrimental for at least three reasons: first  EBV of pre-selected bulls would be underestimated; secondly  the resulting bias would be transferred to the rest of the population (e.g.  daughters) in an uncontrolled way; and finally  genomic predictions using results from these biased evaluations would be sub-optimal. Therefore  it is essential that information originating from current implementations of genomic selection (GEBV of all animals  or at least selection differentials) at least be shared at the national level. Ignoring genomic pre-selection at the national level impacts national EBV and  as a consequence  international EBV too. We are currently investigating to what extent the transmission of biased or unbiased national EBV for selected bulls only could bias international genetic evaluations. There is an urgent need to account for genomic pre-selection of young sires before their national EBV become biased. Based on a real dairy cattle dataset  breeding values were generated in the last generation of sires to mimic genomic pre-selection. In this study  including a genomic pseudo-performance based on GEBV for all the selection candidates strongly reduced or removed biases  regardless of their magnitude. However  this approach does not account for some potential overestimation of the weight that is placed on genomic information and for dependency of genetic and genomic evaluations. Thus  the proposed method may need further improvement  but in the short term  it makes possible to implement a simple and general procedure that accounts for these new selection practices in BLUP evaluations at the national level. In addition  this approach provides an alternative method to combine genomic  phenotypic and pedigree data in multiple steps procedures which is easy to understand and implement.

Duck and chicken  genes probably perform similar function in the development of growing oocytes and deposition of yolk lipoprotein. Therefore   could be a candidate gene for duck egg performance and be used as a genetic marker to improve egg performance in ducks. The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR)  a member of the LDL receptor family []  is an important multifunctional receptor. Apart from mediating the metabolism of triglycerides  it is well documented that VLDLR also takes part in a range of cellular processes including cell proliferation  migration and differentiation  etc []. The  gene was firstly isolated from a rabbit heart cDNA library and later cloned in chicken  human  mouse  cattle and monkey and its structure in these different species was elucidated in great detail []. Similar to the  gene  the  gene contains five functional domains: (i) multiple cysteine-rich repeats constituting the amino-terminal ligand-binding domain; (ii) an epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor homologous domain; (iii) an O-linked sugar domain; (iv) a transmembrane domain; and (v) a cytoplasmic domain with a FDNPVY sequence []. Although the structural features of each domain of the VLDLR and LDLR proteins share some striking homologies  they differ in the number of cysteine-rich repeat sequences present in the ligand-binding domain i.e. VLDLR has eight cysteine-rich repeats and LDLR  only has seven [  ]. The O-linked sugar domain is a serine and threonine rich domain that corresponds to exon 16 in the  gene and its differential splicing has been described in human  rat  rabbit and cattle [  ]. Chicken VLDLR  also named oocyte vitellogenesis receptor (OVR) or vitellogenin receptor (VTGR)  mediates the absorption of yolk protein precursors from plasma very low density lipoprotein and vitellogenin. Bujo et al. (1994) detected a point mutation (G/C) at position 2177 bp of the chicken  cDNA (mutation named \"restricted ovulation\" or ) and showed that the mutant had a reduced egg production []. Subsequently  it was shown that VLDLR has a key role on chicken reproduction  including the development of oocytes and yolk lipoprotein deposition [  ]. Recently  a study in zebra finch suggested that  mRNA expression was pivotal for reproduction in oviparous species []. Duck is an important agricultural poultry species for the production of eggs and meat. However  egg performance of some local duck breeds remains low and could benefit from genetic improvement. Marker-assisted selection is based on the association between DNA variation and genes that control a trait of interest and has become an important approach towards improving production traits in animal breeding. In chicken and zebra finch  the  gene has been reported to play a key role in reproduction and could represent a functional candidate gene for egg performance. Since little was known on its structure and role in duck  we have cloned the full length duck  gene  analysed its expression profile in twelve different tissues and investigated its association with duck egg performance using SNP located within the gene. Three healthy female ducks (aged 20 weeks) were selected from the second generation of the white  g × white  cross  and all the ducks were reared under normal management conditions. All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Biological Studies Animal Care and Use Committee of Hubei Province  PR China. Twelve different tissues were sampled from each duck  including heart  liver  spleen  lung  kidney  muscle  brain  adipose tissue  intestine  pituitary gland  ovary and oviduct  immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until total RNA extraction. Ducks of the second (n = 350) and third (n = 251) generations of white  × white  cross were provided by the Hankou Jingwu Industry Garden Ltd.. The ducks were reared in cages in a semi-open house and subjected to conventional management conditions. Recorded traits included age of the first egg  body weight at age of first egg and egg production (during 210 days  300 days and 360 days) of each individual duck. Egg characteristics were measured at day 295 to 300  and included egg weight  Haugh unit  egg index  percentage of yolk  percentage of albumen and shell strength []. Genomic DNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform method from blood samples []. DNA concentration and quality were measured with the spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Nano-Drop  USA)  and the concentrations were adjusted between 50 and 300 ng/µL. DNA samples were stored at 4°C until use for PCR reactions. Total RNA was isolated from different tissues with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen  Carlsbad  CA  USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality of total RNA sample was evaluated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and their concentrations were measured with the spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Nano-Drop  USA). cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 1 µg of DNase-treated (TOYOBO CO.  DNaseI) total RNA according to the M-MLV reverse transcriptase kit (TOYOBO  Japan) at 42°C. Based on the conserved region between  (GI: 45382562) and  (GI: 148733616)  genes  a pair of primers () was designed to obtain partial duck  gene sequence (primers shown in Table ). The PCR program included denaturation during 5 min at 94°C  followed by 32 cycles of 30 s at 94°C  30s at 60°C  30s at 72°C  and an extension step of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were cloned into the PEASY-T1 vector (TransGen Biotech) and sequenced commercially. Based on the partial cDNA sequence obtained from the above RT-PCR reaction  duck gene specific primers and cDNA-end RACE primers were designed to amplify the full-length cDNA sequence of duck  (primers shown in Table ). 3'-RACE and 5'-RACE PCR were conducted with 10 mg of RNA isolated from ovary and the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories  CA  USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR program included a denaturation step of 4 min at 94°C  followed by 35 cycles of 35 s at 94°C  35 s at annealing temperature (Table )  30 s to 2 min at 72°C  and a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. The 3'-RACE and 5'-RACE PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the PEASY-T1 vector (TransGen Biotech)  then commercially sequenced. The open reading frame (ORF) and the amino acid sequences were deduced using SeqMan (DNAstar). The phylograms were created by MEGA 4.0 Neighbor-Joining (NJ) software []. The second structure prediction was performed using online tools on the ExPASy website (). To determine the tissue expression of the two type splice variants  semi-quantitative RT-PCR were carried out using total RNA from various duck tissues and a pair of primers () encompassing the region corresponding to the O-linked sugar region (Table ). The PCR program included a denaturation step of 5 min at 94°C  followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C  30s at 60°C  30s at 72°C  and a final step of 5 min at 72°C. As control  a pair of primers () (Table ) was used under the same conditions. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with ultraviolet light. Two pairs of specific primers ( and   Table ) were designed to screen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Twelve DNA samples from the second generation ducks were amplified and sequenced. The obtained sequences were aligned by SeqMan (DNAStar software) to screen SNP based on the differences between sequences. The restriction endonuclease sites that harboured an SNP were detected with the primer premier 5.0 software to design the genotyping protocols. Genotyping of other individuals of the second and third generations were carried out by PCR-RFLP. PCR for genotyping were performed in a volume of 15 µL consisting of 50-300 ng of genomic DNA  1 × PCR buffer  0.5 µM of each primer  25 µM dNTP  2.0 mM MgCl and 0.2 units Taq DNA polymerase (TransGen  Beijing  China)  and ddHO. PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min at 94°C  followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C  30 s at 56°C  35 s at 72°C  and a final step of 5 min at 72°C. Three µL of PCR product were digested overnight with 3 units of  (TaKaRa  Dalian  China) at 37°C  and then the digested products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with ultraviolet light  to record the genotype of each sample. The general linear model (GLM) procedures of SAS software package (SAS Inst. Inc.  Cary NC  USA) was used to determine associations between the different genotypes with performance traits according to the following model  Y= µ+ S +G+e  where Y is the observed value of different egg traits  µ is the population mean; S and G are the fixed effects of each generation and genotype  respectively  and e is the random error. Values are considered significant at P < 0.05 and are presented as least square means ± standard error. Using RACE and sequence matching techniques  a cDNA sequence covering the whole coding sequence was obtained from duck ovary. The cDNA consisted of 3450 nucleotides  containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 2553 bp  a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 243 bp  and a 3'-terminal UTR of 654 bp including a TGA termination codon (nucleotides 2797~2799 bp)  one putative polyadenylation consensus signal (AATAAA) and a poly (A) tail. The duck  nucleotide sequence shares ~70 to 90% similarity with its counterpart in other species including  (GI: 45382562)   (GI: 409425)   (GI: 74136368)   (GI: 609532)   (GI: 315506984)   (GI: 31341853)   (GI: 169646704)   (GI: 126723672) and  (GI: 224091307). However  unexpectedly we found that the duck  cDNA lacked approximately 90 nucleotides compared to the rabbit  cDNA. Differential splicing of  mRNA has been detected in rabbit  human  mouse and cattle and results from the deletion of the same region [  ]. To confirm that a 90-bp deletion also occurred in duck  RT-PCR was carried out with total RNA from heart and a pair of primers flanking the deletion was designed. Two bands of 268 and 178 bp were amplified and cloned into T-vector and sequenced  which showed that the 268-bp fragment contained the additional 90-bp sequence. Thus  in duck  two  splice variants are present in heart  one (VLDLR-a) with an O-linked sugar domain and the other (VLDLR-b) without. The prediction results from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics software showed that the  (GenBank: JF950611) contained a 2643 bp ORF  and encoded a protein of 881 amino acids (aa) with an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.70 and calculated molecular mass (MW) of 96.73 kDa. The  (GenBank: JF950612) contained a 2553 bp ORF and encoded a protein of 851 aa with a pI of 4.69 and calculated MW of 93.74 kDa. Similar to the  transcript  the  consists of five domains (Figure   ): (i) six ligand binding motifs (S-D-E) and eight cysteine-rich repeats within the ligand binding domain; (ii) five YWXD motifs in the EGF precursor homology domain; (iii) an O-linked sugar domain with clustered serine and threonine residues; (iv) a 23-aa sequence in the putative transmembrane domain and (v) a FDNPVY sequence in the cytoplasmic domain at the C- terminus [  ]. The  form lacks the O-linked sugar domain.  . Letters in bold character indicate the start codon (ATG); the cleaved signal sequence is boxed at the N-terminus; different ligand binding motifs within the ligand domain are underlined; YWXD repeats are indicated by a thick underline.  . An asterisk indicates the stop codon (TGA) and the polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) is underlined and in bold character; YWXD repeats are indicated by a thick underline; serine and threonine residues that correspond to the O-linked sugar domain are indicated by double underline; the 23 amino-acid putative transmembrane domain is shaded; the FDNPVY sequence targeting the receptor to coated pits is marked by a wavy underline. To investigate the evolutionary origin of duck VLDLR  a phylogenetic tree showed in Figure  was constructed based on aa sequences of duck and eleven other animal species for which a complete aa sequence was available  including  (GI: 45382563)   (GI: 65301167)   (GI: 65301164)   (GI: 74136369)   (GI: 315139195)   (GI: 238637303)   (GI: 238637305)   (GI: 126723673) and  (GI: 27806193)   (GI: 169646705) and  (GI: 224091308) [        ]. Based on this analysis  three branches were obtained with duck  chicken and zebra finch belonging to one group indicating that duck VLDLR proteins are closer to chicken and zebra finch VLDLR than to those of the other species. This suggests that duck  chicken and zebra finch VLDLR probably perform similar functions. . The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method of MEGA 4.0 using the deduced amino acid VLDLR sequence of duck and eleven other animal species; the number at the branches denotes the bootstrap majority consensus values on 1000 replicates; the branch lengths represent the relative genetic distance among these species. To determine the tissue expression of the two duck splice variants  semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with total RNA from twelve duck tissues and a pair of primers encompassing the region corresponding to the O-linked sugar region. As shown in Figure   both transcripts were expressed in nearly all the tissues tested from adult female ducks. The  was highly expressed in muscle tissue  while the  was predominantly expressed in ovary  oviduct  pituitary gland  liver  spleen  lung  kidney and intestine. Both transcripts are expressed at equivalent levels in heart  brain and adipose tissues.   . Tissue samples are heart  liver  spleen  lung  kidney  muscle  brain  intestine  adipose tissue  pituitary gland  ovary and oviduct from adult female ducks;  is used as control. In rabbit  the  transcript with the O-linked sugar region (type-1 ) is the major transcript in heart and muscle  whereas the transcript for  lacking the O-linked sugar region (type-2 ) is preferentially expressed in non-muscle tissues  including cerebrum  cerebellum  kidney  spleen  adrenal gland  testis  ovary and uterus []. In cattle  the variant with the O-linked sugar domain is mainly expressed in heart  brain and skeletal muscle  while the non-O-glycosylated splice variant is found in all detected tissues []. In our study  a differential representation of the two splice variants was also observed   was predominantly expressed in muscle tissue  and there was no obvious differential expression in heart and brain tissues. Considering that the differential expression of both  variants varies slightly among species and tissues  the roles of each isoform may differ. In addition  the fact that the transcript lacking the O-linked sugar region () and expressed in ovary emphasizes its specific role in the development of growing oocytes. Alignment of the PCR sequences from different individuals detected two SNP in a fragment of 714 bp (compared to the reference chicken genome  sequence  the fragment covers intron 12 to intron 13 and their flanking region sequences  GenBank: HQ446851 and HQ446852). These two SNP were positioned at 231 bp for C/T and 633 bp for G/A. These two mutations at 231 bp (i.e. at position 2025 bp of the ORF) and 633 bp (i.e. in intron 13 (reference chicken genome DNA sequence)) were selected to carry out a PCR-RFLP polymorphism analysis with  and   respectively. For the  site  the 315 bp (T allele) PCR product was digested into two 191 and 124 bp fragments (C allele) (Figure ). For the  site  the 168 bp (G allele) PCR product was digested into two 115 and 53 bp fragments (A allele) (Figure ). Genotyping data showed that these two sites are in complete linkage  and only two homozygotes were detected in our testing population.       . TT (315 bp) and CC (191/124 bp) genotypes for the  site (A) and GG (168 bp) and AA (115/53 bp) genotypes for the  site (B) were generated. The genotypes are shown at the top of each lane; M is marker1. Since a resource population was used and under the hypothesis that the gene is located on an autosome  heterozygous individuals would be expected. Thus  the only explanation is that in duck  the  gene is located on the Z chromosome  which agrees with the location of the chicken and zebra finch  genes also on the Z chromosome. Human  gene is on chromosome 9  which has been shown to share extensive conserved synteny with chicken Z [  ]. Recently  Ellegren (2010) reported that the chromosomal evolution of birds occurs at an unusually slow rate and many chromosomes have remained more or less intact during avian evolution []. Thus  based on the genotype disequilibrium and the fact that duck is closely related to chicken and zebra finch  we conclude that the duck  gene is most likely located on the Z chromosome. The association analysis demonstrated a significant association between the two haplotypes and egg production  age at the first egg and body weight at the first egg. Hens with haplotype AT had a higher egg production (210-day egg production (P < 0.0001)  300-day egg production (P = 0.0003)  360-day egg production (P = 0.0002)) and earlier age for starting laying (P = 0.0001). Hens with haplotype CG had a higher body weight at the first egg (P = 0.0277) (Table ). In chicken  a naturally occurring point mutation (G/C) at position 2177 bp in the  cDNA resulting in an unpaired cysteine residue  prevents the normal yolk protein precursors to be accumulated  and causes a reduction or cessation of egg laying [    ]. In zebra finch  it has been reported that the expression of  mRNA plays a key role in determining inter-individual variation in reproductive phenotype (e.g. follicle or egg size) []. In duck  the detected polymorphism may affect  mRNA stability through unknown mechanisms  influencing its expression in ovary  and the development of the growing oocytes and yolk lipoprotein deposition. The association analysis also confirmed the crucial role of  on the development of yolk protein precursors in oviparous species. In conclusion  two variants of duck  transcripts were identified and characterized  and their tissue expression patterns were analysed. Two complete linked SNP were screened and an association with egg performance was detected using a two generations population. Our results suggest that duck  could be a candidate gene for duck egg performance and used as a genetic marker to improve this trait.

Highly tissue-specific association patterns suggest that candidate genes or gene pathways should be investigated in the context of specific tissues. In recent years  high-throughput genomic technologies have accelerated the discovery of new causal mutations and made the study of biological systems more accessible than ever. This is true not only in humans and model organisms but also in agriculturally important species like the pig. One major interest in the study of livestock species is that the strong selection pressure applied in breeding programs has resulted in breeds that are phenotypically extreme for many traits. In addition  such selection has indirectly acted on the transcriptome and the metabolome  but the resulting effects are much less studied  not to say understood  than those on external phenotypes like growth or fat deposition. In humans and other animal species  the blood levels of molecules related to lipid  glucose and protein metabolism  such as non-esterified fatty acids  triglyceride  glucose and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  reflect nutritional and disease status. In livestock species  the abundance of plasma metabolites can be associated with agriculturally important traits like growth and fatness []. Among the major livestock species  pig is a good model for human diseases such as atherosclerosis []. Genetic mapping studies have identified several genetic loci affecting blood metabolites in both human and pig populations [  ]. Ideally  the functions of genes need to be defined in the context of relevant tissues and gene expression networks. Most of the studies that combine gene expression network and data on plasma metabolites have been primarily carried out on liver and adipose tissues [  ]. However  endocrine glands  by secreting hormones  also play a pivotal role in maintaining the homeostasis of plasma metabolites  either directly or indirectly. Despite the importance of these tissues  the relationship between endocrine transcriptome and plasma metabolites is not well known. In addition  most existing analyses have considered tissues separately although complex traits like obesity or metabolite blood levels involve molecular networks both within and between multiple tissues. In the work reported here  we have analyzed the association between the transcriptome of five endocrine tissues (hypothalamus  adenohypophysis  thyroid gland  gonad and fat tissue) and 12 plasma metabolites in pig. Since the study was carried out on pigs belonging to different breeds but managed and sacrificed simultaneously  we could also investigate the existence of any genetic (breed) effect on the metabolites analyzed. The plasma metabolites studied here play a fundamental role in the basal metabolism (glucose  cholesterol  triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acids  alanine aminotransferase)  or the inflammatory response (haptoglobin  pig major acute phase protein). The term \"quantitative trait transcript\" or QTT refers to a probeset  the expression of which is significantly associated (P < 0.01) with a particular metabolic trait. Gene co-expression networks  were inferred both for each tissue separately and for all tissues together. We conclude that using a multi-tissue network provides key relevant information to understand the underlying regulation of the metabolites studied. Animal management and tissue collection procedures have been detailed elsewhere []. Briefly  27 pigs from five breeds  Large White (N = 6)  Landrace (N = 5)  Duroc (N = 5)  a Sino-European hybrid line (N = 5) and Iberian (N = 6)  were bought from three breeding companies after weaning. All pigs were housed together in the university experimental farms and fed the same diet for two months. At 80 to 89 days of age and after 24 hours fasting  pigs were euthanized and sacrificed for blood and tissue sampling. All procedures were approved by the Ethical and Animal Welfare committee of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain). Twelve plasma metabolites were measured in the 27 pigs. Briefly  after collecting and coagulating blood samples at room temperature  serum was separated from clots by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min and stored at -80°C until use. Plasma metabolite concentrations were measured with the following methods: hexokinase assay for glucose  Ranbut assay (Randox Laboratories Ltd.  UK) for 3-hydroxybutyrate  NEFA-C reagent (Wako Chemicals GmbH  Germany) for non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA)  CHOD-PAP-method for cholesterol  immuno-inhibition method for high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)  selective protection method for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)  GPO-PAP method for triglyceride  Biuret method for total protein and  methods recommended by IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Haptoglobin was assayed with the Phase Haptoglobin kit (colorimetric assay based on binding of haptoglobin to hemoglobin  Tridelta Ltd  Ireland) and pig major acute phase protein (PigMAP) levels with an ELISA kit (PigCHAMP ProEuropa  Segovia  Spain). All the assays were performed with an Olympus AU400 analyzer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We used the GeneChip Porcine Genome Array from Affymetrix (Santa Clara CA) to profile the transcriptome of five endocrine tissues: hypothalamus (HYPO)  adenohypophysis (AHYP)  thyroid gland (THYG)  gonads (GONA) from both male and female pigs  and backfat tissue (FATB) in 16 (four Large White  four Duroc  four Iberian and four from the Sino-European hybrid line) of the 27 pigs. Each breed consisted of two males and two females  except for the hybrid line with three males and one female []. Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of tissue and RNA samples were cleaned  quantified  and adjusted to 500-1000 ng/µl. Five µg of total RNA were used to synthesize cDNA. Then  the 80 microarrays corresponding to 16 animals × five tissues were hybridized and scanned to generate signal intensities which were converted to CEL files by the GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS). All CEL files were adjusted for background noise and normalized using the GCRMA procedure [] and the data was then used for subsequent analysis. The transcriptome data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession number [GEO:GSE14739]. We used a general linear regression model to investigate the effect of sex and breed on the biochemical traits: where  is a vector of the studied metabolite measures. The model applied to assess the strength of the association between metabolic traits and probesets was: where probeset  is defined as a quantitative trait transcript (QTT) if its association with a particular biochemical trait achieves a nominal P value < 0.01. Since both breed and sex were adjusted in the regression analysis  the detected QTT for a particular metabolite represent general transcriptional effects in both breed and sex. The analysis were implemented using the GLM function in R []. The False Discovery Rates (FDR) of the associations were determined by permuting the labels of the phenotypes for 20 iterations  while preserving the correlation structure of the transcriptome. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was implemented using R scripts downloaded from  with a few modifications. In this analysis  the average value across probesets was used as the expression value of that gene in each individual when a gene was represented by more than one probeset. This reduced the 24 123 probesets to 18 017 unique genes. For each metabolic trait  we ranked the 18 017 genes according to their partial correlations with the metabolic trait under study (conditional on sex and breed). Then  an enrichment score measuring the extent to which a predefined set of genes (e.g.  genes in a specific KEGG for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes category) clustered at the top or the bottom of the ranks is calculated for each gene set. The normalized enrichment scores were used to measure the strength of the association between gene sets and the metabolic trait. The significance and FDR of the associations were determined by 1000 permutations []. The gene expression data were corrected for sex and breed effects  and corresponding residuals were used to build up a weighted gene co-expression network using R package weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) [  ]. Briefly  a Pearson correlation matrix was first obtained and then transformed into an adjacency matrix A using a power function  = | |    where | | is the absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficients between probeset  and probeset    is the element in A. The network connectivity () of probeset  is defined as  where index  corresponds to all probesets other than probeset  in the network   is the overall number of transcripts studied []. The parameter  is chosen so that the connectivity distribution approximates a scale-free criterion  () =  . The adjacency matrix was further transformed into a distance matrix through topological overlap-based dissimilarity measures; finally a dynamic clustering procedure was applied on the distance matrix to divide the entire co-expression network into multiple modules []. Similarly  the intramodular connectivity probeset  was defined as   where index  indicates all probesets other than probeset  in a specific module of size  . We also introduced a standardized inter-tissue connectivity of probeset :   which measures the connection strength for a probeset  to probesets in external tissues  here index  indicates all the  probesets in tissues other than the tissue to which probeset  corresponds. The strength of connection between a pair of tissues with regard to gene expression is defined as   where  and  correspond to probesets in tissue 1 and tissue 2  and  and  are the number of probesets in tissue 1 and tissue 2  respectively. The porcine Affymetrix probeset identifiers were converted into their human orthologs using the latest annotation file version (2010) from []. The gene category enrichment analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation  Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) web-accessible program []. The physiological relevance and main statistics of the 12 metabolites considered in this study are summarized in Table . Overall  sex had little influence. Given a p-value threshold of 0.05  only the NEFA levels differed between sexes  with male pigs having higher NEFA levels than female pigs (1.22 ± 0.46 mmol/L vs. 0.96 ± 0.33 mmol/L) (Figure ). In comparison  breed was a greater source of variability. Breed effects were significant for six traits (P < 0.05). The most breed-biased trait was total protein content  followed by NEFA  ALP  LDL-C  haptoglobin and PigMAP. Sino-European hybrid pigs had the highest NEFA and ALP levels  but the lowest PigMAP and LDL-C levels  Iberian pigs had the highest total protein and PigMAP levels  but the lowest ALP level and a relatively low NEFA content and the Duroc and Large White pigs had the highest LDL-C levels (Figure ). The correlation coefficients among the levels of the 12 metabolites are summarized in Additional file : Table S1. The strongest correlation was observed between LDL-C and cholesterol (r = 0.84)  which is not unexpected since cholesterol is defined as the sum of LDL-C  HDL-C and other forms of lipoprotein associated cholesterol. . a) Bar plots of metabolic traits that significantly differed across sexes and breeds i.e. Duroc (DU)  Iberian (IB)  Landrace (LR)  Large White (LW) and a Sino-European hybrid line (YL). b) Dendrogram of the four pig breeds (DU  IB  LR  LW) in terms of average standardized values for the 12 plasma metabolites. c-e) Dendrograms between breed z-scores for a subset of tissues i.e. thyroid (THYG)  adenohypophysis (AHYP) and backfat (FATB). Differences in metabolite levels among breeds were also visualized with a dendrogram  these differences being defined as 1 - r  where r is the correlation coefficient between standardized average values of 12 metabolites in any two breeds. Note that a perfect positive correlation corresponds to 0  no correlation to 1 and a perfect negative correlation to 2 on the y axis (Figure ). To facilitate the comparison with the dendrograms built with gene expression data  only the 16 animals with transcriptome data were used. As shown in Figure   the Iberian and Large White breeds were within the same clade  whereas the Duroc breed and the Sino-European hybrids clustered together in a distinct clade. The height of these two clades was approximately equal to 1  meaning that the metabolite levels between Iberian and Large White pigs  and between Duroc and Sino-European pigs were uncorrelated  whereas the total height of the tree was ~ 1.6  suggesting a negative correlation between clades. Notably  we observed similar patterns in dendrograms constructed using a Bayesian standardized measure of the breed's gene expression levels [] in adenohypophysis  thyroid gland  backfat tissue  hypothalamus  and female gonad (Figure ). Next  we investigated the association between metabolites and transcripts in each tissue separately across the 16 pigs (see methods above). A probeset was defined as a quantitative trait transcript (QTT) if its association with a particular metabolic trait achieved a nominal P value < 0.01. The number of QTT for the 12 metabolites in each tissue is shown in Table . For most of the metabolic traits  the number of QTT in the five tissues did not exceed the number expected by chance. Only three traits  ALT  HDL-C and NEFA measures had more than 500 QTT (FDR ~ 50%) detected in at least one tissue. For ALT  3 322 QTT (FDR ~ 6%) were detected in the thyroid  which is much higher than the number of QTT associated with ALT in other tissues. For NEFA  we observed more than 500 QTT in four tissues: adenohypophysis  gonad  hypothalamus and thyroid. Note that fewer QTT were found in backfat tissue than in other tissues  although NEFA is mainly secreted by adipose tissue. To assess the tissue specificity of associations between transcripts and metabolites and to which extent QTT and functional gene sets associated with a particular metabolite were shared across tissues  we used two approaches: QTT overlap analysis and GSEA. To evaluate the overlap of QTT  we examined whether the number of QTT shared by any two tissues was significantly larger than random expectations using Fisher's exact test. Generally  a very limited overlap of QTT across tissues was observed for most of the traits. Excessive QTT overlaps between tissues (P value < 10) were observed only for HDL-C and NEFA levels (Table ). The QTT enriched for genes involved in a biological process i.e. RNA processing (Table ) were those shared by hypothalamus and thyroid and associated with HDL-C. GSEA associates gene sets  rather individual genes  to a given trait  and has been shown to have greater power in finding similarities between two independent studies than in a single-gene analysis []. Figure  shows the top 10 KEGG pathways with the most significant normalized enrichment scores  five positive (red) and five negative (blue) for NEFA in the five tissues. Similar to the QTT overlaps  a limited number of pathways were preserved across tissues. A similar situation was observed for other metabolic traits. Overall  these observations suggest that the associations between transcriptome and metabolites are highly tissue-specific. This is also in agreement with our previous analyses [  ]  that highlighted that the factor with the largest effect on transcriptome was tissue. . Red (blue) denotes top five pathways with positive (negative) normalized enrichment scores in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for backfat (FATB)  gonad (GONA)  adenohypophysis (AHYP)  thyroid (THYG)  hypothalamus (HYPO). A gene co-expression network is a representation of how transcripts are correlated. Genes within the same biological pathway can be highly correlated and therefore grouped into the same module. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis  the QTT for each of the 12 metabolic traits in each of the five tissues were clustered into one to four modules. Because the networks were constructed using probesets separately for each tissue  we refer to these networks as single-tissue networks. Furthermore  we examined the biological significance of these modules by gene ontology (GO) categories (including biological processes  molecular function and cellular component) and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis. The enrichment of these gene categories was assessed by p values corrected by the Benjamini and Hochberg approach []. Five of the 12 traits  i.e. NEFA  ALT  HDL-C  glucose and triglyceride levels were found to have a least one module enriched for genes in certain KEGG or GO categories (P < 0.05  Table  and Additional file : Table S2). The most striking result was found for NEFA  for which enrichment of functional categories was observed in four tissues. The backfat module was enriched in oxidation reduction and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. The gonad module was enriched in genes participating in the regulation of protein and nucleotide metabolisms  in cell-cell signaling and T cell proliferation. We observed that both adenohypophysis (30 genes) and hypothalamus (44 genes) modules were enriched for genes involved in protein transport  however  only three genes ( and ) were shared between tissues. This is consistent with the highly tissue-specific pattern of associations mentioned above. For ALT  the most remarkable tissue is thyroid  for which the 3322 QTT were grouped into a single module  96% of the QTT being positively associated with ALT. This module is enriched in genes related to a large variety of functional categories (Table ). The gonad module was enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion  leukocyte trans-endothelial migration  nucleoside triphosphate metabolism and blood vessel development. The previous results were obtained from analyses on separate tissues. Because endocrine tissues regulate the homeostasis of plasma metabolites through the secretion of hormones collaboratively rather than independently  a deeper understanding of the biology should be gained by considering several tissues simultaneously. We assumed that inter-tissue communications would be reflected in the inter-tissue gene correlations. To investigate the inter-tissue connections at the gene expression level  we constructed a multiple-tissue gene co-expression network that contained 5148 nodes (QTT) associated with NEFA from the five tissues. We focused on NEFA because it was the metabolite for which the largest number of QTT and biologically meaningful modules across the five tissues was found (Tables  and ). In this multiple-tissue network  a large proportion of the nodes were loosely connected  whereas a small proportion of nodes were highly connected (Figure ). The hypothalamus genes had the highest average inter-tissue connectivity  while the gonad genes had the lowest (Figure ). We also assessed the connection strength between tissues. Interestingly  the strongest connection was observed between hypothalamus and adenohypophysis (Additional file : Table S3)  two tissues that are closely related. The entire network was divided into five modules (Figure ). Module 1 was enriched for adenohypophysis probesets  modules 2 and 4 were enriched for gonad probesets  whereas module 3 was overrepresented with hypothalamus and thyroid probesets. Module 5 was not enriched for any tissue (Additional file : Table S4). . a) Distribution of probeset connectivity in the multiple-tissue network. b) Box plot of standardized inter-tissue connectivity of genes in the five tissues i.e. backfat (FATB)  gonad (GONA)  adenohypophysis (AHYP)  thyroid (THYG) and hypothalamus (HYPO). c) Heat map for the multiple-tissue network  color shades i.e.  from white to red represent the correlation strength between a pair of probesets; different modules are indicated by different colors in the row and column box  and ordered by size (the module labels are shown on top of the graph); the genes within modules in the rows and columns are sorted according to their intramodular connectivity. d) A subset of the multiple-tissue network containing nodes that are QTT for NEFA in the five tissues; here  the nodes represent the top 10% probesets with the highest intramodular connectivity in each of the four modules; node colors denote the tissues: red (hypothalamus)  blue (adenohypophysis)  yellow (gonad)  cyan (thyroid) and green (backfat); two nodes were connected with an edge if their correlation was significant (nominal P < 10  FDR < 0.05)  the pink (blue) edge indicates a positive (negative) correlation. Highly connected (hub) nodes constitute the backbones of a network structure. In Figure   we show a subset of the entire network using the top 10% probesets with the highest intra-modular connectivity (hub nodes). Several interesting observations can be made. All hub nodes in module 1 corresponded to adenohypophysis  while all hub nodes in modules 2 and 4 corresponded to gonad  these modules possibly reflecting biological processes that operate within tissues. In contrast  hub nodes in module 3 corresponded to four tissues including hypothalamus  thyroid  adenohypophysis and backfat  suggesting that the genes in this module could be part of gene regulation pathways that are involved in communications between tissues. Notice that 64% (73/114) of the hub genes in module 3 corresponded to hypothalamus  which is regarded as an organ integrating information from the body's nutritional and hormonal signals. Both positive and negative correlations among hub nodes were present in module 3  indicating the existence of feedback signaling. In comparison  only positive correlations among probesets within the three other modules were observed. There are many more links between module 1 and module 3 than between any other pair of modules. Many of these are links between hypothalamus and adenohypophysis genes. Interestingly  hormone secretion in the adenohypophysis is directly regulated by neurons in the hypothalamus. Thus  these observations emphasize the central role of the hypothalamus with regard to gene regulation networks. Plasma metabolite levels are main indicators of endocrine status  including health status  and are potential predictors of performance. In this study  a survey of 12 plasma metabolites showed that six metabolites  including total protein  NEFA  ALP  LDL-C  haptoglobin and PigMAP are affected by breed ( < 0.05) and therefore have a partial genetic cause. The Iberian pig  which is fatter and grows more slowly than commercial pig breeds  has the highest average levels of total protein and PigMAP  but the lowest level of ALP. Interestingly  ALP is reported to be associated with body weight in pigs []. The Sino-European hybrid pigs have lower haptoglobin and PigMAP average levels which are positively associated with inflammatory processes. This suggests that the Sino-European hybrid pigs could have a weaker inflammatory response as compared to e.g.  Duroc and Landrace breeds (Figure ). Notably  we observed a similar pattern of correlation among breeds in terms of both the levels of the 12 metabolites and the transcriptome in multiple tissues (Figure ). The endocrine glands play important roles in maintaining homeostasis of metabolites in blood. Here  we report an association analysis between gene expression profiles in five endocrine tissues and plasma metabolites in pigs. The associations were found to be highly tissue-specific  as suggested by the limited overlap of QTT and biological pathways in the five tissues for all the metabolites. The QTT for NEFA  ALT  HDL-C  triglyceride and glucose within each tissue were grouped into biologically meaningful sub-networks. Furthermore  we constructed a multiple-tissue network using QTT from the five tissues for NEFA. Overall  the FDR of the associations between probesets and metabolites was high at the current significance threshold (P < 0.01) and a similar high FDR was also observed at a stricter threshold (P < 0.001). This is likely due to the limited size of the sample (N = 16). Yet  we did find a significant increase in the number of QTT for NEFA and ALT  and the QTT within tissues were grouped into biologically meaningful modules (detailed below). The limited overlap between QTT and gene pathways across tissues suggests that the associations between endocrine transcriptome and biochemical traits were highly tissue-specific. This is in agreement with our previous analyses of the data as well [] and with the literature in general. For instance  Yang et al. [] have reported a minimal overlap and very different functional categories of sexually dimorphic genes in brain  liver  adipose and muscle of mice. Therefore  candidate genes or gene pathways e.g.  obtained from genome-wide association studies should be investigated in the context of specific tissues. The most significant observations regarding QTT number concerned NEFA. NEFA derive from the hydrolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue or lipoproteins  circulate in the blood and serve as source of energy (especially for heart and muscle) and cellular signaling messengers. In the backfat module  we found that genes involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (such as    and ) were negatively correlated with NEFA  suggesting that the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was repressed in animals with higher plasma NEFA levels. Moreover  other genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolisms (such as    and ) were also found negatively correlated with NEFA in this module. The hypothalamus module for NEFA was enriched for genes related to synapses  learning and memory. Many genes participating in protein transport and localization processes like  and  are also active at synapses. Synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus is known to be associated with nutritional state []. In the adenohypophysis module  genes involved in calcium ion binding  protein transport and localization  neuron projection and in the presynaptic membrane were overrepresented. The importance of calcium-dependent electrical activity in adenohypophysis cells has been reviewed  e.g.  by []. Both in vitro [] and in vivo [] experiments have shown that changing NEFA concentrations can alter pituitary hormone secretion in pigs. Both in humans and dog  it was shown that the plasma NEFA level increases after administration of growth hormone []  NEFA in turn can block growth hormone secretion []. Thus  in general  we observe that enriched functional categories often have a physiological interpretation. For ALT  the most relevant tissues in this analysis are the thyroid and gonad (Tables  and ). The observed large number (3322) of QTT and wide range of functional categories in thyroid suggest a close relationship between thyroid function and plasma ALT levels. It is well known that ALT blood levels reflect the liver condition since clinical links between the thyroid and liver are well documented. Liver metabolizes the thyroid hormone  which in turn influences the liver function and thyroid disorders are often associated with an elevation of ATL []. In the gonad module  we checked the genes in the enriched functional categories using DAVID online tools   and found that many genes (   and ) related to cell adhesion or migration were associated to ovarian tumors. Moorthy et al. (2005) reported that administration of gonadal hormones like estradiol and progesterone decreased ALT levels in heart  liver  kidney and uterus in naturally menopausal rats []. For HDL-C  the backfat module  was slightly enriched for apolipoprotein genes including        and  (P = 0.061). This observation is unexpected  since no evidence was found to support the synthesis of these apolipoproteins in adipose tissue. Both thyroid gland and hypothalamus modules contain a group of genes participating in mRNA processing specifically mRNA splicing. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an important role in the control of neuronal development and function []. Thyroid hormones and their receptors have been shown to stimulate reverse cholesterol transport in animal models []. To explore the connections between tissues at the gene expression level  we built a co-expression network containing all the QTT for NEFA from the five tissues (Figure ). Module 3  in which hypothalamus genes are overrepresented  appears to be particularly interesting. The top 10% most connected genes in this module are from four different tissues and might constitute core regulation pathways involved in communication between tissues. Additionally  we have also shown that genes have a significantly higher average inter-tissue connectivity in the hypothalamus than in other tissues (Figure ). These observations emphasize the central role of hypothalamus genes in the multiple-tissue co-expression network. Dobrin et al. (2009) constructed inter-tissue co-expression networks between hypothalamus  liver and adipose tissue. Their results also suggested the hypothalamus as the controlling tissue since asymmetric connectivity was more common in the hypothalamus than in other tissues. e.g.  the most connected hypothalamus gene   was linked to 169 adipose genes  while adipose gene  was only linked to two hypothalamus genes. Interestingly  the hypothalamus is known as an organ that integrates and responds to signals from peripheral tissues [  ]. More links were found in hub genes between modules 1 and 3 than between any other modules (Figure )  suggesting that the genes in these two modules act in a more coordinate fashion. Several hypothalamus genes (   and ) and a backfat gene () in module 3 were highly connected to hub genes in module 1. Furthermore  we examined the hub genes in module 3 (Additional file : Table S5) using DAVID online tools []  and highlighted the genes associated with functions in corresponding tissues. We found genes in the hypothalamus that were related to the differentiation and development of the central nervous system (   and ) and to protein transport and localization ( and ). Most of these genes are relevant to neuron function or energy balance e.g.   is a member of the cyclin dependent kinase family  and serves as an essential modulator of synaptic function and plasticity [].  is a GTPase predominantly expressed in brain that has been suggested to participate in retrograde transport of cargo in neuronal cells []. This gene was also up-regulated in the brain of mice fed with omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid enriched diet [].  is a Golgi associated poly-ADP-ribose polymerase gene  abundantly expressed in brain. -deficient mice show an increase in energy expenditure  fatty acid oxidation and insulin simulated glucose utilization []. Two transcripts in the backfat module correspond to   which is involved in the synthesis of UDP-glucose  the precursor of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue  and of lactose in lactating mammary gland. Among the adenohypophysis genes   and  are related to the function of the adenohypophysis.  is a well studied gene that is abundantly expressed in the hypothalamus and adenohypophysis and related to food intake and obesity [  ].  is a GTP-binding protein involved in vesicular trafficking in anterior pituitary cells [].  is an isoform of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)  and plays an important role on pituitary gonadotrope function. Our results suggest a partial hereditary basis for some metabolite levels  like total protein  NEFA  ALP  LDL-C  haptoglobin and PigMAP. Single-tissue gene co-expression networks were composed of highly connected modules associated with metabolites (especially NEFA) that had a biologically meaningful role. These networks were  in general  tissue-specific. Finally  the multiple-tissue network emphasized the central role played by the hypothalamus.

Estimators of genealogical coancestry based on molecular data are easy to derive. Estimators based on molecular covariance are more accurate than those based on identity by state. A correction considering the random distribution of allelic frequencies improves accuracy of these estimators  especially for populations with very strong drift. The concept of coancestry (or kinship) between two individuals plays a central role in practical applications of genetics. In animal breeding  coancestry coefficients are required both to estimate genetic parameters and to carry out genetic evaluations []. In sociobiology  they are important to make evolutionary interpretations of social behavior and to determine parameters of the biology of reproduction. In the field of animal conservation  they constitute fundamental tools to estimate inbreeding depression and to optimize genetic management in a conservation program. Several estimators of coancestries based on molecular information have been proposed  including recent estimators that are designed to deal with a large number of markers []. These estimators are based on intuitive basic identities that were explicitly shown by Cockerham [] (and also [])  namely  that resemblance between genotypes is a function of coancestry (identity by descent) and allelic frequencies at the base population. Interest in this subject has grown with the use of dense marker data. However  this body of literature is poorly known in the human and animal genetics communities. The aim of this work is to build estimators of genealogical coancestry from molecular coancestries and molecular covariances and to illustrate their behavior based on simulations and a real data set. In the following sections   refers to the gene frequency value for genotypes    and   coded  1  1/2 and 0  respectively  of individual  at locus  where  and . Gene frequency is half the gene content (number of copies of the reference allele A). Two animals will be referred to by indexes  and  and two loci by  and . Allelic frequency in the base population is notated by . Loci will be assumed to be neutral. In both population and quantitative genetics  the genetic relationship between individuals can be quantified by Malecot's coefficient of coancestry (or kinship) []. The coancestry coefficient     between individuals  and  is defined as the probability that  at a random  neutral  autosomal locus  an allele drawn randomly from individual  is identical by descent (IBD) to an allele drawn randomly from individual . The inbreeding coefficient of an individual      is defined as the probability that the two alleles carried by this individual at a given locus are IBD. The inbreeding of an individual equals the coancestry between its parents. Finally  the self-coancestry  of an individual equals 1/2(1+ ). These coefficients can be estimated from pedigrees using the tabular method []. For diploid individuals  twice the coancestry coefficient is the additive relationship coefficient  which describes the ratio between the genetic covariance between individuals and the genetic variance of the base population. If  individuals have been genotyped for one molecular marker  the molecular coancestry (or kinship)   between individuals  and   is the probability that two alleles at the locus taken at random from each individual are equal (identical by state  IBS). The coancestry concept includes the self-coancestry of an individual with itself     in which case two alleles are drawn with replacement within individuals. Analogously   is the molecular inbreeding of individual   i.e. the probability that the two alleles carried by this individual at a given locus are IBS. By definition   = 1/2(1 ). Molecular coancestry between individuals  and  can be calculated at a given locus  as: and averaged across loci as: although other alternatives could be considered []. If a set of individuals has been genotyped for several loci  we can calculate  for each individual  the variance of the gene frequencies across loci and for each pair of individuals  the covariance between two individuals  also across loci. The covariance between individuals  and  can be calculated as: where   and  is the number of loci. It is important to emphasize that both molecular coancestry and molecular covariance are empirical measures of genetic similarity  and do not rely on any assumption about how the genotypes were generated. Notice that in this definition Cov has to be computed over one or two individuals at a time and across loci. Therefore  it can be applied to one individual  or to individuals from different populations. Loci are considered as exchangeable (in the statistical sense)  similar to how loci are treated in the context of gene dropping analysis where  instead of averaging the results over loci we can  equivalently  start the gene dropping analysis with just one locus and average over many replicates []. Here  we provide an intuitive explanation of Cockerham's [] derivation. If the individuals are genealogically connected  the genealogical coancestry can also be defined as the molecular coancestry for 'virtual' alleles at loci that are all different in the founder population. For instance  in the gene dropping analysis []  we start with a founder population where  founders have many independent loci  each with  different alleles present in the founder population. If we then calculate the molecular coancestry of each pair of individuals and average over many loci  we recover precisely the same coancestry values as those calculated by  for example  the tabular or path coefficient methods. Let us imagine now  that to each one of the 2 alleles at a locus in the base population  we assign a tag at random that indicates whether the allele is  or  with probability  and  = 1- (because this assignment has been done at random  the genotypic frequencies    and  will be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). For this locus  the molecular coancestry between two individuals will be the probability that two alleles  taken at random from each individual have the same tag (thus are IBS). This could happen in two ways: either because they have become IBD as genealogy progresses (i.e. they are copies of the same unique allele from the base population  with probability  )  or because they are not IBD (with probability 1 -  ) but have the same tag in the base population (with probability  + ). Therefore  on expectation  This expression can be obtained from Equation () in reference [] by summing the two events of IBS ( =  or  = )  weighted by probabilities  and . The relationship between genealogical coancestry and molecular covariance  shown in []  is also known from standard population genetics (e.g. []). Briefly  two gametes co-vary (are identical) with a probability (and correlation)  and thus  the covariance of the gene frequency of two individuals across loci (replicates) is (assuming the same  for all loci): Alternative derivations of these expressions (3) and (4) are given in the Appendix. A simple relationship exists between the expectations of molecular coancestry and molecular covariance: From expressions (3) and (4)  two different method-of-moments estimators of  can be obtained by reversing the formulas: Expressions (3) and (5) are well known []  whereas (6) does not seem  to our knowledge  to have been used previously. The above formulas refer to a scenario in which the base population has one or many independent loci with a common allelic frequency . If this is not the case and  for individual loci is a random variable that has been sampled from a distribution with mean  and variance  ()  taking expected values across loci  we obtain: Then  using and   we obtain The first term involving  () represents a bias that results from an artificial covariance between individuals (even between unrelated ones) that is caused by variation in allele frequencies between loci. Equation () is derived as follows. As shown in the Appendix  the expectation of the molecular covariance between individuals  and  for a unique allele frequency  is where ( ) =  +  and  ( )  ( ) = . For random allele frequencies  in addition to averaging across the sampling distribution of individuals  and  in the population ( ) one has to average also across allele frequencies ( )  and the expression above becomes which  after algebra  gives equation (). Therefore  with varying allele frequencies  estimators of genealogical coancestry based on equations () and () can be built as These estimators use the same notation as expressions (5) and (6); including or not variation in allelic frequencies will depend on the context. Assuming that the allele frequencies are random draws from a Beta distribution with parameters  and    and  () are /() and / [() ( +  1)]  respectively.Thus  to extrapolate from molecular coancestry or molecular covariance to genealogical coancestry requires that the distribution of the base population allele frequencies is known  or at least its first and second moments are known. However  for practical applications  both  and  () can be replaced by their estimates from the current population  namely where Equations 5-6 and to 9-10 (using when necessary Equations  to ) will be implemented in the simulations. These four methods will be compared by simulation with one of the methods proposed by Van Raden []  which can be seen as an implementation of expression (6). In the first method proposed by Van Raden  across individual allele frequencies were computed (not necessarily using Equation ())  and then estimators of molecular covariance were computed for each locus and then averaged over total molecular variance as follows: This method corresponds to positing a linear model where  for a hypothetical quantitative trait  the genetic value of an individual is the sum of independent marker effects; overall (i.e.  due to the sum of the effects of all loci) covariance among individuals in the sample is computed first  and then standardized by the overall variance of a base population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with allele frequencies equal to that observed in the sample  to arrive to additive relationships. In the second method of Van Raden (later used  for example  in [])  estimators of genealogical coancestry are computed as in Equation () for each locus and then averaged  as follows: The main difference between estimators (14) and (15) is that less polymorphic loci get more credit in estimator (15). Note that Equation () is undefined for  equal to 0 or 1  which is not the case for Equation (). These estimators differ slightly from the combined use of Equations () to (12); in Equations () and ()  individual allele frequencies  are centered with reference to allele frequencies  across individuals but within loci  whereas in Equations () to (12)  covariances and coancestries and are computed for each pair of individuals as shown in Equations () and ()  i.e. individual allele frequencies  are centered using frequencies across loci but within individuals: . Here  loci are not exchangeable in the same sense as for equations () and ()  because loci with different allele frequencies in the population will contribute more or less to the covariances. A population was bred from a base (founder) population of 20 individuals. One hundred or 10 000 biallelic loci representing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers  distributed over 10 chromosomes  were simulated. Loci were autosomal  unlinked  neutral  without mutation  and followed Mendelian inheritance. In the first scenario  at each locus  alleles at the founder population were sampled with a fixed probability value of  = 0.5. In the second scenario  at each locus  alleles were sampled with a probability taken from a flat Beta distribution (1  1). Therefore  there was Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within loci. Ten discrete generations of 20 individuals were bred  using random mating with separate sexes  resulting in a data set of 200 individuals. We also ran some simulations with linkage between loci but the results were not much affected. Thus  we included only one example with high linkage with either 100 SNP over 1 Morgan or 10 000 SNP over 20 Morgan. Relatedness between all pairs of individuals was estimated from the marker data using each of the four (5)  (6)  (9) and (10) estimators described above and those of Van Raden (14) and (15). For the second estimator of Van Raden (15)  monomorphic loci were ignored because for some loci the estimated value  may be one or zero and the estimator becomes undefined. In addition  relatedness between individuals was calculated from the pedigree  using the tabular method [] and this was considered to be the true value; this is true if there are many unlinked loci (avoiding noise due to finite sampling and co-segregation)  which holds in the simulation. We also compared results to true IBD probabilities rather than pedigree coancestries. This is relevant for real situations where deviations from the average relationship exist due to linkage and finite sampling []. To obtain true IBD probabilities  we coded the alleles in the base population as unique alleles  with codes 1 through 2. To illustrate the procedure on real data  a set of 1 827 French Holstein bulls genotyped with the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip for 51 325 polymorphic (minor allele frequency > 0) SNP was used. The pedigree of these bulls was traced back as far as possible  including 6 940 individuals. We used PEDIG [] to compute the equivalent number of known generations: 4.22  and the average number of ancestors: 91.4. Estimators (5)  (6)  (9) (10)  (14) and (15) were used to compute coancestries among the genotyped animals. Some of the computations used the preGSf90 software with methods detailed in []. The agreement between the molecular coancestries and molecular covariances and their expected values were checked by simulation. As for the comparison with IBD probabilities  the results were almost identical to those obtained with genealogical coancestries except for the scenario with a low number of markers. Table  shows the regression of the genealogical coancestry on the molecular coancestry or the molecular covariance. Very good agreement exists between expected (in estimators (5)  (6)  (9) and (10)) and observed values of intercept and slope when the number of SNP is very large; also  the coefficients of determination are close to 1. This occurs in the two considered situations ( fixed or  variable among loci). The coefficients of determination are low when the number of SNP is low  especially when the allele frequencies in the base population are variable. For the simulated data  we implemented estimators of the genealogical coancestry based on molecular coancestry (equations () or (9)) and molecular covariance (equations () or (10))  using the true or estimated frequencies. In both cases ( fixed or random) estimates based on coancestry and covariance were almost identical and only the regression features when using  are presented in Table . As expected  the estimation works very well if the number of SNP is high. If it is low  the estimation of the intercept is biased upwards and the regression coefficient downwards. When the number of SNP used to estimate  decreases  the covariance between estimator and the true value decreases and the regression coefficient also decreases; the intercept increases as a direct consequence. When parameters of the true distribution of allele frequencies in the founder population are not known  we replaced them by their estimates according to Equations () and (). Table  shows that this simple method works well with respect to the goodness of fit (R) but the estimates were biased (and inflated: b < 1) even for a high number of SNP. Indeed  Van Raden [] already pointed out that base allele frequencies should be used to recover correct inbreeding coefficients. Table  gives the same results but for a scenario where loci are linked  with 1 (100 SNP) or 20 (10000 SNP) Morgans per gamete. Results were very similar to the unlinked situation (Table )  although the estimation improved for the small number of markers and worsened for the high number of markers. For the situation with linkage  we also analyzed what happens if we use IBD instead of the genealogical coancestry as the true values (right hand side of Table ). The fit is better for IBD values than for genealogical coancestry  especially with a low number of markers. Results presented in Table  show that the Van Raden estimator (14) works less well than those proposed here based on molecular coancestry or molecular covariance. The reason appears to be that inferences about the distribution of allele frequencies in the founder population are less accurate when based on the average across individuals than when based on the average across loci. In fact  the results of the Van Raden estimator improve when the distribution of allele frequencies is estimated from the data of the last five generations (R = 0.69 or 0.96 for 100 and 10000 SNP  respectively) or when the population simulated comprises four generations of 50 individuals per generation (R = 0.53 or 0.96 for 100 and 10000 SNP  respectively). Thus  strong drift exacerbates the problem. Results from the second estimator of Van Raden (15) were almost identical to those from estimator (14). Considering all coancestries among the 1827 bulls in the real data set  Table  summarizes the comparisons among all estimators. The average genealogical coancestry was 0.04 and whereas estimators (5) and (6) were severely biased  estimators (9)  (10) and (14) were (slightly) biased in the opposite direction  showing that  as described by Hayes et al. []  they effectively set the current population as the base. We will refer to this later. Estimators (5) versus (6) and (9) versus (10) showed the same bias; estimators (5-9) and (6-10) were perfectly correlated  which is logical because they are linear transformations of each other. Only estimator (14) provided a variance of coancestries similar to genealogical values  although all estimators show higher variances; this can also be seen in the simulations because the regression coefficients were less than 1. Estimator (15) is unbiased  but shows low correlations with all other methods and higher variance due to numerical instability caused by low minor allele frequencies. Estimator (14) is an adequate estimator with regard to closeness to genealogical coancestries. Genetic marker data are widely used to estimate the relatedness between individuals. Such marker-based relatedness is valuable in many areas of research on the evolution and conservation of natural populations  for example for estimating heritabilities  estimating population sizes  minimizing inbreeding in captive populations  and studying social structures and patterns of mating. Since the 1950's  many relatedness estimators have been proposed. However  in the last years  the use of high-density SNP genotypes in 'genomic selection' has prompted the need of a genomic coancestry matrix [  ]  more accurate than the pedigree-based one  because true coancestry will be affected by linkage and finite sampling []  and also because pedigree-based genealogical coancestry is obliged to assume an average relationship among founders (usually 0). Van Raden [  ] has proposed the use of molecular covariance to derive (more exact) genealogical coancestries. Because of its simplicity and computational efficiency  the use of molecular covariances has quickly become widespread [  ]  although its origin is often erroneously attributed [  ]. In fact  the earliest reference we are aware of its use is []. Here  we have recalled Cockerham's original derivation [] and have provided an equivalent derivation. This provides further proof for the prediction methods of gene content of non genotyped animals through pedigree relationships [  ]  which  in turn  are the basis for the single-step method to combine genomic and pedigree relationships [  ]. We have also shown that  if we know the true distribution of the allelic frequencies in the founder population  it is possible to obtain very accurate estimates of genealogical coancestries from either molecular coancestries or covariances if the number of markers is high. Even if allelic frequencies in the base population are unknown  and the results are severely biased  a high correlation between the estimated and the true genealogical values is maintained. In principle  it is possible to infer founder frequencies using either genealogical or marker-based relationships  possibly iteratively [    ]. However  this is usually quite inaccurate and results in estimators that are very similar to crude population frequencies. In addition  a question remains on what is the ideal base population  which is unsolvable if no pedigree is known. In fact  using allelic frequencies in the observed population (crude means) is equivalent to defining  a population with the same gene frequencies as the observed population as the base generation  but with genotypic frequencies in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium []. To change the base population  a correction based on Wright's F coefficients has recently been suggested []. In practice  the computed matrix of coancestries () is used for two purposes. One purpose is the estimation of breeding values based on marker genotype data. In this case  if no other information is used (i.e.  there is no use of pedigree-based relationships )  adding or removing constants from  is equivalent to fitting an overall (random) mean to the model for genetic values. Thus  estimates of breeding values will be simply shifted by a constant but their contrasts and selection decisions will be unaffected. In this case  the variance components need to be estimated with the same  and will be inflated. However  if mixing of  and  is needed  as in the single-step procedure [  ]  then the two matrices need to be compatible. In this case  bias due to selection can be a problem. A recent correction based on F suggested by Powell et al. [] has been proposed for the single-step method and has been shown to increase accuracy and remove bias of genetic evaluations [  ]. This correction works  roughly  by fixing the biases and variances of the estimator of coancestry that can be observed  for instance  in Table . For conservation purposes  most strategies work by minimizing the average coancestry []  which can be expressed as a quadratic form . The optimization of this expression is invariant to the addition (or multiplication) of any constant to   unless more than one population is considered. If the  matrices are computed separately for each population  then they will not be compatible. If pooled current frequencies are used  then the more variable or more abundant population will be favored. Possibly  in this case  a clear definition of the allele frequencies (and thus the base population) to compute coancestries is needed. In addition  the real data example shows that  in this data set  estimators based on molecular covariances are more similar and more compatible with those based on pedigree  than estimators based on coancestries  in particular estimator (14). We do not recommend estimator (15) because it does not agree well with genealogical coancestries  the distribution of coancestries has more variance  and it is unstable for minor allelic frequencies close to 0 and undefined for monomorphic loci. Unfortunately this estimator is recommended by some authors [    ]. The rationale to compare and estimate genealogical coancestries based on molecular empirical coancestries or covariances has been shown for any outbred or inbred population  and different estimators have been developed which account for variation in allele frequencies between loci. In practice  different estimators lead to similar conclusions. Estimators are easy to construct but suffer from a lack of knowledge on the distribution of allele frequencies in the base population. This is  however  not a problem for most practical applications. We present here a formal derivation of relationship between genealogical and molecular coancestries and covariances. This is an alternative derivation to that of Cockerham [] and to our knowledge it has not been shown so far. We will prove it for a population of outbred individuals and will sketch the proof for a population of inbred individuals. There are three ways in which a pair of relatives can share genes identical by descent (IBD) Crow and Kimura (Figure );   2 and  are the probabilities that  and  share no genes  just one gene and both genes IBD ( + 2 +  = 1). The coancestry coefficient between two individuals is thus defined as: . The joint genotypic distribution of non-inbred relatives  and  is well known (see for example [])  as shown in Table . The expected value of the molecular coancestry averaged over the nine rows will be After some algebra  The expected value of the molecular coancestry averaged over the nine rows will be  given that ( ) = ( ) =   When either relative may be inbred  we need nine ways in which a pair of relatives can share genes identical by descent [] (Figure ). The following relationships hold: . The joint genotypic distribution of non-inbred relatives  and  when either relative may be inbred is also well known (Table ). First we need to define nine ways in which a pair of relatives can share genes identical by descent and the corresponding k-coefficients. After algebra  we arrive to the same expressions as above for and . Note that the proof of Cockerham [] is general and applies to either outbred or inbred populations.

Due to the availability of affordable genome-wide dense marker maps  the use of marker information in practical animal and plant breeding programs is increasing. In particular  the application of genomic selection is becoming the new standard in animal breeding e.g. [  ]  and is an emerging alternative for marker-assisted selection in plant breeding [  ]. Genomic selection uses genome-wide dense marker maps to accurately predict the genetic ability of an animal  without the need of recording phenotypic performance of its own or from close relatives  such as sibs or offspring e.g. []. Genome-wide prediction is also being recognized as an important tool to predict phenotypes [] and genetic risk for diseases [] in other fields than animal or plant breeding. The key principle for all these applications is the simultaneous estimation of all genome-wide marker effects based on a reference population with known phenotypes. Many different models have been proposed to simultaneously estimate marker effects [  ]. Most of the proposed models try to reduce the effective dimensionality of the marker data  since the number of markers is typically much larger than the number of phenotyped animals in the reference population. Reduction of dimensionality of the markers  i.e. whether a locus affects the trait or not  is often integrated in the sampling process using model selection [  ]. An added benefit of such integrated marker selection procedures is that posterior distributions are provided for the probability that a locus affects a trait  and these can be used for QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) mapping purposes []. By putting emphasis on loci that are closely linked to causative loci  genomic prediction holds the promise to be particularly beneficial for selection on traits that are difficult or expensive to measure  that are sex-linked  or that are expressed late in life. One effective strategy that has been used to deal with such traits in the past  without using genotypic information  has been the implementation of multi-trait prediction with indicator traits that are easier or cheaper to record. These might be closely linked traits  for example somatic cell count as indicator trait of mastitis  or the same trait recorded in a different environment or country. Multi-trait prediction allows to use information simultaneously from relatives and from different traits []. Therefore  an important question is to evaluate what is the added value of including genomic information in multi-trait genomic prediction. The objectives of this paper were to develop methods for multi-trait genomic breeding value prediction  to enable multi-trait genomic selection  and to compare the accuracy of prediction among the different methods and with equivalent single-trait models  based on the results of applications to simulated datasets. Datasets were simulated to compare the different models  in terms of accuracy of predicted breeding values. An effective population size of 500 animals was simulated  including 250 females and 250 males. This structure was kept constant for 1000 generations. Mating was performed by drawing the parents of an animal randomly from the animals of the previous generation. In total  25 replicated datasets were simulated. The simulated genome spanned 5 M (Morgan). Ten thousand bi-allelic loci were simulated across five chromosomes  with equal 0.05 cM distances between adjacent loci. In the first generation  animals received at random alleles 1 or 2 with equal chance. In the 1000 generations thereafter  each locus had a mutation rate of 2.5 × 10  so that a mutation drift balance was reached within a limited number of generations []. A mutation caused allele 1 to become allele 2  and vice versa. Genotypes from the last four generations  as well as pedigree information of the last six generations  were retained for analysis. In total  on average across replicates  5 655 loci segregated in the last four generations. These four generations will hereafter be referred to as generations 1 to 4. Two hundred loci segregating in generations 1 to 4 and evenly distributed across the genome  were drawn to be QTL loci. These QTL were used to simulate two traits  with heritabilities of 0.9 and 0.6  reflecting average offspring performances such as daughter yield deviations [] or de-regressed proofs []. For example  if one considers that the animals in the reference population reflect dairy bulls each with 100 daughters and their phenotypic records  the chosen heritabilities of 0.6 and 0.9 correspond to traits with heritabilities at the phenotypic level of 0.06 and 0.33  respectively  i.e. a fertility and a production trait in dairy cattle. The heritabilities of 0.6 and 0.9 were derived using the formula  e.g. []  where  is the reliability of selection (in this case the heritability used to simulate the phenotypes of the animals in the reference population)   is the number of daughters and  is the heritability at the phenotypic level. The two traits were simulated by drawing the allele substitution effects of each QTL locus from a multivariate normal distribution that followed the simulated genetic correlation. Three genetic correlations were considered  i.e. 0.2  0.5  or 0.8. To investigate the ability of the models to predict breeding values for animals with records for the two traits  only one  or none of the traits  two scenarios were considered differing in the number of animals that had phenotypes available for each of the traits (Table ). In scenario 1  all animals in generations 1 and 2 had phenotypes for both traits. In scenario 2  all animals in generation 1 had phenotypes for both traits  while one half of the animals of generation 2 had phenotypes for the first  and the other half of the animals had phenotypes for the second trait. In both scenarios  all the animals in generations 3 and 4 had no phenotypes for either trait  and thereby reflected juvenile selection candidates. Four different models were used to estimate breeding values. The general multi-trait model was: where  is the phenotypic record for trait j of animal  is the overall mean for trait  is the random polygenic effect of animal  for trait  is a random effect for allele  on trait  at locus  of animal   and  is a random residual for animal . The first model omitted the SNP effects  and used a relationship matrix based on the pedigree retained to estimate the polygenic effects and the polygenic (co)variances of traits 1 and 2 (model A). The second model was the same as the first model  but included a genomic relationship () matrix calculated by using all the markers to estimate the polygenic effects (model G). This  matrix was calculated as described by VanRaden []: where  is the frequency of the second allele at locus   and  is derived from genotypes of all included animals  by subtracting 2 times the allele frequency expressed as a difference of 0.5  i.e. 2( - 0.5)  from matrix  that specifies the marker genotypes for each individual as -1  0 or 1. Here  we used allele frequencies of 0.5 that reflected allele frequencies in the base generation i.e. in the very first generation of the simulation. The third and fourth models included both a polygenic effect with a pedigree-based relationship matrix  and SNP effects. The difference between the third and fourth model resulted from considering one (model 3) or two (model 4) distribution(s) for the SNP effects. SNP effects  in the general model denoted as    were estimated in models 3 and 4 as     according to Meuwissen and Goddard []  where  is the size of the effect of allele  at locus  and  is a scaling factor in the direction vector for locus  that scales the effect at locus  for trait . In the original implementation by Meuwissen and Goddard []  the variance of the direction vector    denoted as   is sampled per locus for each trait  separately  without considering covariances between the traits across loci. Here  in both models 3 and 4 and for the estimation of   covariances between traits across loci are considered. Therefore  the prior distribution for  in this case was  according to Meuwissen and Goddard []: where was chosen such that it reflected the total genetic (co)variance between traits  and   divided by the total number of SNP.  was sampled from the following conditional  variate-inverted Wishart distribution with ( + 10) degrees of freedom: where    = number of evaluated marker loci  and 10 is the number of degrees of freedom for the prior distribution. Model 4 was similar to model 3  but included a QTL-indicator ( ) for each bracket  that had a value of either 0 or 1. According to Meuwissen and Goddard (2004)  in this case the prior distribution of  is similar to that from model 3  but here  was chosen such that it reflected the total genetic (co)variances of traits  and   divided by the total number of expected QTL instead of the number of SNP. Furthermore   was sampled from an inverted Wishart distribution as described above for model 3  but in this case: Where the QTL-indicator  was sampled from: where  is the prior QTL probability  i.e. the probability that  is equal to 1  which follows a Bernoulli distribution. Prior QTL probabilities used in the analyses reflected the prior assumption that 100 QTL underlie both traits. The third model is referred to as model BCp0  since this model is similar to a model that is termed BayesCp0 []. The fourth model is referred to as Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) e.g. []. In all the models  the residuals were assumed to be normally distributed (  )  where  is the  ×  residual covariance matrix. In models A  BCp0 and BSSVS  the polygenic values were assumed to be normally distributed (    )  where A is the additive relationship matrix and  is the  ×  polygenic covariance matrix. Matrices  and  were both sampled in the Gibbs sampler from an inverted Wishart distribution  with a uniform prior distribution. Models A  BCp0 and BSSVS were performed using Gibbs sampling with residual updating. Model A was run for 5 000 cycles  discarding 2 000 cycles for burn-in. Models BCp0 and BSSVS were run for 10 000 cycles  discarding 2 000 cycles for burn-in. Except for the multi-trait runs in the second scenario where 30 000 cycles were run with 10 000 cycles discarded for burn-in  since initial results showed that more cycles were required for convergence in that scenario. Model G was performed using ASReml []  because initial analyses using the Gibbs sampler showed slow convergence of the genetic variances for scenario 2. In the multi-trait analyses of scenario 2 for the models that were analyzed using the Gibbs sampler  residuals for missing phenotypes in generation 2 were sampled using an EM algorithm. The missing residuals were drawn from the following distribution  according to VanTassell and VanVleck []: where  stands for missing and  for observed records. This allowed us to sample the effects in the model using residual updating. Residual (co-)variance matrices were estimated conditional only on residuals linked to observed records. Each simulated dataset and scenario were analyzed three times with all four models: first traits 1 and 2 were analyzed separately in a single-trait (ST) model  and then both traits were analyzed together in a multi-trait (MT) model. The results of each of the different models were evaluated using the accuracy of predictions and the bias of the estimates. Accuracy of prediction was calculated as the correlation between simulated and estimated breeding values. Using t-tests  the significances of differences were investigated between the accuracy obtained with different SNP-based models both within ST and MT models  and between the same SNP-based models in ST and MT application. Bias was assessed by regression of the simulated on estimated breeding values. In addition  (co)variances of the estimated breeding values were compared to those of the simulated breeding values  to assess the ability of th models to capture the true genetic (co)variances. In generations 1 to 4 of the simulated data  the linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers  measured as []  was 0.32. The realized correlations between the simulated breeding values of the two traits were on average 0.25  0.54 and 0.75. Hereafter  we will refer to those correlations as being the simulated genetic correlations. In Figures  and   the accuracies are given for all ST models  per trait and per scenario. For the first trait  the accuracy of model BSSVS was larger than that of model BCp0 that was in turn larger than that of model G and all were considerably larger than the accuracy of model A (Figure ). When omitting the 250 phenotypes from generation 2 (scenario 2)  all accuracies for trait 1 decreased  and the differences between SNP-based models disappeared (Figure ). For the second trait  in scenario 1 the order of accuracies was similar to that for trait 1  but differences were smaller (Figure ). In the case of scenario 2  the accuracy decreased for all animals  but especially for those without phenotypes (Figure ). In all scenarios  the ST models including SNP information yielded similar accuracies  and showed a comparable decrease in accuracy when the distance to the phenotyped animals became larger (i.e. from generation 3 to 4). Only for trait 1 in scenario 1  based on the standard errors of the estimates across replicates  were the accuracies of the different SNP-based models for juvenile animals in generation 3 significantly different from each other (Table ). . Displayed accuracies are for both scenarios across generations with animals with (ph) and without phenotypes (no_ph). . Displayed accuracies are for both scenarios across generations with animals with (ph) and without phenotypes (no_ph). The accuracies of all MT models for trait 1  in both scenarios  were similar to those of ST models. In Figure   the accuracies are shown for trait 2 for scenario 1  considering different genetic correlations with trait 1. The order of accuracies was similar across different genetic correlations (BSSVS > BCp0 > G > > A)  and differences between models were in all cases significant (Table ). For animals without phenotypes  the accuracy increased from 0.03 to 0.04 across models when the genetic correlation increased from 0.25 to 0.75 (Figures  and ). . Displayed accuracies are across generations with animals with (ph) and without phenotypes (no_ph)  with genetic correlations between both traits of 0.25 (A)  0.54 (B) and 0.75 (C)  respectively. In Figure   the accuracies are given for trait 2 and scenario 2  considering different genetic correlations with trait 1. In this case  for animals without phenotypes the order in terms of accuracies was BSSVS > BCp0 > G > > A for all genetic correlations. The differences between BCp0 and BSSVS were small and not significant (Table ). Differences between G and BCp0  and G and BSSVS were always significant (Table ). Accuracies for trait 2 increased from 0.07 to 0.14 for the SNP-based models when the genetic correlation increased from 0.25 to 0.75. For animals with phenotypes  accuracies of the SNP-based models were very similar. . Displayed accuracies are across generations with animals with (ph) and without phenotypes (no_ph)  with genetic correlations between both traits of 0.25 (A)  0.54 (B) and 0.75 (C)  respectively. Tables  and  show the increase in accuracy when changing from ST to MT models in scenarios 1 and 2  respectively for traits 1 and 2. In scenario 1  MT models did not increase accuracies for trait 1 compared to ST models (Table ). In scenario 2  the accuracies for trait 1 were not increased by the MT models for animals with phenotypes. For animals without any phenotypes  the accuracy increased to a maximum of 0.01 for model A and 0.03 for the SNP-based models. For animals with phenotypes for trait 2  the accuracy increased to a maximum of 0.04 both for model A and the SNP-based models. Only in a few situations with a genetic correlation of 0.25  did the MT models yield slightly lower accuracies for trait 1 compared to the ST models. Accuracies of SNP-based models for trait 1 obtained with the MT models were only significantly higher than those from the ST models in scenario 2 when the genetic correlation was 0.75 (Table ). For trait 2  the accuracy increased with the MT model in nearly all the situations (Table ). For animals with phenotypes  a maximum increase in accuracy of 0.05 was observed for both scenarios 1 and 2. For the SNP-based models  maximum increases in scenario 2 were as high as 0.14 for animals that had phenotypes only for trait 1  and 0.09 for animals without any phenotypes. For the first generation of juvenile animals  nearly all the MT models gave significantly higher accuracies for trait 2  when the genetic correlation with trait 1 was 0.54 or higher (Table ). All MT models showed a higher increase in accuracy for trait 2 for animals with only phenotypes for trait 1 compared to animals without any phenotypes. For those animals with only phenotypes for trait 1  the highest increase in accuracy was 0.20 obtained with model A  compared to 0.13-0.14 with G  BCp0 and BSSVS models. In addition to this result  Figure  shows that for the accuracy of trait 2  at genetic correlations of 0.25 and 0.54  having genotypes for the animals is more effective (generation 3_nophen; model G  BCp0 and BSSVS) than having phenotypes for trait 1 (generation 2_nophen; model A). However  to achieve a high accuracy for trait 2 at a genetic correlation of 0.75 having phenotypes for trait 1 is more effective than having genotypes. Table  shows the coefficients of regression of the simulated on the estimated breeding values for the first generation of animals without phenotypes  across both traits and all models and for scenarios 1 and 2. The regression coefficients were all close to 1.0. This indicates that there was generally little bias in the estimated breeding values. Table  shows the correlation between estimated breeding values of traits 1 and 2 for the first generation of animals without phenotypes (generation 3)  across models and scenarios 1 and 2. In all situations  this correlation was lower than the genetic correlation for the ST models  and higher than the genetic correlation for the MT models. For the ST models  the correlations in scenario 1 were closer to the genetic correlations than those in scenario 2. The results from scenario 1 showed that the correlations between estimated breeding values of the two traits from the MT models were closer to the simulated genetic correlations  when SNP-based models were used  compared to the purely polygenic model A. The correlations for model A were higher than the simulated values  despite the fact that genetic correlations estimated in the model were very close to the simulated correlations (results not shown). The objectives of this paper were to develop methods to apply MT genomic breeding value prediction  and to evaluate their impact on the accuracies of obtained breeding values compared to ST genomic breeding value prediction. In the simulations  we assumed an effective population size of 500. This number is higher than the effective population size in current livestock populations  but was primarily chosen to obtain levels of LD  in relation to the distance between markers  that are comparable to that in livestock populations. As a result the accuracies of the ST analyses were somewhat lower than those in other simulation studies where an effective population size of 100 was assumed e.g. [    ]. When MT instead of ST SNP-based models were used  in nearly all the cases  the accuracy of prediction did increase with a maximum increase for the second trait of 0.14. This is in line with a simulation study that showed that an across-country model G for dairy cattle yielded higher accuracies than a model including information from only one country []. The models applied here allowed for increasing complexity levels of the assumed underlying genetic architecture. Model A considers the infinitesimal model  where an infinite number of loci with infinite small effects are assumed. All other models consider a finite locus model  where the number of loci is the number of SNP used. Models G and BCp0 assume that the (co)variance of all SNP is equal. Model BSSVS assumes that there is a distribution with large effects to model SNP that are associated with a QTL and a distribution with small effects to model SNP that are not associated with a QTL. In this sense  only model BSSVS incorporates a variable selection step  which can actually be used for QTL mapping purposes e.g. [  ]. Therefore  it was expected that model BSSVS had the greatest flexibility to fit the SNP effects  followed by models BCp0 and G. The results confirmed this expectation  since model BSSVS generally yielded the highest accuracy  followed by BCp0 and G models. An important conclusion is that despite the generally consistent ranking of the models  the difference in results between the different models was generally small. Comparing our results across scenarios showed that an increase in power did result in increasing differences between the models. For instance  within all the ST analyses  the only apparent difference among models was for trait 1 in scenario 1  which was the ST analysis with the highest power. In addition  when increasing the power by performing MT rather than ST analyses  again the differences between the models were more pronounced. Several alternative scenarios could be considered that would show larger differences among the models  due to increased power: 1) a more extreme distribution of QTL effects  2) a higher SNP density resulting in higher linkage disequilibrium between SNP and QTL  or 3) a larger reference population. Since all of these alternative scenarios are expected to increase the power to detect QTL  it was expected that the BSSVS model would achieve a higher accuracy compared to the other models. Given the relatively small differences found between models in our study  differences in computational demands may be an important factor that determines the model of choice in practical applications. The required computation time for the bivariate G model (281 min) was 15 times longer than for the univariate models (19 min). Bivariate G models required in ASReml on average 12.5 iterations  compared to 8.5 iterations for the ST models. Initial runs with model G implemented in a Gibbs sampler  showed that for a MT analysis of scenario 2 with an unequal number of records for both traits  a large number of iterations was required before the posterior genetic variance converged. Univariate analyses with BCp0 and BSSVS models both required 58 min. Bivariate analyses with BCp0 and BSSVS models both required 75 min. In both cases  a total of 10 000 cycles were run  implying that the bivariate analyses for scenario 2  which were run for 30 000 cycles  required three times as much time. These computation times imply that for the Bayesian models presented it is computationally less demanding to run one bivariate analysis compared to two ST analyses. This originates from the parameterization that implies that in a MT analysis the number of effects in the scaling vector  is equal to the number of analyzed traits  while the number of  effects is independent of the number of traits analyzed. Importantly  the increase in calculation time when going from ST to MT models is much smaller for the Bayesian models compared to model G. This difference is expected to further increase when the number of records used in the analysis increases  because the size of the G matrix and therefore the size of the left-hand sides of the mixed model equations increases quadratic with the number of animals  while the number of calculations in the Bayesian models increases less than linearly. In current applications of genomic selection in dairy cattle  the number of animals included in the reference population may be as high as 16 000 []. Inversion of the G matrix in such cases is already challenging for ST models  and solving the mixed model equations will be even more demanding for models including multiple traits. Although computation time of models using a G matrix may be heavily affected by the applied computing strategy e.g. []  models that are parameterized based on the numbers of loci instead of the number of animals  eventually will have a lower computational burden. Based on our results  for practical applications with rapidly increasing reference populations  using models that are parameterized based on the number of markers is preferable. Moreover  running the presented Bayesian models in an MT rather than an ST form actually reduced the total required computation time. In our study  all the models estimated breeding values and variance components simultaneously. Further reductions in computation time could be achieved by performing a typical BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) analysis with fewer iterations to estimate breeding values  using predetermined variance components. Those variance components may be re-estimated periodically using a reduced dataset to reduce computational burden. When the aim is to improve accuracy of prediction for traits that are scarcely recorded  different strategies can be adopted with regard to the selection candidates: 1) using pedigree indexes for the indicator trait and/or the trait of interest  2) recording the performance of an indicator trait in common sib or progeny testing schemes  3) recording performances for the trait of interest  4) obtaining genotypes  and 5) using various combinations of these strategies. An important question is which strategy is most effective  depending on the genetic correlation with the indicator traits. For instance  in our simulation  we can compare the results of scenario 2  for animals in generation 2 that have only phenotypes for trait 1 evaluated with multi-trait model A  with the results for animals with no phenotypes in generation 3 that were evaluated with the MT SNP-based models (Figure ). In the first situation  the parents had phenotypes for both traits  and the selection candidates had phenotypes for the indicator trait. In the second situation  the parents had phenotypes for trait 1  and half of the parents had phenotypes for trait 2  while the selection candidates were genotyped. In this situation  our results show that when the genetic correlation with the indicator trait is below ~0.5  and some animals in the reference population have records for the trait of interest  having genotypes is more effective for selection candidates than having phenotypes for the indicator trait. When the genetic correlation with the indicator trait is high (> 0.5)  having phenotypes for the indicator trait is more effective  but if selection candidates are genotyped as well  the accuracy is increased by ~0.03. These findings have important implications when considering the use of genotypes to predict the breeding value of an expensive or difficult to measure trait directly  using estimated SNP effects from a limited reference population  compared to the traditional alternative using easy-to-measure correlated indicator traits. For the above comparison based on our study  when the indicator trait has a genetic correlation lower than 0.5 to the trait of interest  obtaining genotypes seems to be more effective than obtaining phenotypes for an indicator trait. It should be noted that this conclusion cannot be directly generalized to for instance scenarios where measurements are done directly on the phenotypic level and the heritability of the phenotypes used is much lower than that in our study. For other scenarios  heritabilities of the evaluated traits  as well as numbers of animals in the reference population  need to be considered to establish below which level of genetic correlation  genotyping is more effective than obtaining phenotypes for an indicator trait. The BSSVS model allows deviating from the assumption that  in traditional MT selection models  a large number of genes  all having infinite small effects  underlie each trait. In the infinitesimal model  a genetic correlation between two traits arises due to a subset of genes that have an effect on both traits []. The BSSVS model allows the analysis of scenarios in which a limited number of genes with large effects may heavily influence the genetic correlation between two traits. When investigating the basis of a genetic correlation  an important question is to determine whether a correlation arises mainly from pleiotropic effects from single genes  or from closely linked genes. It has been shown that multiple QTL models  similar to the presented BSSVS model  give a sharper indication of the QTL position []  and a simulation study showed that it is possible to distinguish the effects of two QTL that are only 15 cM apart []. In other studies  it has been shown that MT QTL mapping methods may distinguish between a pleiotropic QTL versus two closely linked QTL  based on simulated [] or real data []. In addition  studies based on real data confirm that multi-trait QTL mapping models have an increased power to map QTL compared to single-trait models []. Although the optimal model for QTL mapping may differ from the optimal model for prediction of genomic breeding values []  an increase in power to detect QTL is expected to also yield an increase in accuracy of predicted breeding values. A study that compared published genetic correlations to correlation estimates based on reported QTL effects  generally showed a poor match between both estimates []. Several reasons may have led to this result  such as bias in estimated QTL effects  low resolution in mapping experiments  and statistical problems by combining results from multiple models. Multi-locus models tackle the problem of multiple testing  and thereby directly control the explained genetic (co)variance by the SNP. The three SNP-based models presented in our study  are all multi-locus models. We consider that the correlation between the estimated breeding values for the MT models is a proxy for the genetic correlation used in the model. The results for scenario 1 show that for models G and BCp0  the correlations between estimated breeding values of both traits were similar but higher than the simulated genetic correlation. The correlation for model BSSVS was  especially at higher genetic correlations  closest to the simulated genetic correlation (Table ). This suggests that possible bias in estimated genetic correlations depends on the ability of the model to resemble the distribution of effects of the underlying loci. New models were developed and tested for genomic selection with multiple traits. The models could deal with a scenario in which not all the animals in the reference population had phenotypes for both traits. For juvenile animals without any phenotypes  an increase in accuracy up to 0.11 was observed when using MT SNP-based models compared to an ST analysis. For animals with only phenotypes on a correlated trait  the increase in accuracy was up to 0.04 and 0.18  for genetic correlations with the trait of interest of 0.25 or 0.75  respectively. Whenever the indicator trait had a genetic correlation to the trait of interest lower than 0.5  genotyping the selection candidates yielded a higher accuracy than obtaining phenotypes for the indicator trait. However  when genetic correlations were higher than 0.5  using the indicator trait was still the best alternative. For different combinations of traits  the level of genetic correlation below which genotyping selection candidates is more effective than obtaining phenotypes for an indicator trait  needs to be derived considering at least the heritabilities and the numbers of animals recorded for the traits involved.

Several models to estimate genomic breeding values have been studied. In general  two approaches have been used. One approach estimates the marker effects first and then  genomic breeding values are obtained by summing marker effects. In the second approach  genomic breeding values are estimated directly using an equivalent model with a genomic relationship matrix. Allele coding is the method chosen to assign values to the regression coefficients in the statistical model. A common allele coding is zero for the homozygous genotype of the first allele  one for the heterozygote  and two for the homozygous genotype for the other allele. Another common allele coding changes these regression coefficients by subtracting a value from each marker such that the mean of regression coefficients is zero within each marker. We call this centered allele coding. This study considered effects of different allele coding methods on inference. Both marker-based and equivalent models were considered  and restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used in inference.ResultsTheoretical derivations showed that parameter estimates and estimated marker effects in marker-based models are the same irrespective of the allele coding  provided that the model has a fixed general mean. For the equivalent models  the same results hold  even though different allele coding methods lead to different genomic relationship matrices. Calculated genomic breeding values are independent of allele coding when the estimate of the general mean is included into the values. Reliabilities of estimated genomic breeding values calculated using elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix depend on the allele coding because different allele coding methods imply different models.

Several models to estimate genomic breeding values have been studied. In general  two approaches have been used. One approach estimates the marker effects first and then  genomic breeding values are obtained by summing marker effects. In the second approach  genomic breeding values are estimated directly using an equivalent model with a genomic relationship matrix. Allele coding is the method chosen to assign values to the regression coefficients in the statistical model. A common allele coding is zero for the homozygous genotype of the first allele  one for the heterozygote  and two for the homozygous genotype for the other allele. Another common allele coding changes these regression coefficients by subtracting a value from each marker such that the mean of regression coefficients is zero within each marker. We call this centered allele coding. This study considered effects of different allele coding methods on inference. Both marker-based and equivalent models were considered  and restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used in inference. Theoretical derivations showed that parameter estimates and estimated marker effects in marker-based models are the same irrespective of the allele coding  provided that the model has a fixed general mean. For the equivalent models  the same results hold  even though different allele coding methods lead to different genomic relationship matrices. Calculated genomic breeding values are independent of allele coding when the estimate of the general mean is included into the values. Reliabilities of estimated genomic breeding values calculated using elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix depend on the allele coding because different allele coding methods imply different models. Finally  allele coding affects the mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms  with the centered coding being the best. Different allele coding methods lead to the same inference in the marker-based and equivalent models when a fixed general mean is included in the model. However  reliabilities of genomic breeding values are affected by the allele coding method used. The centered coding has some numerical advantages when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used. There has been growing interest in the use of marker-based models [] in recent years. In studies using these models  descriptions of the effect of allele coding system on inference and computations are often vague or missing. By allele coding  we refer to the coefficients in the marker matrix of marker-based models. Coefficients  commonly used for allele coding of a marker is 0 when the individual is homozygous for the first allele  1 when the individual is heterozygous  and 2 when the individual is homozygous for the second allele. Depending on which of the alleles has been chosen as the first allele  the coefficients are different. Thus  this allele coding method does not give unique regression coefficients. There are other allele coding methods such as the one that use coefficients -1  0  and 1 instead of 0  1  and 2  respectively. Different allele coding methods affect coefficients in the statistical models but they do not seem to change the amount of information for statistical inference. Hence  one would expect that the use of different allele coding methods would lead to the same inference. However  allele coding can be of vital importance in computations. First  convergence of iterative methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods often used in Bayesian inference can be assumed to be affected by the allele coding method used because different allele coding methods change the correlation structure between marker effects. Second  equivalent models have become popular in animal breeding [  ]. An important concept in these methods is the genomic relationship matrix. Differences in allele coding will yield different genomic relationship matrices []. Thus  some elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix can be different and  consequently  reliabilities may be different. We investigated effects of different allele coding methods using theoretical derivations and a practical example when restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or Bayesian inference is used. Effects on parameter estimates  reliabilities  and McMC computations were studied. We considered marker models and their equivalent breeding value models. Let us consider a univariate linear mixed effects model for genomic marker effect estimation  e.g. []  where  is  × 1 vector of observations   is the general mean   is a  ×  matrix containing a column for each marker locus   is a  × 1 vector of random SNP marker effects  and  is a random residual vector. There can be other fixed or random effects in the model but their inclusion does not change the following derivations. There are several alternatives for coding the coefficients in the  matrix. Four allele coding systems are considered. A simple transformation can be made from one allele coding system to another. Our basic allele coding system counts the number of copies of one of the alleles. Depending on which of the alleles is counted  the matrix can be different. In the allele coding system 012  the number of copies of the less frequent allele is counted. Thus  the coefficient is 0 if the individual is homozygous for the more frequent allele  1 if it is heterozygous  or 2 if it is homozygous for the less frequent allele. In this case  the  matrix for the basic allele coding system 012 is denoted by . A general form for the allele coding transformation from the basic allele coding system is  where  is a  × 1 vector. This allows many types of allele coding methods. Note that the transformation keeps distances between allele codes within a marker the same. So  the coding 0 1 2 can be changed to - 1 0 1 or 0.5  1.5  2.5 by this transformation  but not to -10 0 10. We define the centered allele coding system as  =  -    where each column of the matrix  contains the average allele count for the corresponding marker column. Thus  summing values in each column will give a vector of zeros  i.e.   is a vector of zeros. For the centered allele coding system  we have   i.e.  . Note that  2 gives the allele frequencies of the markers in the data. The allele coding transformation allows shifts in the allele codes. The 101 allele coding system is such that - 1 is assigned to the genotype homozygous for the more frequent allele  0 to the heterozygous individual  and 1 to the individual homozygous for the less frequent allele. For the 101 allele coding system  we have  =  . The 101 allele coding system is equal to the centered allele coding system when all allele frequencies are equal to 0.5. In the following  the derivations will use the general allele coding transformation. The matrix  is unique. However  in general the decision on which of the alleles to count is arbitrary. Let the 210 allele coding system be such that the more frequent allele is counted. Then the  matrix for the 210 allele coding system can be calculated from the 012 coding matrix by  where  is  × 1 vector of ones. The 210 allele coding system is the opposite to the 012 allele coding system but results in this paper apply to the 210 allele coding system as well  with some modifications mentioned separately. Different allele coding methods imply different models (1) and different models may lead to different parameter estimates. However  the inference considered in this paper is not affected by allele coding  as we demonstrate below. Variance component estimation by restricted maximum likelihood (REML)  prediction of random effects  and Bayesian inference are all based on the likelihood after marginalization of the fixed effects  i.e.  the fixed effects have been integrated out. Bayesian inference requires even more marginalization. In order to show that inference is not affected by allele coding  it is sufficient to show that the likelihood after integrating out the general mean is the same irrespective of allele coding. The following derivation makes no assumptions on the prior densities of marker effects. Thus  the results apply to many models  including BLUP  BayesA and BayesB in []. The marginal likelihood for the mixed effects model is where ( |      ) is the conditional density of   often a Gaussian density  and  contains all parameters in the distribution of   often only the residual variance parameter . Using the transformation result (7) in Appendix A and a change of integration variable   we can write where  denotes the 012 allele coding system. Hence  the marginal likelihood does not depend on allele coding  a property used in the following derivations. The REML-likelihood is defined when  and  are multivariate Gaussian distributed  and equals where  contains all parameters in the distribution of   commonly only the genetic marker variance parameter . This likelihood is independent of allele coding  and  hence  REML parameter estimation is independent of allele coding. Note that maximum likelihood estimation is based on (      ) = <U+222B> ( |      )(   )  and is affected by allele coding because  in this case  the general mean is not integrated out. BLUP estimation of marker effects  assumes that the variance parameters (   ) are known. The conditional distribution (        ) = (     )( |  )/(   ) is independent of allele coding. Hence  BLUP  and associated uncertainties do not depend on the allele coding. In Bayesian inference  the joint posterior after integrating out  is where (  ) is the joint prior for the parameters  and the denominator () is the integral of the numerator. All terms in the numerator are independent of allele coding  and by marginalization () satisfies the same. Hence  (       ) does not depend on allele coding. The general intercept  is  however  not independent of allele coding. For simplicity of the argument  we assume that parameters (   ) are known  and omit showing these values. According to the transformation result (8) in Appendix A and a change of integration variable   the conditional expectation of the general mean is where  denotes density for the 012 allele coding  and  is the conditional expectation of the general mean when using the 012 allele coding. Thus  the general mean estimate is different by allele coding when  is not zero. When  and  are multivariate Gaussian distributed  the conditional expectations  and  equal the BLUP and BLUE estimates  respectively. Finally  the inference is indifferent to the allele being counted. This is demonstrated by studying the centered coding system and assuming that allele in the first marker is counted in the opposite way  i.e.  the first column in  is minus the first column in    or  = -. We see that  where the entries in  are equal to the entries in   except for the first entry which equals minus the first entry in . Since  and  have the same distribution  these two models are equivalent. In breeding value evaluation  the main interest is in estimation of genomic breeding values for the genotyped animals. In other words  estimation of  where  are solutions to the marker effects by a marker-based model like model (1). Because the marker effect solutions are the same for different allele coding systems  the estimated genomic breeding values are different due to differences in the coefficient matrix . Allele coding does not  however  change relative differences between the estimated genomic breeding values  because  shows that they are just shifted by a constant. Let us define complete genomic breeding values as . Substituting  and using equation () we obtain Consequently  the estimated complete breeding values  are the same irrespective of allele coding. Assume that the marker effects have a Gaussian distribution  where  is an  ×  identity matrix. The breeding values  =  can be calculated directly without estimating  by the model [  ] where the breeding values have prior density of . Often the covariance matrix of the breeding values is scaled by a value such as  where  is the allele frequency of marker . Then  the breeding values have a prior density of  where the genomic relationship matrix is  and genetic variance is . Assuming that the residual distribution is  ~  (  )  then the mixed model equations for the equivalent model are The breeding value solutions  from these mixed model equations () are the same as the genomic breeding values calculated by  where  are marker effects estimated by the marker-based model (1). Therefore  the conclusion for the marker-based models about relative differences between genomic breeding values being unaffected by allele coding is also true for the equivalent model  although different allele coding methods lead to different genomic relationship matrices. Similarly  variance component estimation by REML and Bayesian methods are unaffected by the allele coding due to equivalence of models with the marker-based models. The mixed model equations in (3) are not well-defined when the genomic relationship matrix  is singular. However  mixed model equations not requiring an invertible  matrix do exist; see page 48 in []. The genomic relationship matrix  can be singular for several reasons. For example  there can be identical twins or clones that have the same genotypes. In addition  for the centered allele coding system the genomic relationship matrix is . The last row of  is equal to the sum of all the other rows. Hence   is not of full rank  and  is singular. Gaussian models are often used in practical genomic evaluation of animals. In these models  reliabilities of estimated breeding values  are calculated using elements of the inverse of the mixed model equations such as (3). Reliability of  is where PEV  is the prediction error variance  i.e.  Var( | )  of animal   and  is the diagonal element of animal  in the genomic relationship matrix ; e.g. []  p. 51 in []. The prediction error variance for animal  is the diagonal element of the inverse of the coefficient matrix of mixed model equations () for animal . Alternatively  where  is the genomic marker effect submatrix in the inverse of the coefficient matrix of the mixed model equation for marker-based model (1) (see Appendix B). The submatrix  = Var( | ) is the same irrespective of the allele coding method used as shown in the chapter on inference on marker-based models. Because the coefficient matrix  is different depending on allele coding  PEV is also different depending on allele coding. Consequently  the reliability of  depends on allele coding. More generally  for any of the models considered in this paper   =  where ( | ) is independent of allele coding and  depends on allele coding. Therefore  the distribution (  ) and  in particular  the variance-covariance matrix Var( | ) and reliabilities of  depend on allele coding. The complete breeding value distribution ( ) does not depend on allele coding  unlike PEV associated with . The proof is based on the demonstration that when applying any function   the expectations are independent of the allele coding system  where E is the expectation when using the basic allele coding method. Therefore  the variance-covariance matrix Var( | ) and all higher order moments of the distribution are independent of allele coding. However  the result does not provide actual formulas for the moments. A closed form formula of the variance-covariance matrix is derived for a Gaussian model. Assume  and  ~  (  ). For this model  in Appendix B we obtain that where  and . As demonstrated earlier in this section  this variance-covariance matrix is independent of allele coding. When   the variance-covariance matrix simplifies to where  is based on the centered allele coding method. The diagonal elements in (6) are different from the PEV s in (4) because they contain uncertainty about the unknown mean  as well. For the complete breeding values    we have shown above that prediction error variances are independent of allele coding and we have provided a formula for the Gaussian model. Reliabilities of    however  can not be defined in a meaningful way. Substituting the diagonal elements from (6) for the PEV s in (4) is not appropriate since the denominator in (4) is Var( ) not Var( ). The denominator in the reliability formula should contain the marginal (unconditional) variance Var( )  =  Var( +  | )  but this variance is infinite. The convergence and mixing of an McMC algorithm depend on the parametrization of the model and on the algorithm used. Theoretical results about the geometric rate of convergence to the stationary distribution for Gibbs sampling algorithms are shown in []  and as mentioned in [] this rate also describes the mixing of the algorithm. Below we show specific results about the convergence rate  for Gibbs sampling algorithms for simulating from [   | ] in the marker-based model (1)  where  is Gaussian  and  is Gaussian . These results provide some ideas about more general models and algorithms where theoretical results cannot be obtained. Section 2.2 in [] contains results about various Gibbs-sampling schemes for simulating from a multivariate distribution. Here we apply these results (see Appendix C for details) to two types of Gibbs updating schemes. The first scheme iterates between updating  and a block of all components in   and will be called the block updating scheme hereinafter. The second scheme updates     ...   sequentially one at a time  and will be called the single site updating scheme. For the block scheme  the convergence rate is where  is a  × 1 vector  and . For the single site scheme  the convergence rate is where  is the matrix containing the lower triangle and the diagonal of     is the diagonal of    and  is the matrix containing the upper triangle of  . This single site Gibbs sampling algorithm is the stochastic counterpart of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm for solving the mixed model equations  and the convergence results are similar  see []. When the centered allele coding method  is used   is a vector of zeros and  hence   = 0. The centered allele coding method breaks dependency between the general mean and genetic marker effects  as seen from the variance-covariance matrix (derived in Appendix B for a more general situation) Consequently  absorption of the general mean is done without needing to compute absorption explicitly. Note that  in general  this holds only when the residual variance-covariance matrix is . For the block McMC scheme  the convergence and mixing of the algorithms are of the same order as for non-McMC algorithms that simulate directly from the distribution of interest. For the single site McMC scheme  the centered allele coding method still breaks the dependence between the general mean and marker effects  but as  0 illustrates  the individual marker effects    ...   are not independent and the McMC samples are autocorrelated. Data for the XII  QTLMAS workshop [] were used to illustrate the theory. The simulated data had four generations. In each generation  15 sires and 150 dams were selected randomly to produce the next generation. Each sire was mated to 10 dams and each mating produced 10 progeny. Thus  the base generation had 165 individuals  and the subsequent three generations  1500 individuals each. In total  the analyzed data had 4665 animals with phenotypes. The simulated trait had a heritability of 0.30. The data had 6000 equally spaced SNP markers on six chromosomes. We deleted markers that had a minor allele frequency less than 1% among the phenotyped individuals and this reduced the number of markers to 5896. The 012 allele coding method was used to make the base data set. So  the least frequent allele was counted. In addition  210  101  and centered allele coding data sets were analyzed. The marker-based model (1) with common genetic variance was used to analyze the data:  and . McMC computations by a single site updating Gibbs sampler were used to calculate posterior mean estimates of the location (  ) and dispersion  parameters. The length of the McMC chain was 100000 iterations  of which the burn-in period of 10000 was omitted. Every tenth sample was saved  giving 9000 saved samples. Effective sample sizes were calculated for all parameters using the initial monotone sequence approach []. The approach estimates the number of independent samples from the post burn-in samples. Theoretical convergence rates were calculated for all the allele coding methods in the single site and block updating schemes. Here  the convergence rate also describes the mixing of the McMC chain and was measured by the correlation between successive McMC samples. Because of the Markov property  the -lag correlation is    where  is the convergence rate and  is the lag or distance between samples. In order to compare the theoretical convergence rate to the observed effective sample size  theoretical mixing was calculated relative to the 012 allele coding system as follows. Let  be the convergence rate from the 012 allele coding system  and  the convergence rates from another allele coding system. Mixing of the other allele coding system is equal to mixing of the 012 allele coding system when every  sample is taken from the McMC samples and  =  . Thus  the relative mixing is  = log() log(). Parameter estimation by REML for both the marker-based model and the equivalent model and for all four allele coding methods was done using software DMU []. Both AI-REML and EM-REML were investigated. For the equivalent model and the centered allele coding method  the singular genomic relationship matrix was modified by multiplying the diagonals by 1.001 in order to be able invert the matrix. The effect of allele coding on convergence was investigated  and it was checked that the parameter estimates were the same. Reliabilities were calculated by different allele coding methods using (4) and elements of the inverse of the mixed model equations. The variance components were those estimated by the centered allele coding method using the single site McMC approach. Prediction error variances were calculated by both the marker-based model equations () and equivalent model equations (). Mean  minimum  maximum and standard deviations of reliabilities were calculated for all allele coding methods. Also  correlations between reliabilities from all allele coding methods were calculated. Posterior mean estimates of marker effects and variance components were almost equal between different allele coding methods (Table ). Correlations of estimates of the marker effects between allele coding methods were higher than 99.98%. Only the general mean () had a different estimate  as expected. The estimated variance components agreed well with those used to simulate the data. Additive genetic variance was   where   and  are the observed allele frequencies in the reference data. Thus  the heritability estimate was   compared to the simulated value of 0.30. Effective sample sizes differed depending on allele coding method. The centered allele coding method had the best mixing  and the 210 allele coding method had the worst (Table ). In particular  the increase in effective sample size was largest for the general mean. For the centered allele coding method  the general mean was independent from the marker effect   which led to excellent mixing of this parameter. In general  the marker effects showed excellent mixing. With all allele coding methods  effective sample sizes were at least 5500 for all marker effects  and on average were equal to about 8800. Theoretical convergence rates (Table ) displayed the same results as the effective sample sizes discussed above. Note that our Gibbs sampler used single site updates for all parameters. For the single site updating algorithm  the 210 allele coding system was predicted to need 5.64 times more iterations than the 012 allele coding system. The number of effective samples for the general mean parameter () was 5.11 times bigger for the 012 than for the 210 allele coding system. These figures were 0.48 and 0.48 for the 101 allele coding system  and 0.070 and 0.0051 for the centered allele coding system. Theoretical convergence rates for the block Gibbs sampler showed the same pattern as for the single site update (Table ). Surprisingly  the block Gibbs sampler was predicted to be worse than the single site Gibbs sampler for all allele coding systems except for the centered allele coding system. However  it is well known in the literature that block-updating schemes may sometimes be worse than single site updating schemes  for examples see []. The excellent convergence rate of the block Gibbs sampler with centered allele coding was expected because  in this case  the Gibbs sampler is equal to Monte Carlo sampling. Table  shows convergence of REML in parameter estimation. For the marker-based model  the convergence was independent of the allele coding system  whereas for the equivalent model  the convergence was fastest for the centered coding system and slowest for the 210 coding system  although the differences were small. The parameter estimates obtained (Table ) were the same  with the exception of  for the centered coding system. The difference is due to the need to make the genomic relationship matrix  to be full rank by multiplication of the diagonals by 1.001. In summary  REML parameter estimation is only slightly affected by allele coding. Reliabilities were affected depending on the allele coding method used. Differences were large (Table ). Average reliabilities ranged from 0.37 with the 210 allele coding method to 0.80 with the centered allele coding method. The centered allele coding method gave higher reliabilities than achieved by any of the other allele coding methods. Reliabilities calculated by different allele coding methods were also different as judged by the correlation to each other (Table ). Reliabilities calculated by the marker-based model and the equivalent model approaches were equal within the numerical rounding error. The observed large differences in reliabilities using different allele coding methods can be explained by differences in estimation uncertainty. Different allele coding systems have different  matrices. Consider first the 012 and 210 allele coding methods. The 012 allele coding system has a 0 coefficient when the individual is homozygous for the more frequent allele while the 210 allele coding system has a coefficient of 2 instead. In the marker-based model  uncertainty or the inverse of the coefficient matrix is the same irrespective of allele coding method. Reliability is calculated by multiplying the marker uncertainty by the  matrix (5). Consequently  uncertainty is less in the 012 allele coding system than in the 210 allele coding system because the more frequent homozygous allele multiplies the marker solution and uncertainty by zero. Thus  homozygous genotypes for the more frequent allele do not increase uncertainty when estimating genomic breeding values. Thus  the 012 allele coding system will yield higher reliabilities than the 210 allele coding system  as was observed. This argument can be generalized as follows. In the genomic model considered  uncertainty of a genotype in estimating genomic breeding value is valued relative to a chosen base genotype. The further away an observed genotype is from the base genotype  the larger the coefficient in absolute value in the  matrix and the higher the uncertainty in genomic breeding value. In the 012 allele coding system  the base genotype is homozygous for the more frequent allele  while in the 210 allele coding  it is homozygous for the less frequent allele. In the 101 allele coding system the base genotype is the heterozygote. The higher the number of heterozygous individuals is in the data the smaller will the uncertainty be  i.e.  the higher the reliability will be for the 101 allele coding system. For the centered allele coding system the base genotype is the average genotype in the data. Thus  for this allele coding system the base population is roughly the population we work with []  and it has the smallest average distance of observed genotypes from the base genotype. In practice  this can be expected to lead to the highest reliabilities. Different allele coding systems have different model design matrices   and  hence  imply different models. Thus  reliabilities from different allele coding systems are in fact from different statistical models. Comparison of reliabilities from different models is meaningless. However  the different allele coding systems lead to the same parameter estimates. If the correct allele coding method  i.e.  statistical model  is known  it should be used. Because the true model is unknown and comparison of reliabilities by allele coding method is meaningless  some principles must be used to decide on which allele coding method should be used. These principles will not guarantee the use of a correct model or correct reliabilities. One such principle should be consistency of reliabilities between evaluations. The centered allele coding method changes model from one evaluation to the next because more marker data accumulate. Hence  according to the consistency principle  it cannot be recommended to computate reliabilities. Likewise  the base genotype in the 012 and 210 allele coding methods depend also on the observed allele frequencies  i.e.  marker data. The centered allele coding method is similar to that introduced in [] where the allele frequencies were from an unselected base population. It was used in order to \"give more credit to rare alleles than to common alleles when calculating genomic relationships\". As shown  inference is the same irrespective of the allele coding method when a fixed general mean is in the model. However  reliabilities are affected as shown. The use of base population allele frequencies in the centered allele coding method would remove the above mentioned problem of inconsistency between evaluations  but estimating these allele frequencies is elusive. Recently  [] presented a method for adjusting the  relationship matrix to become a relationship matrix relative to the base population  thereby avoiding the estimation of base population allele frequencies. The results in this paper are based on the assumption that phenotypes and genotypes are available for all animals in the analysis. This assumption may often not be satisfied. Models based on an extension of the genomic relationship matrix to include also non-genotyped animals have been presented by []. The results in the present paper about parameter estimates and estimated breeding values not depending on allele coding do not carry over to the models with an extended genomic relationship matrix. We showed that  in theory  different allele coding methods led to the same inference in marker-based models when the model has a fixed general mean effect. Practical analyses led to the same conclusions. Also in theory  the centered allele coding method was expected to give better mixing properties when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used. This was also observed in practice. When an equivalent breeding value model was used  different allele coding methods proved to lead to the same inference as in the marker-based model. However  reliabilities of breeding values depend on the chosen allele coding system because different allele coding methods change the amount of uncertainty in the estimated breeding values. In the following  we consider the effect of allele coding method on the densities ( |   ) and (    | ). For simplicity of presentation  the parameters in the distribution of  and  are omitted. Let  denote density for 012 allele coding. Because the location parameters  and marker effects  relate to the observations  only through  +   we first study this term. By substituting  into the term  we have So  when different allele coding systems are used  the densities have equality by By changing the integration variable   we obtain <U+222B>  ( |   )  = <U+222B>  ( |    )  and  hence  () = <U+222B> <U+222B> ( |   )()  = (). From these results  we see that The results (7) and (8) are fairly general in terms of distributional assumptions. The only requirements are that ( |   ) depends on  and  only through  +   that an improper uniform prior is used for   and that () is finite. The later requirement is to assure the posterior distribution becomes a proper distribution  and this has to be proven for a model to be valid when an improper prior is used. When  ~ (  )  it is not difficult to show that with . Therefore  <U+222B>  ( |   )  where the constant  is independent of . Thus  () = <U+222B> <U+222B> ( |   )()   <U+222B> ()  =  is finite  irrespective of distribution of the marker effects . We consider a Gaussian distribution model where  and  ~  (  ). Consequently  the distribution [   | ] is a multivariate Gaussian distribution. In the following  we derive the variance-covariance matrix for this distribution. The conditional density is where With    and . The matrix  is the coefficient matrix in the mixed model equations and the inverse of this matrix is where . Note that the submatrix  = Var( | ) is independent of allele coding  because  as shown in the main text  ( | ) does not depend on allele coding. Variance-covariance matrix for the complete breeding value is The results in [] state that the convergence rate of a Gibbs sampler is equal to the largest modulus eigenvalue of a certain matrix  where the eigenvalues can be complex numbers. As mentioned in [] this convergence rate is also a a measure of correlation between successive McMC samples  i.e.  mixing of the algorithm. The closer the convergence rate is to zero the less correlated are the successive samples. The  matrix is constructed as follows. Let  be the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the target multivariate normal distribution  in our case the coefficient matrix in the mixed model equations. Assume that a Gibbs sampling scheme is used where the variables are grouped into  blocks and  is split accordingly into  blocks. First  define Let  be the block lower triangular matrix with blocks in the lower diagonal being those of   and let  =  - . Thus   is a strictly upper triangle matrix with zeros in the diagonal. Then the matrix of interest is We consider the genomic marker model (1) where  is Gaussian  and  is Gaussian . The conditional distribution [   | ] is a multivariate normal distribution with some mean vector and a variance-covariance matrix with inverse where ; see Appendix B. We consider two McMC updating schemes. The first scheme iterates two blocks:  and . The second scheme updates successively all parameters:     ...   . For the first McMC updating scheme we have where  is a  × 1 vector. Hence  The convergence rate is where  () of a matrix  is a notation for the maximum modulus eigenvalue of . The final equality follows from a general property for a square matrix form  where  is a vector  saying that it only has one eigenvalue different from zero which is equal to '. For the second McMC update scheme  where  is the diagonal of  . Hence  where  is an upper triangular matrix containing the upper triangle of  and  is a matrix containing the diagonal and lower triangle of  . Therefore  The convergence rate is Meuwissen THE  Hayes BJ  Goddard ME: Prediction of total genetic value using genome-wide dense marker maps. Genetics. 2001  157: 1819-1829.

Mastitis or the inflammation of the mammary gland has the highest economical impact of all productive diseases in dairy cattle []. In addition to the economical losses in milk production  the negative effects on animal welfare as well as food-born pathogens that can cause potential damage to human health are the main reasons for intensive research on this topic during the last decades []. So far  many studies have identified genomic regions harboring quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting clinical mastitis or mastitis-related traits [  ]. The number of studies investigating molecular mechanisms of immune response to different mastitis pathogens  and  in cattle is also increasing []. However  the link between QTL  causal mutations affecting the phenotypic variation in mastitis susceptibility and how these mutations alter or affect molecular mechanisms is still lacking for most QTL. So far  only a few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms affected by a QTL for udder health or related traits []. In a first study []  we demonstrated the suitability of an  test system to investigate the transcriptome of primary mammary epithelial cells. In the present study  we conducted a genome-wide expression analysis to analyze the molecular mechanisms of mastitis susceptibility in cattle that are affected by a specific QTL on  autosome 18 (BTA18). Several reports have shown that BTA18 harbors QTL affecting clinical mastitis or mastitis-related traits like the somatic cell score (SCS) in the German Holstein [] and other cattle populations []. SCS  a phenotypic measure of the number of somatic cells in milk  is often used as a surrogate trait for udder health and has a strong genetic correlation to mastitis in the German Holstein population (r = 0.84; []). One of the best confirmed QTL affecting SCS in the German Holstein population is located at the telomeric end of BTA18 (hereinafter referred to as SCS-BTA18-QTL) [    ]. Within this region  QTL affecting udder conformation traits like fore udder attachment and udder depth have also been reported [  ]  traits that are known to have a substantial impact on udder health []. Thus  the specific functional background underlying the SCS-BTA18-QTL could not be unambiguously inferred  because aside from mechanisms of immune defense  udder conformation might also contribute to the genetic variability of mastitis susceptibility. Additionally  the chromosomal region enclosing the QTL confidence interval is characterized by a high gene density []. Thus  the aim of the present study was to obtain insights into the physiological mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation in mastitis susceptibility  which might help identify molecular pathways and genes affecting mastitis susceptibility due to the SCS-BTA18-QTL using a combined approach of holistic gene expression profiling of primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (pbMEC) sampled from heifers that inherited alternative QTL alleles. In a previous study  prepartum primiparous heifers with a genetic predisposition for low or high SCS after parturition [] were selected using the molecular marker information known for BTA18. Quantitative Real-Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to specifically investigate the mRNA expression profiles of 10 innate immune system key molecules after bacterial challenge of pbMEC []. The first results showed that the less susceptible animals that inherited the favorable SCS-BTA18-QTL allele 'Q' (referred to as SCS-BTA18-Q animals) had a significantly elevated mRNA expression of innate immune response genes like  and  24 h after bacterial challenge in comparison to the more susceptible animals that inherited the unfavorable SCS-BTA18-QTL allele 'q' (referred to as SCS-BTA18-q animals). In the current study  we expanded the analysis to a holistic transcriptome analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Array to characterize global differences in gene expression in response to pathogen challenge in pbMEC sampled from SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q animals. By analyzing the respective expression data using the short time-series expression miner STEM [  ]  co-expression profiles and significantly affected Ingenuity canonical pathways were identified providing first insights into genetically determined molecular mechanisms affecting mastitis susceptibility due to the SCS-BTA18-QTL. Heifers with either high or low susceptibility to mastitis were selected from the entire German Holstein population comprising heifers born between February and September 2003  that were sired for first parturition in a time interval of six weeks between December 2004 and February 2005. The detailed selection strategy and phenotypes of selected heifers are described by Kühn et al. []. In brief  three sires were selected from the German Holstein population based on the discrepancy of their marker-assisted best linear unbiased prediction (MA-BLUP) breeding values for SCS for their alternative haplotypes in the telomeric region of BTA18. Daughters of the three sires and their dams were genotyped at five marker loci (BM7109  ILSTS002  BMS2639  BM2078  TGLA227) within the telomeric region of BTA18 as described in Xu et al. []. The most likely paternally inherited marker haplotypes and thus  indirectly  the inherited paternal QTL alleles were inferred  and eleven heifers were selected from the pool of daughters. Six heifers (three heifers of sire 1  two heifers of sire 2  one heifer of sire 3) were assumed to have inherited the paternal chromosomal region decreasing SCS (SCS-BTA18-Q) and five heifers (three heifers of sire 1 and one heifer of each sire 2 and sire 3  respectively) were assumed to have inherited the paternal chromosomal region increasing SCS (SCS-BTA18-q). Dams and dam sires of the heifers were preselected for high (low susceptible heifers) and low relative estimated breeding values (high susceptible heifers) to increase the probability that the heifers inherited also the corresponding SCS-BTA18-QTL allele from the dams. All 11 heifers were born and raised on different ordinary dairy farms. The heifers were collected at the Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology Dummerstorf (FBN)  in August 2005 at least 12 weeks prior to calving. They were kept in a free stall barn in one group under identical environmental conditions regarding housing  feeding and milking regime. The husbandry conditions were in accordance with national guidelines for animal experiments and standard dairy farm practice without any intervention in the living animal. The experimental approach was approved by an institutional committee. All individuals were slaughtered according to protocols for certified European slaughterhouses under the federal control of an independent veterinarian. The somatic cell count of the experimental and non-experimental cows in the dairy herd at the FBN was routinely below 100 000 cells/mL indicating a high management level of udder health. At day 42 postpartum  the individuals were slaughtered and a post mortem investigation of the udder and the carcass was performed. All heifers had no clinical mastitis and milk samples did not give indication of bacterial infection at slaughter. Primary cell cultures from the mammary gland epithelium were established as described by Griesbeck-Zilich et al. []. Immediately after slaughter of the selected heifers  two samples were taken aseptically from the parenchyma of the left rear quarter of the udder. The samples were transferred into Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with antibiotics (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich  Munich  Germany)  and the tissue was minced and blood as well as milk residues were flushed away. Thereafter  the cells were transferred to a digestion mix of 200 mL HBSS supplemented with antibiotics  0.5 mg/mL collagenase IA  0.4 mg/mL DNase type I and 0.5 mg/mL hyaluronidase (enzymes from Sigma-Aldrich  Munich  Germany). After incubation  the cells were separated from connective tissue and non-epithelial cell conglomerates by filtration and centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F12  Sigma-Aldrich  Munich  Germany) containing 10% FBS and 10 µl/mL ITS (0.5 mg/ml bovine insulin  0.5 mg/mL apo-transferrin  0.5 µg/mL sodium selenite; Sigma-Aldrich  Munich  Germany). The cells were incubated for 40 min (37°C  5% CO  and 90% humidity) until the fibroblasts had attached and epithelial cells could be isolated by decanting. The cells were cryopreserved at -80°C in 1 mL freezing medium containing DMEM/F12  20% FBS  and 10% DMSO. In order to verify the epithelial origin of the cells  an immunocytochemical staining of cytoceratins characterizing this cell type was conducted randomly as described []. The predominant cell type was represented by epithelial cells (approximately 90 to 95%). Pathogen challenge and cell culture were performed essentially as described by Griesbeck-Zilch et al. []. Heat-inactivated  M60 and  isolates derived from bovine milk samples of mastitis affected udders were used for inoculation []. Epithelial cells were thawed and cultured (37°C  5% CO  and 90% humidity) in DMEM/F12 medium for two further passages. For pathogen challenge  they were seeded in three six-well tissue culture plates (Greiner bio-one  Frickenhausen  Germany)  one plate for each animal and each time point (1  6 and 24 h)  at a concentration of 300 000 cells/well. Two wells in each plate were prepared for control and one for each  and  treatment. At a confluence of about 70% on the second day after seeding  the medium was refreshed. According to Wellnitz et al. []  100 µL of bacterial-solution representing a multiplicity of infection of 10  was added. 100 µL PBS were used as control treatment for the un-inoculated control cells. Cells were harvested 1  6  and 24 h after pathogen challenge  and total RNA was extracted with the TriFast reagent as described in the manufacturer's protocol (PEQLAB Biotechnology GmbH  Erlangen  Germany). After DNaseI treatment  RNA was removed using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen  Hilden  Germany). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop  PEQLAB Biotechnology GmbH  Erlangen  Germany) and its integrity was checked by running 1 µg of RNA on a 1% agarose gel. Comparative expression profiling was performed using the GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays (Affymetrix  St. Clara  USA) comprising 24 072 probe sets representing approximately 19 000 UniGene clusters. According to the recommendations for microarray hybridization (Affymetrix  St. Clara  USA)  antisense biotinylated RNA was prepared with 2 µg of total RNA using the GeneChip 3'IVT Express kit (Affymetrix  St. Clara  USA). After hybridization  arrays were scanned using the GeneChip scanner 3000 (Affymetrix  St. Clara  USA). The quality of hybridization was assessed in all samples following the manufacturer's recommendations using Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.1 (Affymetrix  St. Clara  USA). Additionally  the R-statistical language (distribution 2.9.2) and the affy (version 1.22.1) and affyPlm (version 1.20.0) packages from the Bioconductor microarray suit [] were used for supplemental quality control. A complete list of all arrays included in the analyses is given in Table . After quality control  nine chips of the SCS-BTA18-q group and two chips of the SCS-BTA18-Q group were removed  because of higher centered and larger spread boxes in NUSE (Normalized Unscaled Standard Error) plots and an elevated RNA degradation indicated by the 5' to 3' ratio of GAPDH-RNA. Due to lack of biological material  these chips could not be repeated. The microarray data are deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus database [] (GEO: GSE24560). The R statistical language (distribution 2.9.2) was used for data preprocessing. Microarray raw data were preprocessed using the RMA algorithm [] for background correction  normalization by quantile normalization and summary measures by median polish. The data were filtered for absent genes by applying the MAS5 algorithm implemented in the Bioconductor affy package (version 1.22.1) for detection of present calls. Thereafter  Affymetrix control probe sets were removed from the datasets. Annotations of the Affymetrix identifiers to human gene symbols are based on Hintermair [] supplemented with additional information obtained from the NetAffx annotation provided by Affymetrix. After preprocessing of the microarray raw data  the BioConductor package Limma (version 2.18.3) [] was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Limma applies an empirical Bayes approach based on linear models to assess the probability of differentially expressed genes. In this study  a three factorial design considering genotype  treatment and time point as factors was analyzed. A variety of tests was performed to confirm the effects of the QTL allele on cell culture and inoculation and to survey the consistency between analyses that could have been affected by the low number of chips within and the difference in the number of chips between groups. Analysis 1 was performed to compare gene expression levels between time points separately for each combination of factors treatment ( and control) and genotype (SCS-BTA18-q and SCS-BTA18-Q). Analysis 2 was used to investigate differences in gene expression levels at time points between inoculated and control cells separately for each combination of factors genotype (SCS-BTA18-q and SCS-BTA18-Q) and pathogen ( and ). Analysis 3 was performed to investigate differences in gene expression levels between time points for each fold change obtained between inoculated cells and control cells at time points (Analysis 2) separately for each combination of factors genotype (SCS-BTA18-q and SCS-BTA18-Q) and pathogen ( and )  respectively. All investigated comparisons are listed in Table . Due to the low number of samples within groups and the difference in the number of samples between groups  a decreased power of the statistical analyses was expected. This problem is evident mainly in Analysis 3  because of the high number of tests in addition to the moderate number of factors and low numbers of samples. Analysis 3 was focused on the analysis of genes predominantly affected by pathogen challenge. Therefore  only genes with a minimum expression change of log fc = 0.75 during time-course were considered. A fold change threshold was applied in order to include in the co-expression analysis  only the genes  showing elevated expression changes during time-course. With the log fc = 0.75 a moderate fold change filter was applied []. The significance of co-expression was then assessed by applying the clustering algorithm implemented in the short time-series expression miner STEM (version 1.3.6) [  ] for co-expression profiling and a subsequent comparison of the number of genes assigned to a specific co-expression profile model to the expected number of genes assigned to the co-expression profile model quantified by permutation. Because no expression profiling was performed at time point zero and control cells and inoculated cells derived from the same cell culture  no differences regarding gene expression between the inoculated and control cells were expected at time point zero. Hence  the 'no normalization/add 0' option was selected in STEM in Analysis 3 and all expression values at time point zero were set to zero to enable the co-expression profiling to include changes in gene expression levels in the first hour after bacterial challenge. The STEM clustering method [] was chosen  and the maximum number of profiles was set to the default value of 50 considering a maximum unit change of 2 between profiles. Contrary to Analysis 3  in Analysis 1 and Analysis 2 the moderated t-test statistics implemented in Limma considering a stringent significance threshold of an FDR adjusted p-value of q = 0.05 were applied. Additionally  a fold change criterion was not applied in these analyses to monitor all significant expression changes due to cell culture or inoculation. For the biological interpretation of the data  significantly differentially (Analysis 1 and Analysis 2) and co-expressed (Analysis 3) genes were further analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 8.8 []. In addition  to compare and visualize gene expression levels  the hierarchical clustering method implemented in the MeV MultiExperiment Viewer v4.4 [  ] was used. To investigate the influence of cell culture on pbMEC sampled from SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q animals  the differences in mRNA expression levels of control cells between time points 1  6 and 24 h were analyzed separately for each SCS-BTA18-QTL allele (Figure ). A first analysis of differentially expressed genes using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that cellular and molecular processes affecting 'cell cycle' and 'cellular development' are regulated in response to cultivation after 24 h and that there is a difference in the response to cell culture between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells. Between time points 1 and 24 h  both  the cells derived from SCS-BTA18-Q animals and the cells derived from SCS-BTA18-q animals  showed substantial changes in gene expression. Whereas 293 genes were differentially expressed in SCS-BTA18-Q cells  only 28 genes were differentially expressed in the corresponding SCS-BTA18-q cells [see Additional file ]. The difference in the number of differentially expressed genes between the two groups is partially related to the lower number of samples in the corresponding SCS-BTA18-q group (10 samples) compared to the SCS-BTA18-Q group (17 samples) affecting the power of the statistical analyses. However  only about 50% of the genes (14 genes) differentially expressed in the SCS-BTA18-q group were also found to be differentially expressed in the SCS-BTA18-Q group. Five of the six genes that were up-regulated towards time point 24 h () and three of the top ten down-regulated genes () in the SCS-BTA18-q cells showed the same direction of significant changes in expression levels in the SCS-BTA18-Q cells. Accordance in genes' regulation and differences in the genes regulated between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells suggested that common mechanisms were affected by cell culture but also that unique mechanisms were affected by the genotype. A subsequent functional analysis of the significantly differentially expressed genes associated with molecular and cellular functions related to 'cell cycle'  'cellular development' and 'cellular assembly and organization' was performed. In the SCS-BTA18-Q group  genes mainly associated with molecular and cellular functions affecting 'cell cycle progression' ()  'rRNA processing' () and the 'activation of gene expression' () were differentially expressed after 24 h of cell culture (Table ). Although the number of genes in the SCS-BTA18-q group was low compared to the SCS-BTA18-Q group  single genes indicated that  at least in part the same molecular and cellular functions were affected in the SCS-BTA18-q group (Table ). After 24 h of cell culture  genes associated with molecular and cellular functions involved in the 'regulation of the cell cycle' ()  in the 'regulation of gene expression' () and in 'rRNA processing' () were differentially expressed. Unique to the SCS-BTA18-q group was the decreased expression of  and  after 24 h of cell culture. Both genes are involved in several molecular and cellular functions including the 'organization of the actin cytoskeleton' and the 'differentiation and proliferation of epithelial cell lines' () as well as the 'nuclear assembly'  the 'chromatin organization' and 'apoptosis signaling' (). Unique to SCS-BTA18-Q cells  was the differential expression of genes affecting molecular and cellular functions associated with 'small molecule biochemistry'  'nucleic acid metabolism' and 'carbohydrate metabolism'. In these cells  the down-regulation between time point 1 h and 24 h of   genes that are involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway  of RNA polymerase polypeptides  and   genes that are involved in the pyrimidine and purine metabolisms  as well as the down-regulation of  and  that are involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis affirmed that the processes affected after 24 h of cell culture are mainly those important for cellular homeostasis. . Number of differentially genes (FDR adjusted p-value q = 0.05) between time points 1  6 and 24 h of cell culture for each of the inherited SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles  respectively. Inoculation with either pathogen significantly affected gene expression in both SCS-BTA18-QTL groups. The most significant changes were observed when considering the whole time period between 1 h and 24 h of inoculation and the gene expression at time point 24 h between inoculated and control cells (Figure ). Between time points 1 h and 24 h   inoculated cells showed a significantly higher number of differentially expressed genes (SCS-BTA18-Q: 1010 genes and SCS-BTA18-q: 1393 genes) in comparison to  inoculated cells (SCS-BTA18-Q: 312 genes and SCS-BTA18-q: four genes). Similarly  at time point 24 h  402 and 43 genes were differentially expressed between  and  inoculated cells and their respective un-inoculated control cells in the SCS-BTA18-Q group and 107 and five genes in the SCS-BTA18-q group  respectively. In comparison  the number of differentially expressed genes in inoculated cells between time points was higher than between inoculated and control cells at given time points suggesting that when analyzing between time points  a large proportion of the differentially expressed genes were affected by cell culture or by cumulative effects of cell culture and inoculation. . Number of differentially expressed genes (FDR adjusted p-value q = 0.05) between time points  for each pathogen challenge and each of the inherited SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles as well as between inoculated cells and control cells at time points for each pathogen challenge and each of the inherited SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles;   inoculated cells;   inoculated cells;   inoculated cells versus control;   inoculated cells versus control. These observations are supported by the identified functional categories associated with the differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. At time point 24 h  inoculated cells in comparison to control cells exhibited predominantly differentially expressed genes that were involved in molecular and cellular functions comprising 'hematological system development'  'inflammatory response'  'cell to cell signaling' and 'immune cell trafficking' (Table ). These genes were exclusively regulated in inoculated cells but not in control cells during time-course (Figure ). In addition  differentially expressed genes between time points 1 h and 24 h in both inoculated and control cells were significantly associated with molecular and cellular functions comprising 'cell cycle'  'cellular growth and proliferation'  'DNA replication  recombination and repair' and 'cell death' (Table ). However  these differences were more pronounced in inoculated cells in comparison to the control cells. Furthermore  the number of genes assigned to each of the top five molecular and cellular function categories between time points 1 h and 24 h was higher in  inoculated cells compared to  inoculated and control cells. These results indicated that cellular processes important for cellular homeostasis are more seriously affected by inoculation with  than with . . Comparison between significantly co-expressed genes at time point 24 h and significantly differentially expressed genes in control cells between time points 1 h and 24 h  in inoculated cells between time points 1 h and 24 h as well as between inoculated cells and control cells at time point 24 h for each pathogen and each QTL allele  respectively;  SCS-BTA18-Q cells inoculated with ;  SCS-BTA18-q cells inoculated with ;  SCS-BTA18-Q cells inoculated with ;  SCS-BTA18-q cells inoculated with  However   inoculation resulted in an elevated number of differentially expressed genes assigned to the functional categories 'cell death' and 'DNA replication  recombination and repair' in SCS-BTA18-Q cells between time points 1 h and 24 h in comparison to control cells indicating that  inoculation affected processes important for cellular homeostasis more seriously than cell culture. This analysis was done on SCS-BTA18-Q cells only  because the number of significantly differentially expressed genes was too low in  inoculated SCS-BTA18-q cells to perform a reliable investigation of associated molecular and cellular functions. Nevertheless  the observed effects of cell culture and pathogen challenge on gene expression in pbMEC clearly indicate the suitability of the established  system to study the cellular and molecular response to effects of endogenous and exogenous factors like effects of the SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles. To study the effects of SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles on the response to pathogen challenge  the non-random co-expression of genes was assessed by applying a permutation test to overcome the difficulty in assessing an appropriate significance level enabling an unbiased comparison between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells. The co-expression profiles that were significantly enriched for genes showing a similar expression profile during time-course are shown in Figure . A table of genes including log fold changes for significantly enriched profiles is given in additional file  [see Additional file ]. Most of the 14 different significant profiles (10 profiles) indicated an up-regulation of genes towards time point 24 h. Remarkably  all of the profiles up-regulated after 24 h in SCS-BTA18-Q cells showed an early and linear up-regulation of co-expressed genes  whereas all profiles in SCS-BTA18-q cells inoculated with  and in part in those with  (profiles 25 and 33) showed a delayed up-regulation of genes after 6 h of inoculation (Figure ). These different expression profiles are characterized by genes mainly associated with the functional categories 'cell death' ()  'complement system' ( and ) and 'chemotaxis of neutrophils' ( and ). . Significantly enriched co-expression profiles clustered by the short time-series expression miner (STEM); profiles are ordered based on the p-value significance of the number of genes assigned to the co-expression profile versus the number of genes expected quantified by permutation; only significantly enriched profiles are shown; each square represents one probe level model; the line within the square represents the changes in the expression level during time-course between inoculated and control cells; in the upper left corner the number of the profile and in the lower left corner the number of assigned genes are shown; colors indicate similar profiles within each analysis. To obtain a more detailed view of pathways affected by the SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles  all of the significantly co-expressed genes were included in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for a biological interpretation of the data. In a first step  Ingenuity canonical pathways were investigated. An overview of significantly affected canonical pathways is given in Figure . Comparing canonical pathways affected in SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells as well as in  and  inoculated cells indicated that most of the significant canonical pathways were affected in both SCS-BTA18-QTL groups. However  the different ranks of canonical pathways based on p-values and the number of co-regulated genes within pathways between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells indicated that there are pathogen-specific differences in the response to inoculation between both SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles. In SCS-BTA18-q cells  the most significantly affected canonical pathways were 'communication between innate and adaptive immune cells' as well as 'acute phase response signaling'  whereas in SCS-BTA18-Q cells 'dentritic cell maturation' and 'TWEAK signaling' were predominantly affected. 'Dentritic cell maturation' and 'acute phase response signaling' were two of the most significantly affected pathways for both SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles and both pathogen challenges. However   inoculated SCS-BTA18-Q cells showed a significantly higher number of differentially expressed genes in comparison to SCS-BTA18-q cells and both  inoculated cells (Table ). The most prominent genes associated with 'dendritic cell maturation' belonged to the major histocompatibility complex class 2 molecules namely  and   to genes involved in NF-kappaB signaling  namely  and  and to the Interleukin 1 cytokine family members  namely  and . Genes like  and  that are also involved in 'dendritic cell maturation' showed an earlier and superior pathogen specific up-regulation in SCS-BTA18-Q cells in comparison to the SCS-BTA18-q cells. In contrast  genes of the 'acute phase response signaling' pathway such as  and  showed an earlier and higher up-regulation after inoculation with both pathogens in SCS-BTA18-Q cells in comparison to SCS-BTA18-q cells (Figure   profiles 40 and 42). . Ingenuity canonical pathways affected during time-course between inoculated and control cells in SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells inoculated with  and   respectively; blue bars indicate p-value significance and the orange threshold line indicates the p = 0.05 significance thresholds; orange squares and lines indicate the ratio of genes found to be involved in the specific pathway to the overall number of genes involved in that pathway. In addition  we investigated genes that are involved in the 'migration of leukocytes' associated with the physiological system development and function category 'immune cell trafficking'  which was significantly regulated by both pathogen challenges and SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles (Table ). This was done  because genes involved in leukocyte migration could have a large effect on pathogen clearance and on SCS. Here  we applied the hierarchical clustering method implemented in the MeV MultiExperiment Viewer v4.4 [  ] to compare and visualize gene expression between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells after pathogen challenge (Figure ). In both challenges  SCS-BTA18-Q cells showed a faster response in comparison to SCS-BTA18-q cells. Thus  after inoculation with both pathogens cytokines showed an earlier and faster up-regulation towards time point 24 h in SCS-BTA18-Q cells in comparison to SCS-BTA18-q cells. In addition  a substantial difference in the composition of cytokines up-regulated in response to  challenge between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells was observed (Table ). In  inoculated SCS-BTA18-Q cells  22 of the 29 genes affecting leukocyte migration were also up-regulated in SCS-BTA18-q cells  whereas in  inoculated SCS-BTA18-Q cells  only four of the 18 genes significantly co-expressed were also up-regulated in SCS-BTA18-q cells (Table ). In particular  the elevated expression level of  and  1 h after inoculation with  showed that SCS-BTA18-Q cells can initiate an early response to inoculation by the up-regulation of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response and in chemotaxis in comparison to SCS-BTA18-q cells. Furthermore  the hierarchical clustering indicated that the up-regulation of genes involved in leukocyte migration already occurred preferentially in the first 6 h in SCS-BTA18-Q cells inoculated with   whereas in SCS-BTA18-q cells several genes () did not show an elevated expression until 24 h after inoculation. The difference in the regulation of genes during time-course between SCS-BTA18-q and SCS-BTA18-Q cells was more pronounced in  than in  inoculated cells  which could be attributed to the delayed up-regulation of genes 6 h after inoculation in SCS-BTA18-q (Figure ). Thus  after  inoculation  SCS-BTA18-Q cells showed a continuous up-regulation towards time point 24 h in the corresponding hierarchical clustering analysis  whereas the expression data of SCS-BTA18-q cells at time point 24 h and of both SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells at time point 1 h were clustered together. In summary  SCS-BTA18-q showed a less distinct and delayed response to pathogen challenge in comparison to SCS-BTA18-Q in both  and  inoculated cells  and  inoculated cells triggered a faster and more distinctive response to pathogen challenge than  did. To identify potential candidate genes underlying the SCS-BTA18-QTL  a combined survey considering differentially expressed and positional candidate genes was performed  indicating a single gene   () to be differentially expressed after inoculation in SCS-BTA18-Q  but not SCS-BTA18-q cells and to be located in the vicinity of the SCS-BTA18-QTL. . Hierarchical clustering of expression data obtained for significantly co-expressed genes in SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells associated with the Ingenuity functional category 'immune cell trafficking' that are involved in the migration of leucocytes;   inoculated cells;   inoculated cells; heat map visualizes changes in gene expression levels between inoculated and control cells at time points; the log fold change ranges are shown at the upper bars. In this study  some first insights into the molecular mechanisms of the response to bacterial challenge of mammary gland epithelial cells sampled from half-sib heifers marker selected for alternative SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles were drawn from a holistic transcriptome analysis. The main findings of this study were firstly  that both  cell culture and inoculation  triggered significant changes in gene expression of mammary epithelial cells . Secondly  inoculation with heat-inactivated  induced a stronger immune response compared to inoculation with heat-inactivated  within the first 24 h. Thirdly  both  cells sampled from animals inheriting the favorable QTL allele 'Q' and cells sampled from animals inheriting the unfavorable QTL allele 'q' could activate immune response mechanisms after bacterial challenge   but there was a delayed and weaker response in SCS-BTA18-q cells. Numerous studies have shown that mammary epithelial cells play a crucial role in the response to invading pathogens in the mammary gland [    ]  and several studies have used primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cell cultures to investigate common mechanisms of immune response in mammary epithelial cells in response to mastitis pathogens  [    ]. The differences in the response to bacterial challenge of mammary epithelial cells  and  have been partially characterized by [  ]  indicating that only a subset of the genes involved in the immune response  are regulated in mammary epithelial cells  and that there is a difference in the time-course of the response. It has been suggested that these differences could be related to missing virulence factors of heat-inactivated pathogens that were used in  experiments compared to the active pathogens used in  models and to other immune cells regulating the gene expression of mammary epithelial cell  [  ]. However  most of the studies showed that primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cells can trigger an immune response after bacterial challenge or inoculation with bacterial cell wall components [      ]. In particular  an induced expression was observed for inflammatory chemokines like  and  that are involved in neutrophile  lymphocyte and monocyte recruitment as well as for genes with antimicrobial activity such as  and  and for acute phase proteins like  and  [      ]. Our aim was to survey  if the present established  test system is suitable to investigate molecular mechanisms regulated in the response to bacterial challenge and if there are differences in the response to pathogen challenge that are related to the different genetic predisposition of the animals. Firstly  our study demonstrated that the cells sampled from SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q animals responded to cell culture and that processes mainly involved in 'cell cycle' and 'cellular development' were affected by cell culture after 24 h. In particular  the down-regulation of genes associated with molecular and cellular function like 'small molecule biochemistry'  'nucleic acid metabolism' and 'carbohydrate metabolism' in SCS-BTA18-Q cells  comprising genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway  in pyrimidine and purine metabolisms as well as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis  indicated that processes essential for cell survivability are down-regulated during culture. The number of differentially expressed genes in SCS-BTA18-q cells after 24 h of culture was low compared to SCS-BTA18-Q cells. Correspondingly  the observed effects of cell culture were more pronounced in SCS-BTA18-Q cells  which could be in part attributed to the lower number of samples in the SCS-BTA18-q group. However  the high coincidence of the top up- and down-regulated genes between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q control cells  the observed distinct response of pathogen challenged SCS-BTA18-q- after 24 h  and the distinct response of SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells during time-course  both  after cell culture and inoculation  indicate that the limited number of differentially expressed genes in the control SCS-BTA18-q cells in comparison with the control SCS-BTA18-Q cells reflects well the observed delayed and weaker response after challenge with pathogens. The response to inoculation with heat-inactivated  and  showed pathogen specific effects on the gene expression in pbMEC with an elevated number of significantly differentially expressed genes observed for  inoculated cells compared to  inoculated cells within the first 24 h. A faster and more pronounced immune response to  in comparison to  is also known from other studies investigating response mechanisms of the mammary gland  and  []. Different analyses were performed to characterize the response of the mammary gland epithelial cells to bacterial challenge in this study. All three analyses  i.e. analysis between time points  analysis at time points between inoculated and un-inoculated cells and co-expression analysis showed that inoculation of cells sampled from SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q animals with  stimulated the expression of genes involved in the 'migration of leukocytes' as well as in canonical pathways associated with 'dendritic cell maturation' and 'acute phase response'.  and  were some of the genes stimulated 24 h after  inoculation  that have previously been shown to be significantly up-regulated in response to  challenge in pbMEC []. Essentially  these results confirmed the results obtained in the analyses of innate immune system key molecules by RT PCR [] investigating the same cells. After  challenge  the microarray results at time point 24 h were in agreement to the respective results obtained with RT PCR [].  and  showed a higher expression in cells sampled from SCS-BTA18-Q animals compared to cells sampled from SCS-BTA18-q animals. In the  inoculated cells  all of these genes showed a higher expression level 24 h after inoculation in SCS-BTA18-Q cells compared to SCS-BTA18-q cells in the microarray analyses  hence  fully confirming the previous results obtained by RT PCR at time point 24 h []. Observed effects of cell culture and pathogen challenge on gene expression in pbMEC clearly indicated that the established  system is suitable to study the cellular and molecular response to effects of endogenous and exogenous factors like effects of the SCS-BTA18-QTL alleles. This is in agreement with an ovine animal model []  which also used sheep mammary gland epithelial cells to identify molecular mechanisms that are affected by selection for high and low SCS in two divergent lines of sheep selected by applying a selection strategy based on conventional breeding values. In the present study  cells sampled from SCS-BTA18-Q animals exhibited corresponding changes in gene expression after pathogen challenge in accordance to other studies investigating molecular mechanisms of immune response in mammary gland epithelial cells [    ]. In contrast  cells sampled from animals inheriting the SCS-BTA18-q allele showed a delayed and less distinct immune response associated gene expression to pathogen challenge. The comparison of genes affecting leukocyte migration between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells clearly showed that SCS-BTA18-Q cells triggered a faster response to  inoculation indicated by the early and linear up-regulation of  and . These genes are important for the inflammatory response and for the recruitment of monocytes  lymphocytes  neutrophils and basophils  which in turn are essential for a fast pathogen clearance [  ]. On the contrary  cells from animals inheriting the SCS-BTA18-q allele showed a delayed up-regulation of those genes towards time point 24 h in response to  challenge. The observed early and linear up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines after  or  inoculation in SCS-BTA18-Q cells is in line to the earlier and higher up-regulation after pathogen challenge of  and   genes that are involved in 'acute phase response signaling'. The differences observed between SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells inoculated with  were more distinct than in  inoculated cells. Whereas a high number of genes were regulated in common after  challenge in SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA-q cells  only  and  were in common and significantly regulated in SCS-BTA18-q and SCS-BTA18-Q cells after  challenge. In addition  the expression data of SCS-BTA18-q cells at time point 24 h clustered together with the expression data of SCS-BTA18-q and SCS-BTA18-Q cells at time point 1 h underlining a delayed response in SCS-BTA18-q cells. Interestingly  by comparing the differentially expressed genes in SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells a single gene located in the vicinity of the SCS-BTA18-QTL    was exclusively and significantly regulated in SCS-BTA18-Q cells. In a previous study we could identify the two-marker haplotype  within a 1 Mb range of the  locus as associated with SCS in the German Holstein Population [].  is involved in the non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling as part of the RelB/p52 complex []. Further analysis of genes involved in non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling also indicated that  and  ()  two receptors eliciting the non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling are significantly co-expressed in SCS-BTA18-Q cells as well as   the gene encoding the p100 protein  which is processed into p52 to activate the RelB/p52 complex. The RelB/p52 complex is thought to be important in biological functions such as lymphoid organogenesis  B-cell survival and maturation and dendritic cell activation [  ]. In addition   deficient mice exhibited a multifocal  mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in several organs [] and fibroblasts from  deficient mice  also indicated an important role of  as transcription suppressor limiting the expression of proinflammatory mediators []. This would be in line with the higher susceptibility of SCS-BTA18-q animals indicated by the higher SCS observed in SCS-BTA18-q animals. In summary  these results indicated  as an interesting positional and functional candidate gene for the SCS-BTA18-QTL  but further studies are needed to investigate the role of  within the SCS-BTA18-QTL and to confirm the results. A survey of polymorphisms within the  locus would help to clarify if  itself or other genes regulating  are causal for the SCS-BTA18-QTL. Primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cells sampled from marker selected half-sib heifers inheriting alternative paternal QTL alleles of a confirmed QTL for SCS showed distinct responses to pathogen challenge with heat-inactivated  and  during time-course. The individual immune response of both  SCS-BTA18-Q and SCS-BTA18-q cells indicates that the established  test system can reflect genetically determined differences in molecular mechanisms affected by the SCS-BTA18-QTL in response to pathogen challenge and that the underlying mechanisms of the SCS-BTA18-QTL might be attributed to immune functions. The early and linear up-regulation of cytokines in SCS-BTA18-Q cells suggests a superior immune response in SCS-BTA18-Q cells compared to SCS-BTA18-q cells. Especially the up-regulation of  and other genes involved in the non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling in SCS_BTA18-Q cells highlighted  as a positional and functional candidate gene affected by the SCS-BTA18-QTL. Future analyses of lymph node and parenchyma samples obtained from the genetically divergent half-sib heifers and a comparison to conventionally selected heifers will allow to more accurately define the molecular mechanisms specifically affected by the SCS-BTA18-QTL and could provide new insights into molecular mechanisms commonly involved in the response to pathogens in mammary gland epithelial cells.

Traits that were considered to be influenced by fewer QTL and to have a higher heritability maintained a higher GEBV accuracy over generations. In conclusion  GEBV capture information beyond pedigree relationships  but retraining every generation is recommended for genomic selection in closed breeding populations. Genomic selection is based on the estimation of breeding values using high-density marker data [] and provides opportunities to enhance genetic improvement programs [  ]. The resulting marker-based or genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) exploit associations between markers and QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) through linkage disequilibrium (LD) and linkage  along with the capture of pedigree relationships between animals []. In contrast  estimated breeding values (EBV) obtained with the pedigree-based BLUP animal model rely completely on pedigree-based genetic relationships. The accuracy of GEBV is expected to be more persistent across generations than that of pedigree-based EBV because marker-based relationships resulting from LD and linkage are expected to erode during the successive meioses at a slower rate than genetic relationships. The initial hopes that after a single training analysis  genomic selection would permit to completely abandon progeny testing and phenotyping for traits that are expensive or difficult to measure [] appear unrealistic. Several simulation studies have been carried out to determine which factors affect the persistency of the accuracy of GEBV over generations. Sonesson and Meuwissen [] observed a rapid decline in the accuracy of GEBV in the generation immediately following the discontinuation of phenotyping. The decline in accuracy over generations was greater at low marker densities. Solberg et al. [] also reported that higher marker densities help maintain accuracy over generations. These results are in agreement with those of Habier et al. [] who showed that 1 000 to 2 000 markers are sufficient to capture most pedigree relationships and that accuracy due to LD  which requires higher densities  is more persistent. Muir [] showed that the accuracy of GEBV declines much more rapidly over generations with selection on GEBV compared to random selection. However  Sonesson and Meuwissen [] showed that the effect of selection on accuracy was small if retraining was done every generation. Habier et al. [] compared the decline in accuracy over generations for different methods of breeding value estimation and found that the Bayesian model averaging method Bayes-B of [] outperformed fixed regression least squares and a model equivalent to genomic BLUP  i.e.  the BLUP animal model using marker-based relationships. In addition  the persistency of accuracy was greater for all marker-based methods than for EBV obtained from standard pedigree-based BLUP analyses. Simulation studies provide insight into some of the mechanisms that influence the accuracy of EBV but they rely on assumptions for data generation  the validity of which is unknown in real data  such as the number of QTL  the distribution of their effects  and the population history that contributed to the current LD structure. Except for Habier et al. []  who showed the decay in accuracy with decreasing pedigree relationship  to our knowledge  no studies on the dynamics of changes in accuracy of GEBV over generations in real data are available in the literature. Thus  the objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of EBV and to quantify the persistence of accuracy over five generations using marker versus pedigree information in a commercial breeding line of layer chickens. The data on 16 economically important traits measured at early (e) or later (l) ages  along with marker genotype data  were collected for a brown-egg layer line: age of sexual maturity (eSM)  body weight at late age (lBW)  shell colour for first three eggs (eC3)  at early (eCO) and late age (lCO)  egg weight for first three eggs (eE3)  at early (eEW) and late age (lEW)  egg production at early (ePD) and late age (lPD)  puncture score at early (ePS) and late age (lPS)  albumen height at early (eAH) and late age (lAH)  yolk weight at early (eYW) and late age (lYW). Early measurements were taken at 26-28 weeks of age. Late measurements were taken at 42-46 weeks of age on birds not culled after early measurements. Early and late egg quality measurements were record averages on three to five eggs. Observations deviating from the within-hatch generation mean by more than three standard deviations were excluded as outliers. All data used in this study were obtained from the routine breeding program data collection of Hy-Line Int. Birds were genotyped for 23 356 segregating SNP obtained from a custom high-density Illumina SNP panel (minor allele frequency > 0.025; maximum proportion of missing genotypes < 0.05; maximum mismatch rate between parent-offspring pairs < 0.05). No editing was done based on GC score. Genotyped birds within a generation included all males and females used for breeding (approximately 60 male and 310 female parents per generation) and some additional progeny. Data cumulated over generations are described in Table . The population was under selection for the 16 traits  using EBV from pedigree-based BLUP (PBLUP) up to generation 3 and on a combination of GEBV and phenotype afterwards. In order to evaluate the accuracy of EBV (accuracy in progeny)  training was done on all data accumulated up to a given generation and validation was on genotyped progeny with own phenotypes. To analyze the persistence of EBV accuracy (accuracy in future generations)  training was done on data accumulated through generation 1 and validation used genotypes and phenotypes of progeny from each subsequent generation. The following methods were used to compute EBV: PBLUP - pedigree-based animal model with REML estimates of variance components. Pedigree starting at generation -1 was used. GBLUP - reduced animal model using the genomic relationship matrix estimated by the method in []  with allele frequencies based on the full data set. This model allows for the inclusion of phenotypes of non-genotyped progeny of genotyped parents. See [] for details. BayesA - a Bayesian model averaging method described by []. BayesCp - a Bayesian model averaging method similar to the Bayes-B method in [] but including an estimation of the proportion of SNP with zero effects () and assuming a common variance for all fitted SNP []. A scaled inverse chi-square distribution was used as the prior for the common variance with degrees of freedom <U+03C5>= 4.2 and scale parameter   where  is the additive genetic variance and  is the allele frequency at locus . For traits which had early and late records  single trait and bivariate (indicated by adding b to the method's abbreviation) analyses were used for the PBLUP and GBLUP methods. Bivariate analyses were not possible for the Bayesian model averaging methods with the available software. The fixed effect of hatch within generation was fitted in the model for PBLUP and GBLUP. For the Bayesian model averaging methods  data were pre-corrected for fixed effects solutions obtained from PBLUP to enable use of family means to include phenotypes from non-genotyped progeny of genotyped animals (see [] for details). For the Bayesian model averaging methods  the chain length was 160 000 iterations  with the first 50 000 excluded as the burn-in period. Analyses were performed using the software packages ASREML [] and GenSel []. The accuracy of EBV was evaluated in the validation datasets as the correlation of EBV with hatch corrected phenotype  divided by the square root of heritability  as estimated in single trait PBLUP using all available data. In order to evaluate which factors influence the accuracy of GEBV  the following linear model was fitted to the accuracy obtained from method  in generation  for trait ; where through are regression coefficients  is the estimate of heritability for trait   and is the estimate of the proportion of SNP with zero effect  as obtained from the BayesCp method using all data. Accuracy was also evaluated using the above model equation but excluding all terms involving  (which is equivalent to fitting average )  because in most of the methods  is not estimated. The effect of differences between early versus late traits in terms of the number of phenotypes used for training (Table ) was also evaluated by adding \"early versus late\" as an effect in the model but this was not found to be significant (p > 0.05) and those results are not reported. For all the methods  accuracy varied substantially between traits (Additional file   Figure S1)  which may be due to differences in heritability  number of records and genetic architecture of traits. Variability in accuracy for the same trait was larger between generations than between methods. This is at least partially explained by the relatively small size of the validation data sets (on average 306 birds/generation)  resulting in large sampling errors of the correlation coefficient. Changes in allele frequencies between generations due to drift and selection may have also contributed to variability in accuracy. The observation that differences between methods were small compared to their standard errors was also reported by Luan et al. [] and Hayes et al. []. From generation 1 to 5  the number of observations available for training increased about five fold (Table ). Figure  presents the accuracies averaged across traits for the prediction of breeding values in the progeny generation  as information accumulates over generations. For all the methods  accuracy tended to increase with additional information but increases were small after generation 2. The increase was greater for marker-based methods than for PBLUP. According to []  for a given effective population size  the accuracy of GEBV depends on four parameters: level of LD between markers and QTL  size of the training data set  heritability  and distribution of QTL effects. An increase in accuracy is expected with an increase in size of the training population according to results of simulation studies for both Bayesian model averaging [] and GBLUP methods []. For example  in []  an increase in training size from 500 to 1 000 individuals led to an increase in accuracy from 0.708 to 0.787 for BayesB and from 0.579 to 0.659 for GBLUP. An increase in accuracy with training data size was also confirmed in real data in several studies [    ]. However  using Australian Holstein-Friesian data  Moser et al. [] reported that larger training data sets did not result in significant gains in accuracy for GEBV derived using Partial Least Squares Regression. Whereas the studies by Meuwissen [] and Goddard [] did not include selection  Muir [] found that with selection on GEBV  the accuracy of PBLUP could actually exceed accuracy of GEBV over time as the favorable LD erodes with selection on GEBV. However  Sonesson and Meuwissen [] pointed out that this may not be the case if retraining is done every generation. In our study  selection was on EBV from PBLUP up to generation 3 and on a combination of GEBV and phenotype afterwards  and the advantage of marker-based methods over PBLUP  in terms of accuracy  seemed to slightly increase over generations with increases in the size of the training data. . PBLUBb and GBLUPb indicate bivariate analyses; all other methods were single trait When all available data were used for training  posterior means for  obtained with the BayesCp method ranged from 0.88 to 0.99  suggesting that from 1 to 12% of the SNP had non-zero effects. Habier et al. [] showed by simulation that trends in  estimates obtained by the BayesCp method agreed well with the trends in true number of QTL. These estimates were used as the assumed  in further analyses. Marker-based methods resulted in greater EBV accuracy than pedigree-based methods for all traits. However  the superiority of the marker-based methods was more pronounced for traits with higher estimates of p  presumably determined by fewer QTL (Figure ). The difference between pedigree and marker-based methods also increased with heritability  however this trend was less clear than for p (Figure ). . PBLUBb and GBLUPb indicate bivariate analyses; all other methods were single trait; traits are ranked by the estimate of  from model BayesCp In order to jointly investigate the impact of p and heritability on the accuracy of marker-based models  least square means from the linear regression model fitted to accuracies were obtained. Accuracies from pedigree-based models were omitted in this analysis because they are not expected to depend on p  in the observed  range. Heritability (p = 0.028)   (p = 0.025)  *generation (p = 0.002) and generation (p = 0.033) had an effect on accuracy at the 0.1 significance level. Results in Figure  show that accuracy increased more with the size of the training data for traits with a low estimate of  (interpreted as determination by many loci) (Figure ) and high heritability (Figure ). We observed a higher accuracy for traits with high  with all the GEBV estimation methods. Differences between methods were small but the ranking of methods depended on  and heritability; with high  or high heritability  methods that weighted markers differentially (BayesA and BayesCp) had the highest accuracy  while GBLUP had the highest accuracy for traits with low  or low heritability. Although these differences were not significant  these trends agree with the literature [  ]. . In a and c: comparison of accuracy for traits with different estimates of  for heritability of 0.5; in b and d: comparison for traits with different heritabilities  ignoring ; broken lines are expected declines in accuracy based on declines in genetic relationships Figure  shows the accuracies of pedigree and genomic EBV per generation  averaged over the 16 traits  when training only on data up to generation one. This rate of decline was observed for pedigree-based EBV but the accuracies of GEBV were more persistent. With the pedigree-based analysis  when validation and training were more than three generations apart  the predictive ability for some traits was practically zero (Additional file   Figure S2). For marker-based methods  the accuracy also dropped over time but substantial accuracy was retained even after five generations. The drop in accuracy was greatest in the first generation  likely because of loss of information through pedigree relationships. The highest drop in accuracy in the first generation after the phenotyping was stopped was also observed in simulation studies [  ]. We did not observe large differences between GBLUP and Bayesian model averaging methods in persistency of accuracy. This is in agreement with results from []  except for milk yield  where BayesB was more persistent. Where available  EBV from bivariate analyses were slightly more predictive than EBV from single-trait analyses (Figure ). . At the 0.1 significance level  (p = 0.063)  generation (p = 0.002)  generation (p = 0.0001)  *generation (p = 0.054)  and *generation (p = 0.092) had an effect on accuracy. Least square means from the linear regression model (Figure ) suggest higher persistency of accuracy over time for traits with high estimates of  (egg weight  body weight)  indicating that the GEBV for these traits capture more information through LD or linkage with QTL  compared to traits which seem to be more polygenic and where markers explain mostly pedigree relationships. Traits with a low heritability showed less persistent accuracy. With five generations separating training and validation  accuracy in the last generation in Additional file   Figure S2 should be a good estimate of accuracy due to LD. Goddard [] showed that accuracy due to LD from GBLUP depends on the number of independent chromosomal segments. Daetwyler et al. [] have shown that accuracy due to LD is expected to depend on the smaller of the number of QTL and the number of independent chromosomal segments for Bayesian model averaging methods. On the other hand  they reasoned that accuracy for GBLUP does not depend on the number of QTL []. In our study  the average accuracy for the four traits with the highest  estimates was 0.52  0.48 and 0.43 for BayesCp  BayesA and GBLUPb  and 0.23  0.23 and 0.24 for the four traits with the lowest . This confirms the theoretical prediction that Bayesian model averaging methods have a higher accuracy for traits that are determined by a small number of genes compared to traits determined by many genes  as classified according to the  estimate. However  our results show that accuracy of GBLUP changed with   in contrast to what was predicted by [] but this may be caused by other factors that can contribute to the differences in accuracies between traits  such as the distribution of QTL effects and non-additive or more complex types of genetic determination. On average  accuracy due to LD (retained after five generations) was similar for all marker-based methods  as was also the rate of decline in accuracy. Habier et al. [] reported similar results for somatic cell score and fat yield  however  they found that for other traits  accuracy due to LD of BayesB was higher than for GBLUP  especially for larger training size. Based on simulation results []  accuracy and its persistency are expected to increase with increasing marker density for the BayesB method. Using real data on egg production and quality traits in layers  this study confirms that the accuracy of EBV based on dense marker data is on average higher than that based on pedigree. An increase in size of the training data improved the accuracy of all methods but not to the degree expected based on theory  possibly as a result of the population being under selection. Marker-based methods had greater advantage over PBLUP  in terms of accuracy  for traits with a high estimate of   which implies a small number of QTL with large effects. There were no significant differences between BayesA  BayesCp and GBLUP methods in average accuracy or persistency of accuracy across traits. The accuracy of the marker-based EBV was more persistent than that of pedigree-based EBV over generations  which indicates that markers capture information on QTL through LD and/or linkage. However  the initial drop of accuracy due to loss of pedigree relationships limits the value of genomic predictions further than one generation ahead. When training was on data from generation 0  accuracy in generation 1 was 0.43 and dropped to 0.33 in generation 2. However  when data from generations 0 and 1 were used for retraining  accuracy in generation 2 increased to 0.49. Retraining every generation is recommended for genomic selection in closed breeding populations.

These results provide a basis for further validation in extended families and other breeds as well as targeting regions for genome-wide association mapping using high-density SNP arrays. Lactation performance plays an important role for the productivity and therefore economic value of dairy cattle and dairy sheep. Persistency of lactation is a trait of considerable importance as it reflects the ability of an animal to maintain milk production at a high level after the peak yield []. It has been found that cows with greater lactation persistency tend to incur lower feed  health  and reproductive costs []  and cows affected with mastitis tend to have less persistent lactations []. The animal health benefits of increased lactation persistency are speculative at present; but it has been hypothesised that increased lactation persistency is associated with lower incidences of peri-parturient metabolic diseases []. With the recent interest in year-round calving as opposed to the conventional 305-day cycle in dairy cattle  identifying the genetic basis for lactation persistency and extended lactation is of interest. Lactation curve models have had a long history in dairy science  dating back at least to Brody []. Since then  many models have been proposed  including the commonly used model by Wood []  which differ both in the mathematical form of the function and the number of model parameters that need to be estimated. More recently  random regression approaches have been proposed  which allow a model to be fitted to the yield data in which the data itself specifies the shape of the fitted model  rather than fitting to a pre-specified mathematical function [  ]. However  random regression models require a large number of lactations with many yields recorded per lactation  which may be a problem in voluntary recording systems. Furthermore  extraction of summary information from fitted random regression models is difficult. As well as being able to predict lactation yield at any stage of lactation  lactation curve models can be used to summarise key features of the lactation curve  such as time of peak yield and the peak flow  and characteristics related to extended lactation. One of the difficulties with some of these lactation length measures is the variety of definitions provided in the literature (e.g. Sölkner and Fuchs [])  although there are some common threads. Lactation persistency is usually defined as the (rate of) decline of milk yield after the peak [  ]. Lactation persistency has also been defined as the difference in yield between peak to a defined day later in lactation []. However  Grossman et al. [] developed a new model for lactation curves which allows the definition of persistency as the number of days at peak lactation. However  the models developed by Grossman et al. [] implied a lactation curve with a plateau  which is not the case for the typical lactation curve in sheep which has a relatively early but sharp peak. These derived measures of lactation persistency can then be used as traits in QTL mapping studies [  ]. Compared with lactation persistency  extended lactation has received relatively less attention in the literature. Extended lactation deals with the ability to maintain lactation at productive levels beyond the usual \"drying off' period or a fixed reference day  i.e. beyond 305 days in cattle  or 100 days in dairy sheep. Both parametric and semi-parametric models can be used to quantify extended lactation. They all consider the level of milk production beyond the reference day. Some studies fit models to empirical data from extended lactation records []  whilst others use fitted models to predict the potential for extended lactation in the absence of actual data records beyond the reference date. Vargas et al. [] analysed the accuracy of different models to predict daily milk yield in standard and extended lactations in cattle. Dematawewa et al. [] compared empirical (including the Wood model) and mechanistic lactation models for their suitability to predict standard (305-day) and extended (999-day) lactations in cattle (with 0.1% of the cows having actual data on the extended lactation). They recommended the use of the model of Rook et al. [] or the Wood model as being appropriate to describe extended lactations including milk  fat and protein yields []. Previously  we showed that the Wood model was appropriate to describe lactation curves in sheep []  so here we extend the use of this model to predict lactation persistency and extended lactation in sheep. To our knowledge  there are no reported heritability estimates for lactation persistency in sheep  nor for extended lactation in sheep or cattle. Reported heritability estimates for milk persistency in cattle were between 0.02 and 0.27 []. Heritability estimates for milk composition and somatic cell count persistency were between 0.03 and 0.2 [  ]. Thus  under conventional mass selection  the rate of gain for persistency of milk yield and milk composition is expected to be low. Growing intensification of sheep and goat production systems during the recent decades have led to increased research interests into the yield and composition of milk from small ruminants []. Milk yield and milk components (%) are negatively correlated in sheep and these correlations change during the lactation [  ]. It has been shown that the quality of cheese processing also declines during the course of lactation in sheep with poor lactation persistency []. Changes in milk composition of dairy sheep throughout the lactation typically result in variable cheese yields and quality []. Selecting animals with improved lactation persistency should therefore also aim at more persistent milk composition and yield during the course of the lactation. This would benefit the use of milk for processing into cheese and other products. Until now  only a few linkage studies have been published for traits related to persistency of milk yield and milk composition in cattle but none have been reported in sheep. QTL were reported for milk  fat  protein or energy persistency [    ] and shape of the lactation curve [] in cattle. Comparison of results across studies is problematic as there is no universally accepted method to calculate persistency  and results are therefore method-dependent. The objective of this study was to report on an appropriate model to predict lactation persistency and extended lactation for milk yield and milk composition traits in sheep  and to provide additional information on QTL for these traits. The application of QTL information for these traits is of potential interest in marker-assisted selection since these traits have sex-limited expression  and are potentially difficult to measure  thus limiting the rate of progress under conventional mass selection. A resource population from crosses between the improved dairy type of Awassi (A) and the apparel wool Merino (M) sheep was established as described in detail by Raadsma et al. []. Genotypic information from the backcross progeny of the first sire was used for linkage mapping. Lactation and milk composition records were collected for 172 backcross ewes between 1999 and 2007 []. Milk yield (MY) was recorded every second day  and protein  fat  lactose percentages and somatic cell count (SCC) were analysed from milk sampled once weekly. Somatic cell score (SCS) was calculated as the logarithm to base 10 of the raw SCC. The yields of protein (PY)  fat (FY)  lactose (LY) and somatic cell score (SCY) were calculated by multiplication of the contents (expressed as a percentage) with MY. Useful yield (UY) was calculated as FY + 1.85 × PY []. Lactation curves for MY  PY  FY  LY  UY and SCY were estimated by fitting Wood models [] to the yield data. Due to its simplicity and reliable fit to the data  the Wood model was chosen as the preferred method to summarise lactation curve characteristics. The basic form of the Wood model is defined as follows: where () is the expected yield at time   and  = ln()   and  are parameters controlling the shape of the curve. Specifically   is related to the total area under of the curve   is related to the sharpness of the early rise  and  describes the decline rate in milk production. Multiple lactation curves were fitted simultaneously using the  function in R  treating each ewe by lactation as a random effect. Further description of the Wood model parameters and procedure for model fitting is in Raadsma et al. []. From this model  the cumulative yield up to day  (e.g. 100 days) (CumY()) can be calculated numerically as   where <U+03B3>(·) is the lower incomplete gamma function  . Furthermore  the day of the maximum yield () and the maximum yield (maxY) were calculated as  = / and maxY = (/) respectively. Milk persistency was defined as the expected milk yield on day   relative to that on the peak day  namely PersY() = ()/maxY. A more persistent lactation will have a flatter curve  with the persistency proportion approaching one. In the same way  derived persistency variables were also calculated for PY  FY  LY  UY and SCY; furthermore  lactation persistency is defined as a general term for milk as well as persistency of milk composition. A previous study showed that 100 day lactation performance  measured as cumulative milk yield until day 100  is highly correlated with cumulative milk yield to day 300  whereas lactation performance taken as either cumulative milk yield to day 50 or 80 was unreliable in predicting cumulative lactation performance []. Furthermore  the number of observations in this data set was still very high ( = 565) at day 100 of lactation  which reinforced the choice of evaluating persistency at  = 100 days [see Additional file ]. Extended lactation deals with the ability of the ewe to sustain milk production beyond a certain time. In the absence of a standard lactation length  as in cattle and as outlined in paper II of this series []  we have adopted day 100 as the standard reference for lactation length in sheep (in cattle this would nominally be day 305)  even though this is shorter than most of the average ovine lactation lengths in the literature [  ]. The definition of extended lactation adopted here is the ratio of expected production from day 100 to 300  relative to the cumulative production (of MY  PY  FY  LY  UY and SCY) up to day 100  i.e. [CumY(300)-CumY(100)]/CumY(100). The greater this ratio is  the more extended the lactation is. Note that the cut off at day 300 is arbitrarily made in order not to have an \"infinite\" lactation length. A genome-scan using 189 polymorphic microsatellite markers covering all 26 autosomes was conducted on 172 backcross ewes. The procedures of DNA extraction  genotyping  allele calling  and the linkage map have been described previously []. Based on a Type I error of 0.05  the design had a predicted power of 0.72 to detect QTL with 0.4 SD effect []. To achieve normality  all traits were log-transformed prior to using two methods for QTL analyses. Solutions were first obtained using a maximum likelihood procedure  named QTL-MLE in R [  ]  which is suitable for the analysis of a backcross population. For QTL-MLE  a LOD of 1.75-2.0 was deemed suggestive  LOD 2.0-3.0 significant  and LOD > 3.0 highly significant. The 1-LOD drop-off method was used to calculate the respective confidence intervals for this method. QTL effects were derived from the model and normalised against a model with no QTL to express the size of QTL effects in units of phenotypic standard deviations. The second method for QTL detection was based on the regression analysis for a half-sib design using QTL Express []. The half-sib model was used since no maternal genotypes were available. For this method  QTL with chromosome-wide significance thresholds ( < 0.05) were described as suggestive  chromosome-wide levels  < 0.01 as significant and experiment-wide levels ( < 0.05) as highly significant QTL. A two-QTL model was also fitted to all data using the same program [] and this was conducted over all chromosomes. Chromosome-wide significance thresholds were assessed using permutation tests  and bootstrap procedures were used to obtain confidence intervals  both implemented in QTL Express using 1 000 re-samplings. The QTL heritability was calculated as the proportion of the phenotypic variance accounted for by the QTL  and this is calculated from the residual mean squares from the regression analysis of fitting a QTL or no QTL as [1-(residual mean square of full model/residual mean square of reduced model)]. To facilitate a comparative genome analysis between sheep and cattle  individual QTL locations and bovine QTL were extracted from the literature  and were loaded into the ovine genome database  which can be browsed at . While a meta-assembly of all known QTL was performed as outlined in previous papers [  ]  no meta-score was calculated for lactation persistency due to the inconsistency of trait definitions of persistency and the inconsistency of QTL positions. However  as publications on persistency become available in the future  we plan to update the ovine genome database to facilitate a full meta-assembly. The Wood model parameters were standardised against the predicted lactation curves for the following fixed effect classifications: five years of age  singleton birth type  third parity  twice milking/day and fourth season for milk yield; five years of age  second parity  and twice milking/day for protein yield; three years of age  second parity  twice milking/day and singleton birth type for fat yield; three years of age  twice milking/day  singleton birth type and second parity for useful yield; and seven years of age for lactose and somatic cell score yield. The factors used for standardisation differed across the lactation traits  as not every factor had a significant effect on all traits. Lactation persistency was highest for useful yield (0.65)  while daily milk yield persistency had the lowest average value (0.23) (Table ). Similarly  extended lactation had the highest average for useful yield  followed by fat and protein  and was lowest for milk yield (Table ). Most of the lactation persistency characteristics for different milk traits showed low to moderate phenotypic correlations  with the exception of persistency of protein yield  which was highly correlated to persistency of fat and somatic cells (Table ). The highest correlations between lactation persistency and extended lactation were observed for milk  lactose and somatic cell yields (0.79-0.89   = 0.01) (Table ). Four significant (LOD > 2.0) and one highly significant (LOD > 3.0) QTL were detected on chromosomes 3  10 and 11 using single QTL analysis across both methods. Six suggestive (1.7 = LOD < 2.0)  four significant (2.0 = LOD < 3.0) and one highly significant (LOD = 3.0) QTL were identified using QTL-MLE (Table   Figure   ). Using QTL Express  eight suggestive (chromosome-wide  < 0.05)  six significant (chromosome-wide  < 0.01) and two highly significant (experiment-wide  < 0.05) QTL were identified [see Additional file ]. On OAR11  QTL for lactation persistency  extended lactation of milk  and extended lactation of protein were detected using both linkage methods. QTL for lactation persistency and extended lactation of milk and lactose were also identified on chromosome 17 and 21  respectively  but these were not verified by using QTL-MLE. We hypothesised that persistency of different lactation traits and extended lactation are likely to be controlled by different genes  with the possible exception of a common gene located on OAR11  which controls extended lactation for milk and protein yield  as well as milk persistency (Table ). . . Most of the QTL identified here showed positive (not necessarily favourable) effects for the Awassi allele  compared with the Merino allele. The largest effect was identified for extended lactation of lactose (0.69 SD) on OAR21. Persistency and extended lactation of milk showed a negative effect of the Awassi allele (-0.64 SD) on OAR11 (Table ). The average QTL heritability  expressed as the proportion of the phenotypic variance accounted for by the QTL  and standardised QTL effects were slightly higher for extended lactation (5.48% and 0.58 SD) than for lactation persistency (5.11% and 0.56 SD) (Table ) and [see Additional file ]. The QTL heritability reached its highest value for fat traits and its lowest for useful yield (the QTL heritability is shown in Additional file ). The standardised QTL effects were similar for all traits and reached values between 0.48 and 0.69 phenotypic SD. (Table ). The greatest standardized QTL effects were found for somatic cells  and the smallest for lactose [see Additional file ]. Using the two-QTL model for all traits across all chromosomes  evidence for two pairs of QTL was found on OAR10 (Table ). For extended lactation of useful yield  neither of the two QTL were detected using single-QTL methods  while for extended lactation of somatic cells  one of the QTL positions was identified in both single-QTL approaches. Both pairs of QTL were in repulsion phase of opposite (unequal) effect and were located in separate flanking marker intervals  giving support for these being separate QTL but this needs to be validated in a separate study. Two genome-wide and two partial bovine QTL studies [      ] were summarised in the meta-assembly; results from two genome-wide association studies were not loaded into the ovine genome database [  ]. Until now  no QTL study for lactation persistency in sheep has been reported. QTL for milk and milk composition persistency in cattle have been reported on chromosomes 1  2  6  9  14  15  17  18  21  22  25 and × using a granddaughter design of German Holstein dairy cattle []. QTL were also identified for shape of the lactation curve for milk  protein  fat and SCS in U.S. Holstein cattle  confirming the QTL on chromosomes 6  14  21 and 22 identified in German Holstein Friesians  and finding additional QTL regions on chromosomes 3 and 7 []  while Weller et al. [] could not verify a QTL for milk persistency on BTA7. Other QTL have been reported on BTA11 and 17 []. All QTL  except those on BTA15  22 and 25  were confirmed by association studies  and additional associations have been identified on all other bovine chromosomes []. Four bovine QTL for lactation persistency traits have been reported on chromosomes that are orthologous to OAR3  9  17 and 24  where we identified QTL for these traits in sheep. The QTL on OAR9 and OAR17 aligned to QTL for the same milk persistence characteristics reported on the orthologous bovine chromosomes (BTA14 and BTA17  respectively) [  ]. The QTL for milk persistency on BTA14 had its peak within the region of the  gene. The QTL identified for fat yield extended lactation on OAR9 (BM4513-RJH1) in our study aligned to the bovine QTL for fat persistency at 139 cM (BM4513-BL1036). This paper is a continuation of our previous study of lactation characteristics in a sheep population []. It extends the application of the Wood model using a nonlinear mixed model to describe lactation curves by deriving persistency and extended lactation measures for milk  protein  fat  lactose  useful yield and somatic cell yield. It identifies novel QTL for both persistency and extended lactation traits and compares linkage and genome-wide association studies for these traits across sheep and cattle. Measures of persistency and extended lactation can be used to define the shape of lactation curves  the former focusing on shape within the conventional lactation length (say 100 days in sheep  305 days in cattle) and the latter on sustained production after this period. Both these measures are useful indicators for practical management applications. Many other measures of lactation curve shapes have been described in the literature  some based on parameters in complex lactation curve models []  others related to the time to reach a certain percentage of total milk production [] or using smoothing cubic splines []. It has been suggested that persistency measures that are uncorrelated with total milk yield  for example using the shape of lactation curve independent of level of production  allows simultaneous selection for total lactation yield and persistency [  ]. To our knowledge  there are no comparable studies of lactation persistency of different milk components in sheep  but in a study in cattle  the highest persistency was found for protein yield  followed by fat  and the lowest for milk yield []. We could confirm the lower values for persistency of milk yield in sheep  but the persistency of fat yield was higher than the persistency of protein yield. Considering that the major use of sheep milk is for producing cheese  protein and fat yields  and their combination in the form of useful yield  are important traits  and their persistency over the length of the lactation  enables a more sustained outflow of milk for cheese production []. A study in cattle [] reported negative phenotypic correlations of total merit traits (namely lifetime net merit  cheese merit and fluid merit) with persistency of SCS. In the same study  it was also found that phenotypic correlations of milk  fat  and protein with SCS were negative  and that persistency of SCS had a close to zero correlation with SCS. They also found that persistency of SCS had low phenotypic correlations with milk  fat  and protein yield across breeds  but these findings were not observed for most of the traits in our study. It is difficult to resolve if this represents a difference between cattle and sheep  or if it is due to differences in the definition of lactation persistency []. While there is a reasonable amount of literature describing lactation persistency  particularly in cattle  little has been published in relation to extended lactation. The general assumption is that persistency and extended lactation represent similar traits. However  some studies have specifically aimed at describing extended lactation  e.g. Grossman and Koops []  who investigated appropriate modelling techniques  and Haile-Mariam and Goddard []  who reported on genetic parameters associated with extended lactation in cattle. While conventional lactation curve modelling studies may be extrapolated to predict extended lactation characteristics  empirical data on actual yields is needed to allow model fits to be assessed. The current study is based on observed milk yield beyond the standard lactation length in sheep (day 100)  as are the two cattle studies reported above (beyond day 305). As shown in the first three papers of this series [    ]  the results from the maximum likelihood approaches to QTL detection (QTL-MLE) were in good agreement with those of the least-squares methodology of QTL Express []. However  it should be pointed out that QTL-MLE is based on fitting a finite mixture model  unlike regression-based methods  which mirrors the underlying Mendelian segregation process of the putative QTL []. To our knowledge  this is the first study describing a whole genome-scan for detecting QTL for lactation persistency and extended lactation of milk and milk composition in sheep. The results suggest the existence of important genomic regions for these traits but overall  the different traits are influenced by many different QTL (Tables   additional file ). In a previous meta-assembly of published QTL reports  QTL for milk yield were identified on ovine chromosomes 1 to 3  6  9  14  16  20  22  and 24 []. However none of the regions identified for lactation persistency and extended lactation of milk on OAR11  12  or 17 corresponded with these findings and only the QTL for milk persistency on OAR-17 was located in the comparative region to BTA17  where a QTL for milk persistency was identified in dairy cattle []. Among the two QTL identified for protein persistency and extended lactation on OAR11 and 24  only the QTL on OAR24 aligned to a QTL for milk persistency on the comparative bovine chromosomes 25 []. The QTL for lactation persistency and extended lactation of fat on OAR3 aligned with the QTL regions for average fat yield and energy persistency on BTA3 []. The QTL on OAR9 aligned with QTL for fat persistency on BTA14 at 139 cM. Rodriguez-Zas et al. [] also reported on a QTL for the shape of the bovine lactation curve of fat at the proximal end of BTA14  which overlaps with the position of the  gene [  ]. The previous meta-assembly [] also showed strong evidence of QTL for fat yield on both ovine chromosomes 3 and 9. Given the lack of QTL studies in both sheep and cattle for lactation persistency and extended lactation  the power of comparative mapping cannot be evaluated. Among the three QTL regions for persistency and extended lactation of somatic cells identified on OAR2  4 and 10  only the QTL on chromosome 2 mapped to a previously reported QTL in an ovine meta-assembly []. The QTL on OAR2 and 4 were supported by an association study for milk persistency []. Our QTL findings for useful yield and lactose yield are novel since there is no other published study. From this study there does not appear to be a single major gene that regulates lactation persistency and extended lactation. Despite the reduced power to detect QTL for lactation traits since they are expressed in females only  the power of this experiment was sufficient to detect QTL with a minimum effect size of 0.4 SD. Such QTL may have utility in marker-assisted selection in the Awassi-Merino population used here. The Awassi breed has been used extensively to improve milk production through upgrading or crossbreeding programs and therefore QTL detected in the Awassi breed may also support marker-assisted introgression programs. Before such programs can be adopted  the QTL need validation in terms of effect sizes and location. The QTL findings also provide a foundation for targeted fine-mapping using SNP before positional candidate genes can be investigated. In particular  the QTL on OAR11 with effects on milk persistency and on extended lactation for milk and protein yield warrants further investigation. This paper presents measures of lactation persistency and extended lactation in dairy ewes using the Wood lactation curve model. For the first time  QTL were identified for lactation persistency and extended lactation for milk components in a sheep resource population. It is shown that the QTL for lactation persistency and extended lactation for milk components (protein  fat  lactose  useful yield  SCS) differ from QTL for the corresponding yield traits. Furthermore  for many traits  the QTL affecting persistency are different from those affecting extended lactation. While a number of QTL of moderate effect size have been mapped  no individual QTL of major effect has been identified for persistency or extended lactation. Some QTL affecting similar traits in cattle and sheep were found to map to the same homologous regions. However  our ability to undertake this species comparison is limited by the relatively large size of support intervals in the sheep QTL study and by different trait definitions across the studies.

The international Bull Evaluation Service  Interbull  was established in 1983 to respond to this need. Currently  Interbull performs multiple-trait across country evaluations (MACE) for several traits and breeds in dairy cattle and provides international breeding values to its member countries. Estimating parameters for MACE is challenging since the structure of datasets and conventional use of multiple-trait models easily result in over-parameterized genetic covariance matrices. The number of parameters to be estimated can be reduced by taking into account only the leading principal components of the traits considered. For MACE  this is readily implemented in a random regression model.MethodsThis article compares two principal component approaches to estimate variance components for MACE using real datasets. The methods tested were a REML approach that directly estimates the genetic principal components (direct PC) and the so-called bottom-up REML approach (bottom-up PC)  in which traits are sequentially added to the analysis and the statistically significant genetic principal components are retained. Furthermore  this article evaluates the utility of the bottom-up PC approach to determine the appropriate rank of the (co)variance matrix.ResultsOur study demonstrates the usefulness of both approaches and shows that they can be applied to large multi-country models considering all concerned countries simultaneously. These strategies can thus replace the current practice of estimating the covariance components required through a series of analyses involving selected subsets of traits. Our results support the importance of using the appropriate rank in the genetic (co)variance matrix. Using too low a rank resulted in biased parameter estimates  whereas too high a rank did not result in bias  but increased standard errors of the estimates and notably the computing time.ConclusionsIn terms of estimation's accuracy  both principal component approaches performed equally well and permitted the use of more parsimonious models through random regression MACE. The advantage of the bottom-up PC approach is that it does not need any previous knowledge on the rank. However  with a predetermined rank  the direct PC approach needs less computing time than the bottom-up PC."

Using too low a rank resulted in biased parameter estimates  whereas too high a rank did not result in bias  but increased standard errors of the estimates and notably the computing time. In terms of estimation's accuracy  both principal component approaches performed equally well and permitted the use of more parsimonious models through random regression MACE. The advantage of the bottom-up PC approach is that it does not need any previous knowledge on the rank. However  with a predetermined rank  the direct PC approach needs less computing time than the bottom-up PC. Globalization of dairy cattle breeding requires accurate and comparable international breeding values for dairy bulls. The international Bull Evaluation Service  Interbull  has for years performed international genetic evaluations for dairy cattle for several traits  serving the cattle breeders worldwide. Due to different trait definitions and evaluation models in countries participating in the international genetic evaluation of dairy bulls  biological traits like protein yield are treated as different  but genetically correlated traits across countries []. Therefore  each bull will have a breeding value on the base and scale of each participating country. For protein yield in Holstein  this currently leads to 28 breeding values per bull and the number of partipating countries is expected to increase. Such a model is challenging for those responsible for the evaluations and estimation of the corresponding genetic parameters. The size of the (co)variance matrix is large: for 28 traits  the genetic covariance matrix of the classical  unstructured  multiple-trait model comprises 406 distinct covariance components. Furthermore  the full rank model becomes over-parameterized due to high genetic correlations. In addition  links between populations are determined by the amount of exchange of genetic material among the populations and can vary in strength. These special characteristics have led to a situation  where variance components e.g. for protein yield in Holstein are estimated in sub-sets of countries  and are then combined to build-up a complete (co)variance matrix [  ]. Also  country sub-setting is not problem-free since it is often necessary to apply a \"bending\" procedure in order to obtain a positive definite (co)variance matrix when combining estimates from the analyses of sub-sets []. Even if the complete data could be analyzed simultaneously  variance component estimation would remain a challenge since the usual estimation methods are very slow or unstable  when the (co)variance matrices are ill-conditioned. Mäntysaari [] has hypothesized that with the high genetic correlations among countries  estimation of parameters for the full size (co)variance matrix may underestimate the genetic correlations and yield unexpected partial correlations. As an extreme case  this can result in a situation where the bull's daughter performance in one country can effect negatively the bull's EBV in another country. This has been illustrated by van der Beek []. Different solutions have been proposed to deal with the problem of over-parameterisation. Madsen et al. [] have introduced a modification of the average information (AI) algorithm that could be applied to estimate heterogeneous residual variance  residual covariance structure and matrices of reduced rank. Rekaya et al. [] have employed structural models to estimate genetic (co)variances. They modelled genetic  management and environmental similarities to explain the genetic (co)variance structure among countries and to obtain more accurate estimates of genetic correlations. The authors considered the method useful  especially when there was a lack of genetic ties between countries. However  they noted a 15 to 20% increase in computing time compared to the standard multivariate model. Leclerc et al. [] have approached the structural models in a different way. They selected a subset of well-connected base countries to build a multi-dimensional space. The coordinates defined by these countries were used to estimate a distance between base countries and other countries and thus the genetic correlations between them. This decreased the number of parameters to be estimated compared to the unstructured variance component matrix for the multiple-trait across country evaluation (MACE) approach []. However  when they studied a field dataset  a relatively large number of dimensions was needed to model the genetic correlations appropriately and the estimation process often led to local maxima  decreasing the utility of the approach. The principal component (PC) approach has also been investigated as a possible solution to deal with the problems of variance component estimation for the international genetic evaluation of dairy bulls. This approach is of special interest because it allows for a dimension reduction. Principal components are independent  linear functions of the original traits. PC are obtained through an eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance or correlation matrix  which yields its eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues. Eigenvalues describe the magnitude of the variance that the eigenvectors explain. For highly correlated traits  the first few principal components explain the major part of the variation in the data and those with the smallest contribution on the variance can be excluded without notably altering the accuracy of the estimates  e.g. []. Factor analysis (FA) is closely related to the PC approach  but it models part of the variance to be trait-specific. Thus  generally it does not lead to a reduction in rank (assuming all trait-specific variances are non-zero)  but benefits from the more parsimonous structure of the (co)variance matrix. Leclerc et al. [] have studied both PC and FA approaches  but instead of estimating parameters directly from the complete data  they used a subset of well-linked base countries  performed a dimension reduction for the subset and estimated a contribution of the other countries to these PC or factors. The above studies were motivated by an attempt to reduce the number of parameters in the variance component estimation for MACE  but except for the study of Rekaya et al. []  they were based on data sub-setting. Kirkpatrick and Meyer [] and Mäntysaari [] have suggested two different PC approaches meant to use complete datasets. Kirkpatrick and Meyer [] have introduced a direct PC approach that exploits only leading principal components to model the variation in a multivariate system to improve the precision of the estimation and to reduce the computational burden inherent in the analysis of large and complex datasets. However  the approach was not specifically designed for MACE and has not been tested for such datasets. The bottom-up PC approach  introduced by Mäntysaari []  is based on the random regression (RR) MACE model that enables rank reduction. It adds traits  i.e. countries  sequentially in the analysis and defines a correct rank in each step  until all countries are included and the final rank is determined. The bottom-up PC approach was designed to estimate the genetic parameters of large  over-parameterized datasets  for which the estimation of the complete  full rank dataset might not be possible. So far it has only been tested on a simulated dataset. This article studies the value of the direct and the bottom-up PC approaches to estimate the variance components for MACE using real datasets and evaluates the validity of the bottom-up PC approach to determine the appropriate rank of the (co)variance matrix. Classical MACE [] including  countries is applied using the model where  is a  vector of national de-regressed breeding values for bull    is a vector of  country effects   is a vector of  different international breeding values for bull  and  is a  vector of residuals.  and  are incidence matrices and the variance of the bull's breeding values is Var( ) = . Differences in residual variances  var( )  were taken into account by carrying out a weighted analysis. Specifically  this involved fitting residual variances at unity and scaling the other terms in the model (1) with weights   =    where  is the sire variance of the j'th country   with heritabilities  provided by each participating country  and  is the bull's effective daughter contribution in country []. Contrary to the official MACE evaluations  in this study animals with unknown parentage were not grouped into phantom parent groups. Following []  the genetic (co)variance matrix of the sire effects can be rewritten as and  can be further decomposed into in which  is a diagonal matrix of genetic standard deviations   is a genetic correlation matrix   is the matrix of eigenvalues of  and  is the matrix of the corresponding eigenvectors. This allows the classical MACE model to be rewritten as an equivalent random regression MACE model [  ]: where is a vector of  regression coefficients for bull  with var() = . Formulating the classical MACE model as a RR MACE model enables a rank reduction of the genetic (co)variance matrix []. If  is close to singular  then the  largest eigenvalues    explain the essential part of the variance in . Thus   can be replaced with where the  ×   contains the  largest eigenvalues and the  matrix  the  corresponding eigenvectors []. Consequently   matrix  has now only (2 -  + 1)/2 parameters. The bottom-up PC approach is comprised of a sequence of REML analyses that starts with a sub-set of traits. New traits/countries are added one by one into the analysis  and after each trait addition step the correct rank of the model is determined. The latter can be inferred based on the size of the smallest eigenvalues of [] or of the correlation matrix or by using likelihood based model selection tools such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) []  which takes into account both the magnitude of the likelihood and the number of parameters in the model  thus penalizing for overparameterized models. The latter was used in this study. For given starting values in each step  we decomposed  into  and   estimated  conditional on  and combined  and  to update . At the beginning of the analysis  starting values provided by Interbull were used and in the subsequent steps  estimates were obtained from the previous steps. The rationale behind the bottom-up algorithm is to select in each step the highest rank  which is still justified by the AIC criteria. Each time a new country/trait   + 1  is added to the analysis  the variance of the previous traits is already completely described by the  eigenvectors. The genetic variance of the new trait and its covariance with the previous eigenvectors is estimated and if it is considered to provide new information on breeding values  the new breeding value equation and the new rank   + 1  is kept. Implementation for MACE: Initial step choose  countries as starting sub-set use starting values    take  and  for bull  to model the residual variance by applying weights  estimate  ×  matrix  for the  starting countries under the full rank model   =  calculate Akaike's information criterion value  = 2 log  + 2  where log L is the maximum log Likelihood and  = ( + 1)/2 the number of parameters Determination of the correct rank for a given rank decompose  derive   where  is obtained from  by removing the smallest eigenvalue from  and the corresponding eigenvector from  update the weights using    and  estimate a new  with  and  as covariables by fitting model (5). calculate   select the best model (\"rank reduction\" step) after the initial step: while <   set  = -1 and repeat step 2  otherwise take  and  and proceed to step 3 after the country addition step: if <   replace  and  with  and   otherwise take  and  and proceed to step 3 Addition of a new country/trait if    =  + 1 and  =  + 1 add a new row and column of zeros to  and   and set the element of  to 1 and the diagonal element of  to twice the average genetic variance from countries  = 1  .

The genetic (co)variance matrix is decomposed into matrices of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and only the leading principal components with notable contribution to the total variance are selected to estimate the genetic parameters. The direct estimation method requires  knowledge of the number of principal components fitted in the model or it must be estimated. Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] noticed that selecting too low a rank in the direct PC approach can lead to picking up the wrong subset of PC  which can result in biased estimates. Thus  it is important to select the correct rank when the direct PC approach is employed. We followed the procedure of Meyer and Kirkpatrick []  to determine the appropriate rank and to test the capability of the bottom-up PC approach to define an appropriate rank. First  the (co)variance matrix for protein yield provided by Interbull was decomposed. Then we studied the magnitude of the eigenvalues to make an informed guess of the correct rank. After this  we performed several direct PC analyses with ranks bracketing this value. And finally  we examined the values of Log L and AIC  the sum of the eigenvalues  the magnitude of the leading eigenvalues to determine the correct rank. In addition  average quadratic deviations between  optimal and sub-optimal models    were calculated to indicate changes in the estimates of genetic correlations while moving away from the optimal model [].  was defined as where  is the number of traits and  is the estimated genetic correlation between traits  and  from an analysis fitting  PC. The genetic correlations from the sub-optimal models were contrasted with the estimates from the direct PC rank 20 model (  )  which was the optimal rank selected by the bottom-up approach. When the rank of the model is appropriately defined  [] AIC should be at its minimum and the magnitude of the leading principal components and the sum of the eigenvalues stabilized  indicating that there is no re-partitioning of the genetic variance into the residual variance  which is the case if too few principal components are fitted []. Further  the improvement of the Log Likelihood beyond the optimal model is expected to be negligible. The parameterization in the bottom-up PC approach differs from the direct PC approach in the matrix that is used for the eigenvalue decomposition. In the bottom-up PC approach  the eigenvalue decomposition was done on the correlation matrix  while in the direct PC approach the parameterization was on the (co)variance matrix []. For both PC approaches  the heterogeneity in residual variances were taken into account using weights  as outlined above. In the bottom-up PC approach  they were updated after each REML run  implying that  were fixed  whereas  were estimated in the direct PC approach. Data of the MACE Interbull Holstein protein yield and somatic cell count (SCC) evaluations were used for testing. Deregressed breeding values [] for protein yield came from the August 2007 evaluation  consisting of 25 countries and those for SCC from the April 2009 evaluation comprising 23 countries. Table  lists the countries participating in the international evaluations in 2007 for protein yield and in 2009 for SCC. The number of countries differs between biological traits since some of countries - often those who joined the international evaluation only recently - provide data only for production traits. In addition  new countries join the MACE evaluation over time  so the number of countries involved increases gradually. We followed Interbull's practice by listing countries in all figures and tables (except Table  for SCC) based on their joining date for the evaluation of each biological trait. The total number of records was 116 941 for protein yield and 122 215 for SCC. These represented 103 676 and 100 551 bulls with deregressed breeding values  respectively. The number of bulls with records in protein yield varied from 145 to 23 380 among countries  with a mean of 4 678 bulls per country. Corresponding values for SCC were 168 to 25 281  with a mean of 5 314 bulls per country. For both biological traits  bulls were used mainly in one country; only 5% of the bulls were used in two countries and 1% in three countries. Further  only 286 bulls (i.e. 0.3%) with records for protein yield and 321 bulls (i.e. 0.3%) with records for SCC were used in more than 10 countries. Breeding policies vary notably among countries in terms of how much countries rely on their own breeding schemes or whether they import most of their breeding animals. USA is an example of a country that has a long tradition of Holstein breeding: only 6% of the bulls were imported bulls for the 2007 protein yield data (Table ). Conversely  Belgium is an example of a country that leans heavily on import: in the same data  97% of the Holstein bulls used in Belgium were imported (Table ). The number of common bulls between countries varied from zero to 1 194 for protein yield  with a mean of 178  and for SCC from one to 1 526  with a mean of 240. Substantial variation existed in the number of common bulls among countries. For both biological traits  French Red Holstein shared the smallest number of common bulls with the other countries and the USA  as a popular trading partner  shared the most. Bottom-up PC runs were performed for both traits. Direct PC runs with ranks 15  17  19  20 and 25 were carried out for protein yield to evaluate the optimal rank using the methods proposed by Meyer and Kirkpatrick []. For SCC  however  only the rank suggested by the bottom-up PC approach was used in the direct PC analyses. The sensitivity of the bottom-up PC approach to different orders of country addition was tested for a sub-set of nine countries: France  USA  Czech Republic  Latvia  Poland  New-Zealand  Australia  Slovenia and Ireland. These nine countries that were well and loosely linked  represented different hemispheres  and different managing systems and thus constituted a representative sample of all countries involved in the Interbull evaluation. Two different orders were tested. Order1 was the order of introduction of the countries above and order2 was the reverse of order1. For both orders  the analysis started with four countries. The order of country addition should not affect the estimates  if only non-significant eigenvalues are excluded. To test this  we modified the bottom-up PC approach. Instead of selecting the best model based on the AIC (steps 2e-f  3d)  we determined a rank based on the proportion of explained variance in the transformation step 2a. Therefore  steps 2b-d became optional  depending on whether the rank was reduced or not. We tested three scenarios: the modified bottom-up approach was required to include 97  99  or 99.5% of the total variance in the transformation step. For comparison  a full fit direct PC analysis (rank 9) and a basic bottom-up analysis were carried out for the sub-set of nine countries. The WOMBAT software [] was used for the direct PC analyses  as well as for the variance component estimation in the bottom-up PC approach. The average information REML algorithm was applied for both approaches. Bull pedigrees were based on sire and maternal grand sire information. Genetic correlations estimated by Interbull in their test runs (protein yield: test run preceding August 2007 evaluation  SCC: test run preceding April 2009 evaluation) were used for comparison. Table  shows the effects of varying the order in which countries are added in the modified bottom-up PC approach on estimates of genetic correlations among the nine countries considered. Explaining 97  99  and 99.5% of the total variance required the inclusion of the 6  7 or 8 largest eigenvalues  respectively. Results clearly revealed the importance of the correct rank selection. When 99.5% of the variance in the eigenvalues was taken into account (rank 8)  the order of the country addition had no influence on the estimates of the genetic correlations. Thus  relatively large number of PC were required to explain all necessary variation in the data. When a larger proportion of the variance in the eigenvalues was removed (ranks 7 and 6)  the order of the countries added in the analysis affected the estimates of the genetic correlations. Especially the genetic correlations of Slovenia and Latvia with the other countries changed notably with the change in the order. Even though the variance explained by the 6th and 7th PC was small  those PC were  however  essential to be included in the analysis to ensure that all necessary PC were picked up. This phenomenon has also been observed in other studies [  ]. The bottom-up PC approach and using AIC to determine the rank resulted in rank 8 as well  indicating that the algorithm was able to find the correct rank. Information used for the model selection of the protein yield data under the direct PC approach is summarized in Table . AIC for the 25-trait analysis was highest for a model fitting 19 PC and log likelihood did not increase significantly beyond rank 19. The sums of eigenvalues and the leading PC were  in practice  identical between models fitting ranks 19  20 and 25. Furthermore  the last five eigenvalues equalled zero with a precision of two decimals  thus they included basically no information. Based on the  values  estimates of genetic correlations from the models fitting ranks 19  20 and 25 were almost identical. Differences in the estimates started to increase  as the rank was dropped to 17 and 15. Thus  results suggested that either rank 19 or 20 is the appropriate rank to describe the genetic variation in protein yield. This means a reduction from 5 to 6% in the number of parameters needed to describe the complete 25 × 25 (co)variance matrix  because the number of parameters for the direct PC is  = (2 + 1) 2. The bottom-up PC run terminated with rank 20 for protein yield  indicating that the approach is able to find the correct rank. Under the bottom-up PC   is obtained by backtransforming it and only the matrix of eigenvalues is directly estimated  thus  = ( + 1) 2  and only 65% of the parameters were sufficient to describe the complete (co)variance matrix for that method. Based on the bottom-up results  the appropriate rank was 15 for SCC. Thus  only 44% of the parameters under the bottom-up PC were needed to describe the 23 × 23 (co)variance matrix for SCC  whereas the corresponding number for the direct PC rank 15 analysis was 87%. Our results on the importance of fitting an optimal rank in the principal component analysis are supported by earlier studies by Meyer [  ] and Meyer and Kirkpatrick []. While studying reduced rank multivariate animal models for beef cattle  Meyer noticed that fitting too few principal components resulted in inaccurate estimates of the genetic parameters [  ]. A more recent study of Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] has listed three sources of bias of reduced rank estimates: spread of sample roots  constraining estimates to the parameter space and picking up the wrong subset of the genetic PC  if too few PC are fitted. Figures  and  summarize the genetic correlations for protein yield and SCC  respectively. Heat map type plots demonstrate the magnitude of the genetic correlations among countries from different approaches  as well as the differences in genetic correlations between approaches. Descriptive statistics of the variation in the correlations from different approaches are collected in the tables below both figures. In general  differences in the estimates obtained with different approaches were small  especially for SCC. Genetic correlations for SCC were high in magnitude for all countries  whereas those for protein yield were very low for some countries - contrary to the biologically justified expectation of on average high genetic correlations. The different approaches did not vary in this respect. . Differences shown are estimates from the first method listed minus estimates from the second method. . Differences shown are estimates from the first method listed minus estimates from the second method. The average estimates of genetic correlations from the direct PC rank 20  direct PC full fit  bottom-up PC rank 20 and Interbull analyses for protein yield were very similar  ranging from 0.68 to 0.70 (Figure ). Based on the first and third quantiles and the median  the distribution of the Interbull estimates was on a somewhat higher level compared to those of the PC approaches. Nevertheless  the Interbull estimates included the lowest value for protein yield  being as low as 0.02 between New-Zealand and Latvia. The means of the SCC estimates were much higher  from 0.87 to 0.89 (Figure )  compared to those for protein yield. In addition  the lowest values were rather high  ranging from 0.61 (Interbull) to 0.65 (bottom-up PC). The distributions of the estimates of genetic correlations from the different approaches were very similar for SCC  although those for the Interbull were on a slightly higher level. The plots of genetic correlations also showed that over-parameterization of the model for protein yield had virtually no effect on the estimates (Figure ) since both rank 20 and 25 models resulted in almost identical genetic correlations. Figure  and Table  illustrate the challenges of the datasets used in this study. Plotting the genetic correlations with the number of common bulls between countries revealed that for protein yield  the level of the correlation estimates increased with the number of common bulls (Figure ). This was  however  not the case for SCC. Furthermore  the standard deviations of the genetic correlations within classes defined by the number of common bulls were notably larger for protein yield than for SCC (Figure ). In addition  a low number of common bulls was associated with larger differences in the estimates between the different approaches  hinting that the approaches reacted differently to challenges in the datasets. . The common bulls were defined as bulls having daughters in both countries of inspection without restriction on the country of origin of the bulls. On the one hand  the lack of connections between countries hinders the estimation of genetic parameters and this can explain the low genetic correlations for e.g. Slovenia and Latvia (Tables  and ). On the other hand  countries like South-Africa and New-Zealand were also associated with a lower level of genetic correlations for protein yield (Table ). However  on average  they have strong links with the other countries (Table ). Furthermore  the standard errors of the estimates of New-Zealand and South-Africa with the other countries were relatively small  unlike those of Slovenia and Latvia with the other countries. Based on the study of Jakobsen et al. []  different trait definitions and national genetic evaluation models  as well as genotype by environment interactions explain the low to moderate genetic correlations in international genetic evaluations of dairy bulls. One of the main challenges in national genetic evaluation schemes incorporating foreign bulls is to adequately model systematic genetic differences by defining genetic groups. This holds especially for countries with small populations and where information on their daughters is scarce. This might result in proofs for foreign sires which are biased. As these national proofs are the data used in variance component estimation  inadequate genetic grouping at the national level may be one of the factors contributing to low estimates of genetic correlations for protein yield in different countries. Because selection of bulls is predominantly targeting production traits  the impact of ill-defined genetic groups on proofs for other  non-production traits is expected to be smaller. In addition  imported bulls may be more representative of the population in the country of origin as  for instance  for SCC. Altogether  using a more parsimonious covariance structure did not resolve the problem of some small genetic correlations for protein yield. Currently  Interbull post-processes genetic correlations to correspond to the level of some justified expectation. This is done by utilizing information on the new estimates  estimates from the previous run  Interbull's own expectations and for non-Holstein breeds  correlations from Holstein []. Until the ultimate reason for the low estimates of genetic correlations has been identified  one alternative to the current post-processing would be to apply prior expectations under the Bayesian MACE suggested by  e.g.  Mark et al. []. With insufficient data  the prior expectations would not be overridden and the level of the final estimates would be closer to their biologically justified expectations compared to the current non-post-processed estimates or those obtained under the PC approaches. By applying the approach suggested by Mark et al. []  we might reduce the degree of parsimony which can be attained using the PC approaches  but this may be off-set by the prior information utilized and thus reduce mean square errors. The run time of the direct PC analysis for protein yield reached a maximum for the rank 15 model (22 days)  decreased with increasing rank  being shortest for the rank 20 model (5 days) and was 17 days for the full fit model. The memory needed for the direct PC rank 20 model for protein yield was 4.1 GB  whereas it was highest i.e. 6.3 GB for the full fit model. Thus  the costs of the over-parameterization were a longer run time and a higher RAM memory requirement without any increase in the accuracy of the estimation. Furthermore  the magnitude of standard errors of the estimates increased with the number of parameters to be estimated. This is a consequence of the increased sampling variance when estimating more parameters [see [  ]]. Interestingly  fitting too few parameters in the model prolonged the run time. This occurred also for SCC (results not shown) and for the factor analytic models (manuscript in preparation). If the rank of the model is reduced too much  the number of available parameters is not sufficient to describe the (co)variance structure of the model  which in turn  detrimentally affects the convergence rate of the REML analysis. The effects of the possible problems in the datasets accumulated as the bottom-up PC approach was used  which the protein yield data clearly demonstrated (Table ). The first 15 countries introduced in the analysis were mostly well-linked countries that test many AI-bulls. They contributed 88% of the total data  but the computing time was less than 9% of the total time used. In the bottom-up approach  each time a new country/trait is added  the (co)variance matrix must be reestimated. Furthermore  the estimation process is carried out twice because two possible models are compared to test if the country addition requires an increase of rank or not. Thus  once difficulties in the iteration process have started  they will  at least to some extent  continue to the very end of the sequential country addition-rank reduction-process. On the other hand  when no larger problems are embedded in the data  the difference in the total estimation time between direct and bottom-up PC approaches is rather small  as demonstrated for SCC (Table ). Overall  both approaches tested in this study performed very well and estimates of genetic correlations were similar to the Interbull estimates. Both PC approaches were applied to complete datasets unlike those suggested in the earlier studies [      ] and the current Interbull procedure [  ]. One advantage of the direct over the bottom-up PC approach are the potentially much reduced computational requirements. This applies in particular when an analysis is started with a small subset of countries and countries with a problematic data structure are added in early on. Such problems were encountered for protein yield  resulting in the computational requirements shown in table . The current test version of the bottom-up PC approach has not been streamlined yet by any means. The analysis of the performance of the bottom-up approach (Tables  and ) as well as preliminary tests give evidence that the computation time can be reduced by starting from a higher number of countries. Furthermore  when a new country is added  zero starting covariances between new and old countries could be replaced with covariances calculated from the mean correlation of countries already in the dataset and from the variances of those countries. The advantage of the bottom-up approach is that we estimate  elements of  ×   -matrix in the parameter estimation step and therefore  there is no danger of picking up the wrong subset of principal components. This study shows that both the direct and the bottom-up principal component approaches and the use of models with optimal rank are useful in the variance component estimation for MACE. Furthermore  both approaches can be applied to large datasets and data sub-setting is not needed. Based on the results  we emphasize the importance of the selection of the appropriate rank of the (co)variance matrix to obtain good estimates. The bottom-up PC approach is capable of determining the appropriate rank for highly over-parameterized models and thus leads to a more parsimonous variance structure. However  with a predetermined rank  the direct PC approach needs less computing time than the bottom-up PC. The third approach that is considered for variance component estimation for MACE is the direct factor analytic approach that will be presented in an upcoming paper.

The Complete Linkage Disequilibrium (CLD) test presented here tests whether a SNP is in complete LD with the causative mutation or not. The performance of the CLD test is evaluated in 1000 simulated datasets. The CLD test consists of two steps i.e. analysis I and analysis II. Analysis I consists of an association analysis of the investigated region. The log-likelihood values from analysis I are next ranked in descending order and in analysis II the CLD test evaluates differences in log-likelihood ratios between the best and second best markers. Under the null-hypothesis distribution  the best SNP is in greater LD with the QTL than the second best  while under the alternative-CLD-hypothesis  the best SNP is alike-in-state with the QTL. To find a significance threshold  the test was also performed on data excluding the causative SNP. The 5  10 and 50 highest T value from 1000 replicated analyses were used to control the type-I-error rate of the test at p = 0.005  p = 0.01 and p = 0.05  respectively. In a situation where the QTL explained 48% of the phenotypic variance analysis I detected a QTL in 994 replicates (p = 0.001)  where 972 were positioned in the correct QTL position. When the causative SNP was excluded from the analysis  714 replicates detected evidence of a QTL (p = 0.001). In analysis II  the CLD test confirmed 280 causative SNP from 1000 simulations (p = 0.05)  i.e. power was 28%. When the effect of the QTL was reduced by doubling the error variance  the power of the test reduced relatively little to 23%. When sequence data were used  the power of the test reduced to 16%. All SNP that were confirmed by the CLD test were positioned in the correct QTL position. The CLD test can provide evidence for a causative SNP  but its power may be low in situations with closely linked markers. In such situations  also functional evidence will be needed to definitely conclude whether the SNP is causative or not. QTL mapping efforts often result in the detection of genomic regions that explain quantitative trait variation  but seldom in the detection of the causative mutation underlying the trait variation. Recently  methods developed to genotype high numbers of SNP have permitted to reduce the size of the genomic regions detected. High density SNP genotyping enables the detection of QTL regions of up to 2 cM in size. Availability of genome sequences and/or comparative maps make it possible to set up a shortlist of positional candidate genes. These candidate genes can be sequenced by second-generation sequencing technologies  leading to the detection of many potentially causative SNP that probably include the causative mutation. However  genetic approaches cannot distinguish between SNP in complete linkage disequilibrium (CLD) with the QTL and the QTL itself and at best  they can test whether a SNP is in complete LD with the QTL or not. Because false discovery rate and power are tightly connected when dealing with complex traits []  the challenge is to find methods that provide sufficient power to discover a complete LD SNP and simultaneously keep the false discovery rate under control. Recently  we investigated the effect of precision and power obtained by including the causative mutation among the markers in a QTL mapping experiment []. Both power and precision were increased and the results indicated that it would be possible to identify causative- or CLD-SNP. In this paper  we propose a test to identify SNP that are in complete LD with the QTL  in order to maximise the genetic evidence for the SNP that is the causative mutation. We evaluate the performance of this test using simulated data where the causative SNP is unequivocally known. The simulated data used in this study have been previously described in Uleberg and Meuwissen []. Briefly  the SNP marker data were generated by Hudson's coalescence tree simulation program  \"ms\" [] using a 2 cM long segment and 100 individuals (200 haplotypes). In practical situations  the size of the region depends on the confidence interval of the previous QTL mapping study. The assumed effective population size was 100  and the mutation rate was 10 per bp (10 bp per cM was assumed). The size of the effective population did not exceed that of the sample  which is usually the case in livestock and which makes the continuous time approximation of the coalescence process somewhat unrealistic. In spite of this  we expected the resulting genealogies to resemble those in QTL mapping experiments involving unrelated individuals  such as Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). In addition to the 100 replications previously analysed by Uleberg and Meuwissen []  900 new replications were performed resulting in a total number of replicates of 1000. From the numerous markers generated by the \"ms\" simulations  21 were selected based on position and allele frequency. The selected markers had minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 0.1 and were close to equidistant over the region  so that the average distance between two markers was 0.1 cM. The 11 SNP was selected as the causative SNP and the effect of the QTL genotype was 0  1 or 2. Phenotypic records were obtained by summing the QTL genotype effect and an environmental effect  which was sampled from N(0  0.5). The average genetic variance (from the first 100 replicates) was 0.48  leading to a heritability of 0.54. Two datasets were selected for each of the 1000 simulations i.e. one containing 20 markers but not the causative SNP and one containing 21 markers including the causative SNP as the 11 marker. Figure  shows the average linkage disequilibrium measured by r[] between the causative SNP and the other 20 SNP as a function of their distance to the causative SNP. . The analysis consisted of two steps: analysis I and analysis II. In analysis I  a QTL analysis of the region was performed using a statistical model that regressed directly on marker effects  as in association mapping  calculating the log-likelihood of effects of the different markers. The model assumed additive inheritance and was: where µ is an overall mean   is a vector of ones   is a vector of two random SNP allelic effects and  is a vector of random sampling errors;  is a design matrix indicating which marker alleles are carried by the animals. The correlation matrix of  is the identity matrix  . The variance of the random effects  and  and the log-likelihood of the model were estimated using the ASREML package []. A model containing the marker alleles was tested against a model excluding the marker alleles. The log-likelihood ratio  i.e. the difference of log-likelihoods between the two models  was used as a criterion for evidence of a QTL at the putative marker position. Next  the SNP were ranked for their log-likelihood values  where the most likely SNP was denoted (1)  the second most likely (2)  etc. In Analysis II  the two SNP that gave the highest log-likelihood values in analysis I were compared by the CLD test. The idea is that  if the maximum-likelihood-SNP is in complete LD with the QTL  it will not only have a high Identity-By-Descent (IBD) probability with the QTL but also be alike-in-state (AIS) and thus will explain substantially more variance than a SNP that is only in partial LD with the QTL  such as the second highest log-likelihood SNP. The test statistic is thus: where LogLik(m) is the log-likelihood of the model including the -th ranking marker. The T values are a measure of the relative importance of the best SNP compared to the second best SNP. Since the best SNP is expected to explain more variance than the second best SNP  the null-hypothesis distribution differed from the usual one  i.e. the best SNP was expected to explain more variance. Thus  under the null-hypothesis distribution  the best SNP is in somewhat more LD with the QTL than the second best SNP  whereas under the alternative-hypothesis the best SNP is in complete LD with the causative mutation and thus also alike-in-state with the QTL. In order to establish a significance threshold for the CLD test  the test was also performed on data where the causative SNP was excluded. The 5  10 and 50 highest T value out of 1000 replicated analyses excluding the causative SNP were taken as the p = 0.005  p = 0.01 and p = 0.05 significance threshold  respectively. Figure  shows mean log-likelihood ratio values from the analysis including or excluding the causative SNP. The average log-likelihood ratio for the most likely SNP position was ~ 6 when the causative SNP was excluded and ~ 23 when the causative SNP was included. Based on 100 replicates  the LD  measured by r  was 0.33 between the QTN and the best adjacent marker. The average r between all markers was 0.2. . Table  shows that analysis I detected a QTL in 994 replicates (p = 0.001) when the causative SNP was included in the analysis. In 972 replicates  the detected QTL was positioned in the 11 marker position  which was the correct position. For 59 of the replicates  the best log-likelihood value was shared between two SNP. In 58 cases  this was the causative SNP and a SNP positioned 1-3 positions away from the causative SNP. For the 58 replicates when the causative SNP was amongst the SNP with equal log-likelihood values  the replicate was defined as correctly positioned in Table . The 59 simulations that found equal log-likelihood values for two SNP positions were not included in analysis II  because our ultimate aim was to find evidence for the causal SNP  and in these 59 cases  the genetic evidence is clearly inconclusive and more data is needed. The six replicates that did not find evidence of a QTL were also excluded from analysis II. When the causative SNP was excluded from the analysis  evidence for a QTL at p = 0.001 was detected for 714 replicates. Four hundred and forty-seven of these were positioned adjacent to the masked causative SNP. The results from the first 100 simulations of analysis I have been presented by Uleberg and Meuwissen []. Figure  shows the distribution of the T values for the analysis when the causative SNP was included or excluded. T values were generally higher when the causative SNP was included. The average T value was 4.84 when the causative SNP was excluded and 12.45 when the causative SNP was included. . T values are ranked in descending order Table  shows that in analysis II  the CLD test confirmed 88 causative SNP for the 1000 simulations when the significance level was p = 0.005. When the significance level was reduced to p = 0.05  the CLD test confirmed 280 causative SNP. All confirmed SNP were positioned correctly by the initial analysis I. Thus  none of the 22 significant SNP that were not correctly positioned was confirmed by the CLD test. It should be noted that the CLD test involves only a single test for the entire segment  such that higher p-value thresholds can be used than when testing every SNP individually  and performing 21 tests. Additional analyses were performed to investigate the behaviour of the CLD test when the QTL effect size was reduced. The relative effect of the QTL was reduced by doubling the error variance from 0.5 to 1. In analysis I  the reduced QTL effect led to a decrease in average log-likelihood values for the most likely QTL position from ~ 6 to ~ 3 when the causative SNP was excluded from the analysis and from ~ 23 to ~ 12 when the causative SNP was included in the analysis. The number of detected causative SNP was reduced from 972 to 899 (Table ). Eight hundred and fifty-five of the detected SNP were positioned at the position of the causative SNP. For 49 of the replicates  the best log-likelihood value was shared between two SNP. Again  these replicates were excluded from analysis II  as the evidence for a causative mutation was not conclusive. The 101 replicates that did not find evidence of a QTL were also excluded from analysis II. Table  also shows that when the causative SNP was excluded from analysis I  the number of replicates that detected evidence for a causative SNP was reduced from 714 to 505 when the QTL effect was reduced. The results from the first 100 simulations of analysis I have been presented by Uleberg and Meuwissen []. Figure  shows that  when the size of the QTL effect was reduced  the average T values were reduced from 4.84 to 2.91 if the causative SNP was excluded and from 12.45 to 6.66 if it was included. Table  shows that  with a reduced QTL effect  the CLD test confirmed fewer causative SNP from the 1000 simulations. The number of confirmed causative SNP was reduced from 88 to 48 with a significance level of p = 0.005 and from 280 to 231 with a significance level of p = 0.05. Again  the position of all confirmed SNP was the same as that of the causative SNP determined by the initial analysis I. . T values are ranked in descending order We investigated the relationship between the T value and the LD between the best and second best SNP: for the 50 highest T values  the average r was 0.23 and for the 50 lowest it was 0.85. This shows that a low r between the best and second best SNP favours a high test statistic and thus produces a significant result. Thus  if the causative SNP is among the SNP being tested  there is a greater chance to obtain a positive result if the r value between adjacent SNP is low and thus if marker density is low. The datasets with the 50 highest and 50 lowest T values had an average minor allele frequency (MAF) for the causative SNP of 0.38 and 0.24  respectively  indicating that a higher MAF value favours a significant test result  although this effect is relatively small. The proposed CLD test confirmed 280 out of 1000 causal SNP at a p-value of 0.05 (231 when the QTL effect size was reduced). The power of the CLD test is thus 23-28% and is much lower than when the SNP are used to detect QTL-SNP associations. This relatively low power reflects the fact that proving that a SNP is in complete LD is more difficult than showing that it is merely associated with the QTL. Thus  as previously reported []  avoiding false discoveries results in lower power when trying to confirm causal SNP. Reducing the size of the QTL effect did not affect dramatically the power of the test  indicating that other factors  such as the LD structure in the region  are more important to the power of the test. The stringent threshold for the CLD test is the result of strong LD between the SNP in these data. Thus  the CLD test accounts for the background LD when trying to distinguish complete LD from associated SNP. An alternative approach to find the causative SNP is the concordance test [] in which the candidate SNP are genotyped in the parents of the families involved in the linkage mapping design. For this test  the QTL genotypes of the parents should be based on many offspring and be quite certain. If the SNP genotypes agree with that of the inferred QTL genotypes  it provides evidence for the SNP being causative. However  if a SNP is in strong LD with the QTL  the SNP genotypes are also expected to agree with the QTL genotypes  especially when there are only a few parents with 'almost' certain QTL genotypes. For example  in a coat colour mapping study in dogs  37% of the candidate genes past the concordance test []. Moreover  if some of the QTL genotypes are wrongly inferred  this test results in a type-I-error []. The data used in this paper did not have the structure of a linkage mapping study  and thus QTL genotypes could not be inferred with high accuracy. The current data resembled that of an association study and  thus  the presented approach is suited to follow-up upon GWAS results. The test-statistic of the CLD test is based on the assumption that  under the null-hypothesis distribution  the best SNP explains more variance of the phenotype than the second best  whereas under the alternative hypothesis the best SNP is also alike-in-state with the QTL and explains much more of the phenotypic variance. Based on the average log-likelihood values for all 1000 simulations  the difference between the best and second best SNP in these data is ~17 log-likelihood units when the causative SNP is included and only ~0.5 log-likelihood units when the causative SNP is excluded from the analysis. However  the variance between replicates is large  leading to a relatively low power when all replicates are evaluated. In GWAS  isolated significant SNP are often distrusted  because none of the neighboring SNP confirms the presence of a QTL. In such a case of an isolated significant SNP  the CLD test would provide a positive result since its signal is so much higher than that of neighboring SNP. Here  we assumed that the previous QTL mapping study unequivocally detected a QTL in the studied region  so that regions with spurious significant SNP will not be subjected to the test. QTL mapping cannot distinguish between a causative SNP and a SNP that is in perfect LD with the causative SNP []. Thus  if two SNP are found with equally high log-likelihood values  it is not clear which of the SNP is the causative mutation  and the CLD test statistic would be zero and should not be performed. The latter effect of having a low CLD statistic if one or more SNP are in very high LD with the causative SNP appears to protect the CLD test from pointing to non-causative SNP when the causative SNP is included in the analysis. This is demonstrated by the result that none of the 22 and 44 incorrectly positioned significant SNP in Table  are confirmed by the CLD test. Since higher T-statistics were found for SNP with a low r with their nearest marker  we investigated the effect of SNP density on the power of the test. Here  we considered the highest possible density  namely sequence data  which is becoming increasingly available. We reran 1000 \"ms\"-simulations as described in the Methods section  but retained all the SNP that resulted from the simulated mutations. This resulted in an average of 470 SNP in the 2 cM segment  with an average r between adjacent markers of 0.12. The average r was rather low due to the often low MAF  but for 6% of the marker pairs r was equal to 1. The SNP closest to the middle of the 2 cM segment was designated as the QTL and an environmental effect sampled from N(0 0.5) was added to obtain phenotypes. Out of 1000 replicates  545 had a single most significant QTL  and 402 of these had the QTL correctly identified. Out of these 402 replicates  63 had a significant T statistic (P < 0.05)  resulting in a power of 16% (= 63/402). Thus  the power was substantially reduced if the marker density was increased to that of sequence data  but some level of power remained. Again none of the misplaced QTL positions passed the CLD test. The fact that high marker densities  such as in sequence data  results in a reduction of the power of the test  may suggest that removing some SNP from the data (obviously not the putative causative SNP) will improve power. However this invalidates the CLD test  since the test assumes that some SNP from the QTL region were obtained through a SNP discovery process that is not related to the phenotypic data. Moreover  this artificial reduction of SNP density can result in false positive test results  because the T statistic will be artificially increased if the second best SNP is removed and  e.g.  replaced by the -th best. In 59 replicates  analysis I found two or more SNP with equal log-likelihood values for the most likely SNP. This was typically the causative SNP and a SNP located 1 to 3 positions away from the causative SNP. Evaluating five of these replicates showed equal haplotype combinations for every animal for the two most likely SNP  thus the two SNP were in perfect LD. Other replicates produced similar results  with the causative SNP and one close SNP returning log-likelihood values at a higher level than the rest of the SNP  although not equal. In these replicates  the analysis excluding the causative SNP returned large T values and resulted in the stringent significance threshold that was used here. As explained by Goddard and Hayes []  causative SNP might be expected to show different properties to common SNP  because causative SNP may be subject to selection such that polymorphisms will typically be recent and have low minor allele frequencies. Thus they may show less LD with markers than common SNP. As a consequence  causative SNP may be expected to show less LD to common SNP in real data than in these simulations  which may improve the power of the CLD test in real data  if the causative SNP is included. However  since we tend to choose common markers for SNP genotyping experiments  the causative SNP will less likely be included in real data as long as selection is based on the minor allele frequency. Hence  all SNP in the promising regions will have to be genotyped in order to improve the probability of inclusion of the causative SNP. When SNP are evaluated  a number of these will be coding SNP that change amino acids []. The number of coding SNP is substantially smaller than the overall total number of common SNP. So far little effort has been placed on identifying coding SNP  but for the future  knowledge on which SNP are coding could be valuable when trying to identify causative mutations. Information about coding SNP will reduce the number of candidate SNP and thus improve the power of tests for causal SNP by removing the signal from non-coding SNP in LD with the causative SNP. However  non-coding SNP in regulatory regions of the genes may also be causative. If the candidate region contains several genes  information on gene function could also be used to increase the power of the test. Including the causative SNP as a marker increased the average log-likelihood values about four times in these simulations (Figure ). Although these simulations were quite simple  this large increase appears to be quite general  although its size may be modified by different factors  such as family structure  marker density  dataset size and QTL effect sizes. Given our general conclusion that the inclusion of the causative SNP is expected to increase the log-likelihood ratios  these factors are expected to affect mainly the power of the test. To apply the CLD test to real data  the significance threshold must be estimated from the real data. The basic approach that is proposed is to perform a QTL analysis (i.e. analysis I)  and to calculate the T statistic (T). Then  records are simulated assuming that the SNP detected by the QTL analysis is causative  with simulated QTL variances equal to the estimates obtained from the real data analysis  where every SNP  will in turn be assigned as causative  and will be masked when analysing the data. This simulates replicated data under the null-hypothesis with an LD structure as found in the QTL region. Analysing these null-hypothesis data without including the assumed causative SNP will provide a significance threshold for the analysed data. A significance level can be obtained by counting how many of the null-hypothesis T values exceed the real data T -value. For example  if 100 out of 1000 null-hypothesis datasets have T values exceeding T  the p-value of the real data CST is 0.1 (= 100/1000). The relatively low power of the CLD test does not imply that it should not be used  since it is not very costly to perform and  depending on its p-value  it may provide substantial statistical evidence for a causative SNP. However  because of the low power of the test  the p-value of the real data T (as described in the previous paragraph) will in most situations be quite high. Ron and Weller [] suggested that the quest for the causative SNP had to be won on points rather than by knockout. Their criteria for validating causality included linkage analysis and LD mapping  positional cloning  selection of candidate genes  DNA sequencing  and statistical analysis. Their conclusion was that only an array of evidence can establish proof of causality. The critical test will be concordance and functional validation. In this setting  the CLD test may provide considerable evidence for a causative SNP  especially when a concordance test cannot be applied  but due to its high p-value  functional evidence will be needed to definitely conclude whether the SNP is causative or not.

Direct genomic values were estimated for German Holstein cattle with a genomic BLUP model including a residual polygenic effect. A total of 17 429 genotyped Holstein bulls were evaluated using the phenotypes of 44 traits. The Interbull genomic validation test was implemented to investigate how the inclusion of a residual polygenic effect impacted genomic estimated breeding values. As the number of reference bulls increased  both the variance of the estimates of single nucleotide polymorphism effects and the reliability of the direct genomic values of selection candidates increased. Fitting a residual polygenic effect in the model resulted in less biased genome-enhanced breeding values and decreased the correlation between direct genomic values and estimated breeding values of sires in the reference population. Genetic evaluation of dairy cattle enhanced with genomic information is highly effective in increasing reliability  as well as using large genomic reference populations. We found that fitting a residual polygenic effect reduced the bias in genome-enhanced breeding values  decreased the correlation between direct genomic values and sire's estimated breeding values and made genome-enhanced breeding values more consistent in mean and variance as is the case for pedigree-based estimated breeding values. With the availability of the bovine genome sequence and the development of high-density arrays of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers  the accuracy of genetic predictions has improved compared to conventional breeding value estimations based on phenotypic data and pedigree []. In order to model genetic variation for quantitative traits  Meuwissen et al. [] have proposed a genetic evaluation model that includes a large number of SNP markers simultaneously. This genomic model assumes that  all the loci that affect the trait are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one SNP marker and thus marker genotypes can be used as predictors for breeding values. A main advantage of the availability of genome-enhanced breeding values (GEBV) in dairy cattle comes from the improved accuracy in pre-selecting animals for breeding. Therefore  more and more countries have been implementing genomic evaluations in dairy cattle breeding. The genomic BLUP model  which has been used to include high-density SNP data in most of the dairy cattle applications []  assumes that all SNP contribute equally to the genetic variance  because field data results support the infinitesimal model [    ]. The reliability of genomic predictions strongly depends on the number of genotyped bulls in the reference population that is used to estimate SNP effects [  ]. The increase in genomic reliability appears to be approximately linearly correlated with the number of reference bulls []. However  little is known on how the size of reference populations impacts the estimation of SNP effects. A German national genomic dataset has been used to study this question. Genomic models [    ] usually assume that a given SNP marker chip  such as the Illumina Bovine54K (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA)  explains all the genetic variation of a trait  and as a consequence no residual polygenic effect (RPG) is typically fitted in genomic prediction [    ]. Fitting the RPG effect can account for the fact that SNP markers may not explain all the genetic variance [    ]. Including the RPG effect in the genomic model can also render the estimates of SNP effect less biased and more persistent over generations []. To investigate the impact of including an RPG effect on genomic prediction  a larger dataset from the EuroGenomics reference population [] was used. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) the impact of the size of a genomic reference population using German reference bulls on the estimation of SNP effects and on direct genomic values (DGV) and (2) the impact of including an RPG effect on the accuracy of genomic prediction using EuroGenomics reference bulls. Holstein bulls from the German national genomic reference population originating partially from the national genome project GenoTrack and partially from routinely genotyped populations  were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine50k (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA). The genotyping was conducted after ethnical review and approval by the project committee. Only SNP with a minor allele frequency greater than 1% and a call rate threshold greater than 95% i.e. 45 181 SNP were used for the analysis. Since male animals have only one allele for the 533 markers on chromosome X  the procedure to estimate marker effects developed for markers with two alleles was modified for these SNP. A genotyped animal was excluded if less than 95% of all SNP markers were called. Deregressed EBV (DRP) and effective daughter contributions (EDC) were obtained from the January 2010 German national conventional evaluation for all bulls. Forty-four traits from seven trait groups were analysed: milk production (three traits)  udder health (one trait)  functional longevity (one trait)  calving (four traits)  female fertility (six traits)  workability (four traits) and conformation (25 traits). Table  shows the number of genotyped bulls per year of birth in the analyzed reference and validation sets. A total of 10 487 animals were genotyped. The reference bull population for milk yield comprised 5 025 German Holstein bulls. To validate the genomic evaluation system  genotyped bulls born between September 2003 and December 2004 were used for validation  and 3 676 genotyped bulls born before September 2003 were used to estimate SNP effects. To compute DGV of validation bulls  the estimated SNP effects multiplied by genotype were summed  which were then combined with the conventional pedigree index from the reference population using the pseudo-record BLUP method [  ] to derive GEBV. Subsequently  the combined GEBV of the validation bulls were compared with their actual deregressed EBV to validate the genomic model and to check the consistency of the genetic trend and variance based on GEBV versus EBV according to the Interbull genomic validation test procedure []. Realised reliabilities for the pedigree-based EBV and the combined GEBV of the validation bulls were computed as the square of observed correlations with deregressed EBV  adjusted for the average reliability of the conventional EBV of their daughters []. The gain in reliability from genomic information was calculated as the difference between the realised reliability of the pedigree-based EBV and the combined GEBV of the validation bulls. To investigate the impact of including an RPG effect on GEBV  another dataset was used  which originated from the EuroGenomics collaboration []. This dataset comprised 17 429 genotyped Holstein bulls  representing 21.4 million daughters from the EuroGenomics countries i.e. France  Germany  Nordic countries and The Netherlands []. The total number of genotyped animals in the German Holstein population  including domestic candidates  was 26 191. Deregressed Multiple Across Country Evaluation (MACE) EBV from the April 2010 Interbull evaluation were used as dependent variables. In order to apply the Interbull genomic validation test []  the genotyped bulls were divided into two groups: 14 494 reference bulls born before September 2003 and 1 377 German national validation bulls born between September 2003 and December 2004. The GEBV and parental average of pedigree-based EBV of the validation bulls were compared to their actual deregressed MACE EBV to evaluate the predictive ability of the genomic model. To investigate the impact of including an RPG effect on genomic predictions  three different percentages of residual polygenic variance to total genetic variance were considered  5%  10% and 15%. These three scenarios were compared to a scenario with a very small residual polygenic variance by setting the heritability of the RPG effect to 0.0001 []  which was equivalent to 0.02% of the total genetic variance for milk yield. In order to determine the optimal residual polygenic variance for each trait in the German Holstein breed  a genomic validation study was conducted according to the Interbull genomic validation test []  in which SNP effects were estimated using genotypic and phenotypic information of older bulls and the resulting GEBV of younger validation bulls were compared to their daughters' actual performance  i.e. deregressed EBV of the validation bulls. Observed regression coefficients of validation bulls' DRP on GEBV were compared to their expected value of 1. The scenario with observed regression coefficients close or equal to the expectation of 1 was chosen as the one with the most optimal residual polygenic variance. In the literature [  ]  some concern has been raised that  under the BLUP genomic model  estimated SNP marker effects may model mainly family relationships. Solberg et al. [] have suggested fitting an RPG effect to reduce this problem. In order to investigate whether incorporation of an RPG effect into the genomic model would reduce the correlation of animal DGV with EBV of sires in reference population  milk yield was analysed for the scenarios of residual polygenic variance of 0.02%  5%  10% and 20%. The following BLUP SNP model was applied to the DRP of reference bulls: Where is the DRP of bull    is a general mean  is the RPG effect of bull    is the number of fitted SNP  is a genotype indicator (-1 or 1 for the two homozygotes and 0 for the heterozygote) of marker  of bull   is the random regression coefficient for marker   and is the residual effect of bull . The total additive genetic variance    was obtained from a conventional pedigree-based analysis  e.g. for milk production traits [] and for female fertility traits []  and was partitioned into two components: the residual polygenic variance   where  is the proportion of additive genetic variance explained by the RPG effect  and additive genetic variance explained by the  markers . We assumed that all markers contribute equal genetic variance. The proportion of residual polygenic variance  was assumed to vary across traits. The optimal  value was determined by applying the Interbull genomic validation test []. Residual variance associated with the deregressed EBV was   where  is the error variance obtained from the pedigree-based evaluation and is the EDC for bull . The RPG was fitted in the same way as in conventional genetic evaluations  i.e. using full pedigree and the same grouping procedures of phantom parents []. Since the BLUP SNP model (1) has a large number of parameters  i.e. SNP effects that need to be estimated simultaneously  a Gauss-Seidel iteration with residual updating [] was applied to estimate all the effects of model (1). To further improve convergence  the SNP were processed in descending order of heterozygosity. Table  shows the results of genomic validation based on the national genomic and phenotypic data of German Holstein cattle. Gains in reliability were high in general  due to the large reference population  except for fertility and calving traits. For the three milk production traits  the gain in reliability was about 30%  with the highest gain found for fat yield. Low heritability traits  such as fertility traits and stillbirth  had the lowest gain in reliability  which can be partially explained by the fact that reliabilities of conventional EBV of the reference bulls were much lower than for other traits. The realised gains in reliability of conformation traits ranged between 10% and 28%. When the genomic reference population for German Holstein cattle was switched from the German national to the EuroGenomics reference population  the number of reference bulls increased from 5 025 to 17 429. Additionally  the dependent variable DRP was derived from MACE EBV  which included phenotypic information from foreign countries  in contrast to German national EBV. In comparison to the validation results from the German national reference population in Table   when the larger EuroGenomics reference population was used the gain in reliability over pedigree-based EBV was 12% greater on average across four of the analyzed traits  protein yield  somatic cell score  udder depth and non-return rate. A significant gain in genomic reliability has also been reported in another genomic validation study using the EuroGenomics reference population []. During the development of the German genomic evaluation system  a number of test runs were conducted over time  which enabled a comparison of the estimates of SNP effects across different reference populations. Table  shows the comparison among estimates of SNP effects for milk yield from eight genomic test runs  differing in the number of reference bulls. Because only a few young reference bulls added some daughter information over the time period of the test runs  the difference in phenotypic information on bulls already genotyped was neglected when interpreting the results in Table . As the number of reference bulls increased from 735 to 5 025  the observed variance of the SNP effect estimates increased more than five times. The estimate for the SNP with the largest effect increased continuously  up to 4.13 fold  as the size of the reference population increased. As expected  the correlation of SNP effect estimates was higher between any two runs  when the numbers of genotyped bulls were similar. Note that the correlation of SNP effect estimates is much lower than the correlation of DGV which was close to 1 for the reference bulls (unpublished data). It can be seen that even under the BLUP genomic model assuming equal variance for all markers  effect estimates can vary greatly between markers  and even more when new genotyped animals are added to the reference population. Table  shows the correlations between DGV estimates from the most recent genomic evaluations (February 2010) with the largest reference population of 5 025 bulls and DGV from each of the previous test runs. For all selection candidates  born between 2006 and 2009 and for which no phenotypic information was available  correlations between DGV increased from 0.824 to 0.993 as the number of reference bulls increased from 1 939 to 4 896. Candidates with sires included in both reference populations had somewhat higher DGV correlations than those without a genotyped sire in the reference population; however this difference in DGV correlations almost disappeared when the number of reference bulls reached 4 896. When bulls changed from candidate to reference individuals from one run to the next  the correlations between their DGV were much lower  ranging from 0.72 to 0.875  as expected. The increase in DGV correlations due to the inclusion of more reference bulls clearly shows that the genomic prediction for candidates becomes more consistent with an increasingly larger reference population. Estimated SNP effects from three scenarios using the EuroGenomics reference population were compared to the scenario with the lowest residual polygenic variance for milk yield (Table ). The correlation of SNP effect estimates decreased only marginally with an increasing difference in residual polygenic variance assumed in the genomic model. Correlations were greater than 0.9  except for the correlation between the two most different scenarios with 0.02% and 20% residual polygenic variance (i.e. 0.86). As the residual polygenic variance increased  the variance of SNP effect estimates and the value of the estimate for the SNP with the largest effect decreased. Similar results were also obtained for all the other traits (data not shown). Table  shows the observed variance of estimated DGV defined as the sum of SNP marker effects and the variance of DGVt  which was defined as the sum of DGV and the estimate of the residual polygenic effect  and their correlations with conventional EBV for the reference bulls. It can be seen that the correlation between DGV and EBV decreased and the correlation between DGVt and EBV increased slightly with increasing residual polygenic variance. The variance of DGV estimates was also significantly lower for the scenarios with the higher residual polygenic variance. However  the observed variance of DGVt remained constant  indicating that the information lost from the DGV was captured by the residual polygenic effect for the reference bulls. For all scenarios  regressions of conventional EBV or DRP on DGV or RPG were unity for the reference bulls  and the regression intercepts were very close to zero (results not shown). The estimates of RPG effects and DGV were positively correlated for milk yield  with somewhat higher correlations for the scenarios with a higher percentage of residual polygenic variance  e.g. 0.42 and 0.47 for 5% and 20% residual polygenic variance respectively. Following the Interbull genomic validation test procedure []  conventional deregressed EBV of the validation bulls were compared to their DGV or combined GEBV estimates  which were calculated based on the reduced subset of the reference population. Table  shows the correlations observed between deregressed EBV  without adjusting for the reliability contributed by the daughters' performance  and DGV or GEBV estimates for the validation bulls. These correlations were high  indicating a high reliability of the genomic evaluation with 14 494 reference bulls. The correlations between DGV and deregressed EBV decreased as the polygenic variance increased  especially for milk yield. In contrast  the correlations between GEBV and deregressed EBV decreased less when the polygenic variance increased or remained constant  e.g. around 0.72 for somatic cell score. Based on the relatively small decrease in correlations between DRP and DGV or GEBV  we can conclude that the impact of the assumed percentage of residual polygenic variance on accuracy is limited. Regression of conventional deregressed EBV of the validation bulls on their GEBV based on phenotypic information from previous generations can identify some possible biases of a genomic evaluation model []. The intercept of the linear regression model was not significantly different from zero for all traits. The estimate of the regression slope was nearly unity for the validation population according to the validation procedure []. A regression slope estimate that is lower (higher) than its expected value indicates that the variance of the GEBV is too high (too low). According to the regression slope estimates in Table   the optimal percentage of residual polygenic variance seems to vary across traits. For traits with a high heritability or reliability  e.g. production traits  somatic cell score  stature and rump angle  the optimal residual polygenic variance appeared to be less than 5%. For the conformation traits  rump width and body conditional score  10% or higher residual polygenic variances gave the least biased GEBV estimates. Genomic validation results have revealed that either fitting a residual polygenic effect in the BLUP SNP model or blending the G matrix with the pedigree relationship matrix A in the G-matrix BLUP model [    ] was necessary to avoid over-prediction of candidates' GEBV. The optimal proportion of genetic variance assigned to the RPG effect or the optimal weight on matrix A varies across traits. As a result  a trait-specific residual polygenic variance was assumed in routine genomic evaluations for German Holstein cattle. The magnitude of the assumed polygenic variance had a minor effect on the correlation between GEBV and deregressed EBV for selection candidates (Table ); however  the variance of GEBV decreased significantly with increasing residual polygenic variance. Including the RPG effect in the genomic model (1) provided a similar scale of variances for GEBV and EBV  making them more comparable and consequently resulting in a more accurate joint ranking of genomic selection candidates and proven bulls. However  the problem of optimal partitioning of the additive genetic variance between the residual polygenic and SNP-based components is not resolved. More appropriate statistical methods  such as REML or Bayesian methods []  should be used to estimate the residual polygenic variance  preferably also including non-genotyped animals. A concern that under the genomic BLUP model  animals' DGV are highly correlated with the sires' EBV [  ] was addressed in this study by fitting an RPG effect with varying residual polygenic variances: 0.02%  5%  10% and 20% of the total genetic variance for milk yield. The DGV or the sum of DGV and RPG of 11 978 reference bulls that had genotyped sires in the reference population  were regressed on the conventional EBV of their 580 sires that were also included in the genomic reference population. The corresponding R values indicate the fraction of the sons' genetic variation that is explained by their sires and are shown in Figure  for the genomic models with different residual polygenic variances for milk yield. When the RPG effect was given a nearly zero variance i.e. 0.02%  the R value was 0.42 for both DGV and the sum. As the residual polygenic effect increased to 20% of the total genetic variance  the R value between the DGV of the son and the EBV of the sire dropped below 0.20. In contrast to DGV  corresponding R values for the sum of DGV and RPG remained constant  regardless of the level of residual polygenic variance. Figure  shows the influence of the sires' EBV on the DGV of validation bulls. The R values of the regression of DGV on the sires' EBV dropped from 0.29 for the scenario with a 0.02% residual polygenic variance to about 0.10 for the scenario with a 20% residual polygenic variance  suggesting a decreasing impact of the sires' EBV on the DGV of validation bulls. With increasing residual polygenic variances  R values decreased much less for combined GEBV of the validation bulls than for DGV alone  because in the combined GEBV the influence of sires was added back via the pedigree index. By fitting an RPG effect in the genomic model  the estimated DGV were less dependent on the sire's EBV  which was indicated by the lower R value of the DGV regression on sire's EBV. The two figures showed that fitting an RPG effect in a genomic model can reduce the correlation between sires' EBV and animals' DGV. . . Convergence of the BLUP SNP model was improved when the SNP markers were processed in descending order of heterozygosity. The processing order was particularly important when some reference bulls with extremely high or low EBV happened to have extremely high EDC  because those extreme phenotypic values could lead to extreme regression estimates of SNP markers with a low heterozygosity and thus could cause a convergence problem in the estimation of SNP effects. For the currently and most widely used 54 K Illumina BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA)  we observed that SNP effects did not converge as well as their sum  i.e. DGV. Due to higher LD  convergence of SNP effects could become even lower for a higher density chip  although the convergence of DGV should remain unchanged. An alternative modelling of marker information from high-density chips should be explored. The tremendous advances in conventional genetic evaluations during the last decades have formed a solid basis for genomic evaluation and selection in dairy cattle. Genomic validation studies worldwide have demonstrated that the genomic model proposed by Meuwissen et al. [] is highly effective to increase the reliability of evaluations in dairy cattle breeding. In this study  we have shown that the size of the genomic reference population is an important factor affecting the reliability of genomic prediction. Fitting a residual polygenic effect in the genomic model is necessary to avoid the variance of DGV being too high  to make the GEBV of candidates less biased  and to reduce the correlation between reference sires' EBV and animals' DGV.

However  the size and distribution of QTL effects and the size of reference populations still greatly influence the effectiveness of using sequence data for genomic prediction. Genomic selection (GS) is a method to predict breeding values in livestock; however the underlying mechanism by which it predicts is not fully clear. The initial premise of GS was that it was based on the predicted effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with markers []. However  there is increasing evidence that GS also relies on \"relationships\" between individuals to accurately predict genetic values []  because genomic predictions are more accurate when predicted individuals are more closely related to a reference population. Given this debate  a better understanding of what GS is actually predicting is relevant for several reasons. First  the LD/QTL paradigm suggests that accurate predictions of breeding values will persist for several generations into the future allowing for a reduced number of phenotypic measurements []. Furthermore  it assumes that higher marker densities may allow for the prediction of breeding values across breeds [] In contrast  if the relationship paradigm is true  then the predictive ability based on genomic data would persist only for one or two generations ahead. Therefore  continuous measurements of phenotypes of individuals that are related to selection candidates would be needed. The LD/QTL model has been further challenged by the observation that for many traits only a small part of the additive genetic variance is explained by variation at known QTL [  ]. Consequently  Fearnhead et al. [] noted that inconsistencies often exist between high estimates of heritability and the small proportion of total genetic variance explained by QTL and they proposed that a rare variant model might explain this \"missing heritability\". These results from whole-genome analysis studies have raised questions about the true model underlying (quantitative) genetic variation which is still largely unknown. The potential models underlying additive genetic variation range from an infinitesimal model based on the action of very many genes  each with a very small effect [] to a model based on a small number of genes having a large effect and many genes having a near zero effect (QTL model). Although experimental data is needed to provide more evidence about the true model underlying genetic variation  simulation can be used to explore the behaviour of various prediction methods used in genomic selection. Prediction methods vary in how much they allow individual loci to contribute to variation. The gBLUP method assumes equal variance across all loci []. In contrast  the Bayes B approach allows the marker loci to explain different amounts of variation  with only a small number of loci having an effect and many loci having no effect []. Therefore  each of these methods is expected to be suited to different models of variation. For example  gBLUP is expected to be suited to infinitesimal model assumptions and the Bayes B model is expected to be best suited to assumptions made by the QTL model. The question is whether the performance of each prediction method is dependent upon the true underlying genetic model  and whether these methods are robust against changes to the model of variation. Previously  it has been shown that while assuming the infinitesimal model over the short term  the traditional BLUP method (covariance defined by pedigree relationships) is quite robust against drastic deviations from that model []. Conversely  it is unknown how well the Bayes B method will perform when the true model of variation is more \"infinitesimal\". The objectives of this research were to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of genomic methods used for genomic selection under various underlying genetic models and marker densities and for these various models to compare the accuracy of genomic selection when the validation individuals were one generation  several generations  or one sub-population removed from the prediction animals. Genotype simulations were conducted using the Markovian Coalescence Simulator (MaCS) [] to simulate 1 000 base haplotypes. Thirty chromosomes each with base haplotypes of 100 cM (1 · 10 base pairs) were simulated with a per site mutation rate of 2.5 · 10. The total number of SNP segregating on the genome was approximately 1 670 000 (SNP sequence). Sixty thousand SNP markers and 5 000 SNP markers were randomly selected from all SNP in the genome sequence and these markers were used in the 60K and 5K analyses respectively. To give the simulation a realistic population structure  we simulated a population with an effective size of 100 and with historical Ne 1 000 years  10 000 years and 100 000 years ago equal to 1 256  4 350 and 43 500  respectively  which were loosely based on estimates by Villa-Angulo et al. [] for Holstein cattle. The base population haplotypes were randomly allocated to 200 base male and 1 000 base female animals of a simulated population structure  with 10 subsequent generations receiving these haplotypes via mendelian inheritance  allowing recombination to occur according to the genetic distance  i.e. 1% recombination frequency per cM. The pedigree was split into two divergent lines each with 10 generations and each generation containing 1 000 individuals i.e. 500 males and 500 females. Ten percent of the males were randomly selected and randomly mated to all females. Each female had two offspring per generation. The different models used to simulate the additive genetic variation were: 1) the QTL model (QM) with 100  1 000 and 10 000 QTL  2) a rare variant model (RM) with 100 and 1 000 QTL  the infinitesimal model (IM) and a traditional polygenic model. Heritability () for all models was 0.3. The true breeding value () of each animal was determined using: where  is the additive effect of QTL genotype () and  is the QTL genotype at locus  which is coded as 0  1  or 2 and is the number of copies of the QTL that an individual () carries. Each QTL was randomly chosen from all segregating SNPs in the base generation. For both the QM and RM  all of the genetic variance was explained by QTL. The effect of each QTL was drawn from a gamma distribution with a shape and scale of 0.4 and 1.66 respectively [] and had a 50% chance of being positive or negative. All simulation parameters were common to both the QTL and rare variant models  however  under the RM all QTL were assigned to SNP markers with an allele frequency <0.01. Each SNP had a 3% chance of being used as a marker and a 0.05% chance of being used as a QTL. The true breeding value () of each animal was again determined using: where  is the additive effect of genotype () and  is the genotype at locus  which is coded as 0  1  or 2 and is the number of copies of the QTL that an individual () carries. All of the SNP in this model were given an effect drawn from a normal distribution and had a 50% chance of being positive or negative. To ensure that the heritability of the QTL  rare variant and infinitesimal scenarios remained constant  the residual variance was scaled relative to the variance of the breeding values of individuals in the base generation  which was given by: where  is a vector of breeding values of individuals in generation 1 and  is the number of individuals in that generation. The genetic values for the base individuals were simulated using a traditional polygenic simulation model which uses the formula: where z is a random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution z~ N(1 0) and  is the genetic standard deviation. The breeding values for the subsequent generations were obtained using the following equation: where  and  are the parental breeding values and  is a term for Mendelian sampling given by  where  is the average inbreeding coefficient of the parents of individual  and  is the genetic variance. Three methods were used to estimate breeding values: 1) Bayes B as described by Meuwissen et al. []  which uses a model that assumes that only a proportion of the loci explain the total genetic variance and that many markers explain zero variance. The statistical model for the implementation of Bayes B can be written as  where  is the phenotype of animal   µ is the overall mean   is the number of marker loci   is the marker genotype at locus  which is coded as 0  1  or 2 and is the number of copies of the SNP allele that individual () carries   is the allele substitution effect at locus    is a 0/1 variable indicating the absence (with probability p) or presence (with probability 1 - p) of locus  in the model  and  is the random residual effect. The value for parameter p was 0.95. The genetic variance was fixed to the value resulting from the data simulation and the value for the residual variance was estimated from the data. Marker effects  were estimated by computing means of the posterior distribution resulting from a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) and was implemented using AlphaBayes []. For each replicate within each scenario  a burn-in period of 20 000 cycles was used before saving samples from each of an additional 40 000 MCMC cycles  therefore using a total of 60 000 MCMC cycles. The genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) for animal  in the test set was estimated as: where  is the mean effect at locus  obtained from the post-burn in samples. 2) gBLUP  which assumes an equal variance for each marker and uses a genomic relationships matrix among all individuals in a reference set and a test set allowing it to compute variance components and best linear unbiased predictions (BLUP) from a mixed model. This was achieved by replacing the pedigree-based relationship matrix with the genomic relationship matrix (G) estimated from SNP marker genotypes to define the covariance among breeding values. As in Hayes et al. []  we assumed a model  where  is a vector of phenotypes  µ is the mean  1  is a vector of 1s  Z is a design matrix allocating records to breeding values   is a vector of breeding values for animals in the reference set and the test set and  is a vector of random normal deviates ~. Furthermore  where G is the genomic relationship matrix  and  is the genetic variance for this model. The genomic relationship matrix was formed as defined in VanRaden []; where M is the incidence matrix that specifies which alleles each individual inherited; the frequency of the second allele at locus  is    and the matrix P contains the allele frequencies expressed as a difference from 0.5 and multiplied by 2  such that column  of P is 2( - 0.5). Subtraction of P from M gives Z  which sets the expected value of  to 0. Subtraction of P gives more credit to rare alleles than to common alleles when calculating genomic relationships. Therefore G = ZZ'/[2<U+2211>(1 - )]. The division by 2<U+2211>(1 - ) makes G analogous to the numerator relationship matrix (A). 3) Traditional BLUP which ignores genomic data and relies on information from ancestors using a numerator relationship matrix (A). This method uses the same model as gBLUP (above) however with the vector of additive genetic values  replaced by   with  where A is the numerator relationship matrix and  is the additive genetic variance. Variance components for both BLUP methods were estimated with ASREML [] and the model solutions yielded estimated breeding values. The accuracy of the estimated breeding values in the test set was calculated as the correlation between estimated and true breeding values. Three reference populations (2 000 individuals) were assigned to test the effect of varying the relationships between animals in the reference population and test population  each time using generation 10 of line 1 (1 000 individuals) as the test set. Reference set: 1) Generations 8 and 9 of line 1  were used to observe the effect of using closely related animals in the test and reference populations; 2) Generations 1 and 2 of line 1  were used to test divergent relationships; and 3) Generations 8 and 9 of line 2  were used to represent a different strain or closely related breed. Each method used phenotypes from the reference populations to estimate the breeding value of individuals in the test set. Eight replicates were performed and the estimated genetic values for each method were compared to the simulated true genetic values. The traditional BLUP method acted as a control using the entire pedigree  however only individuals from each respective reference population had phenotypes. Whole-genome SNP sequence data was used for both genomic methods; gBLUP and Bayes B. Genotype data on all ~1.67 million SNPs were used and the Bayes B method was implemented with p = 0.998 so that a similar number of SNP were included in the model as with 60 000 markers  i.e. ~ 3 000. Average SNP effects were estimated in reference populations 1 and 2 to predict the genetic value of individuals in the 10 generation of line 1. The gBLUP method was also implemented using SNP sequence data. A genomic relationship matrix was formed (as above) using all SNP on each chromosome  each separate matrix was then weighted according to the proportion of the total SNP to give an averaged whole-genome relationship matrix. Phenotypic data from animals in reference populations 1 and 2 were used to predict the genetic value of individuals in the 10 generation of line 1. The Bayes B method gave a more accurate prediction of breeding value than gBLUP and was robust against the changes to the underlying model of genetic variation. It had the highest accuracy of the estimated breeding value in both the QM and RM (Table ). The highest accuracy was achieved by the Bayes B method when genetic variation was controlled by a few QTL with relatively large effects (100 QTL). Also under the RM  the Bayes B method gave a more accurate prediction of breeding value than gBLUP and BLUP especially when only a few QTL controlled variation. Although Bayes B was not significantly better than gBLUP under the 1 000 RM there was a distinct trend that Bayes B predicted breeding value more accurately than gBLUP. As the model of variation became more polygenic  the superiority of Bayes B decreased  however its predictive accuracy was not significantly different to that of gBLUP  even under the infinitesimal and polygenic models. The accuracy of the gBLUP method was less dependent on the various genetic models. gBLUP performed as well as Bayes B when variation was controlled by the infinitesimal model. It also performed competitively when variation was controlled by common variants under the QTL models  but the accuracy of breeding value prediction under the QTL models was lower than that achieved by Bayes B. Similarly under the RM model  gBLUP did not predict genetic values as accurately as Bayes B. However it was significantly better than traditional BLUP under the QM scenarios  the infinitesimal model and the RM with 100 rare variants and it also tended to be more accurate under the RM with 1 000 rare variants. When genetic variation was controlled by QTL with large  moderate or small effects  traditional BLUP was the least accurate method to predict breeding values. However  under the traditional polygenic model in reference population 1  BLUP was the most effective method to predict breeding values. The accuracy of predicting breeding values significantly decreased for both genomic evaluation methods when animals became less related (using reference populations 2 and 3) (Tables  and ). With large QTL effects  prediction accuracy persisted over many generations when using Bayes B to predict breeding values. Similarly gBLUP was also able to predict a small proportion of the variation in breeding values in unrelated individuals. Using reference populations 2 and 3  traditional BLUP was unable to accurately predict breeding values of animals in the test set when the reference population consisted of distantly related animals. However  when variation was modelled as the traditional polygenic model based on pedigree relationships  all of the methods were unable to estimate breeding values for the distantly related individuals. The accuracy of estimating breeding values was higher when marker density was increased to whole-genome SNP sequence data (Table ). When comparing Tables  and  with Table   the largest gains were observed when sequence information was used in both of the 100 QTL and 1 000 QTL models. Similarly  sequence data increased the ability of Bayes B to predict breeding values after many generations (reference population 2)  increasing the accuracy by 5% for the 1 000 QTL model. Figure  illustrates that as the number of QTL increased  the accuracy advantage of using this sequence data decreased. Indeed when 10 000 QTL controlled genetic variation  the accuracy of prediction only increased by 1 percent from 0.57 using 60 000 markers to 0.58 using SNP sequence data and when the variation was controlled by the infinitesimal model there was no significant difference between 60 000 markers and sequence data. Similarly  the inclusion of sequence information had very little effect on the accuracy of prediction using gBLUP under all simulated models of variation. . We have found that the Bayes B method was the most accurate method to predict breeding values and was the most robust against changes to the model underlying genetic variation. Previously  Meuwissen et al. [] and Habier et al. [] have obtained similar results to those observed in this study  whereas Daetwyler et al. [] reported that in some instances gBLUP predicted more accurate breeding values than Bayes B. The current study has shown that even under infinitesimal assumptions when all SNP explain small amounts of variation  and even when there is an absence of detectable QTL effects  Bayes B will perform as well as gBLUP. A possible explanation is that under the IM and the traditional polygenic model  the Bayes B method will use information from a number of selected SNPs  and although the effects may be poorly estimated and a random set of markers is used  the resulting prediction is similar to gBLUP. Habier et al. [] have shown that gBLUP is equivalent to a mixed model fitting all marker loci with equal variance (RR BLUP) and a genomic relationship matrix based on a subset of markers  as selected in the Bayes B method  may be a reasonable approximation of the genomic relationship matrix based on all markers []. In essence  the Bayes B method may estimate the relationships of animals based on a weighted subset of SNP  with weights derived from the variance explained at each locus. In the analysis using Bayes B  p was set to 0.95 for all models and keeping this constant may have influenced the results for Bayes B. Given that many QTL had small effects in the 10 000 QTL model and in the infinitesimal model  it would have been very difficult to estimate the QTL that had non-zero effect sizes. There has been some recent work by Habier et al. [] regarding the estimation of p using Bayesian methods (referred to as Bayes Cp) where p is jointly estimated in the analysis. However  there is little empirical evidence about the estimation of p when using the Bayes B method. The Bayes B analysis used in this study also required the genetic variance for the trait to be provided and in this case  we used the true genetic variance. This may have biased the results to favour Bayes B; however  the estimated genetic variance obtained from REML was very similar to the true genetic variance and this estimated variance can be used in the Bayes B analysis when the true genetic variance is unknown. The extent of the differences between gBLUP and Bayes B was largely dependent on the model of genetic variation used to simulate the underlying variation. Similarly to Meuwissen et al. []  high accuracies were observed when genetic values were predicted under the QM with few QTL having large effects. This model favoured the Bayes B approach and both GS methods were able to predict genetic values accurately over the different reference population scenarios. However  the accuracies achieved for the 100 QTL model are rarely observed when GS is used to predict breeding values in 'real' populations of this size (reference populations of 2 000 animals) and accuracies are commonly closer to 0.5 []. Moreover  results from dairy cattle data analysis show that gBLUP and Bayes B achieve very similar accuracies for most traits [  ]  as seen when more than 1 000 QTL were simulated. This suggests that in many cases  the model of variation in real populations may be controlled by many genes and behave somewhat like the model with many small QTL effects controlling variation. The size and distribution of the QTL effects controlled the effectiveness of both GS methods. Given that all QTL effects in the RM and QM were sampled from a gamma distribution  there were fewer QTL actually responsible for large proportions of the genetic variance. In the 100 QTL model  the top 10 QTL explained 80% of the genetic variance and the largest QTL explained 25% of the variation. For the 1 000 QTL model  the largest QTL explained 5% of the genetic variation and the top 20 QTL explained 50% of the genetic variation. In the 10 000 QTL model  the largest QTL explained 1% of the variation and the top 100 QTL explained 30% of the variation. For the traditional polygenic model  no QTL were simulated  therefore both methods relied on estimates of pedigree relationships to accurately estimate breeding values. Results from the simulated traditional polygenic model were also somewhat unrealistic  as there was no link between genotypes and phenotypes other than pedigree information. This bias towards pedigree information allowed traditional BLUP to outperform the GS methods. However  this model was useful to show that Bayes B also uses pedigree information to explain a proportion of breeding value in absence of any detectable QTL. The results of the RM appeared to be highly variable  and a low accuracy was found especially for the gBLUP and BLUP methods. The estimates of heritability (Table ) were highly variable and generally lower than under the QM  IM and polygenic models  resulting in lower accuracy of prediction. As a consequence of all variants being rare and with relatively high allele substitution effects  changes in the frequency of these alleles had a large effect on the overall genetic variance in the population. These low allele frequencies of QTL in generation 1 made it easy to \"lose\" variation due to drift under the RM which  led to large fluctuations in the results. This suggests that this model is unlikely to explain additive genetic variation  especially with all genetic variation being additive  as simulated in this study. However  in spite of all of the QTL being rare in this model  and therefore difficult to detect  Bayes B could predict a substantial amount of genetic variation with genetic markers  similar to the QM. The accuracy of across-line or across-breed prediction can depend on the similarity between different populations or the extent of the divergence between two populations [  ]. When using Bayes B  the estimation of breeding values for individuals that were many generations apart or across different lines may be possible when variation is controlled by a small number of QTL with large effects. However  as the number of QTL increases this ability to predict breeding values decreases. Although gBLUP does not predict the breeding values for these unrelated individuals as accurately as Bayes B  it still relies on QTL information to better predict the relationships between animals  since it is able to predict a proportion of breeding value in both reference populations 2 and 3 under the IM  whereas under the polygenic model this accuracy was zero. A larger divergence between breeds and limited LD across the two populations is expected to lead to less accurate across-breed prediction of breeding values from genomic data []. The overall prediction of breeding values rely on the degree of relationship between the predicted individuals and those in the reference population because the less related the predicted individuals were to those in the reference population  the lower the accuracy of prediction. This has important implications for breeding programs. If there are QTL with large effects  then accurate predictions may persist over generations  but long term predictions may not be as accurate when variation is controlled by a larger number of genes. Therefore  the larger the number of small genes controlling variation the more important it is that animals included in the reference population are genetically more related to selection candidates. Additionally continuous updating of the reference population will be needed to maintain an accurate level of genomic prediction over generations. Much debate has arisen around the effect of marker density on GS prediction accuracy. Low density marker panels may be cheaper and more cost effective for use in livestock prediction. Higher marker densities are expected to be more accurate  with sequence data expected to give the highest accuracy. For example  Yang et al. [] have suggested that in human studies a low amount of LD may be a cause of inaccurate estimates of genetic values for lower density SNP panels. In our study  we used a population with a much lower effective size than in humans (therefore having a higher LD). A 5k SNP panel appeared to give significantly lower accuracy of breeding value  likely due to insufficient LD  with such large distances between SNPs. However  it appeared that with this simulated effective population size (Ne of 100)  most of the LD is accounted for by 60 000 markers  and only a very small increase in accuracy was achieved when using sequence data. Results from reference population 2 showed that  when predicting many generations ahead  i.e. as LD decreases  the advantage of using sequence data increases. The additional value of using sequence data over 60k markers in increasing accuracy of genomic breeding values was directly related to the size of simulated QTL effects. It was expected that sequence data would be very accurate as all QTL genotypes were included in the data and LD was no longer limiting the accuracy of the prediction. Meuwissen and Goddard [] have found very high accuracies of up to 0.97 under a model similar to our 100 QTL model. Our study shows that a lower accuracy is likely when there are more QTL each with a smaller effect  as Bayes B is unable to estimate smaller QTL effects accurately  as shown when all SNP control variation (IM). This suggests that if a trait is highly polygenic  then the additional value of using sequence data will be smaller in terms of increased accuracy of estimated breeding values. When marker density is high enough to account for LD  the accuracy of genomic selection will be largely limited by the size of the reference population. Our results suggest that Bayes B is a superior method to gBLUP to estimate breeding values from genomic data. The method accurately estimates breeding values under a model with large QTL effects  but even if QTL with larger effects are not evident  it gives a similar accuracy of prediction to those obtained using gBLUP. The underlying model of genetic variation greatly affects the predictive ability of genomic selection methods  and their superiority over BLUP prediction depends on the presence of QTL effects. The use of sequence data will outperform the less dense marker panels as long as QTL effects can be estimated accurately. However the size and distribution of QTL effects will still greatly influence the effectiveness of using sequence data in genomic prediction. If a trait is more polygenic  then the inclusion of sequence information may not increase the accuracy of breeding values unless the reference population is very large.

For genomic prediction to influence beef cattle breeding programs and the rate or cost of genetic gains  training analyses must be undertaken  and genomic prediction tools made available for breeders and other industry stakeholders. This paper reviews the nature or kind of studies currently underway  the scope or extent of some of those studies  and comments on the likely predictive value of genomic information for beef cattle improvement. Genetic improvement results from selection of above-average candidates as parents of the next generation. In a competitive market  above-average candidates would be those that improve consumer satisfaction  influencing immediate eating quality  purchase cost  long-term health implications of consumption  care of the environment in the production and processing of the beef; and welfare of the animals. Satisfied consumers demand and pay more for desirable beef  and under perfect competition this will be reflected along the production chain by increased farm-gate prices for cow-calf producers. Seedstock suppliers that sell bulls to cow-calf producers would be expected to respond by developing and implementing breeding programs that provide successive crops of bulls that outperform their predecessors. Inspection of genetic trends  e.g. [  ]  shows that beef cattle selection has resulted in animals with increased merit for early growth and improved rib eye area and marbling scores. There is no evidence for genetic improvement in reproductive performance. Selection has resulted in animals with larger mature size [] and greater cow maintenance requirements []  which increase production costs  as cow maintenance requirements are a major determinant of the total feed required in the production system []. Beef cattle selection has therefore failed in practice to achieve balanced improvement across the spectrum of traits that contribute to breeding goals. One reason has been our inability to cost-effectively rank selection candidates for all the attributes of interest []. This is the case because reliably quantifying the merits of animals in terms of their breeding values has been totally reliant on recording pedigree and performance information  primarily on the selection candidates themselves  their parents and perhaps their offspring. This has led to improvement programs that have been phenotype driven  i.e. programs that are focused on easy to measure traits that are recorded at young ages  such as early growth and ultrasound assessment of carcass attributes  rather than being goal driven and focused on all the attributes that influence consumer satisfaction []. The fundamental reason for this failure is that mixed model predictions of merit using the relationship matrix and applied to young animals can  with sufficient historical data  reliably predict the parent average (PA) effects  but are unable to predict the Mendelian sampling effects without having phenotypic observations on the individual or its descendants []. Accordingly  with only ancestral records  there is little information to discriminate among paternal half-sibs other than based on the merit of the dams. In that setting  it is seldom possible to identify young selection candidates with merit superior to existing selected sires. In the beef cattle context  this has led to low selection accuracy for mature size  lifetime reproductive performance  stayability/longevity  and disease resistance. Other important traits such as tenderness of beef  other aspects of eating quality  and feed efficiency  have had no prospects for selection as there are no phenotypic measures that can be readily and cost-effectively obtained on large numbers of seedstock animals. Molecular-based information has long held promise to improve the prediction of young animals by first using phenotypic markers  second using microsatellite markers  and most recently using ever-increasing densities of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Phenotypic markers such as blood groups were found to characterize the inheritance of certain chromosomal regions  proving useful for selection if that region contained a major gene responsible for variation in a trait of interest []. Unfortunately  there are insufficient simply inherited phenotypic attributes to characterize the entire genome. Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers provided new opportunities to find major genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) that influence important traits []. These markers that can have many alleles at each locus  can be informative in much of the population  and are well distributed along the genome. The offspring of any heterozygous parent can be segregated on the basis of marker information  to distinguish the marker haplotype inherited from each parent in a particular genomic region. Microsatellite genotyping was and is expensive and consequently many experiments lacked sufficient power to characterize regions well  and therefore detected only the largest effects []. Relatively few QTL were found that were useful for beef cattle improvement []  although many interesting scientific discoveries arose from these endeavors. Following the sequencing of the bovine genome  which led to the discovery of millions of bi-allelic SNP  and the creation of subsets of SNP that can characterize the genome and be multiplexed for cheap and efficient genotyping []  molecular-based studies to predict animal merit have been based on high-density SNP genotypes. This review documents the current status of whole-genome prediction of breeding merit in beef cattle and describes its implementation for the purposes of selection. The breeding objective comprises a list of traits that influence the breeding goal  along with their relative emphasis []. An ideal breeding objective would include all the traits that will in the future influence the breeding goal. A profit-based goal would motivate the list to include all attributes that will influence income or costs. For beef cattle  these clearly include: traits that influence productivity such as reproductive performance  growth rate and survival; traits that influence cost of production such as feed intake; and traits that influence product quality such as tenderness and taste. In recent times  the list of traits has been expanding to include attributes that have been externalities. These include traits that impact the long-term contribution of beef consumption on human healthfulness  such as factors that influence anemia  cancer  obesity  diabetes and heart disease; traits that influence the environment in its broadest context  comprising air quality  water quality  soil degradation  visual farm/feedlot appearance and competition with wildlife throughout the production  finishing and processing system; and welfare factors  both of the animals in terms of exhibiting natural behaviors and being free of disease  suffering  and mortality  and of the labor in terms of worker safety. In this context  the design of a beef cattle improvement program should holistically consider traits that influence production efficiency such as individual animal measures of inputs and outputs  traits that influence the quality of the eating experience  traits that influence animal health  and traits that influence the human healthfulness of the consumed beef. The tools available to the animal breeder to improve consumer satisfaction from beef include: the choice of breed  the choice of mating plan to exploit complementarities and heterosis  and selection for within-breed improvement []. The main tools for selection for within-breed improvement are the estimated breeding values (EBV) and corresponding indexes that arise from national cattle evaluations (NCE)  which are available in many countries and empowers genetic improvement within the seedstock sector []. In the absence of genotype-environment interactions that can occur when seedstock animals are managed in different and typically superior environments compared to those of commercial animals []  those gains are passed on to the commercial cow-calf sector by the sale of improved bulls (or semen) to be used as sires. The current focus of the use of genetic markers for genomic prediction is to improve within-breed selection  by increasing the accuracy of existing EBV by the time the selection candidate reaches puberty  or by providing new EBV for attributes that influence the breeding goal but have not been available from conventional performance recording. Other genomic analyses that will not be considered in this review include correct assignment of parents  identification of genetic diseases  detection of signatures of selection  prediction of breed composition of crossbred animals and identification of QTL. National cattle evaluations (NCE) in beef cattle began with measures of weight traits  and now include birth  weaning and yearling weights  and to a lesser extent mature weights. Rather than reporting EBV  US breed associations typically report Expected Progeny Differences (EPD)  that are one-half the EBV. A summary of the traits for which EPD are typically reported is in Table  for the 16 most prominent US beef cattle breeds. Calving ease has been added to most national evaluation systems and  like weaning weight  includes EPD that reflect direct and maternal contributions []. Carcass traits have typically been problematic to collect in seedstock herds  so most carcass information tends to come from ultrasound measures of rib-eye area (REA)  intramuscular fat (IMF) and fat depth []. Not all breed associations provide carcass EPD. Eating quality is principally limited to tenderness  but this is difficult to measure in most processing plants. In the US  carcass marbling has been used as a surrogate for tenderness/eating quality. More recently  QTL in the region of the calpain and calpastatin genes have been exploited for marker-assisted selection  using SNP that vary among breeds  most notably between  and  breeds. Reproductive measures have been difficult to evaluate since most breed associations have not used inventory recording systems until relatively recently  so it is impossible to determine if a female not represented as a dam actually calved or not []. Reproductive EPD have therefore been limited to scrotal circumference  and more recently  heifer pregnancy. There are no routine measures of input traits on a significant scale  as feed intake is problematic to measure  especially in grazing circumstances. Maintenance energy requirements have been predicted from knowledge on mature weight  condition score and milk production potential []. The concept of using high-density SNP genotypes to predict genetic merit was popularized by the landmark publication of Meuwissen . []. Their approach involved the computation of EBV for individual chromosome fragments  characterized by SNP genotypes or haplotypes. Estimated breeding values of selection candidates are subsequently obtained by summing up the values of all inherited chromosome fragments. This estimate is referred to as a molecular breeding value (MBV). A variety of methods has been proposed to derive EBV of chromosome fragments []  and these can be broadly categorized into methods that fit all SNP  and methods that use mixture models that assume that not all but a fraction of the SNP have effects on the trait. All methods can be reparameterized in terms of equations that fit animal genetic effects rather than SNP effects and obtain the MBV directly  using the inverse of a genomic-based rather than a pedigree-based relationship matrix in the mixed model equations []. The concept of genomic prediction using a genotype-based relationship matrix predates [] by several years []. In practice  so-called genomic training populations that are used to derive prediction equations  may be of inadequate size for reliable prediction of all but the largest chromosome fragments []  leading to predictions that account for just a fraction of the additive genetic variance []. In this circumstance  blending the MBV and the conventional PA will improve accuracy []. Given the genotypes  blending can be achieved in the same analysis as the genomic training  using an inverse relationship matrix constructed from pedigree information on non-genotyped individuals and genomic information on genotyped animals [  ]. In the absence of the genotypes  the blending can be achieved using MBV as a correlated trait []. That approach requires knowledge of the covariance components relating the MBV to the trait  typically represented in publications as the genetic correlation [  ]. Whereas microsatellite marker studies have typically failed to identify QTL and subsequently SNP that could apply equally well across a range of breeds  there was hope that the reduced cost and the increased density of multiplexed SNP panels would lead to discoveries that could be exploited across breeds. The reduced cost per genotype for panels of 50 000 or more multiplexed SNP compared to microsatellite markers allows for more animals to be used in analyses  increasing power. In both conventional QTL studies and in genomic prediction  detection of effects relies on an association between the segregating marker genotype and the segregating causal polymorphism. The strength of this association reflects the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD)  which can be represented by the squared correlation between genotypes at two loci. Microsatellite studies exploited linkage relationships to create LD between the flanking sparse markers and a QTL within families  even when the marker was in linkage equilibrium with the QTL from a population perspective. Genomic prediction does not require family structures but takes advantage of the higher density of SNP markers and the fact that physically close loci tend to have higher LD than distant loci. Provided the genome is saturated with SNP markers  any QTL should be near some genotyped SNP and hopefully at least one will be in sufficient LD with the QTL. Research studies of genomic prediction in livestock populations began with the release by Illumina of a high-density bovine panel of some 54 001 SNP markers []. In any particular breed  a proportion of these SNP will not be segregating  so the genotypes will be described in this paper as coming from a 50k panel. Training involves statistical analyses that exploit individuals with both high-density genotypes and recorded performance []. The amount of data required for training depends upon a number of factors  including the heritability of the trait []. One approach to training is to use sires whose genetic merit can be assessed more reliably using progeny performance than would be the case using only measurements on the individual sire itself []. This may be more problematic in beef cattle than dairy cattle  as the recorded population of even the largest beef cattle breed is much smaller than that of the Holstein breed. Further  artificial insemination (AI) is much less used in beef cattle seedstock herds than in dairy herds  collectively resulting in fewer highly reliable sires available for use in training. Industry populations have advantages for genomic prediction. In the case of elite or widely used industry animals  the individuals included in the training data will be relevant to the commercial population. For AI sires  DNA is readily accessible despite the disparate ownership or physical location of the animals. The principal source of performance information comes as EPD from NCE and is well represented for growth traits  moderately well for ultrasound traits  poorly for behavior  reproduction and longevity traits  and typically with no information on many other traits such as disease resistance or eating quality. Since most recorded animals are purebred  training on crossbred data is seldom an option using NCE data and is limited to those few breed associations that collect crossbred data. A US repository of DNA from over 3 000 Angus bulls born since 1948 was assembled by the University of Missouri []. These bulls are represented in American Angus Association pedigrees and have generally been widely used. Accordingly  these bulls have EPD and accuracies for : calving ease (direct); birth weight; weaning weight; yearling weight; yearling height; scrotal circumference; : maternal calving ease; milk; mature weight; mature height; : carcass weight; marbling; rib eye area; fat depth; along with some  trait EPD: docility; and heifer pregnancy. The accuracies of EPD on old bulls are limited for some traits. Igenity  a genomic testing service owned by the animal health company Merial  has used the results from the analysis of this Angus population  along with other resource populations  to market a reduced panel comprised of a subset of informative SNP referred to as a 50k-derived product. It is marketed in the US in conjunction with the American Angus Association and costs $65 []. The US Meat Animal Research Center (US-MARC) at Clay Center Nebraska has worked with some breed associations to develop a repository of some 2 026 influential or upcoming bulls in 16 of the most prominent beef breeds in the US with EPD from NCE and includes: Angus  Beefmaster  Brahman  Brangus  Braunvieh  Charolais  Chiangus  Gelbvieh  Hereford  Limousin  Maine-Anjou  Red Angus  Salers  Santa Gertrudis  Shorthorn  and Simmental. Initial plans for the use of this repository were to provide genomic predictions of these bulls from training analyses based on a US-MARC crossbred population [] and to carry out multi-breed training. These SNP genotypes have now been made available to the respective breed associations. The alternative to training on widely-used sires is to train using phenotypes collected specifically for genomic analyses. This could be achieved using non seedstock field data  but in many cases the mating designs and contemporary group classifications are not entirely adequate for the purpose. Most field data comprise offspring from natural mating  so sires tend to be nested within rather than cross-classified by contemporary groups. In the case of carcass traits  animals tend to have their ownership transferred several times between weaning and harvest  making it difficult to ensure harvest cohorts were managed together throughout their entire lifetime. For reproductive traits  it is difficult to obtain sizeable cohorts of animals for comparison  particularly for phenotypic measurements obtained after first calving  as birth cohorts get subdivided according to sex of calf  age of dam  and whether or not yearlings became pregnant. These problems can be overcome by sourcing animals from large herds and by designing the study prior to the birth of the study animals  which may be several years prior to the collection of phenotypes. The US carcass merit project (CMP) was one such long-term industry-funded semi-structured undertaking initiated in 1998 that collected carcass data  tenderness and sensory attributes on over 8 200 progeny. Some of the half-sib offspring of more than 70 sires across 13 breeds were DNA sampled. The sires were widely-used AI bulls from various breeds and dams were commercial cows []. The dataset has been valuable to validate early genomic tests being commercialized in the US. Validation of tests using these data has been undertaken by the National Beef Cattle Evaluation Consortium (NBCEC) and the details having been published on-line by Van Eenennaam et al. []. More recently  the CMP dataset has been genotyped using high-density SNP chips by at least two different organizations to identify genes and to apply whole-genome prediction  which will prevent this resource from being used for independent validation of future tests derived from that data. Collecting data for more novel phenotypes requires the deliberate generation of suitable populations. Given the current dominant market position of the Angus breed in the US  it was an obvious candidate for any new studies to expand the scope of traits for genomic prediction. Two large studies have been undertaken  one at Iowa State University to investigate fatty acid and mineral content in beef as possible targets for improving the human healthfulness of beef  and another at Colorado State University to investigate feedlot health. The healthfulness study involved several cohorts representing 2 300 predominately Angus cattle assessed for carcass and meat quality attributes  including tenderness and sensory information  in addition to extensive phenotyping of traits that might influence the human healthfulness of beef. These healthy beef traits include mineral and fatty acid compositions of key muscles []. The feedlot health study used two annual crops of about 1 500 composite British and Continental steers from one ranch in Nebraska. The animals were extensively phenotyped for feedlot health  particularly respiratory disease and response to treatment. Sickness was assessed visually  by temperature profiles and by lung damage scores. Data includes temperament and immunological measures []. Both experiments included body weight and a number of carcass and meat quality phenotypes. These collective resources have been used  along with other populations  to develop an Angus 50k product for production and carcass traits that Pfizer Animal Genetics has marketed in the US for $124-$139  depending upon the number of animals tested []  with predictions from this panel now incorporated in NCE undertaken for the American Angus Association. Research herds with deep phenotyping are also candidates for studies of genomic prediction. The most comprehensive such resource is represented by the US-MARC germplasm evaluation studies  the recent cohorts being known as the Cycle VII and F1-squared populations. In addition to an across-breed training analysis for which single-SNP effects have been published for birth  weaning and yearling weights and their respective gains []  this population was used to develop a low-density 196-SNP panel with markers believed to be informative for weaning weight. Such reduced panels comprised of only the most informative markers were believed to be more cost-effective and therefore more likely to be widely adopted by the beef industry. That panel was used in a project coordinated by the NBCEC to demonstrate the use of reduced panels in seedstock herds  and the incorporation of the resulting MBV into NCE []. The collection of feed intake on large numbers of animals is still problematic from a practical viewpoint  and to date  such data has been limited to measuring relatively small disparate groups of animals during finishing  with findings focused on QTL detection rather than genomic prediction. Other datasets of limited size have been collected on a range of traits  including reproductive performance and tick resistance but have not yet had any findings published from a genomic prediction perspective. Costs for conventional pedigree and performance recording and for NCE have been met by producer funds in the US. Public funds have been used for the development of NCE methodology. Public funds were not immediately available for extensive genotyping of training populations  and neither seedstock breeders nor breed associations had funds to adopt this technology beforehand given the uncertain nature of its value. Fortunately  applications of this approach in beef cattle improvement were considered as business opportunities by commercial companies such as Merial Igenity and Pfizer Animal Genetics to invest in the training phase  presumably with expectations of recouping returns on that investment through future sale of genomic tests. However  this situation has changed industry dynamics  introducing competitive partners into the process of ranking animals  and has increased the proprietary nature of performance information  genotypes and analytical approaches. This is one reason for the dearth of refereed publications on the accuracy of genomic prediction in beef cattle  in contrast to the dairy cattle situation. Confidence in genomic predictions can only be provided by validation in a group of animals that are not included in the training population. Close relationships between animals in training and validation populations tend to lead to better predictive ability than when the groups are more distantly related []. Analysis of simulated data suggests that methods based on mixture models provide better predictive ability than methods that assume all the SNP have predictive value []  while analysis of field data tends to demonstrate relatively little difference between alternative methods  and some inconsistencies appear from trait to trait as to which is the most predictive method [  ]. There appears to be more variation in predictive ability according to the choice of validation population than there is between methods. One of the few reports on accuracy of genomic predictions in beef cattle analysed deregressed EPD [] from NCE to quantify cross-validation results from 2 100 Angus AI bulls []. The data were partitioned into three subsets  with training animals in two groups and validation animals in the third. Subsets were created so that no sire had sons in both the training and validation groups. Genomic predictions were obtained from the training data using method Bayes C []. Predictive ability was quantified as correlations between 50k predictions and realized (deregressed) performance (Table ). The general conclusion is that correlations between genomic predictions from 50k SNP and deregressed EPD in independent datasets of related animals are 0.5-0.7. It is not possible from these correlations to readily derive the genetic correlation between genomic prediction and the true BV  because of heterogeneity of variance among the deregressed EPD. This heterogeneity does not impact the expectation of the estimated covariance between genomic predictions and deregressed EPD  but it does impact the estimated variance of the deregressed EPD. Furthermore  the genotyped animals represent AI sires  and these represent highly selected individuals  so their genetic variance is not likely to be representative of the population genetic variance. Also  correlations between genomic prediction and EPD do not provide expectation on the genetic correlation  due to the varying degrees of shrinkage influencing EPD  which vary in their information content. Accordingly  correlations between genomic prediction and EPD or deregressed EPD provide a guide to accuracy  but cannot be interpreted as quantifying the proportion of variation accounted for by the genomic prediction applied to new animals. This would not be the case for correlations between genomic prediction and homogeneous information such as individual phenotypic observations. Other numerically important breeds tend to have fewer registrations than Angus and it will be difficult to collect comparable sized training populations of AI sires. In contrast to the dairy industry  most bulls are used solely in commercial herds that do not record parentage or individual performance and therefore do not obtain progeny information for training or validation. The American Hereford Association has increased the 50k genotypes provided by US-MARC to develop a training population of 800 animals  but no results have been published yet. The other US breeds have even fewer animals ready for training. Genomic prediction for beef cattle healthfulness has shown varying levels of predictive ability  as determined by the proportion of variation accounted for by markers []. Using samples from the   iron concentration of beef could be readily predicted  whereas magnesium  manganese  phosphorus and zinc concentrations appeared to be under less genetic control. For other minerals such as calcium  copper  potassium and sodium  concentrations could not be predicted. Prediction of the fatty acid's concentrations showed similar trends to that of the minerals' concentration. For the predominant even-numbered saturated fatty acids C14:0  C16:0 and C18:0  monounsaturated C18:1 and polyunsaturated C18:2  prediction was good  while for C18:3 and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentrations  predictions were not conclusive. These results look promising to develop tools capable of modifying the concentration of saturated fatty acids  or the relative proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. For these traits  the challenge will consist in developing a market for beef with modified fatty acid composition. Using the same dataset as for beef healthfulness  it has been shown that carcass and beef quality traits can be predicted []. Hot carcass weight  calculated yield grade  marbling score and fat thickness had 40-50% of phenotypic variance explained by the 50k markers  whereas markers accounted for less than 30% of the variation for dressing percentage  loin eye area and tenderness assessed by Warner-Bratzler shear force. Cross validation results were not reported. Reduced SNP panels can be produced either to be highly informative for a particular trait or for several traits by including the most strongly associated SNP  or to be informative for high-density genomic prediction after imputing the high-density panel from a reduced set of evenly spaced SNP with high minor allele frequency []. To date  the beef industry focus has been on subsets of markers chosen to be informative for a subset of traits that are believed to have the most economic relevance and greatest market opportunity. Mixture models such as Bayes B and Bayes C [] assume that some fraction of the SNP have zero effect on the trait. The posterior frequency with which any particular SNP was fitted in an MCMC analysis reflects the informativeness of particular SNP and can be used for SNP selection. Subsets of 600 SNP markers created by selecting the 20 markers on each bovine chromosome with the highest model frequency  from Bayes C analyses with 90% of 50k SNP assumed to have zero effect  demonstrated relatively little loss of predictive ability compared to 50k predictions []. Cheaper genotyping can be achieved by reducing the number of markers to a single set of 384 SNP  chosen for predictive ability across the portfolio of traits of interest. However  reducing the number of SNP below 600 reduces predictive ability. For example  the correlation reported in [] for sets of the best 50  100  150 or 200 SNP chosen to predict marbling in Angus were 0.28  0.29  0.39  and 0.43  well below the 0.67 achieved with 600 SNP. A single set of 384 markers chosen from the above analysis for predictive ability across a range of traits was validated in a new population of 275 Angus bulls []. The correlations from that analysis were 0.59 for marbling  0.32 for backfat  0.58 for rib eye  0.44 for carcass weight  0.39 for heifer pregnancy and 0.35 for yearling weight. In the study on beef healthfulness []  subsets of as few as 10 markers retained more than half of the predictive ability of the 50k SNP chip when used to predict the even-numbered saturated fatty acids C14:0 and C16:0. The genomic architecture of mineral and fatty acid concentrations is likely to be much simpler  as the biochemical pathways and enzymes involved in metabolizing and catabolizing these compounds have been identified and seem to be somewhat straightforward  in contrast to traits such as growth rate  which are the collective result of genes influencing bone growth  muscle growth  fat accumulation  visceral weight among other factors. The development of reduced panels for any quantitative trait in breeds other than Angus is currently limited by the lack of training populations. In contrast to the dairy industry  where reduced panels are being used for imputation of 50k markers for genomic prediction []  target populations in beef cattle are diverse in terms of species ( and ) and breeds. Furthermore  many pre-pubertal selection candidates are offspring of natural mating rather than of AI sires. Collectively  these facts increase the genetic distance between the training and target populations. Prediction across breeds is more problematic because different breeds may exhibit different QTL  dominance or epistasis can occur  and allele frequencies may vary between populations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is not very consistent across breeds and therefore training in one beef cattle breed using 50k genotypes will not be very effective to predict a different breed []. Simulated data using actual 50k genotypes from the CMP and an Angus dataset as if they were causal genes and adding a random environmental effect to represent a trait with 50% heritability  demonstrated that predictive ability varied according to the number of simulated QTL. The best results were achieved for the smallest number of QTL  since in that scenario the average size of the QTL was larger than when more QTL were simulated. The across-breed predicted correlation from the simulation [] varied from a high of 0.4 for 50 QTL down to 0.2-0.3 for 500 QTL. These correlations account for up to 18% of genetic variance for 50 genes and less than 10% of variance for 500 genes. Unpublished data predicting the merit of Hereford bulls using training results from Angus bulls always resulted in positive correlations  but typically less than 0.10  with the best correlation being 0.18 for birth weight and slightly less for yearling weight. Genomic prediction in beef cattle based only on 50k genotypes will therefore require training individuals from every target breed  confirming findings from simulations []. Recently released next generation Illumina HD or Affymetrix Bos-1 panels  with more than a 10-fold increase in SNP density beyond the 50k  will allow imputation of missing SNP genotypes in animals already genotyped for 50k panels [  ]. It is hoped that the 10-fold increased SNP density will improve across-breed prediction  avoiding the need for large training populations of every target breed  but this has yet to be demonstrated in practice. Genomic prediction across-breed using reduced panels will be inferior to 50k based predictions. A subset of 192 SNP markers was chosen from the US-MARC association analysis for weaning weight reported in [] and applied to predict merit for weaning weight and post-weaning gain in purebred calves representing seven of the breeds represented as crossbreds in the US-MARC training data. The genetic correlation estimated between the MBV and direct effects for weaning weight was slightly negative (-0.05) in one breed  0.0 in another  and ranged from 0.10-0.28 in the remaining breeds []. These results are disappointingly low. Both predictions from Merial Igenity and Pfizer Animal Genetics are currently used in the American Angus Association (AAA) NCE by including them as correlated traits. The estimated genetic correlations for the Merial Igenity MBV are 0.54 for carcass weight  0.58 for REA  0.50 for fat and 0.65 for marbling []. Corresponding values have not yet been reported for the Pfizer Animal Genetics MBV. Procedurally  breeders send DNA samples to AAA  where they are anonymously recoded and forwarded to the relevant genomics company. The MBV are reported back to AAA to be provided to the breeders and included in NCE. In this circumstance  retraining to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction is not an option as no party has access to both the genotypes and EPD or phenotypic performance of the genotyped individuals. Predictive ability is influenced by effective population size  heritability  and the number of animals in the training data  among other factors [  ]. Increasing the number of genotyped animals should increase predictive ability. Ideally  the training data should accumulate as the seedstock producers genotype individuals for selection purposes. Unlike for the dairy industry  this is not occurring yet in the beef industry  since genomics companies are marketing predictions without the genotypes going into the national databases administered by the breed associations. Research populations may therefore be critical to the accumulation of training animals in the near term. In Australia  industry has actively promoted an information nucleus for this very purpose []. The presence of such populations will inevitably place strain on the relationship between genomics companies that want to keep information of a proprietary nature and public/industry funding efforts. Pooling training populations across countries provides an opportunity to increase training data size  but may add complications. Different countries sometimes define traits in different ways (e.g. age-adjusted or weight-adjusted)  and have different harvest end-points (e.g. weight-constant or fat-constant)  resulting in imperfect relationships between the traits in different countries. Further  genotype by environment interactions can also be important because production conditions tend to be more diverse in beef cattle than in dairy production. Pooling training data across breeds provides an appealing alternative to increase predictive power but will require the use or imputation of new higher-density SNP panels. The use of haplotypes [] may also provide additional power  although this has yet to be demonstrated in beef cattle with field rather than simulated data. Cost-effective use of the technology will likely result in approaches that exploit genotype imputation  and use mixed densities of genotyping on individual animals. This will likely include the DNA sequencing of individual animals []  such as widely-used AI sires  and the imputation of sequences. However  additional SNP information alone may reduce predictive ability [] unless the size of the training populations increases. Exploiting bioinformatics  such as from expression analyses and knowledge of the location of genes known to influence traits in beef cattle or other species  may help to increase predictive ability by allowing focusing on additional SNP only in the regions that lack sufficient LD. New analytical methods  such as approaches that explicitly fit QTL effects [] rather than SNP effects (such as methods that jointly account for LD and linkage information []) may also help. Extension of genomic predictions to the full range of traits that influence consumer satisfaction will further require a focus on the collection of reliable phenotypic information across the broad spectrum of traits. Collecting such information will likely rely on public funding efforts  but even then will be limited by the availability of meaningful phenotypes for some traits. New electronic technologies that facilitate the collection of phenotypes on large cohorts will also be invaluable. Genomic prediction offers accuracies that exceed those of pedigree-based parent average of young selection candidates. The highest accuracies are achieved for offspring of the training population. Accuracies can be equivalent to progeny tests based on up to 10 or so offspring  providing a slightly higher predictive ability than a single phenotypic observation on the individual. These accuracies are not yet sufficiently high to warrant selection in the absence of phenotypic information  particularly as these accuracies tend to erode when assessed in validation populations that are more distant from the training population in terms of the number of meioses separating generations. Accuracies are expected to improve with further research  as the training population grows in terms of numbers of genotyped animals  and density of SNP genotypes per animal. Phenotyping is now the principal limitation in expanding the series of traits beyond those routinely recorded for NCE. In the meantime  applying genomic prediction will influence traits that were easy to record in conventional improvement programs  rather than addressing the traits difficult and costly to measure. Sharing of information among parties to the benefit of industry is still in its infancy  as is the incorporation of MBV into NCE. The latter activity will cause particular challenges for small breed associations which lack the funding or expertise to change their NCE systems. Whereas it had been hoped that genomic prediction would facilitate selection in small breed associations with fewer registered animals  the current need for within-breed training will serve only to increase the technology gap between the breeds and facilitate faster rates of change in those breeds that have a large market share.

Both threshold linear models and grouped data models can guarantee the goodness-of-fit of the genetic evaluation for carcass conformation and fat cover  but our results highlight the need for specific thresholds by sex and slaughterhouse in order to avoid fitting deficiencies. Beef cattle production is becoming increasingly concerned with meat and carcass quality traits []. Currently  beef cattle genetic evaluations include mainly growth traits  but carcass traits are also economically important []. European beef producers are paid based on the weight of the animals at slaughter and on carcass conformation (CON) and fat cover (FAT) scores. All carcasses are classified at commercial slaughterhouses according to CON and FAT scores measured by subjective grading performed by trained technicians. These subjective records usually involve classification under a categorical and arbitrarily predefined scale  which may lead to strong departures from the Gaussian distribution. Theoretically  the discrete nature of performance traits is taken into account in genetic evaluations using a threshold linear model []  which assumes an underlying continuous distribution called liability. This model includes thresholds that link the underlying distribution with the observed scale. However  in some cases  different technicians may use different intervals on the categorical scale  or a wider or narrower range of values for the subjective grading. Thus  the link between the observed scale and the liability scale could be specific to each technician. In 2006  Varona and Hernandez [] proposed a specific ordered category threshold linear model for sensory data and concluded that each panelist used a different pattern of categorization. In 2009  Varona et al. [] compared different threshold linear models using the deviance information criterion and showed that the most plausible model to analyse carcass traits was the slaughterhouse specific ordered category threshold linear model. This result was confirmed by the fact that the threshold estimates differed notably between slaughterhouses. Liability may follow many distributions  such as the Gaussian distribution (probit model)  the logistic distribution (logit model) or the reverse extreme value distribution. This latter distribution is a log-Weibull distribution and the resulting model can therefore be framed as a linear model for the logarithm of the liability The Weibull distribution (including the exponential distribution as a special case) is commonly used in survival analysis and it can be parameterised as either a proportional hazards model or a log-linear model. It is the only family of distributions that has this property []. Whereas a proportional hazards model assumes that the effect of a covariate is to multiply the hazard by some constant  a log-linear model assumes that the effect of a covariate is to multiply the underlying variable by some constant []. The results of fitting a Weibull model can therefore be interpreted in both frameworks. Prentice and Gloeckler [] presented the \"grouped data model\" for analysis of discrete data while maintaining the assumption of proportional hazards. Ducrocq [] reparameterized and extended grouped data models to include random effects for animal breeding applications. Tarres et al. [] showed that Ducrocq's formulae []  drawn from the grouped data model for survival analysis (where the value of the underlying variable is necessarily larger than 0)  can be applied to an underlying variable with negative values. They also highlighted the flexibility of the grouped data model for the analysis of discrete traits  such as calving ease of beef calves  in comparison to homoscedastic and heteroscedastic threshold linear models. Given the diversity of models to analyse discrete variables such as CON and FAT scores  comparing these models requires specific tools to test goodness-of-fit with real data. Bootstrap approaches  introduced by Efron []  have become routine methods to approximate the distribution of a parameter of interest  and have been applied to the animal breeding framework [  ]. In 2006  Casellas et al. [] proposed a parametric bootstrap procedure to test goodness-of-fit that provides a clear framework to compare predicted and actual distributions of variables of interest. Significant fitting deficiencies are revealed when the distribution of the actual data is not included within the bootstrap interval. This bootstrap approach could be a very useful tool to validate models by direct assessment of the ability of the model to fit the actual data. The aim of this work was to perform a parametric bootstrap procedure to test the goodness-of-fit of three threshold linear models  a threshold log-linear Weibull model  and a grouped data model for the analysis of carcass conformation and fat cover in beef cattle. The three threshold linear models were a model with slaughterhouse and sex effects  along with other systematic effects  with homogeneous thresholds  and two extensions with heterogeneous thresholds that vary across slaughterhouses and across slaughterhouse and sex. Bruna dels Pirineus is a beef type breed selected from the old Brown Swiss (derived from the Canton Schwyz) with herds located in the Pyrenean mountain areas of Catalonia (Spain). From October/November to June  when most of the calving occurs  the animals remain in the valleys close to the villages and then the cows and calves are taken to the mountains to graze alpine pastures. After weaning  calves are fattened by  feeding with barley-corn concentrate meal and straw. Data were recorded between 2004 and 2009 in 12 slaughterhouses located in Catalonia (Spain)  and included records from 2 539 beef carcasses from animals participating in the Yield Recording Scheme of the breed. Two traits were analysed in this study: the CON score  which describes the development of essential parts of the carcass profile according to the (S)EUROP scale (CEE no 2930/81  1981)  and the FAT score  which quantifies the amount of fat on the outside of the carcass and in the thoracic cavity. The categorical scale of CON was converted to a numeric scale from 2.00 (O) to 5.00 (E) because S and P scores were not observed. Similarly  FAT could have scores between 1 and 5  but scores over 4 were not observed. The percentages of each score in each slaughterhouse are presented in Tables  and . The data were completed with pedigree records provided by the Bruna dels Pirineus Breeders Association (FEBRUPI). Both FEBRUPI and slaughterhouse databases were merged according to the European animal identification code. The pedigree file contained 5 153 animals related to these calves  of which 332 were sires. Statistical analysis of these data was performed with different threshold models. Each CON and FAT score was modelled as a discrete variable  conditional to an unobservable underlying continuous variable   referred to as liability. The probability that the discrete variable  has a value  is: where    and  are thresholds that define the four categories of response. The prior distributions of the threshold positions were assumed to be flat. Thresholds  and  are assumed to be known  i.e. arbitrarily fixed to 0 and 2.0 for CON and FAT  to provide a simpler sampling scheme than the one defined by fixing the mean and the residual variance of the liability []. The posterior conditional distributions for the augmented underlying variables are censored normal distributions  as described by Sorensen et al. []. The underlying variable  had the following distribution: where  are the regression coefficients of the systematic effects   are herd effects   direct breeding values      and  are incidence matrices linking data with their respective effects  and  is the residual variance. The systematic effects included in   i.e.   referred to slaughterhouse (12 levels)  sex (males and females)  parity (1st to 4 or more)  age at slaughter (6 levels: 9 to 14 months)  season at slaughter (winter  spring  summer and autumn) and year of slaughter (2005 to 2009). Prior distribution for herd effects (73 levels) was assumed to be multivariate normal where  is the herd variance. For direct breeding values  the prior distribution was: where  is the numerator relationship matrix and  is the additive genetic variance. The prior distributions for systematic effects and the (co)variance components were bounded flat uniform distributions. Bayesian analysis of the Threshold Linear Model (TLM) was carried out with the Gibbs sampler algorithm implemented in Varona et al. []. Each analysis consisted of a single chain of 100 000 iterations  with the first 25 000 samples discarded. Analysis of convergence and calculation of effective sample size followed the algorithms by Raftery and Lewis []. All iterations in the analysis were used to compute posterior means and standard deviations of estimated regression coefficients and random effects  so that all available information from the output of the Gibbs sampler could be considered. This model is the same as above  except that it estimates a specific set of thresholds for each slaughterhouse. Now  the probability that the discrete variable  takes a value  is: where   and are thresholds that define the four categories of response and have a different position depending on the slaughterhouse (12 different slaughterhouses). As in the previous model  the prior distributions of the threshold positions are assumed to be flat  and thresholds  and  are assumed to be known and arbitrarily fixed to 0 and 2.0 for both traits. The presence of specific thresholds for each slaughterhouse should take into account the variation captured by the slaughterhouse effect in TLM. Thus  in this model  systematic effects were reduced to sex  parity  age at slaughter  season and year at slaughter. Once again  a Bayesian analysis was carried out with the Gibbs sampler algorithm implemented as in Varona et al. []. This model differs from the previous ones in that it estimates a specific set of thresholds for each sex in each slaughterhouse. Now  the probability that the discrete variable  takes a value  is: where   and are thresholds that define the four categories of response and have a different position depending on the interaction of sex and slaughterhouse (24 levels). As in the previous model  the prior distributions of the threshold positions are assumed to be flat  and thresholds and are assumed to be known and fixed to 0 and 2.0 for both traits. The presence of specific thresholds for each sex in each slaughterhouse should take into account the variation captured by the sex effect in SHTLM. Thus  in this model  systematic effects were reduced to parity  age at slaughter  season and year at slaughter. Once again  a Bayesian analysis was carried out with the Gibbs sampler algorithm implemented in Varona et al. []. In the previous models  CON and FAT scores were modelled as a discrete variable  conditional to an unobservable underlying continuous variable   referred to as liability that follows a linear model. In the TlogLWM  we assume that the liability is modelled as follows: where  follows a standard Weibull distribution. In this case  this model is equivalent to: where e follows an extreme value distribution []  and  and  are the Weibull parameters   are the regression coefficients of the systematic effects   are herd effects   are breeding values  and     and  are incidence matrices linking data with their respective effects. The systematic effects included in   i.e.   were the same as in TLM. Here it is important to note the minus sign in front of the effects because it influences the interpretation of the results. The probability that the discrete variable  has a value  is: where    and  are homogeneous thresholds that define the four categories of response and   with (.) being the underlying hazard function that is the ratio of the probability density function to the complementary cumulative distribution function []. This hazard function follows a proportional hazard model () = ()exp(+ + ) with (.) being the baseline Weibull hazard function. In our data  each CON and FAT score can take four values k = 1  2  3 or 4. Then  the probability that the discrete variable Y has a value k was calculated as: Because  can by definition only take values between 0 and 1  it was modelled using a log-log transformation as: where     and  were mean values ranging from -8 to +8. These means were different for each k value of CON and FAT while systematic effects   herd effects  and breeding values  were the same for all the k values The Survival Kit package [] was used to analyse the TlogLWM model because the likelihood expression was exactly the same as assuming an underlying variable T with a threshold proportional hazard model []. In fact  TlogLWM is a particular case of a threshold proportional hazard model with a baseline Weibull distribution. The threshold proportional hazard models are called grouped data models []. In these models  the discrete variables  are modelled conditional to an unobservable liability that follows a proportional hazard model. In this case  the hazard function of the liability () = ()exp( +  + ) is the product of two terms  the baseline hazard function (.) and the regression coefficients term. Unlike in the previous model  in GDM the baseline distribution of the underlying variable  can be unknown and not necessarily Weibull  because the estimates of regression coefficients  herd and genetic effects will be exactly the same regardless of the distribution assumed. The probability that the discrete variable Y has a value k was calculated as before: where   and are heterogeneous thresholds that vary by slaughterhouse and sex and define the four categories of response  and  was modelled using a log-log transformation as: where    and  were mean values ranging from -8 to +8. In our study  the variables included in  were the systematic effects with incidence matrix   i.e. . On the one hand  these regression coefficients were the same for all values k of CON and FAT. On the other hand  the slaughterhouse and sex effects were assumed to be score-dependent  i.e. different for each value  of CON and FAT scores. Likelihood ratio tests determined whether including score-dependent effects for these factors gave a significantly better fit. Herd effects  and breeding values  were assumed to be random with incidence matrices  and  that link data with their respective effects. Prior distributions for herd effects and genetic effects were chosen as in the previous models. The Survival Kit package [] was used for the analysis of the GDM model. It is important to note here that the heterogeneous threshold positions do not appear in the likelihood expression and therefore they are not estimated. However  they can be calculated a posteriori by assuming a known distribution and solving ln  = ln ( ) - ln ( ) where (.) is the complementary cumulative distribution function of the liability. In this way  a direct relationship can be established between score-dependent effects and heterogeneous thresholds positions. A parametric bootstrap approach was applied to test the goodness-of-fit of the described models in the analysis of CON and FAT scores. The bootstrapping methodology was the same as in Tarres et al. []. Confidence intervals obtained for the frequency of each  value of CON and FAT were stated as being the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the bootstrap samples  and they were easily contrasted with the frequencies of the actual data. Significant fitting deficiencies were revealed when the actual frequencies were outside the confidence interval for one model  and they could be statistically quantified through the bootstrapped p-values []. The average carcass of the Bruna dels Pirineus breed under commercial conditions weighed around 279 kg at 12.5 months of age (377 d)  with an average CON score of 3.43  between R (good) and U (very good)  and a low FAT average score (2.48). Male calves were slaughtered one month later than females (387 d vs. 360 d) and had a higher cold carcass weight (305 kg vs. 231 kg) and CON score (3.61 vs 3.35) but a slightly lower FAT average (2.47 vs 2.54) (results not shown in tables). These results show that under commercial conditions the Bruna dels Pirineus and the Pirenaica breeds have similar performances []  which are also similar to those previously reported for the same breeds under an experimental environment by Piedrafita et al. []. In addition  the Bruna dels Pirineus breed results were comparable to those from other European populations scored by the EUROP carcass classification system  such as the Swedish Charolais and Simmental populations studied by Eriksson et al. []  but with a higher CON score and a smaller FAT score than the Irish populations studied by Hickey et al. []. A standard alternative for analysis of categorical data such as CON and FAT scores is the threshold linear model or TLM []. Using TLM  sex  parity and age at slaughter effects reflected the expected physiological relationship among them (results not shown). Males showed larger CON scores than females  which is very similar to results of Altarriba et al. []. The situation was reversed for FAT  since females showed a higher FAT score than males  due to their greater precocity []. Calves from multiparous dams had higher CON scores than calves from primiparous dams  but these differences were not so large for FAT scores. Moreover  for the effect of age at slaughter  an almost linear increasing relationship was observed for CON scores (results not shown) but for FAT scores no clear tendency was detected. The difference in precocity among sexes did not generate a different effect of age at slaughter on FAT score between sexes because this interaction was not significant in our data. Finally  significant differences in CON and FAT scores were detected depending on the season and year of slaughter but there was no clear trend over time. These estimated regression coefficients were used to compute the bootstrap intervals for TLM. Significant fitting deficiencies were revealed because in many cases the actual frequency of CON and FAT scores was not within the bootstrap interval  especially when stratifying by slaughterhouse (Tables  and ). This was because CON and FAT score frequencies varied significantly between slaughterhouses. For two slaughterhouses (11 and 12)  over 80% of the carcasses were qualified as R for CON  whereas in the other slaughterhouses most of the carcasses were qualified as U (Table ). In the case of FAT scores  several slaughterhouses (1  3  4  5  8  9 and 12) qualified most carcasses with a value of 3  while in some slaughterhouses (2  6  7 and 10) the most frequent value was 2  and in one slaughterhouse (11) the most frequent value was 1 (Table ). These differences among slaughterhouses can be explained either by the fact that some slaughterhouses prefer to slaughter light young animals (i.e less than one year old) compared to other slaughterhouses  or by the fact that both traits were scored by different technicians in each slaughterhouse. Despite the existence of an objective European scoring system  each technician may have a different subjective interpretation (i.e. each technician puts the threshold at a different position). As in Varona et al. []  this fact reveals the complexity of the normalization of carcass evaluation for CON and FAT scores  which cannot be accommodated by the TLM because it suffers from low flexibility due to the assumptions made in the model (i.e. all the slaughterhouses have the same threshold position). The flexibility of threshold models was improved in SHTLM by estimating different thresholds per slaughterhouse in order to take the different subjective interpretations of scoring systems into account. The posterior means for the thresholds indicated a large variation among slaughterhouses (results not shown)  in strong concordance with the heterogeneity of the raw data presented in Tables  and . Threshold position was negative for slaughterhouses in which most carcasses were qualified as U for CON and positive for slaughterhouses in which most carcasses were qualified as R. For FAT  the threshold position was positive for slaughterhouse 11  in which most carcasses were qualified as 1 (69.57%)  and the threshold position was over 0.45 for slaughterhouses (2  6  7 and 10) in which most carcasses were qualified as 2. Using SHTLM  most of the fitting deficiencies when stratifying by slaughterhouse disappeared  as most of the frequencies of CON and FAT scores from actual data fell within the bootstrap intervals (results not shown). However  SHTLM still failed to correctly fit the frequencies by sex (Tables  and )  especially for FAT score  since five of the eight actual percentages in Table  were not within the bootstrap interval. This fact indicates that the threshold positions for FAT scores differed by sex and that differences among sexes could not be totally captured by a systematic effect  as fitted in SHTLM. The flexibility of threshold models was improved in SEXTLM by estimating different thresholds per sex in each slaughterhouse in order to take the different subjective interpretations of scoring systems by sex into account. Using SEXTLM  the frequencies of CON and FAT scores by sex were always within the boostrapped boundaries (Tables  and ) and no fitting deficiencies were detected. This fact confirmed that the interpretation of the scoring system was different for each sex in each slaughterhouse. This model assumed proportional (log-linear) effects on CON and FAT scores  instead of the additive effects assumed in the threshold linear models  but again slaughterhouse  sex  parity  age at slaughter  season and year had a significant effect on CON and FAT scores. Male calves had a CON score 1.08 times higher than females  but females had a FAT score 1.03 times higher than males. Calves from multiparous dams had a CON score 1.08 times higher than calves from primiparous dams  and calves slaughtered over 14 months of age had a CON score 1.16 times higher than calves slaughtered before 9 months of age. In spite of the fact that these effects reflect the expected physiological relationship with CON and FAT scores  in the bootstrap analysis  TlogLWM failed to correctly fit the frequencies when stratifying by slaughterhouse and sex  especially for FAT (Tables  and ). This fact again indicates that differences in CON and FAT scores among slaughterhouses and sexes could not be totally captured by a systematic effect  as fitted in TlogLWM  and heterogeneous thresholds should be allowed for sex and slaughterhouse effects. The previous model TlogLWM is a particular case of a grouped data model with a baseline Weibull distribution. Its fitting deficiencies can be solved in GDM by assuming that slaughterhouse and sex effects are score-dependent. Likelihood ratio tests confirmed this fact and showed that slaughterhouse and sex effects were significantly score-dependent  especially for FAT score (P < 0.001). Again  this fact reveals the complexity of normalising carcass evaluations for CON and FAT among slaughterhouses and sexes. In the bootstrap analysis  fitting deficiencies were not observed using GDM  as the frequencies of both traits when stratifying by each factor were always within the bootstrapped boundaries (Tables  and  for sex  and results not shown for the other factors). Including score-dependent effects gave great flexibility to GDM []  and is similar to assume different thresholds positions by slaughterhouse and sex in threshold linear models  i.e. estimating one parameter for each score. Thus  this is a useful way to improve the goodness-of-fit of the models with a small increase in the number of parameters to be estimated  since there were only four scores. Estimates of variance components for the two traits are presented in Table . In this study  only slight differences in terms of variance components were noted among models (except for s). Estimated heritabilities were similar for all models and ranged from 0.29 (SEXTLM) to 0.35 (TlogLWM) for the CON score  and from 0.21 (SHTLM) to 0.25 (TLM) for the FAT score (Table ). These heritabilities estimates indicate that a sizeable fraction of the variance is additive genetic and confirmed that the results obtained were within the range of estimates from previous studies for the same subjective traits in other populations evaluated with the EUROP system [      ]. The heterogeneity of the models described above had a marked impact on the prediction of EBV. For threshold linear models  the correlations were over 0.98 for CON and 0.95 for FAT scores between EBV from TLM and SEXTLM (Figures  and )  much higher than the results of Varona et al. []. For grouped data models  the correlations were over 0.98 for CON and 0.96 for FAT scores between EBV from TlogLWM and GDM. Correlations between EBV from SEXTLM and GDM dropped to around minus 0.90 (Figures  and ) because the assumptions made in both models were different. Whereas SEXTLM assumes that the effect of the EBV is additive on the underlying variable  a GDM assumes that the effect of the EBV is exponentiated to multiply the underlying variable by some constant. The correlations between EBV from SEXTLM and GDM were negative because a negative EBV for an animal in GDM meant higher CON and FAT scores  e.g. an EBV of -0.20 meant exp(-(-0.20)) = 1.22 times higher performance. However  although the prediction of EBV was different  both models can be used to analyse CON and FAT scores with a correct goodness-of-fit. Therefore  there is a need for an appropriate procedure  e.g. predictive ability criteria  to rank models properly for a better choice of the model for genetic evaluation. .

Comparison of the specific sex by slaughterhouse threshold linear model and the grouped data model Significant fitting deficiencies were revealed when analyzing carcass conformation and fat cover scores using a threshold linear model with homogeneous thresholds. When a specific sex by slaughterhouse threshold model was considered  the fitting deficiencies were solved. Similar results were also obtained when heterogeneous thresholds were assumed in grouped data models that estimate score-dependent sex and slaughterhouse effects. The estimated heritabilities obtained from all models indicated that a sizeable fraction of the variance of both traits was additive genetic.

As a conclusion  we propose to refute the hypothesis that a single mutation located near the centre of the QTL region could control androstenone accumulation in fat by regulating the  expression. Boar taint refers to an unpleasant odour and flavour of meat which occurs in a high proportion of uncastrated male pigs and is primarily due to the accumulation of androstenone and skatole in fat tissue [  ]. Androstenone is synthesised in the testis  together with the steroid hormones  androgens and estrogens  from pregnenolone []  in relation to sexual development and is stored in fat tissue because of its lipophilic properties. Currently  only a few studies have tried to identify QTL for androstenone accumulation []. It is important to understand the genetic mechanisms controlling this trait in order to be able to select pigs for low androstenone levels and thus limit the occurrence of boar taint. Le Mignon et al. [] identified QTL for androstenone variation in a 480 Large White (LW) pig population using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. The present study focused on one of these QTL  explaining 18.7% of the genetic variance  which was detected on the q-arm of chromosome  7 (SSC7) using GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) near the position 66 Mb on the \"\" version (April 2009) of the pig genome sequence. Examination of the gene content in this QTL region  suggested  as an obvious candidate gene. Moe et al. [] and Grindfleck et al. [] had already detected differential expression of  in the testes of boars with either extremely high and or low levels of androstenone in fat. Moreover  a previous study reported one polymorphism in exon 1 of  significantly associated with androstenone levels in Yorkshire boars []. This gene encodes the CYP11A1 enzyme  which is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane  and catalyses the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in the first and rate-limiting step of the synthesis of steroid hormones []. Therefore  it is very important to clarify the role of  in boar taint. If testicular expression of  is found to influence the QTL for androstenone variation  it would be difficult to select against this QTL without encountering reproduction problems. On the INRA experimental farm  98 LW sows were inseminated with 56 LW boars  chosen as unrelated as possible. Each boar inseminated one or two sows. A total of 580 male piglets were raised in pens till they reached 110 kg of live body weight and then slaughtered in a commercial slaughterhouse. A total of 480 animals were measured for backfat androstenone levels. Six litters were produced by inseminating LW sows with semen from two commercial LW boars. Twenty-two animals were produced and then slaughtered at 24-25 weeks of age. Testicular samples were collected immediately after slaughter  frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. To obtain testicular samples  testes were decapsulated to remove connective tissues  fasciae and the main blood vessels. Samples (2 to 5 cm) were collected from the inner part of the testicular tissue  containing Leydig cells. Samples were disrupted  homogenised and ground to a fine powder by rapid agitation for 1 min in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled grinder with stainless steel beads before RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from testis using  (Talent) kits according to the manufacturers' instructions  and treated with DNase to remove contaminating DNA. RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies  DE  USA). First strand cDNA synthesis was conducted using SuperScript-II Rnase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen  Carlsbad  CA). According to the manufacturer's instructions  0.5 µg of total RNA from each sample was used as a template with dN9 random primers (Ozyme  New England Biolabs)  in a total volume of 100 µL. The level of  expression was determined by real-time PCR on cDNA from testes. Experiments were performed on the ABI 7900HT (Sequence Detection System 7900HT) in a 384-well plate. All measurements were performed in duplicate on the same plate and no reference sample was used. Primers were designed in exon 3 (TGTTTCGCTTCGCCTTTGA) and exon 4 (CCCAGGCGCTCTCCAAAT) of  cDNA. Transcript's concentrations were corrected with respect to the housekeeping gene   (GGGATGTCTGAAGAAGTACGAAAC//CATTCCTACAAGCCATTCCTTACG). Data was analysed with ABI software to obtain Ct values (threshold cycle). Four points of dilutions of a mix of cDNA were used for each gene and for each tissue  to determine PCR efficiency (E). As efficiency levels were similar for all measured genes (including the reference gene)  results are expressed as E × 1000 in arbitrary units. Before quantifying  transcripts  possible alternative transcripts were compiled from databases and we checked that the alternative transcript (AK235955 or DB787788) with a 3' shortcut exon 3 was absent in the testicular cDNA. Sequencing of BAC CH242-402H17 containing  gene related sequences is underway and sub-clone sequences are being captured by a blast procedure () from the \"traces-other\" database. To find polymorphisms  PCR products were produced with genomic DNA from several animals. To sequence the PCR products  an aliquot (1 to 12 µL) was purified by a single treatment (45 min at 37°C followed by 30 min at 80°C) using 0.5 U of Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega) and 0.8 U of exonuclease I (New England Biolabs). Sequencing was done with a 3730 ABI capillary DNA sequencer using a Big Dye terminator V3.1 cycle sequencing kit. Differences between two groups of animals were assessed with a heteroscedastic Student's t-test as proposed by MS-Excel (Microsoft Corporation). The 18 informative SNP present in the region containing the QTL for androstenone variation were classified into four groups based on their positions in Mb (Figure ). The position of this QTL was arbitrarily defined in a window of 3 Mb around the most highly associated marker  H3GA0021967 (named M11 and located at 65.91 Mb on the \" provisional genome sequence)  identified by GWAS analysis []. Since sequencing of the porcine genome is not yet completed []  our results are anchored on the human map. The genomic content of this region (64.4 - 67.4 Mb) was deduced from the global alignment proposed by the Narcisse software []. The first part of the QTL region between 64.40 and 66.45 Mb corresponded to the - region from HSA15 (Figure ) and the second part between 66.45 and 67.40 Mb was homologous to HSA14 (). The information was completed and compared to the provisional annotation of the \" version available on the Ensembl web site (). We found that the assembly between 66.0 and 66.4 Mb did not coincide completely although the SNP order was correct (Figure ). Moreover  four small gaps were detected (Figure ) and in particular  close to the porcine position 64.6 Mb. Using the Blast procedure available on the Ensembl web site  we showed that the 55 kb fragment on \" separating the extremities of  and  genes did not contain sequences related to the  and  genes. Curiously  on the human sequence  this region extended over a total of about 73 kb and contained these two genes which did not overlap but extended over 25 and 30 kb  respectively. . Center part: schematic representation of genes in the 64-69 Mb SSC7 region (in accordance with the  draft sequence); top left hand side: HSA15 segment homologous to the left half of this SSC7 region; lower right hand side: HSA14 segment homologous to the right half of this SSC7region; each gene sequence is represented by an arrow i.e. full arrow if homologous porcine gene exists and hollow arrow if not; lower left hand side: representation of part of the porcine sequence gap including  with its structure schematized showing the location of the polymorphisms characterised in this study i.e. one SNP (R in IUPAC codification) and one microsatellite identified in the distant 5' flanking sequence; SNP (Y) patented by Greger [18] was found in the proximal promoter and SNP (R) previously characterised by Grindfleck et al. [] was found in the first exon; two new SNP (R and R) in the first intron and two consecutive SNP (WK) in the second intron were also detected; composition and position in Mb () of SNP marker groups: (1) over the 64.38-64.65 Mb region with M1 = ALGA0042289; M2 = INRA0026201; M3 = ASGA0034277; M4 = DRGA007689; M5 = ALGA0042294; M6 = H3GA0021937; (2) over the 65.13-65.33 Mb region with M7 = ASGA0034288; M8 = INRA0026223; M9 = ALGA0042315; M10 = ASGA0034291; (3) over the 65.91-66.11 Mb region with M11 = H3GA0021967; M12 = ASGA0034309; M13 = ASGA0034310; M14 = MARC0076146 and (4) over the 68.27-68.56 Mb region with M15 = INRA0026286; M16 = MARC0099388; M17 = inra0026290; M18 = ALGA0042359  appeared to be a promising candidate gene for the QTL for androstenone variation since its product  the CYP11A1 enzyme  catalyses the initial step of androstenone synthesis. Moreover  Moe et al. [] and Grindfleck et al. [] had already detected differential expression of  in the testes of boars with various extreme androstenone levels in fat. The cDNA of  is known in pig (NM_214427) and the sequencing of BAC CH242-402H17 is underway. We performed several assemblies of sub-clone sequences starting with exon sequences. To capture the 5' flanking sequence  we used human sequences and in particular a regulatory region (HSA15:74665162-74667983). We were able to propose an initial assembly (HQ687747) with four genomic fragments schematized on Figure .  gene is composed of nine exons in most mammals. Pig intron 1 (3205 bp) is significantly shorter than the human counterpart (19261 bp) but longer than the mouse one (975 bp). To characterise polymorphisms  the corresponding human 19 kb long intron 1 was sequenced in several animals chosen from the 480 LW animals. One SNP (R according to IUPAC codification) and one microsatellite were identified in the distant 5' flanking sequence. SNP (Y) patented by Greger [] was found in the proximal promoter and SNP (R)  previously characterised by Grindfleck et al. []  was found in the first exon. In the first intron  two new SNP (R and R) and in the second intron  two consecutive SNPs (WK) were detected. Thus  seven SNP and two microsatellites (with SW1418) were available to explore the  region. It would have been interesting to analyse variations of the testicular  expression in animals from this LW population but no samples were available. Fortunately  expression of  in the testis of animals from other LW families could be estimated by real-time PCR. The results are shown in Table . In family A  the level of  expression ranged between 200 and 600 A.U. in the seven animals analysed  while in family B  two animals with a very high level of  expression (1425) and two animals with a low level (250) were found. Moreover four microsatellites were genotyped around  [see additional file   Table S1]  which allowed to deduce that the boar is homozygous -/-  the sow (61043) of family A is homozygous -/- and the sow (65472) of family B is heterozygous +/- for  expression level. Nevertheless  it is very likely that this latter sow (65472) is homozygous for the entire haplotype over this region [see additional file   Table S1]. Sow 65472 was genotyped for the 21 SNP (M1-M14 and 7 SNP related to ) and for two microsatellites (located 5' of  and SW1418). With the exception of M12  M13 and M14  all the markers were homozygous (data not shown). This female appeared to be homozygous for a large region (M1-M11) including SNP H3GA0021967. We examined the haplotypes of 480 LW animals for 14 SNP (M1 to M14) from the  region and found that 14 animals shared the same two SSC7 chromosomal regions present in sow 65472. Nevertheless  genotyping for three markers inside the  gene did not detect any animal carrying the 65472 sow's haplotype. Thus  we believe that the number of genotyped SNP is sufficient to assume that sow 65472 is homozygous for a large region (M1-M11) including SNP H3GA0021967. Since sow 65472 is considered as heterozygous for  expression level and homozygous for a haplotype in the M1-M11 large region  we hypothesized that the mutation controlling  expression is located downstream M11. This region was superimposed on the androstenone QTL region  which enabled us to suggest that a unique mutation located near the centre of the QTL region (M11-M14) could control androstenone accumulation in fat by regulating the  expression. We examined the haplotypes between M11-M14 in 480 LW animals (Table ). The GGAG haplotype in the third group of SNP (M11-M12-M13-M14) occurred at a high frequency in the population (0.48) and had a negative effect on androstenone level []. Since homozygous GGAG animals had a statistically significant lower level of androstenone than animals GGAG/TAGA or TAGG/TAGG (Table )  we suggest that haplotypes TAGA and TAGG could have a positive effect on androstenone level. Furthermore  we analysed  expression in LW families according to haplotypes specifically of the QTL region. Haplotypes of the region between markers M11 and M14 in 22 animals characterised for  expression are shown in Table . Only two animals (75010 and 75011) considered as heterologous for  expression level had haplotype TGAG  the fourth haplotype characterised in the 480LW population and for which it was not possible to evaluate its effect on androstenone accumulation. Nevertheless these two animals have a paternal haplotype GGAG or TAGG which could have a contrary effect on androstenone level. Moreover  we found six animals GGAG/TAGA expected as +/- and seven animals TAGG/TAGA expected as +/+ for androstenone accumulation with no significant difference in  expression (Table ). Haplotypes of the M11-M14 region in these 22 LW animals characterised for  expression level are not concordant with those of the 480 LW animals. Effects of the QTL region's haplotype on  expression level and androstenone accumulation are different. This study suggests that the variation of  expression level is probably not regulated by a mutation located inside the  gene but rather by a mutation located downstream of the SNP H3GA0021967. In the French Large White population  the QTL for androstenone is mapped near this SNP. This co-location is probably a coincidence since haplotypes of the M11-M14 region of animals characterised for  expression and of animals characterised for the QTL for androstenone are not concordant. This study shows that the testicular expression of  is not the main cause of this QTL for androstenone. As a conclusion  we propose to refute the hypothesis that a single mutation located near the centre of the QTL region (M11-M14) could control androstenone accumulation in fat by regulating the CYP11A1 expression.

If the aim is to reduce susceptibility  earlier termination of the challenge-test or back-truncation of the follow-up period should be avoided  as this may shift focus of selection towards endurance rather than susceptibility. Genetic evaluation of resistance against infectious diseases in aquaculture species is typically based on data from challenge-tests  where individuals are exposed to the relevant pathogen under controlled environmental conditions. Traditionally  such evaluations have been based on cross-sectional models  i.e.  models considering survival as an all-or-non trait (survived/dead at a specific point in time). More recent studies in aquaculture species have suggested using more advanced longitudinal survival models []  such as proportional hazards frailty models [] or survival score models []. These models take into account not only whether the individual survives a given time period  but also time until death. A typical assumption in survival analysis is that all individuals are at risk  i.e.  censored lifespans are simply the result of a limited follow-up period. However  this assumption is violated if a fraction of the individuals are non-susceptible (e.g.  not infected or tolerant)  which is not unlikely when testing for resistance against specific pathogens [e.g.  [  ]]. Given that a fraction of non-susceptible individuals exists  mortality is expected to level out when the majority of the susceptible individuals have died  rather than approaching 100%. Genetic evaluations of binary traits are expected to be most accurate at intermediate frequencies []. To achieve this  challenge-tests in aquaculture breeding programs have often been terminated at intermediate but still increasing mortalities  or evaluation datasets have been back-truncated at such frequencies. However  this would only be an advantage when analyzing survival data with cross-sectional models that treat survival as a binary trait. For classical longitudinal survival models  high mortality (and thus limited censoring) would be an advantage in genetic analysis []. Furthermore  the practice of early termination or back-truncation is based on the assumption that survival time and long-term survival under exposure to the pathogen are equivalent genetic traits. Given the presence of non-susceptible individuals  this may not be the case. For example  in wild Atlantic salmon  some Baltic populations are to a large extent tolerant to the ectoparasite   while East Atlantic stocks are highly susceptible [  ]  leading to mass mortalities in infected rivers []. Hence  comparing these populations on survival time would be inappropriate. Furthermore  even within a highly susceptible Norwegian river population  a small fraction of long-term survivors was identified. In the latter population  susceptibility (long-term survival) and endurance (time until death of non-survivors) appeared to have a low genetic correlation  indicating that these two aspects of parasite resistance are genetically distinct traits []. Given that a non-susceptible fraction exists and that endurance and susceptibility are distinct genetic traits  selection programs for improved disease resistance would (if given the opportunity) most likely favor improvement of non-susceptibility over endurance  as the latter may postpone mortality rather than avoid it in the long run. Existence of non-susceptible individuals may also reduce pathogenic pressure in the population  while highly endurant (but infected) individuals may produce large numbers of infectious disease agents during their long period of infection. Still  in real disease testing schemes  follow-up periods are often limited due to practical considerations  and survivors are thus expected to be a mixture of non-susceptible and susceptible individuals with censored lifespans. A mixture cure model [] is a survival model that attempts to distinguish susceptible and non-susceptible (\"cured\") survivors  which may be of great advantage in the analysis of time-to-event data that contain a cure fraction. Taura syndrome (TS) is an economically important viral disease affecting Panaeid shrimp and has been responsible for mass mortality in Pacific white shrimp (). The Taura syndrome virus (TSV) was first discovered in South America  but has later spread to North America  Hawaii and Asia []. A substantial underlying heritability (0.30 ± 0.13) has been estimated for TS resistance  and selective breeding is successfully implemented; i.e.  survival after exposure to TSV increased by 18.4% after only one generation of selection for TS resistance []. Furthermore  in a Colombian mass selection program for TS resistance  overall survival in TSV infected areas is now back to the levels prior to the first outbreak of TS []. The aim of the study was to apply a cure model to survival data from challenge testing of Pacific white shrimp with TSV and to compare this model with classical models of analysis of such data. The study was based on recorded survival times of 15 261 Pacific white shrimp from Colombia. The shrimp originated from 513 full-sib families (266 sires and 484 dams). The parents were selected for TS resistance and growth through a combined individual and family-based selection program []. The dataset contained individuals from seven different batches  including three consecutive generations. Parents were used across several batches  resulting in good genetic ties between the different groups in the dataset. All families were kept separate in different tanks until they were individually tagged when the population reached the average size of one gram (normally eight weeks after hatching). Animals from the same full-sib family were randomly selected and tagged with a common color code by injecting differently colored fluorescent elastomers into the 6th abdominal segment of each animal. Each batch was tested separately in three different test-tanks. Shrimp from the first batch were orally infected with TSV-infected minced muscle tissue for seven consecutive days at a feeding intensity of 10% of the tank biomass per day. Due to low mortality  the animals of the second batch onward were infected through intramuscular injections of 20 µL of a purified inoculum of the pathogen. For each test  mortalities were recorded on an hourly basis until no more dead animals were recorded for 24 hours. The length of the recording periods in the different test lasted from 18 to 30 days (Figure ). . The different challenge tests are numbered as \"batch_tank\" (batches 17 to 23). Survival times in hours were transformed to test-day (24 h) binary survival scores. Hence  the number of records per individual equals the number of days (measured from the time of the first observed mortality in the test) until death or censoring. For each period  an individual was scored as dead (= 1) if it was recorded as dead during that period and as alive (= 0) otherwise  e.g.  an animal dying at day 4 had survival scores of [0 0 0 1]. The model and Bayesian setup is described in more detail by Ødegård .[]. Here  the probability of an individual  being censored ( = 1) at the end of the follow-up period (survival time  = ) is: where  is the susceptibility status (susceptible = 1; non-susceptible = 0)   is the endurance score for period   i.e. whether individual  survives (0) or dies (1) in time period   given that it is susceptible. Given  and   the cure model is reduced to a bivariate threshold model  where the first trait (susceptibility status  ) is whether the animal is susceptible to the disease  and the second trait consists of endurance scores ()  which are only observable for putatively susceptible animals ( = 1). The corresponding underlying liabilities of the two traits were analyzed with the following model (CURE): where and are vectors of liabilities associated with endurance scores and susceptibility statuses  respectively   is a vector of \"fixed\" effects (batch-tank and overall mean for endurance and susceptibility  respectively)   is a vector of random (batch-tank) test-day effects on   with variance    is a vector of random batch-tank effects on   with variance    is a vector of random additive genetic effects of all individuals   is a vector of random common environmental family effects (i.e.  potential effects of separate rearing of families prior to tagging  maternal effects and dominance genetic effects)   is a vector of random residuals associated with both traits   is the genetic co-variance matrix   is the co-variance matrix of common environmental family effects   is the additive genetic relationship matrix and  denotes an identity matrix of appropriate size. As endurance can only be observed in putatively susceptible individuals  the residual covariance between the two underlying traits is not identifiable and was restricted to be zero []  as indicated above. In the CURE model  the susceptibility status ( ) of a survivor   surviving  days in a given test was sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with a conditional probability for susceptibility [] calculated as: where  is a vector of all location parameters  the  vectors are appropriate row incidence vectors associated with the location parameters of the endurance and susceptibility liabilities of the individual. The standard normal cumulative density function  is thus the prior probability of being susceptible ( = 1) for individual  (given the model parameters) and  is the probability (given the model parameters) for individual  to survive until day  (end of test)  given that the individual is susceptible. Based on observed survival time and the sampled putative susceptibility status  we defined a set of putative \"endurance scores\"  which were defined based on the recorded survival time and censoring status (as described above) for the putatively susceptible individuals  and defined as missing for the putatively non-susceptible ones (as endurance does not influence survival time in non-susceptible animals). Given the endurance scores and the susceptibility statuses  all parameters of the CURE model were sampled as in a standard bivariate threshold model using Gibbs sampling. For comparison purposes the survival data were also fitted using a \"naïve\" (assuming that all individuals are susceptible) survival score threshold model (NAÏVE) and a simple cross-sectional threshold model for observed survival until the end of test (SIMPLE). The NAÏVE model was: where  is a vector of liabilities associated with the survival scores  and the other parameters are as described above. The SIMPLE model was: where  is a vector of liabilities associated with observed survival to the end of test  is a vector of fixed batch-tank effects and the other parameters are as described above. To avoid bias problems typical of animal threshold models []  genetic (co)variance components were estimated with an algorithm that was based on parental breeding values only []  while all other dispersion and location parameters were estimated as in a standard animal threshold model. All genetic analyses were performed using a modified Gibbs sampling module in the DMU software package []. Convergence was checked through visual inspection of trace plots and Raftery and Lewis diagnostics []. The NAÏVE and SIMPLE models were run in single chains for 110 000 rounds  discarding the initial 10 000 rounds as burn-in  and storing parameters of every 10 sampling round. The CURE model had considerably slower mixing compared with the SIMPLE and NAÏVE models and two separate longer chains were thus chosen for this model (2×340 000 rounds  discarding the first 40 000 as burn-in). Two separate chains rather than one long chain were chosen to reduce the computing time (which varied between 82 h to 123 h)  and results were averaged across the two chains. Due to limitations in storing capacity  samples from every 100 rounds were kept for the latter model. Descriptive statistics of the data set are given in Table   and Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the different tanks and batches are given in Figure . Across challenge-tests  the average mortality was 28% but varied substantially between tests. Environment and management (water temperature and tank densities) were standardized across tanks and batches to achieve as high as possible mortality during the testing period  and no clear phenotypic trends over generations and batches were therefore evident. Even though the tests lasted until mortality naturally stopped  survival was above 50% in all challenge tests. Furthermore  most survival curves showed a clear tendency towards flattening out at moderate or high frequencies  which is consistent with a substantial fraction of non-susceptible individuals in the population. Results of the current analyses are presented in Table . Based on the SIMPLE model  the underlying heritability of end-survival was substantial (h = 0.39 ± 0.06). The fraction of underlying variance explained by common environmental effects was small (c = 0.05 ± 0.02) but significant (based on a likelihood ratio test  using a linear model). Likewise  the NAÏVE model also indicated moderate heritable variation for endurance  with an estimated underlying heritability of 0.16 ± 0.03 for test-day endurance scores  while common environmental family effects explained only a minor part of the total underlying variance for endurance scores (c = 0.02 ± 0.01). The estimated test-day (environmental) variance was rather small and explained only 9% of the underlying variation in endurance liability (posterior mean). For the CURE model  the posterior mean of the percentage of putative susceptible shrimp was 38% (± 1%)  while 28% of the shrimp actually died (Table ). Hence  across tests  86% ((1-0.38)/(1-0.28) = 0.86) of the survivors were considered as non-susceptible. For the CURE model  the estimated underlying heritability (h = 0.07 ± 0.03) for endurance was smaller than for the NAÏVE model  while the estimated underlying heritability of susceptibility was similar (h = 0.41 ± 0.07) to the estimated heritability for end-survival for the SIMPLE model. The genetic correlation between endurance and susceptibility within the CURE model tended to be positive but not significantly different from zero (r = 0.22 ± 0.25). Furthermore  the sampled genetic correlation between endurance and susceptibility was lower than 0.8 in 99% of the sampling rounds of the Gibbs chain  indicating that endurance and susceptibility should be considered as distinct genetic traits. As for the other models  common environmental effects explained a relatively small part of the underlying liability variance for both endurance and susceptibility for the CURE model (c = 5% and c = 7%  respectively). The correlation between common environmental effects on the two traits was low (r = -0.06 ± 0.05). Finally  the random tank-test-day effects for endurance and the random batch-tank effects for susceptibility explained a relatively small fraction of the underlying liability variances (posterior means of 11% and 7%  respectively). Table  shows the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between predicted breeding values (EBV) from the three models. Correlations between EBV of the SIMPLE and NAÏVE models were close to unity (0.99)  and both models showed very high correlations (0.98-0.99) with the EBV of susceptibility in the CURE model; while the correlations with the endurance EBV were substantially lower (0.57-0.63). Similarly  the EBV for endurance and susceptibility from the CURE model were only moderately correlated to each other (0.50-0.51). The estimated underlying heritability of end-survival using the SIMPLE model was substantial (0.39 ± 0.06). This is in line with previously reported estimates of heritability for survival to TS (0.30 ± 0.13) from a different population of Pacific white shrimp []. The NAÏVE model also indicated considerable heritable variation for survival scores  but lower than for end-survival. This was expected  as the model splits the lifespan in several shorter periods. The estimated underlying heritability of susceptibility from the CURE model was similar (0.41 ± 0.07) to the estimated heritability of end-survival from the SIMPLE model  which may be due to the fact that challenge-tests were continued until mortality naturally ceased. Hence  few susceptible individuals were likely to survive  which is supported by the high fraction of putatively \"cured\" animals among the survivors in the CURE model (86%). The estimated heritability for endurance from the CURE model was about half the corresponding heritability of the NAÏVE model  i.e.  in a standard survival model  the more highly heritable susceptibility status is likely to dominate survival time and thereby increase the estimated genetic variance. Based on the results from the CURE model  endurance and susceptibility appear to be distinct genetic traits with respect to TS resistance. If the aim is to improve long-term survival to TS in the population  selection for increased time until death or survival to the end of test is therefore likely to be suboptimal  and more so if testing is based on data from challenge-tests with short follow-up periods or survival data that are back-truncated to a point in time where mortality is still increasing. In a simulation study  it was concluded that if selection aims at improving susceptibility the error of applying a classical \"non-cure\" survival model was non-neglible  especially if endurance and susceptibility were lowly genetically correlated and when genetic variance of endurance is substantial []. However  by using the current testing strategy where the testing period continues until mortality naturally ceases  there were small practical differences between selection for increased survival using classical models (SIMPLE and NAÏVE) and the more advanced CURE model. Hence  correlations between EBV of the SIMPLE and NAÏVE models were close to unity  and both models showed good agreement with the EBV for susceptibility from the CURE model. Still  the EBV for endurance from the CURE model were only moderately correlated to EBV for susceptibility from that same model (and to EBV for the SIMPLE and NAÏVE models). These results indicate that genetic variation in recorded end-survival and time until death of the current data set are dominated by genetic variation in susceptibility. Furthermore  stopping the test at an earlier stage would shift the focus of selection towards endurance (especially for classical models). In a theoretical study  Ødegård . [] have shown that a truly positive genetic correlation between endurance and susceptibility in a cure model may be underestimated as result of large uncertainty (giving more room for downward than upward errors). This could in part explain the low genetic correlation obtained for endurance and susceptibility in this study. Still  based on the range of the sampled genetic correlations  the true genetic correlation between endurance and susceptibility is likely far from unity (as only 1% of the sampled genetic correlations were above 0.8). In the current study  tank-test-day effects were defined as random  implying the assumption that test-day effects are randomly distributed around the overall mean in each test. If the hazard rate (for the susceptible individuals) changes substantially over time during each test  these effects should ideally be fitted as fixed  to better account for potentially large temporal shifts in the hazard. However  preliminary analyses showed that fitting tank-test-day effects as fixed resulted in extreme-category problems in the cure model (results not shown). This is due to the fact that susceptibility statuses are unknown and thus inferred through the Gibbs sampler. Hence  at some point  all survivors in a specific test may be viewed as being non-susceptible (i.e.  all remaining susceptible individuals die during the last test-day)  resulting in extreme-category problems for the endurance trait. These problems were solved by fitting the tank-test-day effects as random []. Likewise  fitting the batch-tank effect for susceptibility as fixed may cause similar problems (i.e.  as all individuals in a given tank at some point may be viewed as susceptible). These effects were therefore also fitted as random for the susceptibility trait in the CURE model. The NAÏVE model is a sub-model of the CURE model when assuming 100% susceptible animals. Hence  if the NAÏVE model is the true model underlying the data  the estimated susceptible fraction is expected to approach 100%  as has been observed in simulated data sets []. However  in the data analyzed here  the susceptible fraction was very accurately estimated at 38% (± 1) and was never even close to the value assumed by the NAÏVE model. As previously mentioned  all challenge-tests were continued until mortality stopped for 24 h. Despite this  mortality never approached 100% in any of the challenge-tests. Thus  the study gives clear evidence for the existence of a substantial fraction of Colombian Pacific white shrimp being non-susceptible to TS. In aquaculture breeding programs  challenge tests for infectious diseases have frequently been terminated at intermediate and often still increasing mortality. The reason for this (apart from obvious practical and economical limitations in follow-up time) is that genetic evaluations have frequently been based on survival measured as a binary trait  for which intermediate frequencies are advantageous in genetic evaluation. However  if the aim is to reduce susceptibility  rather than prolonging time until death (increase endurance)  this is not optimal. Actually  terminating the test at a still increasing mortality implies that selection is shifted towards improved endurance rather than reduced susceptibility. If possible  challenge tests should therefore continue until mortality naturally ceases  as this maximizes the potential importance of susceptibility status on the recorded end-survival (and survival/censoring time). This testing strategy is thus optimal for the CURE model and will also minimize differences in ranking of selection candidates among different statistical models (SIMPLE  NAÏVE and CURE) and  thus  increase robustness of the genetic evaluations. For classical survival models in general  a high degree of censoring is always viewed as unfavorable  as this is considered as loss of information. For cure survival models  a high degree of censoring may  however  be an advantage  provided that this to a large extent is explained by presence of non-susceptible individuals. The proposed cure model can be extended to involve single gene effects and/or genomic breeding values. For example  a cure survival model has been used to discriminate between single gene effects on incidence and latency of scrapie in sheep []. In Atlantic salmon  a major QTL has been identified that gives virtually complete protection against the viral disease infectious pancreatic necrosis []  indicating that a cure survival model may be appropriate for this trait. Furthermore  the cure model can be used to account for incomplete exposure to infection in field data  i.e.  the \"cured\" animals may be unexposed (in this case susceptibility has no heritability). If not accounted for  presence of unexposed animals could give downwardly biased estimates of the underlying genetic variance of disease resistance [].

These results contribute towards a better understanding of the genetic background of leg weakness in pigs. Leg weakness (LW) has a great impact on fitness and longevity of animals  which influences not only animal welfare but also production and reproduction performance. It has been shown that between 20 and 50% of boars completing performance tests are rejected as breeding animals because of LW problems []. Genetic correlations between LW-related traits and longevity in breeding sows have been reported and suggest that a better leg status would decrease involuntary culling [  ]. Heritability estimates have been reported for LW in Duroc  Landrace  and Yorkshire sires i.e. 0.23  0.30 and 0.39  respectively []  and for an overall leg score in Landrace and Large White sows  i.e. 0.27 and 0.38  respectively []. In addition  osteochondrosis (OC) is regarded as the main cause of LW in pig [  ]. OC is a skeletal disease characterized by disturbed bone formation  cartilage retention  or necrosis of the cartilage canal in articular cartilage [  ] and results in economic losses mainly due to the culling of pigs in the breeding industry []. The disease occurs at high frequencies in growing pigs in all commercial breeds []. The estimated heritability of OC ranges from 0.06 to 0.5 [      ] in different pig breeds. Moreover  OC is reported to have negative effects on important performance traits such as sow longevity  growth and feed conversion rate [  ]. In addition to OC  bone mineral density (BMD) is generally regarded as an important parameter to assess bone growth and is associated with bone fracture risk and structural soundness in pigs. Studies in humans have shown that variation in BMD can be explained by genetic factors [  ]. Taken together  all the data reported so far imply that LW-related traits have a low to moderate heritability. Nevertheless  genetic studies of LW-related traits in growing and finishing pigs are limited. A significant number of QTL for performance traits has been reported in pigs [] but few studies have been devoted to LW-related traits []. Therefore  the aim of this study was to investigate QTL for LW-related traits  including leg and feet scores  OC and bone mineral traits in a Duroc × Pietrain resource population. In this study  we used 310 F pigs from a Duroc × Pietrain resource population comprising three generations  Parent (P)  F  and F pigs  and which had been previously analysed to detect QTL for growth  carcass and meat quality traits []. The F pigs were generated by mating six F males with 25 F females. All animals were maintained at the Frankenforst experimental research farm at the University of Bonn. Piglets were weaned at 28 days of age  males were castrated prior to weaning and placed in pens in the post-weaning unit until 10 weeks of age. The F pigs were given an  diet during the whole test period and were slaughtered at approximately 105 kg live weight at around 25-26 weeks of age in the slaughterhouse of the research farm Schwarzenau in Bavaria  Germany. Tissue samples from the tail were collected within the first week after birth for DNA isolation. Before slaughter  legs and feet were scored by the same person  using the criteria listed in additional file   Table S1 as guidelines to make assessments. The traits were recorded according to the rules of German performance stations []. Each 'leg score' is an assessment of the strength and straightness of the legs and of the stability of the joints. Leg scores ranged from 1 to 5  the optimum level being 3. Data were then transformed into a desirability scale  by using the absolute value of the original scores after subtracting three scores (score 3 becomes 0 for optimum leg score  score 2 and 4 become 1 for moderate leg score  and score 1 and 5 become 2 for poor leg score). For feet  the angle and strength of feet/leg attachment  soundness of toes and weight distribution on toes were assessed and given a score value between 1 (poor) and 3 (good). Leg and feet scores were measured on pigs walking on a solid concrete floor. After slaughter  the left fore and rear legs were removed from the carcass to carry out histological examinations of OC lesions. As OC is a bilaterally symmetrical syndrome  it was decided to examine only the left legs. The recorded OC lesions were scored 1 to 4  4 for normal and 3 to 1 for mildly to severely affected (Additional file   Figure ). OC lesions were evaluated on the head of the humerus (HH)  condylus medialis humeri (CMH)  head of the femur (HF) and the condylus medialis femoris (CMF). The histological examination assessed cartilage thickness  cartilage degradation and the vessel structure of cartilage canals. The histological procedures that were used have been described by Laenoi et al. []. The number of animals with OC on different joints ranged between 274 and 279 (Table ). A total of 1 108 samples (532 from castrated and 576 from female pigs) out of 1 240 samples were phenotyped. In addition  the whole ulna and radius bones from the left carcass were stripped of all surrounding tissues and the bone mineral-related traits (BMD  BMC and BMA) were examined using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) []. In total 275 animals were phenotyped for the DXA traits (Table ). . Marker positions along each chromosome are indicated in cM on the x-axis  and  values are given along the y-axis; 5% chromosome-wide (dotted line)  and 1% chromosome-wide (solid line) Markers used for genotyping were mainly selected from the USDA/MARC map () and included 79 microsatellites and three biallelic markers. Marker order and genetic distances between markers are described in additional file   Table S2. Genotyping  electrophoresis  and allele determination were carried out with a LI-COR 4200 Automated Sequencer (DNA Analyzer  GENE reader 4200). Allele and genotyping errors were checked using Pedcheck software (v 1.1) []. In addition to the microsatellite markers  SNP in genes assumed to affect cartilage quality were included  i.e. SNP located in the COL10A1 and MMP3 genes. Sequences were obtained from GenBank (accession no AF222861 and FJ788664 for porcine COL10A1 and MMP3  respectively) and assays were designed to permit genotyping using a multiplex SNP genotyping platform (Beckman Coulter). The relative positions of the markers were assigned using the build  two-point and fixed options of CRIMAP software  version 2.4 []. Recombination units were converted into map distances using the Kosambi mapping function. Marker information content and segregation distortion were tested. A linkage map was constructed with a total length of 2588.7 cM and an average marker interval of 31.57 cM. The data were analysed using the software package SAS (v 9.2  SAS Inc.  CA  USA). Generalized linear models (PROC GLM) were used to identify the effects of sire  dam  age  sex  birth weight  daily weight gain  litter size  litter effect  parity  season  and of carcass weight and length at slaughter on the investigated traits (Additional file   Table S3). F QTL interval mapping was performed using the web-based program QTL Express [] available at . The basic QTL regression model used in the present study was: where: y = phenotype of the i offspring; µ = overall mean; F = fixed effect of litter; ß = regression coefficient on the covariate; cov = covariate of average daily gain for leg and feet score age for OC  and slaughter weight and carcass length for DXA; c = additive coefficient of the i individual at a putative QTL; c = dominance coefficient of the i individual at a putative QTL; a = additive effect of the putative QTL; d = dominance effect of the putative QTL; and e = residual error. The regression model was fitted at 1-cM intervals along each chromosome and the F-value for the QTL effect was calculated at each point. Thresholds for chromosome-wide significance were determined by 1000 data permutations [] for individual chromosomes. Significance at the 5% chromosome-wide (CW) level was considered suggestive  1% CW was considered significant and significance at the 5% genome-wide (GW) level as highly significant. To derive GW significance levels from the chromosome-wide significance levels  the Bonferoni correction was applied []. Empirical 95% confidence intervals (CI) and flanking markers for estimated QTL positions were obtained by applying the bootstrap approach with 1000 re-samplings []. The percentage of phenotype variation explained by a QTL was calculated as: where  MS is the mean square of the reduced model without QTL effects and MS is the mean square of the full model. Descriptive statistics of LW-related traits are given in Tables  and . It is important to note that in this study the direction of a desirable score is the difference between leg and feet scores and OC scores. For leg score  a low value is desirable but for feet and OC scores a high value is desirable. A high percentage of animals showed moderate fore feet scores (FFS) (79.4%) and good rear feet scores (RFS) (54.5%). Only 9.0% and 1.3% of animals showed poor feet scores for fore and rear feet  respectively. For the fore leg score (FLS)  42.3% of animals had a score value of 2 and for the rear leg score (RLS)  54.8% of animals had a score value of 3. Few animals had very poor leg scores (4.8% for fore leg and 0.3% for rear leg). Phenotypic correlations among FLS  RLS  FFS and RFS were low to medium  ranging from 0.19 to 0.44 (Table ). The percentage of severe OC lesions in the 1 108 cartilage samples was higher in the CMF of the knee joint compared to other joints. The CMH and HH of fore limbs had healthier scores than CMF and HF. Phenotypic correlations among OC scores were very low  ranging from -0.13 to 0.12 (Table ). BMD and BMC were not significantly different between castrated male pigs and female pigs (Table ). The phenotypic correlation between BMD and BMC was positive (r = 0.70   < 0.01). Parity  carcass length  weight at slaughter  age and average daily gain had significant (P < 0.05) effects on the measured traits (Table S2). Parity  carcass length and average daily gain had significant (P < 0.05) effects on FLS but only average daily gain (ADG) had an effect on RLS. Parity showed effects on FFS  HH  CMH and HF. Age also had an effect on HF. Parity  carcass length and weight at slaughter affected all DXA traits. BMD and BMC were highly correlated ( < 0.01) with the animals' weight at slaughter (r = 0.54 and 0.71  respectively). The results of the QTL analysis are given in Table . Eleven QTL were identified for LW-related traits on eight autosomes. Most QTL had highly significant dominance effects and three QTL were additive. Two chromosomal regions were identified for FFS ( = 0.05  CW)  at 166 cM on SSC1 and at 36 cM on SSC16. Two QTL  at 87 cM ( = 0.05  CW) on SSC6 and at 26 cM on SSC18  were identified for RLS. No QTL was found for rear feet score and fore leg score. QTL associated with OC were located on SSC2  3  6  10 and 14. The OC score of HH was influenced by three QTL regions  on SSC2  3  and 6 at 14  13 and 61 cM  respectively. A QTL for CMH was identified at 0 cM on SSC14. One QTL affecting OC score of CMF was identified on SSC10 at 70 cM. However  no suggestive QTL was found for OC score of HF. Two QTL were identified for bone mineral-related traits  one for BMD and one for BMC. A QTL for BMD was found on SSC3 at 71 cM. Only one QTL was detected for BMC  at 0 cM on SSC2. Both QTL for BMD and BMC reached a 5% GW significance. In this study  most of the detected QTL appeared to have effects on only one trait  showing no effects on other traits. However  some chromosomal regions influenced more than one trait  notably on SSC2  3 and 6. In this study  we evaluated conformation traits describing leg and feet condition  osteochondrosis score and bone mineral density  which are important in selection to reduce the risk of leg weakness in pigs. However  the genetics of LW-related traits is complex [  ]. A number of factors are known to influence the development of LW  such as nutrition imbalance  high body weight  rapid growth rate  bone and joint diseases  bad body and leg structure  and mechanical stress [  ]. Moreover  it has been reported that the degree of LW and OC may be related to the breed and sex of animals []. However  in our study there was no effect of gender on LW-related traits  which implies that frequencies of LW and OC vary and depend on the genetic background of the animals []. It has been reported that the Duroc pure breed shows the highest incidence of OC compared to other European pig breeds (Pietrain  Landrace and Yorkshire) []. Our data suggest that the unfavourable QTL allele for OC originates from both Duroc and Pietrain breeds (i.e. two QTL originated from the Duroc and three from the Pietrain) (Table ) and that in Duroc and Pietrain crossbred animals  the fore legs are less susceptible to OC than the rear legs. Andersson-Eklund et al. [] have also reported lower OC incidences in the humerus than in the femur in a Wild boar × Large White population. In addition  our data show that the frequency of OC is high (31.05%) at CMF  which agrees with a previous report of 30.0% by Kadarmideen et al. []. QTL analyses for leg weakness and bone-related traits have been performed in different pig breeds  including Landrace purebred []  White Duroc × Erhualian [  ]  Large White × Meishan []  Duroc × Landrace and Duroc × Large White crossbred []  and Wild boar × Large White []. To the best of our knowledge  our study is the first to map QTL for LW-related traits in a Duroc and Pietrain intercross. We have identified 11 QTL some of which being novel and some confirming previous studies [  ]  as described in the next section. However  large confidence regions were obtained in this experiment  which represents a common problem in QTL studies and hampers the comparison of QTL results and their interpretation in terms of causative genes  since large confidence intervals can contain many potential candidate genes []. In this study  a QTL for FFS was detected on SSC1 at 166 cM. QTL for the same trait have been reported at 89 cM in a Landrace purebred [] and at 52 cM in a Large White × Meishan intercross [] on the same chromosome. The dominant QTL for FFS found on SSC16 at 36 cM is close to a previously reported dominant QTL at 27 cM for rear leg score []. The QTL identified for RLS on SSC6 and SSC18 are new and do not overlap with any previous study. A QTL associated with rear leg score was observed on SSC6  close to marker  (SSC6q2.1)  where the gene for transforming growth factor-beta 1 () is located []. This gene is an important candidate for LW-related traits since TGFß1 is a potent regulator of cell proliferation and influences the size and shape of the limb []. We identified a QTL for the OC score at HH on SSC2 at 14 cM  while Christensen et al. [] have reported QTL associated with cartilage thickening of the medial part of condylus humeri at 15 cM on the same chromosome. In addition  a QTL with dominance effect identified for the OC score at HH on SSC6 at 61 cM is located close to previously reported QTL for depression of the proximal edge of the radius at 51 cM [] and for physis score at 75 cM []. QTL for HH on SSC3 at 13 cM and for CMH on SSC14 at 0 cM are new QTL (Figure ). Interestingly  the QTL for CMF on SSC10 at 70 cM is close to a previously identified QTL regions at 75 cM for OC lesion in the subchondral bone of the medial part of condylus humeri and at 83 cM for fissure between cartilage and bone in pigs []. The QTL on SSC2 at 0 cM  close to marker  (SSC2p17)  was the only QTL detected for BMC. One of the highest linkage associations  reaching a 5% GW significance  was found on SSC3 at 71 cM for BMD. A potential candidate gene in this chromosomal region is the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor () gene  which directly regulates bone mass []. These QTL for BMC and BMD are novel and do not overlap with previously reported QTL. Most of the identified QTL show large dominance effects rather than additive affects (Table ). It is important to note that the transformation done on the leg score traits in this study did not change the identified QTL regions since the interval mapping results for these traits using the original score ranging from 1-5 or the scale 0-2 were the same. This implies that the transformation done on the leg score is not the reason for over-dominance in this experiment. In another QTL study in the same population  31 of 71 QTL for growth  fatness  leanness and meat quality traits have also shown high dominance effects []  as well as QTL for immune traits []. Lee et al. [] have also reported that most QTL for LW-related traits in a Large white × Meishan cross show dominance. In addition  using principal components analysis  Andersson-Eklund et al. [] have identified a QTL for OC with a significant and large effect of over-dominance. Therefore  the results from this study and from previous studies reported in the literature [  ] suggest that dominance plays a role in the genetic control of LW-related traits. Most of the traits analysed in this study are categorical rather than normally distributed. Previous studies have shown that the QTL analysis method [] used is suitable for categorical traits  with little loss of power [  ]. The low heritability of these traits indicates that they may be complex traits and may be under a polygenic control primarily by non-additive gene action or affected by a major gene with Mendelian transmission []. In this study  most of the QTL were identified as single-trait regions. This could be explained by the low phenotypic correlations observed between the traits in the population. This is the first study identifying QTL affecting leg weakness and its related traits in a fast growing cross bred pig population between the Duroc and Pietrain breeds. Multiple QTL were detected for leg and feet scores  implying that these traits are controlled by multiple genes and that information from more than one QTL must be incorporated in selection procedures. Our results reveal novel QTL regions on SSC2 for BMC  on SSC3 for HH  on SSC6 and SSC18 for RLS  and on SSC14 for CMH  and also support some previously reported QTL regions. Although confidence intervals are large  these results will help to fine-map and identify candidate genes in these QTL regions using additional markers or gene polymorphisms located in the identified regions for LW-related traits in pigs. average daily gain bone mineral density bone mineral content bone mineral area quantitative trait loci dual energy X-ray absorptiometry leg weakness fore leg score rear leg score fore feet score rear feet score osteochondrosis head of the humerus condylus medialis humeri head of the femur condylus medialis femori Duroc × Pietrain resource population.

The algorithm and software developed in this study make feasible the routine phasing of high-density SNP chips in large datasets. Knowing the phase of marker genotype data can be useful in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)  because it makes it possible to use analysis frameworks that account for identity by descent (IBD) or parent of origin of alleles [] and it can lead to a large increase in data quantities via genotype or sequence imputation e.g. [  ]. Phasing entire genomes in GWAS datasets has been a computational bottleneck due to the unavailability of robust heuristic phasing methods when a family structure does not exist and to the computationally intensive nature of statistically based phasing methods  e.g. fastPHASE [] and Beagle []. Long-range phasing (LRP) is a fast and accurate heuristic method for phasing of marker genotypes  which uses information from both related and seemingly unrelated individuals by invoking the concepts of surrogate parents and Erdös numbers  as defined in Kong et al. []. In comparison to phasing methods based on statistical inference  LRP has been reported to be 1 000 times faster with a 34% lower error rate than fastPHASE []. However  while LRP is powerful and efficient  the method is not fully robust. Applying LRP can result in parts of a given dataset being not phased or phased incorrectly. Incorrect identification of surrogate parents leads to incorrect phasing and this can occur when there is insufficient combinatorial power in the data to correctly identify  partition  or eliminate surrogate parents  or when genotyping errors exist. For any given locus  failure to find information pertaining to phase within the surrogate parents of an individual results in the locus being unphased. The objective of this research was to expand the LRP algorithm of Kong et al. [] in several ways to improve its robustness and ability to access more of the information contained within a dataset. We use the term long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation (LRPHLI) for the expanded algorithm  combining the concept of long-range phasing (LRP) and haplotype library imputation (HLI). In order to handle insufficient combinatorial power and errors in genotypes or physical maps  LRPHLI uses information from multiple surrogate parents and a more robust definition of surrogacy using the concepts of cores and tails (defined below). The LRPHLI partitions surrogate parents into paternal/maternal surrogates with or without pedigree information. A method to impute phase by HLI was developed to increase the overall phasing yield  particularly when the information pertaining to phase within the surrogate parents of an individual is insufficient. The haplotype library corrects mistakes created by false surrogate definition and/or genotyping errors. The performance of the method was evaluated using simulated data on both simulated and real pedigree structures as commonly found in livestock and human populations  with varying family sizes  depths of pedigree  historical effective population sizes  and SNP density. It was also evaluated using real human and livestock datasets. The method has been implemented in a new software package called AlphaPhase. The sections that follow describe the LRP method of Kong et al. []  the improvements made to LRP  the method of HLI  the simulated and real datasets that were used to test different aspects of the LRPHLI algorithm  and finally the performance of the LRPHLI algorithm. The LRP method of Kong et al. [] is illustrated in Figure . These authors have suggested to phase a string of consecutive SNP in a single genome region (termed a core in our algorithm) by first identifying surrogate parents of each proband. Surrogate parents are individuals who share a haplotype with the proband and are identified as those individuals that do not have any opposing homozygote genotypes with the proband []. We propose to identify surrogate parents based on both this core and adjacent 'tails' (Figure )  as further described below. These surrogates are termed Erdös 1 surrogates  meaning that they are one degree removed from the proband on the basis of haplotype identity []. The Erdös 1 surrogates of the proband are partitioned into surrogates of the paternal and maternal haplotypes. The partitioning of surrogate parents into surrogates of the paternal and maternal haplotypes is done in two ways: using pedigree information if it is available; and using a k-medoids clustering algorithm if it is not. Details on these strategies are given in Appendix A. . . For the proband  inference of the phase at each locus within the paternal/maternal haplotype is attempted by stepping through the paternal/maternal surrogates until a surrogate is found that is homozygous at that locus and thus can be used to declare the phase. This is termed accessing Erdös 1 information. If a homozygote is not found at Erdös 1  the algorithm proceeds to information from surrogates at the Erdös 2 layer. Erdös 2 surrogates of a proband are surrogates who do not share a haplotype with the proband but do share a haplotype with Erdös 1 surrogates of the proband. The algorithm can continue like this for as many Erdös layers as contained within the data (Figure ). Errors created due to incorrect surrogate identification are partially resolved by pruning from the surrogate list those surrogate parents whose haplotypes (phased by an earlier round of LRP) do not agree with the genotype of the proband (because of genotyping errors or insufficient combinatorial power to eliminate or partition surrogate parents properly)  and then re-phasing all individuals using the pruned list of surrogates. The expansions to the LRP algorithm proposed in this research are first described individually and then followed by a description of the entire LRPHLI algorithm. A core (Figure ) is defined as a consecutive string of SNP loci for which phasing is being attempted. Tails (Figure ) are defined as consecutive strings of SNP loci immediately adjacent to either end of a core. Information on homozygous loci across both core and tails are used to define surrogates. Specifically  opposing homozygotes between two individuals illustrates lack of IBD and surrogacy in that region. Tails provide additional information  thus reducing the risk of false surrogate definition  especially near the ends of the core region. Without using tails  combinatorial power may be insufficient at the ends of cores and this would result in failure to eliminate individuals that are not surrogate parents due to recombination events in these regions. For each core  each individual in a dataset has potentially many surrogate parents at each Erdös level and potentially many Erdös levels (Figure ). This information can be collapsed into a single square matrix of order equal to the number of individuals in the dataset with genotype information. For each individual  only information on Erdös 1 surrogate parents is stored explicitly  with this information identifying whether a surrogate parent is of the paternal haplotype  maternal haplotype  or of both. Surrogate parents at higher Erdös layers are thus stored implicitly. Storing an indicator as to whether a surrogate parent is paternal  maternal  or both  facilitates the use of the partitioned surrogates at the Erdös layer 1 while allowing all information to be used at higher Erdös layers. It is not necessary to partition the surrogates into maternal/paternal at higher Erdös layers []  giving greater flexibility and power. The algorithm attempts to phase each locus for each proband by sequentially stepping through each Erdös layer and accessing the surrogate parents at each of these layers until a target number of surrogate parents is accessed. Once this target number of surrogate parents is accessed  the phase is determined if a proportion of these greater than a small error threshold (i.e. <10%) agrees on what the phase is. If there is disagreement amongst the surrogate parents on what is the phase  a statistical significance test can be performed. The sequential approach ensures that even though individual surrogate parents can appear at several different Erdös levels  they are only used at their lowest Erdös level because the algorithm steps through the Erdös levels from the lowest to the highest. A restriction is included to ensure that the route to a homozygous surrogate parent can only pass through heterozygous surrogate parents. Phasing using consensus information from many surrogates reduces the impact of any individual surrogate. If information is used only from the first found homozygote  surrogate phasing error can result when false surrogates have been identified or when a surrogate contains a genotype error. Using information from multiple surrogates alleviates the need to carry out the surrogate pruning step of the Kong et al. [] algorithm. Identification of surrogates of a proband as individuals who show no opposing homozygotes with that proband across long strings of consecutive loci is easily disrupted by both genotype and mapping errors. This can be overcome by allowing a small percentage of opposing homozygotes without rejecting surrogacy. However this creates a new problem of increased numbers of individuals being identified as surrogates that are not in fact true surrogates. Several steps are taken to deal with this problem  including haplotype library imputation (described below)  using information from multiple surrogates  and removal of surrogates that break certain rules (described below). LRP may not work in some individuals for which there is insufficient surrogate information (e.g. due to a recombination in a gamete)  or for which surrogate information is inconsistent. Some of these problems can be overcome at the end of the LRP by building a library of all unique haplotypes that LRP has found in the dataset and sequentially imputing phase for unphased individuals from this library. At each round  individuals that have one of their pair of gametes unphased can have it phased as the complement of its phased gamete via the genotype. At each round  new haplotypes that have been created through recombination can be detected and added to the library. A number of steps (described in Appendix A) are invoked during HLI to determine if a suitable haplotype exists in the library and for it to be declared as phase for the unphased gamete of the proband. Step 1: Define start point and end point of the cores and tails. Step 2: Loop across the cores and complete the following steps for each core. Step 2a: Identify Erdös 1 surrogate parents for each genotyped individual by looping across all SNP in the core and tails and counting the numbers of homozygote genotypes in agreement and in disagreement between the individual and all other genotyped individuals. If the count of the loci in disagreement is less than a determined threshold (e.g. 2%)  an individual is taken to be a surrogate parent. Step 2b: Partition Erdös 1 surrogates into surrogates of the paternal or maternal gamete  using the mutually exclusive strategies that are listed in Appendix A pertaining to step 2b. Step 2c: Loop across the genotyped individuals and phase their loci based on information from the various Erdös levels as required  following strategies that are listed in the part of Appendix A that pertains to step 2c. Step 2d: Build a haplotype library containing all completely phased haplotypes found in the dataset. Step 2e: Impute the phase for gametes that are not completely phased by LRP by matching their phased loci to haplotypes in the haplotype library  following strategies listed in the part of Appendix A pertaining to step 2e. Step 2f: In each proband  all phased loci are paired to create a genotype and this genotype is checked for compatibility with the genotype and if across a whole core more than 10% disagreement is found  the heterozygous loci have their phase call removed for this proband. In this case  homozygous loci are assumed to have no genotyping error and are thus phased de facto for this core of this proband. Steps 2e and 2f are iterated until no new haplotypes are added to the library. Performance of the LRPHLI algorithm was tested using an extensive range of simulated and real datasets. In each simulation  a sample of haplotypes representing a single chromosome of 1 Morgan (100 000 000 base pairs) with the per-site mutation rate set to 10 was created using MaCS []  which invokes a neutral coalescent model. Two different population scenarios (Ne  and Ne)  which were based on the results of [  ]  were followed. Scenario Ne followed the effective population size (Ne) of Holstein cattle. Briefly  its current Ne was set to 100  the Ne 1 000 years ago to 1 200  the Ne 10 000 years ago to 4 500  and the Ne 800 000 years ago to 80 000  with gradual decreases in Ne in the intervening periods. The population with the larger Ne could reflect a sheep breed. Its historical Ne matched that of Ne from 800 000 years ago until 2000 years ago  while from 2000 years ago until the present time  its Ne remained at 1000. Scenario Ne created approximately 56 000 segregating sites along the 1 Morgan (100 000 000 base pairs) region  while Ne created approximately 115 000 segregating sites  with little sampling variation about these numbers. Either of these effective population sizes could possibly represent isolated human populations. The simulated haplotypes were then dropped through eight pedigrees  which reflect a spectrum of datasets for which LRPHLI may be suitable. These included pedigrees of completely unrelated individuals  pedigrees of small  intermediate and large half-sib family structures  general livestock pedigrees  and a general pedigree of an isolated human population. Details are in Appendix B. SNP arrays  for a single chromosome  with densities equivalent to 60 000 SNP per genome were created by randomly selecting 2 000 of the segregating sites which had minor allele frequencies of > 5% after the haplotypes had been dropped through the pedigree (60 k set). Briefly  the aims of the different simulation strategies were as follows. Pedigrees 1 to 4 tested the effect of family size  with four sire family sizes of 1  2  10  and 100. Pedigrees 5 to 8 were real pedigrees for livestock and human populations  which feature inbreeding loops and overlapping generations. Including and excluding genotypes on parental individuals in pedigrees 1 to 4 attempted to verify the importance of parental genotypes. Genotyping the sires rather than the last 2000 individuals in pedigrees 6 and 7 was designed to test the effect of more (sires) and less (last 2000) sparse relationships amongst genotyped individuals. To explore the effect of SNP density  a SNP array with a density of 300 000 SNP per genome (10 000 SNP per chromosome) was also created for the pedigree 1 Ne dataset (300 k set). To explore the effect of dataset size  four subsets of pedigree 1 were created  comprising 100  500  1000  and all 2000 individuals. To assess the sampling error  eight replicates of pedigree 1 Ne were carried out. Six real datasets (sheep  pig  beef cattle  dairy cattle  and human) were used to test the algorithm  all of these using SNP that had passed suitable sets of quality control criteria. The numbers of individuals genotyped  the numbers of SNP used  and the chromosome number are given in Table . The sheep and beef datasets had half-sib designs. The pig dataset comprised a full-sib family structure with highly related individuals and some half-sibs. The dairy dataset comprised bulls with progeny  young sires  and some bull dams. The pig dataset pedigree and data structure were actually that of pedigree 5 in the simulated datasets. The human dataset pedigree and data structure were actually that of pedigree 8 in the simulated datasets. The simulated datasets were phased using a wide range of core and core plus tail lengths (CplusT) and using and ignoring pedigree information. CplusT length encompasses the core length plus the two tail lengths of equal size adjacent to each end of the core. For example  when the core length is 100 and the CplusT length is 100  the tail length is zero  and when the core length is 100 and the CplusT length is 200  the tail length is 50 SNP. For the 60 k SNP datasets  we varied core lengths from 100 to 2000 SNP and CplusT lengths from 100 to 2000 SNP. For the 300 k SNP dataset core lengths varied from 400 to 10000 and CplusT length from 400 to 10000 SNP. For the real datasets  core and CplusT lengths were similar to those for the 60 k simulated datasets. For each of the datasets  genotype error/missing genotype thresholds () of 0%  1%  2%  3%  4%  and 5% were used and the pedigree information that was available was used. The method performed well in terms of percentage of alleles correctly phased ()  percentage of alleles incorrectly phased ()  and percentage of alleles not phased ()  across the wide spectrum of simulated scenarios when near optimal core and CplusT lengths were used. This was also the case in terms of the percentage of alleles phased () and % not phased across the wide spectrum of real datasets when near optimal core and CplusT lengths and M/E% thresholds were used. The results were not subject to large sampling variation  e.g.  the mean % correct for the eight independent replicates of pedigree 1 Ne was 99.15%  with minimum and maximum values of 99.11% and 99.19%  respectively. Therefore  the summary results presented in Table   for the most optimal core and CplusT lengths for each simulated scenario  are based on a single replicate of each scenario. The % correct was greater than 97% and the % incorrect was less than 0.66% for all simulated scenarios  with the exception of pedigree 8  which was the smallest dataset with 879 genotyped individuals. The highest % correct (99.76) was observed for pedigree 4 with parents genotyped and Ne. The lowest % correct (95.01) was observed for pedigree 8 Ne. When the % correct was high  the % incorrect was low  while when it was low  the % incorrect was still low. This shows the algorithm's robustness to error  even when the overall phasing yield (in terms of % of alleles phased) is low. The % phased was greater than 97.5% for all the real datasets (Table )  with the exception of the human pedigree. Ignoring pedigree information gave better % correct than using it in ten out of the twelve comparisons possible for Ne  although the differences were small (Table ). For Ne  ignoring pedigree information gave better % correct results in seven of the eleven comparisons and gave worse results in four scenarios (each of which had a half-sib design). However pedigree information generally reduced the % incorrect (Table )  meaning that pedigree information could be interpreted as being of marginally positive value. However differences were small in comparison to the absence of pedigree. The algorithm was invariant to family structure. Pedigree 1 comprised unrelated individuals  while pedigrees 2  3  and 4 comprised half-sib designs with sire family sizes of 2  10  and 100 respectively. These pedigrees showed very small differences in the % correct (< 0.5% for Ne and < 0.65% for Ne) (Table ) when all individuals were genotyped. Results from real livestock pedigrees confirmed these results  with very small differences in accuracy between sheep  pig and dairy cattle pedigrees. Genotype information on parents in pedigrees 2  3  and 4 gave slightly better results than not having it (Table )  with differences in % correct less than 1% in all cases except for pedigree 2 Ne  for which the difference in % correct was close to 2%. It is possible that these differences are due to the reduction in size of the datasets rather than a real effect of having parents genotyped (discussed in the next section). Two genotyping strategies were applied to pedigrees 6 and 7  one which genotyped the sires in these pedigrees and another which genotyped the 2000 most recently born individuals. The difference in these strategies was very small and no consistent trend was discernable. Pedigree 8 had the lowest number of individuals genotyped (879 individuals) and gave results that were noticeably worse than those of other datasets. To further explore the effect of dataset size  four subsets of the pedigree 1 dataset  with a random 100  500  and 1000 individuals  and all 2000 individuals  were used. The % correct increased with increasing dataset size; the 100  500  1000  and 2000 individuals datasets gave % correct of 71.61%  96.19%  98.14%  and 99.11%  respectively  suggesting that datasets of less than 1000 individuals are too small for providing accurate phasing results. The effect of SNP density was tested by comparing a 300 k density with the 60 k density for Pedigree 1 Ne. The results for the 300 k density were better than those of the 60 k density in terms of both % correct and % incorrect (99.11% correct and 0.30% incorrect for 60 k and 99.61% correct and 0.21% incorrect for 300 k). Similar to the 60 k density  small-sized cores and intermediate-sized CplusT gave the best results for the 300 k density  with the best results being obtained for a core of 400 SNP and a CplusT of 1200 SNP. Similar to the 60 k density  the 300 k density consistently gave very low % incorrect (< 0.62%) with all core or CplusT lengths  with the exception of those that were very short (i.e. = 800 SNP). Given appropriate adjustment of core and CplusT length  the algorithm was invariant to the two SNP densities tested  with core lengths of about 5 cM and CplusT lengths of about 15 cM being close to optimal for both. A wide range of core and CplusT lengths was explored for each pedigree and data scenario and for each effective population size. The observed trend across these scenarios was similar  with results for pedigree 1 Ne being illustrative (Figures     and ). Very long cores and CplusT's gave lower performance in terms of % correct because very long (e.g. 100 cM) haplotypes are more varied and have a lower frequency  making both the identification of surrogates and the HLI more difficult. Extremely short CplusTs and cores suffer from a lack of combinatorial power  resulting in difficulty in partitioning and eliminating surrogates and in difficulty for the haplotype imputation step to find unique pairs of haplotypes that explain the genotype (due to there being too many compatible haplotypes). The best results  in terms of % correct  were generally obtained by using a short core (100 SNP) and an intermediate CplusT length (300 to 500 SNP). In terms of % incorrect  shorter CplusT lengths (=200 SNP) gave by far the worst results due the lack of combinatorial power. Intermediate and longer cores gave the best results  with generally less than 0.2% error (Figure ). Importantly  the algorithm was robust to most deviations from the optimal core and CplusT lengths within reasonably wide boundaries (Figure ). The sharp optimal frontier in Figure  suggests that achieving 100% correctly phased alleles is not possible at the SNP densities tested due to lack of combinatorial power. However in Figure   the points tend to the bottom and to the right  effectively forming a pareto-front that constitutes a set of possible outcomes dependent on the relative emphasis on % correct and % incorrect. The sharp curve at the bottom right is fortuitous  as it shows good performance for both criteria. . . . Six M/E% thresholds (0%  1%  2%  3%  4%  and 5%)  a core length of 100 SNP and seven CplusT lengths were used. . The benefit of the HLI step was evaluated by phasing the Ne 60 k datasets for the eight pedigrees of a single replicate of simulated data using the full LRPHLI algorithm and the full algorithm with the HLI step turned off. Across the eight pedigrees  the full algorithm had an average of 97.51% correct and 0.69% incorrect  while the full algorithm with the LHI step turned off had an average of 83.15% correct and 0.97% incorrect. We do not consider that this reflects the relative performance of the Kong et al. [] LRP algorithm compared to the LRPHLI algorithm described here because several additional steps in the LRP component of LRPHLI that were included to reduce % incorrect have a heavy penalty on the overall yield. However  LRPHLI can afford to do this because the haplotype library imputation step resurrects this lost yield. The computation time required for the different datasets for Ne using cores of 100 SNP and CplusTs of 300 SNP ranged from less than three minutes to 321 minutes (Table ). The trends in Table  and other results not shown indicate that  while increases in dataset size  relatedness/effective population size  and SNP density each increase computation time  consistent trends across all datasets and scenarios do not exist. The principle computation bottleneck was the partitioning of surrogate parents into their paternal and maternal surrogate parent clusters and this was directly related to the numbers of surrogate parents. The numbers of surrogate parents in a dataset is determined by its size  its effective population size  level of relatedness amongst its individuals  the proportion of genotype errors allowed for  and the length of the CplusTs. More related individuals are more likely to carry the same haplotypes. Shorter CplusTs are more likely to result in more surrogates because shorter haplotypes are more common than longer ones and shorter CplusTs have less combinatorial power to eliminate individuals as surrogates. These interacting factors make predictions about computation time difficult. However rules of thumb can be suggested based on the following logic. Increasing size  relatedness  and inbreeding levels increase the number of surrogate parents in a dataset  which increases the computational requirements  in some instances drastically. Increasing CplusT length reduces the number of surrogates  thus reducing the computational requirements. Higher levels of relatedness and inbreeding can sustain longer CplusT. Therefore knowledge of such features of a dataset can be used to determine suitable core and CplusT lengths to obtain a high % of phased alleles with reasonable computational costs. For example  for pedigree 5 Ne and ignoring pedigree information  the computation time was 179 minutes for a core length of 100 SNP and a CplusT length of 300 SNP and only 39 minutes for a core length of 100 SNP and a CplusT length of 500 SNP  with little difference in phasing yield. Optimal core and CplusT lengths in terms of phasing accuracy coincided with intermediate computational time requirements. Given that phasing accuracy is robust to minor changes in CplusT lengths around the optimum  the opportunity exists for using slightly longer CplusT lengths with minimal loss in phasing performance but major advantages in terms of computation time (Figure     and ). Computation time is also affected by the number of SNP to be phased. For example  the pedigree 1 Ne dataset (core 800  CplusT 1200) took 83 minutes with 300 k SNP but only 30 minutes with 60 k SNP. The number of SNP does not increase computation time linearly because greater SNP density gives greater power to eliminate surrogates  which can reduce computation time. Using pedigree information reduced the computation time in the larger datasets  which had more relatedness amongst the genotyped individuals  because both relatedness and large data set size cause more surrogate parents (Table ). Memory requirements were minimal; less than 0.4 gigabytes  even for the largest datasets (pedigree 5). The first 1000 SNP of each of the eight replicates of pedigree 1 Ne were also phased using the default settings of fastPHASE []. The mean % correct across the 10 core lengths of 100 SNP across each of the eight replicates was 91.0%  with the remainder being phased incorrectly. The computation time was 13 hours for each of these datasets. In comparison  LRPHLI completed the task for twice as many SNP in these datasets in 30 minutes  99.1% phased correctly. Although better results may be possible with fastPHASE [] if the default settings had not been used  a very large difference would likely remain between these methods in terms of speed and accuracy. In the real datasets  the LRPHLI algorithm performed well in terms of % phased  % not phased  and computation time. With the exception of the human dataset  the % phased was greater than 97.5% (Table ). The human dataset  which only had a 93.7% phased  was the smallest dataset in terms of numbers of individuals genotyped (879) and probably has a larger effective population size than the livestock datasets. The highest % phased was for the dairy cattle dataset (98.4%)  which had the largest number of individuals genotyped (Table ). Across the large spectra of core and CplusT lengths that were tested  the highest % phased in each of the datasets was obtained with relatively short core lengths and intermediate CplusT lengths (results not shown because the patterns were very similar to those for the simulated datasets). The highest % phased was obtained with low M/E% thresholds (e.g. 0 or 1%). The lower % phased obtained with higher thresholds was probably due to ambiguity in eliminating or partitioning surrogates and a consequential conflict in what the surrogates suggest the phase is  which results in an uncalled phase for such an allele. For shorter CplusT lengths  the % phased tended to be lower with a 1% M/E% threshold than with a 0% M/E% threshold but there was little difference between these thresholds for intermediate CplusT lengths  because intermediate CplusTs lengths were better able to compensate for ambiguity introduced by accounting for M/E% threshold than the short CplusTs lengths. This suggests that in datasets with missing genotypes or genotyping errors  slightly longer CplusTs should be used in conjunction with a low M/E% threshold. This study investigated an extended version of long-range phasing  and combined it with haplotype library imputation  resulting in an accurate and fast phasing method. Phasing results of up to 99.5% correct in simulated data and up to 98.5% phased in real data were achieved. Computation time was very tractable even for datasets of 5000 genotyped individuals and 300 k SNP densities. This new LRPHLI algorithm outperformed fastPHASE manyfold in both accuracy and speed  making the routine phasing of datasets for genome-wide association studies and genomic selection feasible. For much larger datasets (e.g. 400 000 individuals)  a similar framework to the one presented here could be used but with some additional steps []. This involves first phasing small (random or strategic) subsets of the large dataset using the complete LRPHLI algorithm described herein  followed by phasing the remaining individuals using the haplotype library imputation step alone. This framework avoids much of the task of partitioning surrogates parents into their paternal and maternal clusters  which is the primary computation bottleneck in LRPHLI. The LRPHLI algorithm adds a number of components to the original Kong et al. [] LRP algorithm. These include pedigree and pedigree free strategies for partitioning of surrogate parents  the concepts of cores and tails for more accurate surrogate parent definition  steps to avoid errors (e.g. removal of surrogate parents who are not different enough  using information from multiple surrogates)  steps to avoid low yields where recombination events create new haplotypes (haplotype library imputation)  and measures to handle missing genotype/genotype error. It is the combination of these additions that give the algorithm its robust performance. A drawback of our proposed algorithm is that chromosomes are partitioned into cores that are generally not aligned with respect to each other. Strategies to align cores along a chromosome include the use of pedigree information (either explicitly or as part of a segregation analysis)  using overlapping cores to step across a chromosome  or aligning based on the similarity between clusters of surrogates for adjacent cores. This latter strategy could also be used to speed up the partitioning of surrogate steps (i.e. good starting values)  while the segregation analysis strategy could also be used to impute dense genotype or sequence information in sparsely genotyped pedigrees []  where scarcity both refers to low density genotyping arrays and to completely ungenotyped individuals in the pedigree. Imputation of genotype data is currently part of many national genetic evaluation systems  e.g. []. A major advantage of the LRPHLI algorithm for phasing and of the LRPHLI algorithm when combined with segregation analysis for imputation of genotypes  is that other phasing and imputation methods [] require more restrictive genotyping strategies  e.g. that both parents are densely genotyped. The LRPHLI algorithm can transfer information upwards  downwards and sideways in a pedigree  similar to the algorithm outlined by VanRaden []. The haplotypes obtained from the LRPHLI algorithm can be used directly in association studies. Because the small error percentages (e.g. 0.5% incorrect) create pairs or clusters of haplotypes that are very similar (e.g. 99.5% identical) but that are identified as different by LRPHLI  clustering these haplotypes into groups of similar haplotypes could be useful. The long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation algorithm performs well in both simulated (up to 99.5% correct) and real datasets (up to 98.5% phased) and had low computation requirements  making the routine phasing of high density SNP chip datasets feasible. The phasing performance was robust to effective population size  pedigree and data structure  and SNP density. The best results were obtained with short core lengths (e.g. 100 SNP for 60 k SNP density and 400 SNP for 300 k SNP density) and intermediate CplusT lengths (e.g. 300 SNP for 60 k SNP density and 1200 SNP for 300 k SNP density). The partitioning of surrogate parents into their paternal and maternal clusters was the principle computation bottleneck and was affected by the dataset size  effective population size  and the degree of relatedness among the individuals. Ignoring pedigree information had a negligible effect on the phasing performance but did increase computation time in the larger datasets. The algorithm is implemented in a new software package called AlphaPhase  which was written in Fortran 95. AlphaPhase is controlled by a parameter file and is freely available for research purposes from . Step 2b: Partition Erdös 1 surrogates into surrogates of the paternal or maternal gamete using the following mutually exclusive strategies  which are listed in order of the precedence: If both parents of a proband are genotyped  paternal (maternal) surrogate parents are identified as those surrogate parents who are surrogate parents of the father (mother) but not of the mother (father). The remaining surrogates are banned from use at any Erdös level for this proband. If the father of a proband is genotyped  surrogate parents that are also surrogate parents of the father are placed in the paternal surrogate parent cluster. Maternal surrogate parents are identified by first choosing a dummy mother. A dummy mother is chosen by looping through the remaining surrogate parents until the surrogate parent with greatest numbers of opposing homozygote loci with the father is found and if this individual has a count of opposing homozygotes greater than 10% of the SNPs in the core and tail in disagreement with the father it is taken to be the dummy mother. The dummy mother is assumed to be a maternal surrogate parent. The remaining surrogate parents are iteratively added to the maternal surrogate parent cluster if they are not surrogate parents of one of the paternal surrogate parents and are surrogate parents of the dummy mother or one of the subsequently identified maternal surrogate parents. If the mother of a proband is genotyped the partitioning is similar to that described in ii  but for the mother. If neither parent is genotyped but pedigree information is available  a dummy father (mother) is identified as a surrogate parent who has a coefficient of relationship of greater than a set threshold with the sire (dam) of the proband and of less than a certain threshold with the dam (sire) of the proband. Paternal (maternal) surrogate parents are identified as those who are surrogate parents of the proband and the dummy father (mother) but not the dummy mother (father). If the proband has offspring which are genotyped  one of the offspring is chosen to be a dummy father (with arbitrary gender allocation for simple presentation)  the dummy father and other offspring which are also surrogates of the dummy father are arbitrarily labelled the paternal surrogate parents. A dummy mother is chosen by looping through the remaining surrogate parents until a surrogate parent who is not a surrogate parent of the dummy father and has a count of opposing homozygotes greater than 10% of the SNPs in the core and tail in disagreement with the dummy father is found. The dummy mother is assumed to be a maternal surrogate parent. The remaining surrogate parents are iteratively added to the paternal (maternal) surrogate parent cluster if they are not surrogate parents of one of the maternal (paternal) surrogate parents and are surrogate parents of the dummy father (mother) or one of the subsequently identified paternal (maternal) surrogate parents. If there is no pedigree information available or the surrogate parents have not been clustered by any of the preceding methods  the k-medoids clustering algorithm is invoked to divide the surrogate parents into two clusters which are arbitrarily labelled paternal and maternal. The clustering algorithm works with a symmetrical matrix of dimension equal to the number of surrogate parents and elements indicating surrogacy amongst the surrogate parents  with 1's denoting surrogacy and 0's otherwise. The two clusters are initialised by ascribing the first surrogate parent found and all surrogate parents who are also surrogate parents of this surrogate parent to one cluster and all surrogate parents who are not surrogate parents of this surrogate parent to the other cluster. The medoids of the two clusters are represented by two vectors of length number of surrogate parents  with each element containing the sum of 1's for that location divided by the square of the number of individuals currently in the cluster. The distance between each surrogate parent and the medoid of both clusters is calculated as the average absolute deviation of the elements in the row of the symmetrical matrix from the corresponding element in the medoid vector. Surrogate parents are moved to the alternative cluster if the distance to the alternative clusters medoid is less than the distance to its current medoid. The medoids are recalculated when a surrogate parent moves clusters and the algorithm proceeds until convergence or the maximum permitted iterations is reached. The maximum number of iterations permitted is set to the number of surrogate parents of the proband. Step 2c: Loop across all individuals carrying out the following steps: Individuals  which are not Erdös 1 surrogates of the proband but whose count of opposing homozygote loci with the proband only exceeds the threshold for inclusion as a surrogate parent by a count of less than the average difference of those genotyped individuals that are not identified as surrogate parents  are banned from use at any Erdös level for this proband. Long-range phases all loci within the core for both the paternal and maternal gametes by sequentially stepping from Erdös level 1 to the maximum Erdös level  until one of the stopping criteria is met. As surrogates are accessed  they are banned from use at higher Erdös levels. nTarget is the targeted number of homozygote surrogate parents (including the proband itself if it is homozygous) across which information about phase is accumulated. Once nTarget is reached the stepping through the Erdös levels stops  phase is declared if a proportion greater than an error threshold (e.g. 10% error) of the nTarget surrogate parents indicate that phase is in one direction  or a statistically significant proportion of the surrogates indicates phase is on one direction rather than the other. If the search through all surrogate parents at all Erdös levels does not yield nTarget homozygous surrogate parents phase is declared if all surrogate parents which are found to be homozygous at this locus indicate that phase is in one direction  or a statistically significant proportion of the surrogate parents which are found indicate phase is on one direction rather than the other. Check across all loci in the core that the phased gametes are compatible with the genotype. If the count of incompatible loci exceeds a threshold (e.g. 5%)  all loci which are heterozygous or missing are declared unphased at this stage. Step 2e: Impute phase for gametes which are not completely phased by LRP by matching their phased loci to haplotypes in the haplotype library. This matching is carried out by one of the following steps which are listed in the order of precedence: If one of a proband's gametes is completely phased the library is searched for candidate haplotypes which  when paired with the proband's completely phased gamete can explain the proband's genotype given a certain tolerance for error along the core. If one candidate haplotype is identified it is assumed to explain the phase of the unphased loci in the core. If more than one candidate haplotype is identified  phase for the unphased loci is determined at the loci where the candidate haplotypes agree. If no candidate haplotype is identified phase for the unphased loci is assumed to be the complement of the phased loci of the phased gamete via the genotype and this new haplotype is added to the library. If neither of the proband's gametes is completely phased the library is searched for candidate haplotypes which agree given a certain tolerance for error with the phased loci along one of the proband's gametes. If one candidate haplotype is found for the paternal gamete and one candidate haplotype is found for the maternal gamete these are paired and if the sum agrees with the genotype at all loci given a certain tolerance for error this pair of haplotypes is assumed to explain the phase of the unphased loci in the core. If one candidate haplotype is found for the paternal gamete and more than one candidate haplotype is found for the maternal gamete the paternal candidate and each of the maternal haplotypes are paired and if only a single of these pairs agrees with the genotype at all loci given a certain tolerance for error this pair of haplotypes is assumed to explain the phase of the unphased loci in the core. If more than one of these pairs are compatible  phase for the unphased loci is determined at the loci where the candidate haplotypes agree. A similar step is carried out where one candidate haplotype is found for the maternal gamete and more than one candidate haplotype is found for the paternal gamete. If more than one candidate haplotype is found for the paternal gamete and no candidate haplotype is found for the maternal gamete  phase for the unphased loci of the paternal gamete is determined at the loci where the candidate haplotypes agree. A similar step is carried out where more than one candidate haplotype is found for the maternal gamete and no candidate haplotypes are found for the paternal gamete. Probands which are still not completely phased but have more than one candidate haplotype identified have these candidates exhaustively paired. If only a single pair explains phase given a certain tolerance for error this pair of haplotypes is assumed to explain the phase of the unphased loci in the core. If more than 1 pair explains phase given a certain tolerance for error a k-medoids type clustering algorithm (described above) is invoked to make two clusters out of the candidate haplotypes. All loci in the core of the proband being worked on have their previously determined phase information deleted  the homozygous loci for this proband are assumed to have no genotyping error and are thus re-phased  and phase for heterozygous loci for this proband is determined at the loci where all the candidate haplotypes within a cluster agree. It is assumed that one of the clusters represents the maternal haplotype and the other cluster represents the paternal haplotype. Pedigree 1 comprised 2 000 \"unrelated\" individuals with unknown parents. Pedigree 2 comprised 2 000 individuals from two generations (500 sires  500 dams  and 1000 offspring). Pedigree 3 comprised 1 600 individuals from two generations (100 sires  500 dams  and 1000 offspring). Pedigree 4 comprised 1 510 individuals from two generations (10 sires  500 dams  and 1000 offspring). Pedigree 5 was a real pedigree of a commercial pig population (courtesy of the Pig Improvement Company) comprising 6 242 individuals  across 16 generational tiers with the largest sire family size being 66 individuals. Pedigree 6 was obtained from an Australian terminal sire sheep breed (courtesy of Sheep Genetics Australia) comprising 9 557 individuals across 21 generational tiers with the largest sire family size being 142 individuals. Pedigree 7 represented the genotyped Australian Holstein sires (courtesy of Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme) comprising 20 792 individuals  across 13 generational tiers with the largest sire family size being 528 individuals. Pedigree 8 was a human pedigree of genotyped individuals from the ORCADES study in the Orkney Islands  Scotland []  comprising 12 294 individuals across 12 generational tiers with the largest sire family being 8 individuals. For pedigree 1  all individuals were genotyped. For pedigrees 2  3  and 4  either all individuals or only second generation offspring were assumed genotyped. For pedigree 5  the genotypes for 3 000 individuals were assumed known  reflecting the same animals genotyped as in the actual Pig Improvement Company dataset. For pedigrees 6 and 7  two genotyping strategies were implemented  with either the last 2 000 individuals of the pedigree or the sires (2 578 sires in pedigree 6 and 1 777 sires in pedigree 7) genotyped. For pedigree 8  we used data from all 749 individuals for which genotypes were available in the Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES).

The spurious effect observed when a maternally allele is present at the IGF2 locus  is in fact due to the presence of a second closely located QTL. This work confirms that pig chromosome 2 is a major region associated with fattening traits. Many QTL associated with economically important traits like growth  fatness and meat quality have been detected since the 2000 s  as reviewed by Bidanel and Rotschild in 2002 []. However  even for those that have been fine-mapped  successful identification of the causal mutation is rare. In 1999  a paternally expressed QTL affecting backfat thickness (BFT) and muscle mass was identified on the short arm of SSC2 close to the IGF2 gene in crosses between Large White (LW) and European Wild Boar [] and between LW and Pietrain []. In 2003  Van Laere et al. [] reported that the IGF2-intron3-G3072A substitution is the causal mutation. This mutation affects the binding site of a repressor and up-regulates IGF2 expression in skeletal muscles and heart  inducing major maternally imprinted effects on muscle growth  heart size and fat deposition. Therefore  selection for animals carrying allele A at this locus is a major issue in pig production. Analysis of the frequency and effects of this mutation in pig populations of different genetic origins showed that both wild (G) and mutant (A) alleles still segregate in modern populations (LW × Pietrain cross) [  ]  and that allele A is very rare or even nonexistent in local breeds and Wild Boars []. The strong favourable effect of allele A was confirmed in both Spanish [] and Polish [] LW and Landrace (LR) breeds. In 2004  Jungerius et al. [] demonstrated that the mutation also explains the major imprinted QTL for backfat thickness in a cross between Meishan (MS) and European White pigs (LW and LR). Yet  although significant effects of the IGF2 mutation were revealed both by ultrasonic and carcass BFT measurements  the presence of a second QTL at a position near 40 cM  as previously described in this population by de Koning []  cannot be excluded []. In the French LW × MS cross  QTL affecting loin weight and BFT on carcass have also been detected near the IGF2 locus []. However  surprisingly  no imprinting effect could be detected []  although the breeds involved are similar (European White breeds and MS) in the Dutch and French studies  and the MS animals in both crosses are related. It has been shown that spurious imprinting effects can exist because of maternal effects [] or because of linkage disequilibrium []. The aims of the present work were to estimate more precisely the IGF2 substitution effect by combining the two MS × European intercrosses  and to investigate further the genetic determinism of the SSC2p chromosomal region by testing the hypothesis of an additional QTL segregating on SSC2 in these populations. In addition  simulation studies were conducted to investigate how the presence of two QTL could affect the apparent mode of inheritance of IGF2 alleles. The French and Dutch F2 MS × European breeds crosses and the recorded phenotypes have been described previously []. Briefly  the French INRA-PORQTL pedigree consisted of 12 F0 (six LW sires and six MS dams)  26 F1 (six sires and 20 dams) and 521 castrated male F2 pigs. All animals were born and raised at the INRA GEPA experimental research unit (Surgère  Charentes). The Dutch pedigree  obtained from the University of Wageningen (WU)  was initiated by mating 19 MS sires to 126 LW and LR dams  resulting in an F1 population of 39 sires and 265 F1 dams  which produced a total of 1212 F2 offspring. The Dutch pedigree was bred in five different breeding companies. Among the 39 Dutch half-sib families  only the 24 largest (more than 30 progeny) were retained in the present analysis in order to homogenize the family structure of the two pedigrees. Among the traits recorded in the two populations  BFT measured between the third and the fourth rib of carcass at 6 cm from the spine [  ] was considered here as the main common trait shared in both designs affected by the QTL under study. This trait was recorded on 565 Dutch pigs (castrated males and females) and on 521 French pigs (castrated males only). Phenotypic data were first adjusted for fixed effects and covariates with the GLM procedure in SAS (SAS 9.1  SAS Institute  Inc.). The models used to adjust the data included the effects of batch  slaughter day and carcass weight for the INRA pedigree and breeding company  sex  slaughter day and carcass weight for the Dutch pedigree. Animals from both pedigrees were genotyped for 11 microsatellites evenly spaced on chromosome 2 (SW2443 (0 cM); SWC9 (2 cM); SW2623 (11 cM); SW256 (23 cM); S0141 (37 cM); SW240 (51 cM); S0091 (76 cM); S0010 (90 cM); S0368 (96 cM); S0378 (108 cM) and S0036 (149 cM))  as previously reported []. Genotyping of the IGF2-intron3-G3072A substitution was performed on some of the F0 and F1 animals of both pedigrees. Previously  F1 boars and their parents [] from the Dutch pedigree had been genotyped by the pyrosequencing technique (Pyrosequencing AB) described in []. In the French design  all F0 and F1 animals were genotyped by PCR-RFLP using primers 5'-GGACCGAGCCAGGGACGAGCCT-3' and 5'-GGGAGGTCCCAGAAAAAGTC-3'. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out at 57°C using the GC-RICH PCR system (ROCHE)  in presence of 1 M GC-RICH Resolution solution  and 1.5 mM of MgCl2. PCR-RFLP with the restriction enzyme ApeK1 was used to detect the mutation according to the manufacturer's recommendations for time  temperature and buffer conditions. Then  genotypes of all F2 animals at the mutation were inferred for non recombinant haplotypes inherited from F1 individuals  using information from the pedigree and from the transmission of parental haplotypes for surrounding markers (SW2443 and SWC9). No genotype was assigned for recombinant F2 piglets with a heterozygous A/G parent or if the mother had not been genotyped for the mutation. The parental origin of the allele inherited at the A/G substitution was also inferred when possible according to the phase they inherited from their parents. QTL detection was performed on the adjusted data using the QTLMap software [  ] as explained in []. Parameter estimates were obtained by maximization of the likelihood with a Newton-Raphson algorithm  and a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) was computed at each cM along SSC2. The maximum LRT along the linkage group indicated the most likely position for a QTL. For each sire  the substitution effect corresponds to the difference between the Meishan and the European alleles  a positive effect indicating an increased value of the trait due to Meishan alleles. The average QTL substitution effect was computed as the mean of the absolute values of the sire substitution effects. QTL significance thresholds were empirically computed using 1000 simulations under the null hypothesis  assuming an infinitesimal polygenic model for the trait  as described by Gilbert and Le Roy []. QTL detection analyses were carried out first for the French and Dutch pedigrees separately  and then for the combined pedigree. A potential second QTL segregating within these pedigrees was investigated with two different methods. First  the multi-QTL option of QTLMAP was used to detect two linked QTL on SSC2 for BFT. The alternative hypothesis (H1) of two QTL segregating was compared to the null hypothesis of one QTL segregating at the IGF2 locus. The LRT were computed following a grid-search strategy  using 5 cM steps along the chromosome. Significance thresholds were empirically estimated by 1000 simulations under the null hypothesis  as described by Gilbert and Le Roy []. In a second analysis  the segregation of a potential additional QTL was investigated: (1) by analysing the data from the progeny of sires homozygous at the IGF2 locus (G/G) and (2) by performing a QTL detection analysis on the full combined pedigree with a model that included IGF2 as a fixed effect. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were carried out to infer the inheritance pattern of the SSC2 QTL  using data adjusted for the previously described fixed effects. Tests were applied to compare different effects  in the model  =  +  +   where  is the adjusted performance of individual  of genotype  (see below)   is the population mean   is the residual error of individual  of genotype   and  is the tested effect. Three different effects for  were built based on the following inheritance patterns: Only the paternally inherited allele at the mutation has an effect (model IGF2pat   = {A G}) Only the maternally inherited allele at the mutation has an effect (model IGF2mat   = {A G}) Both the paternally inherited allele and the maternally inherited allele at the mutation have effects (model IGF2patmat   = {AA AG GA GG}  the paternal allele being written first). These analyses of variance were applied to all F2 individuals of the combined pedigree  of both pedigrees separately  and to sub-groups of animals defined according to the genotype of the parents at the IGF2 mutation: F2 having A/G sires F2 having A/G dams F2 having A/G sires and G/G dams F2 having G/G sires and A/G dams F2 having A/G sires and A/G dams. Simulation studies were performed with the QTLMap software to evaluate the power of the inheritance pattern analyses and of the additional QTL studies proposed in this paper  in the presence of a major imprinted gene in the chromosomal region investigated. A QTL segregating at 44 cM affecting the trait was simulated while assuming a paternal effect of the IGF2 locus. Only the phenotypes were simulated; family structures and genotypes were obtained from real data from the two pedigrees. The effect of the IGF2pat model was set to 0.48 phenotypic standard deviations of the trait (as estimated in the data set  see below). The QTL was assumed to be bi-allelic  with the Q allele decreasing backfat level as compared to the q allele. The simulated QTL effect represented the substitution effect of allele q by allele Q. Simulations were then performed with the following parameter values: Frequency of the QTL alleles: in the F0 European breeds (French F0 males and Dutch F0 females) for allele Q: 0.25  0.50  0.75 or 1.00 in the Meishan populations (French F0 females and Dutch F0 males) for allele q: 1.00. Fixation was assumed based on the small size of the original population and based on the fact that MS individuals were also homozygous for IGF2. Effect of the simulated QTL: 0.22 or 0.32 or 0.42 phenotypic standard deviations of the trait. For each simulation  a QTL analysis was performed as described above and the value of the maximum LRT (LRTmax) and its position were recorded. Simulated phenotypes were exported to the SAS software and analyses of variance were performed as previously described to determine which inheritance pattern was detected depending on the simulated parameters  applying either the IGF2pat or the IGF2mat models. For the analyses of the two pedigrees separately  2000 replicate simulations were performed for each combination of frequency × effect parameters. For the combined pedigree  2000 replicates were performed with an effect of 0.32 and a frequency of 0.50 for the QTL in both grandparental populations  as the two pedigrees were reciprocal. The percentage of replicates returning significant results for each pattern of inheritance of IGF2 and detection of the QTL were then computed from the 2000 replicates for each situation. The IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation was genotyped for most of the F0 and F1 founders of both pedigrees (Table ). Presence of IGF2 wild type and mutant alleles in the Dutch pedigree was reported previously []. To summarize  all MS F0 sires were homozygous (G/G) for the wild allele  and allelic heterogeneity was identified for the LW F0 dams: in the two Dutch LR lines  all the dams were homozygous (G/G)  whereas in the three other LW lines allele A was found with frequencies over 80%. Among the 24 sire families selected for our study  12 F1 sires were homozygous (G/G)  and 12 F1 sires were heterozygous (A/G). These 24 F1 sire families involved 65 heterozygous females (A/G) and 71 homozygous females (G/G)  while the genotype of 38 F1 dams remained unknown. All F0 and F1 animals were genotyped in the French pedigree (Table ). All MS F0 dams were homozygous G/G. Among the six LW sires  five were heterozygous (A/G) and one was homozygous for the mutant allele (A/A). Among the six F1 sires  four were homozygous (G/G) and two were heterozygous (A/G). These six F1 sire families involved 15 heterozygous females (A/G) and five homozygous females (G/G). The genotypes of the F2 pigs at the IGF2-intron3-G3072A were inferred from the genotypes of their parents at the mutation and the haplotypes inherited at the surrounding SW2443 and SWC9 microsatellite markers. A complete genotype at the IGF2 mutation could be obtained for 90% of the F2 pigs. Analyses of variance to test the inheritance pattern of the IGF2 mutation were thus performed on 980 F2 animals (543 Dutch F2 and 437 French F2). For ANOVA studies with the IGF2patmat model  the heterozygous (A/G) F2 pigs were split into two groups depending on the parental origin of the two alleles. For the combined pedigree  the total numbers of animals of each genotype at the mutation were 44 A/A  568 G/G  155 A/G and 213 G/A  with the first allele identifying the paternal allele. First  each pedigree was analysed independently. In the French pedigree  the maximum of the test statistic was obtained in the IGF2 region (0 cM) but was only significant at the 10% threshold. Analysis of the Dutch pedigree gave a significant result at the 5% threshold  but the maximum of the test statistics was reached at 28 cM. The QTL detection analysis was then performed on the combined pedigree (Figure ). The maximum LRT value was obtained in the region surrounding the IGF2 position. However  between 13 and 51 cM  the values of the test statistics were also higher than the 5% threshold. . Solid  circled and crossed lines represent respectively the combined  French and Dutch pedigrees; for each analysis  the LRT is presented as a proportion of the 5% threshold on the chromosome. A multi-QTL analysis was then performed with the combined pedigree but neither significant nor suggestive results were obtained for the hypothesis of two QTL segregating within both pedigrees. The QTL detection analysis performed on the 14 families from sires heterozygous at the mutation revealed a significant QTL close to the IGF2 locus (Figure ). The decrease of the test statistic values downstream from the IGF2 gene was abrupt and no other region reached the 5% threshold. A complementary analysis was performed on the 16 families originating from homozygous F1 sires (G/G) and detected a significant QTL at 44 cM. The substitution effects estimated at this second QTL position showed that  among the 16 sires analysed  three F1 sires could not be validated as heterozygous for the QTL. The 13 remaining sires were heterozygous with MS alleles associated with high BFT values in nine families and with low BFT values in two families. For the two remaining sires  the breed origin of the favourable allele could not be determined. On average  the QTL effect was estimated to be 0.32 s.d. of the trait. A similar result was obtained with the combined pedigree using phenotypic data corrected for the effect of the IGF2-intron3-G3072A genotype (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that a significant QTL affecting BFT is segregating around 40 cM on SSC2. . The solid line represents the QTL detection results from the segregating sire families (A/G sires) and the circles-marked line results from the no-segregating sire families (G/G sires) at the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation; for each analysis  the LRT is presented as a proportion of the 5% threshold on the chromosome. Analyses of variance were performed on different sub-groups of animals to investigate the effect of the IGF2 mutation. Results obtained using the IGF2pat model confirmed the strong effect of the paternally inherited allele at the mutation (Table )  since significant p-values were observed in all studied sub-groups of F2 pigs. The p-values obtained with the IGF2patmat model were always very similar to those obtained with the IGF2pat model (data not shown). To investigate the potential effect of the maternally inherited IGF2 allele  the IGF2mat model was also tested. When the analysis was performed on the F2 progeny of heterozygous dams  a significant p-value was obtained with the combined pedigree (p = 0.04). When the analysis was carried out on the progeny of heterozygous dams mated to homozygous sires  a significant p-value was also observed (p = 0.01). Analysing each pedigree independently  results tended to be significant (p < 0.10) for these two progeny sub-groups in the French pedigree and for the F2 produced from A/G dams and G/G sires in the Dutch pedigree (Table ). The simulated QTL was detected in about 80% of replicates when its effect was at least 0.32 s.d. regardless of the frequency of allele Q in the European grand-parental population (Figure ). When the simulated QTL had a small effect (0.22)  the French pedigree tended to be more powerful than the Dutch pedigree to detect the QTL. With the Dutch design  the simulated QTL was detected in fewer than 50% of replicates. For the simulations performed with the combined pedigree  the QTL was detected in 88% of replicates. . The QTL was considered detected when the 5% threshold was reached; analyses were performed for each pedigree independently (in grey for the French design  in black for the Dutch design) and for three values for the QTL effect (diamonds 0.22 s.d.  squares 0.32 s.d. and triangles 0.42 s.d.). ANOVA was first carried out with the IGF2pat model  using all families. For both pedigrees  the simulated effect of the paternally inherited allele at IGF2 was detected in most replicates (Figure ). The Dutch pedigree gave more significant results than the French pedigree. When the frequency of the simulated Q allele increased in the European populations  the percentage of replicates resulting in a significant effect for the paternally inherited allele decreased. With the combined pedigree  83% of replicates showed a significant effect of IGF2 on backfat thickness. . The effects were considered significant when the p-value was lower than 5%; the dotted and solid lines represent  respectively  the results obtained for the allele inherited from the sire and from the dam at the IGF2 mutation; different frequencies of the Q allele in the European grand-parental populations were tested; analyses were performed for each pedigree independently (in grey for the French design  in black for the Dutch design) and for three values of the QTL effect (diamonds 0.22 s.d.  squares 0.32 s.d. and triangles 0.42 s.d.). Using the model of maternal inheritance on simulated imprinted paternally expressed IGF2 effects  the proportion of results reaching significance for an effect of the maternal allele at IGF2 (IGF2mat) was expected to be low or null. Variance analyses were performed on the sub-group of progeny produced by heterozygous dams regardless of the genotypes of the sires. With the Dutch pedigree  few replicates led to validation of the maternal expression. In contrast  with the French pedigree  more significant results were obtained (Figure ). When the simulated QTL had a large effect (0.42 s.d.) and a low frequency of the Q allele was simulated in the European F0 (0.25)  up to 75% of the replicates gave a significant result for the IGF2mat model in the French pedigree. With the combined pedigree  6.6% of the simulations detected a significant maternally inherited allele effect. When only progeny from the G/G sires among the heterozygous dams' families were considered  the effect of the allele inherited from the mother at the IGF2 mutation was significant in 23% of replicates. The aim of this study was to confirm the existence of two QTL associated with BFT on SSC2p and to further dissect the imprinting effect of the IGF2 gene  in order to resolve contradictory results published for the French and Dutch MS × European pedigrees [  ]. The two designs were based on similar founder breeds (MS were crossed with LW and/or LR) and they contributed equally (considering the number of F2) to the so-called \"combined pedigree\". However  two major differences should be noted. First  the two pedigrees are reciprocal: the MS breed was used as the sire breed in the Dutch pedigree and as the dam breed in the French one. The second discrepancy lies in the pedigree structure: a limited number of large F1 sire families were produced in the French pedigree  whereas the Dutch pedigree consisted in many small F1 sire families. Our objectives were to (1) show that another QTL on SSC2p is associated with BFT in addition to the IGF2 gene and (2) determine the most likely hypothesis to explain the discrepancies regarding observed imprinting effects in the two pedigrees. Two hypotheses were proposed: a) the imprinting of IGF2 gene is not complete and b) the mendelian effect detected at 0 cM (at the position of the IGF2 locus) in the French pedigree [] is in fact an artefact due to genetic linkage between IGF2 and a second QTL. Analysis of the combined pedigree with the single-QTL model gave a most likely position of the QTL at 0 cM  but LRT values over the 5% threshold were obtained for all positions in the first 50 cM of SSC2 (Figure ). When the two pedigrees were analysed independently  two different most likely QTL positions were obtained  in accordance with previously published results on the two pedigrees  i.e. at 0 cM in the French pedigree [  ] and in an interval between positions 20 and 50 cM in the Dutch pedigree [  ]. After genotyping the Dutch pedigree for the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation  it was concluded that the IGF2 QTN  localised at 0 cM  explained most of the observed paternally expressed QTL for BFT on SSC2 []. However  the presence of an additional QTL around 30 cM could not be excluded. In the present work  nearly every position on the short arm of SSC2 was significant  which is consistent with the large variability of positions found in the Dutch pedigree  and tends to confirm the hypothesis that more than one QTL associated with BFT is segregating in this region. However  this hypothesis had not been validated before for these two pedigrees. With the combined pedigree  the multiple-QTL model gave no significant result  so that the hypothesis of two co-segregating QTL could not be validated. These results indicate that the F1 sires in general are not heterozygous for both loci and/or that the dataset does not provide enough information to validate the alternative hypothesis  which might be due to the proportion of homozygous sires for the IGF2 mutation in the combined pedigree (0.5). The separate analyses of the A/G and G/G F1 fathers provided evidence for the segregation of two QTL  the IGF2 mutation and a second one most likely positioned at 44 cM  which is close to the position initially reported in the Dutch pedigree []. Segregation of a QTL affecting BFT around 40 cM was also reported by Lee et al. [] in a Wild Boar × MS pedigree in which all founders were A/A for the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation. Therefore  our results confirm the hypothesis of a second QTL segregating in the Dutch LW × MS cross  as suggested by Jungerius et al. []  and extend this observation to the French cross. The IGF2 gene has been studied in detail in several species and  in most cases  paternal expression has been described. Nevertheless  modifications of the imprinted status of genes have been reported in humans (most often associated with diseases) []. For the IGF2 gene  such pathological modifications have already been described [  ]. However  a study on the loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene in colorectal cancers has also shown a loss of imprinting in normal mucosa and peripheral blood leukocytes []. Moreover  Sakatani et al. [] have reported maternal expression of IGF2 in a healthy human population. Li et al. [] have demonstrated that IGF2 P1 transcripts are bi-allelically expressed in all studied organs from adult healthy pigs. In addition  several studies have reported that the imprinting pattern of a locus can be variable over ontogenetic time [] or under different environmental effects []. One present objective was to evaluate whether the differences of the imprinting status previously reported for the French [] and the Dutch [] pedigrees could be clarified. Significant effects of the allele inherited from the dam at the IGF2 mutation were obtained when analysing the progeny of A/G mothers  which is not in accordance with exclusive paternal expression of the IGF2 gene. Simulations showed that segregation of a second QTL at 40 cM from IGF2 can lead to the false detection of expression of the maternally inherited IGF2-allele in the French pedigree  whereas this was almost never observed in simulations of the Dutch or the combined pedigree. The discrepancies between simulation results can be explained by differences in the pedigree structures. The Dutch pedigree is based on 104 matings between F0 animals that produced many small half- and full-sib families (24 F1 sires and 174 dams)  whereas the French pedigree is based on six matings only between the F0 animals that produced six large half- and full-sib families (six sires and 20 dams). Another difference between the two designs was the allele frequencies at the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation: in the French design  75% of the F1 dams were heterozygous at the mutation whereas only 47% dams where heterozygous in the Dutch design. Since the simulations were performed using the real genotype data at the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation  we could not estimate the influence of the percentage of heterogeneous dams. The relative impact of the different family designs and allele frequencies at the mutation could not be differentiated with these simulations. Nevertheless  the ANOVA and simulation analyses suggest that the differences in the effect of the maternal allele at the IGF2 locus can be caused by the segregation of an additional QTL at 44 cM. The genetic linkage between IGF2 and a second QTL with an effect of 0.32 s.d. is high enough to create this artefactual maternal effect  even if the two loci are relatively distant. Since 2003  several studies have reported the effect of the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation on BFT. Besides this QTN  several studies tend to show that additional loci in the surrounding chromosomal region could influence the same trait. By combining two F2 designs  this study demonstrates that a second significant QTL affecting pig fatness is localised around 44 cM and that segregation of this second locus can explain the maternal effect that was observed in the French pedigree at the IGF2 locus. Thus  selection schemes against BFT should not only take the status at the IGF2 mutation into account but also genotypes at other QTL in the region. QTL for other economically important traits have been described on SSC2p  including QTL affecting daily feed intake [] and teat number []. For these traits  the influence of the IGF2-intron3-G3072A mutation via pleiotropic effects has been excluded [  ]. Therefore  the short arm of SSC2 seems to be an important chromosomal region for pig production. Thus  fine-mapping the other QTL on this chromosome will be of major interest. This task will require a cautious design of fine-mapping experiments since the pedigree structures and the variety of loci in the region can lead to false conclusions.

Evaluations can also include animals genotyped with more or fewer markers using new tools such as the 777 000 or 2 900 marker chips recently introduced for cattle. Gains from more markers can be predicted using simulation  whereas strategies to use fewer markers have been compared using subsets of actual genotypes. The overall cost of selection is reduced by genotyping most animals at less than the highest density and imputing their missing genotypes using haplotypes. Algorithms to combine different densities need to be efficient because numbers of genotyped animals and markers may continue to grow quickly.MethodsGenotypes for 500 000 markers were simulated for the 33 414 Holsteins that had 50 000 marker genotypes in the North American database. Another 86 465 non-genotyped ancestors were included in the pedigree file  and linkage disequilibrium was generated directly in the base population.

Evaluations can also include animals genotyped with more or fewer markers using new tools such as the 777 000 or 2 900 marker chips recently introduced for cattle. Gains from more markers can be predicted using simulation  whereas strategies to use fewer markers have been compared using subsets of actual genotypes. The overall cost of selection is reduced by genotyping most animals at less than the highest density and imputing their missing genotypes using haplotypes. Algorithms to combine different densities need to be efficient because numbers of genotyped animals and markers may continue to grow quickly. Genotypes for 500 000 markers were simulated for the 33 414 Holsteins that had 50 000 marker genotypes in the North American database. Another 86 465 non-genotyped ancestors were included in the pedigree file  and linkage disequilibrium was generated directly in the base population. Mixed density datasets were created by keeping 50 000 (every tenth) of the markers for most animals. Missing genotypes were imputed using a combination of population haplotyping and pedigree haplotyping. Reliabilities of genomic evaluations using linear and nonlinear methods were compared. Differing marker sets for a large population were combined with just a few hours of computation. About 95% of paternal alleles were determined correctly  and > 95% of missing genotypes were called correctly. Reliability of breeding values was already high (84.4%) with 50 000 simulated markers. The gain in reliability from increasing the number of markers to 500 000 was only 1.6%  but more than half of that gain resulted from genotyping just 1 406 young bulls at higher density. Linear genomic evaluations had reliabilities 1.5% lower than the nonlinear evaluations with 50 000 markers and 1.6% lower with 500 000 markers. Methods to impute genotypes and compute genomic evaluations were affordable with many more markers. Reliabilities for individual animals can be modified to reflect success of imputation. Breeders can improve reliability at lower cost by combining marker densities to increase both the numbers of markers and animals included in genomic evaluation. Larger gains are expected from increasing the number of animals than the number of markers. Breeders now use thousands of genetic markers to select and improve animals. Previously only phenotypes and pedigrees were used in selection  but performance and parentage information was collected  stored  and evaluated affordably and routinely for many traits and many millions of animals. Genetic markers had limited use during the century after Mendel's principles of genetic inheritance were rediscovered because few major QTL were identified and because marker genotypes were expensive to obtain before 2008. Genomic evaluations implemented in the last two years for dairy cattle have greatly improved reliability of selection  especially for younger animals  by using many markers to trace the inheritance of many QTL with small effects. More genetic markers can increase both reliability and cost of genomic selection. Genotypes for 50 000 markers now cost <US$200 per animal for cattle  pigs  chickens  and sheep. Lower cost chips containing fewer (2 900) markers and higher cost chips with more (777 000) markers are already available for cattle  and additional genotyping tools will become available for cattle and other species in the near future. All three billion DNA base pairs of several Holstein bulls have been fully sequenced and costs of sequence data are rapidly declining. Reliabilities of genomic predictions were compared in previous studies for up to 50 000 actual or 1 million simulated markers. Reliabilities for young animals increased gradually as marker numbers increased from a few hundred up to 50 000 []  and increased slightly when markers with low minor allele frequency were included []. For low- to medium-density panels (300 to 3 000 markers)  selection of markers with large effects preserves more reliability if only the selected markers are used in the evaluation []  but evenly spaced markers preserve more reliability for all traits if imputation is used []. Reliabilities increased from 81 up to 83% as numbers of simulated markers increased from 50 000 to 100 000 using 40 000 predictor bulls []  however  base population alleles in that study were in equilibrium rather than disequilibrium. Increasing marker numbers above 20 000 up to 1 million linked markers resulted in almost no gains in reliability in a simulation of 10 chromosomes and 1 500 QTL []. Larger gains resulted in a simulation of only one chromosome containing three to 30 QTL that accounted for all of the additive variance []. Many genome-wide association studies of human traits have combined large numbers of markers from different chips []  but those studies almost always estimated effects of individual loci rather than included all the loci to estimate the total genetic effect. Many genotypes will be missing in the future when data from denser or less dense chips are merged with current genotypes from 50 000-marker chips or when two different 50 000-marker sets are merged  as is being done in the EuroGenomics project [  ]. Missing genotypes of descendants can be imputed accurately using low-density marker sets if ancestor haplotypes are available []. At low marker densities  haplotypes provide higher accuracy than genotypes when included in genomic evaluation [  ]. Missing genotypes were not an immediate problem with data from a 50 000-marker set because >99% of genotypes were read correctly []. Fewer markers can be used to trace chromosome segments within a population once identified by high-density haplotyping. Without haplotyping  regressions could simply be computed for available SNP and the rest disregarded. With haplotyping  effects of both observed and unobserved SNP can be included. Transition to higher density chips will require including multiple marker sets in one analysis because breeders will not re-genotype most animals. Simulated genotypes and haplotypes can be more useful than real data to test programs and hypotheses. Examples are analyses of larger data sets than are currently available or comparison of estimated haplotypes with true haplotypes  which are not observable in real data. Most simulations begin with all alleles in the founding generation in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and then introduce linkage disequilibrium (LD) using many non-overlapping generations of hypothetical pedigrees [] or fewer generations of actual pedigree []. Simulations can also include selection [] or model divergent populations such as breeds []. Many genomic evaluation studies simulated shorter genomes and fewer chromosomes than in actual populations  presumably because computing times for obtaining complete data were too long. Goals of this study are to 1) impute genotypes using a combination of population and pedigree haplotyping  2) compute genomic evaluations with up to 500 000 simulated markers  and 3) evaluate potential gains in reliability from increasing numbers of markers. Unknown genotypes can be made known (imputed) from observed genotypes at the same or nearby loci of relatives using pedigree haplotyping or from matching allele patterns (regardless of pedigree) using population haplotyping. Haplotypes indicate which alleles are on each chromosome and can distinguish the maternal chromosome provided by the ovum from the paternal chromosome provided by the sperm. Genotypes indicate only how many copies of each allele an individual inherited from its two parents. Fortran program findhap.f90 was designed to combine population and pedigree haplotyping. Genotypes were coded numerically as 0 if homozygous for the first allele  2 if homozygous for the second allele  and 1 if heterozygous or not known; haplotypes were coded as 0 for the first allele  2 for the second allele  and 1 for unknown to simplify matching. The algorithm began by creating a list of haplotypes from the genotypes in the first pass  and the process was iterated so genotypes earlier in the file could be matched again using haplotype refinements that occurred later. Steps used in the population haplotyping algorithm were: 1) each chromosome was divided into segments of about 500 markers each when analyzing the 500 000 marker or mixed datasets and 100 markers each for 50 000 marker data; 2) the first genotype was entered into the haplotype list as if it was a haplotype; 3) any subsequent genotypes that shared a haplotype were then used to split the previous genotypes into haplotypes; 4) as each genotype was compared to the list  a match was declared if no homozygous loci conflicted with the stored haplotype; 5) any remaining unknown alleles in that haplotype were imputed from homozygous alleles in the genotype; 6) the individual's second haplotype was obtained by subtracting its first haplotype from its genotype  and the second haplotype was checked against remaining haplotypes in the list; 7) if no match was found  the new genotype (or haplotype) was added to the end of the list. Unknown alleles in the genotype were stored as unknown alleles in the haplotype; 8) the list of currently known haplotypes was sorted from most to least frequent as haplotypes were found for efficiency and so that more probable haplotypes were preferred. Steps 4) and 6) of the algorithm for population haplotyping are demonstrated in Figure  for a shortened segment of 57 markers. The example genotype conflicted with the first four listed haplotypes but had no conflicts with haplotype number 5. After removing haplotype 5 from the genotype to obtain the animal's complementary haplotype  the algorithm searched for the complementary haplotype in the remainder of the list until it was identified as haplotype 8. Instead of storing all 57 codes from the segments found  this animal's haplotypes were stored simply as 5 and 8. In practice  some alleles in the least frequent haplotypes remain unknown because few or no matches were found or because each matching genotype happened to be heterozygous at that locus. . Iteration proceeded as follows. The first two iterations used only population haplotyping and not the pedigree. The first used only the highest density genotypes  and later iterations used all genotypes. The third and fourth iterations used both pedigree and population methods to locate matching haplotypes. Known haplotypes of genotyped parents (or grandparents if parents were not genotyped) were checked first  and if either of the individual's haplotypes were not found with this quick check then checking restarted from the top of the sorted list. For example  the algorithm in Figure  could check haplotypes 5 and 8 first if parent genotypes are known to contain these haplotypes. The last two iterations did not search sequentially through the haplotype list and instead used only pedigrees to impute haplotypes of non-genotyped ancestors from their genotyped descendants  locate crossovers that created new haplotypes  and resolve conflicts between parent and progeny haplotypes. If parent and progeny haplotypes differed at just one marker  the difference was assumed to be genotyping error  and the more frequent haplotype was substituted for the less frequent. Imputation success was measured in several ways. Percentages of alleles missing before and after imputation indicated the amount of fill needed and remaining. Percentages of incorrect genotypes were calculated across all loci including the genotypes observed  the haplotypes imputed  and the remaining haplotypes not imputed but simply assigned alleles using allele frequency. An alternative error rate counted differences between heterozygous and homozygous genotypes as only half errors and differences between opposite homozygotes as full errors across the imputed and assigned loci but not including the observed loci []. The percentage of true linkages between consecutive heterozygous markers that differed from estimated linkages was determined  as well as the percentage of heterozygous loci at which the allele estimated to be paternal was actually maternally inherited. Methods to simulate LD were derived and the simulation program of [] was modified to generate LD directly in the earliest known ancestors in the pedigree (the founding population). Previously  marker alleles were simulated in equilibrium and uncorrelated across loci in the founding population  but genotypes at adjacent markers become more correlated as marker densities increase. Most other studies [] used thousands of generations of random mating to establish a balance between recombination  drift  and mutation in small populations with actual size set equal to effective size. Fewer rare and more common haplotypes would occur than in actual populations with unbalanced contributions to the next generation. Neither the standard nor the new approach may provide exactly the same LD pattern as in actual genotypes. Initial LD was generated by establishing marker properties for the population  simulating underlying  unobservable  linked bi-allelic markers that each have an allele frequency of 0.5  and setting minor allele frequencies for observed markers to <0.5 by randomly replacing a corresponding fraction of the underlying alleles by the major allele. Direction of linkage phase for each marker with the previous marker was set to positive (coupling) or negative (repulsion) with 0.5 probability  and this process was repeated across each chromosome. Marker alleles were coded as 1 or 2 and their frequencies were distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. After establishing these initial marker properties  each founding haplotype from an unknown founder parent was generated as follows: 1) for the first locus on each chromosome  an underlying allele was chosen randomly with 0.5 frequency; 2) subsequent loci on the same chromosome were set to the same allele or opposite allele based on direction of initial linkage phase until a break point occurred; 3) if a uniform variate exceeded the LD decay parameter defined as 1 - the fraction of recombinations that had occurred between adjacent loci  then that haplotype block ended and the next allele was chosen randomly with 0.5 frequency; and 4) observed alleles were obtained from the underlying alleles using the allele frequencies. A uniform number was generated at the beginning of each block  and underlying alleles within the block were replaced by the major allele if the minor allele frequency was greater than twice the minor allele frequency at that locus. The benefit of the underlying markers is that a single parameter can model the gradual decay of linkage disequilibrium as marker distances increase  similar to an autoregressive correlation structure. The idea is similar to using underlying normal variables for categorical traits because the math is simpler on the underlying scale. Each allele in the founding haplotypes required generating only two uniform random numbers: one to determine underlying LD blocks and a second to increase frequency of the major allele. The LD blocks mimic segments preserved from unknown generations prior to the pedigree. The simulation process resulted in different lengths  locations of breakpoints  and patterns of rare alleles for each founding haplotype segment. The population simulated included 8 974 progeny-tested bulls  14 061 young bulls  4 348 cows with records and 6 031 heifers  as well as 86 465 non-genotyped ancestors in the pedigrees. The founding animals were mostly born before 1960  about 10 generations ancestral to the current population. This population structure was identical to the 33 414 Holstein animals with BovineSNP50 genotypes in the North American database as of January 2010. Many of these animals share long haplotypes because  for example  three bulls each had >1 000 genotyped progeny in the dataset. Genotypes for 500 000 markers were simulated  and the 50 000 marker subset was constructed using every 10th marker. The simulated percentages of missing genotypes and incorrect reads were 1.00 and 0.02%  respectively  based on rates observed for the BovineSNP50 chip. The LD decay parameter for adjacent underlying alleles was set to 0.998  with an average of 16 667 markers per chromosome  spaced randomly. Linkage disequilibria derived from the simulated and from real genotypes were compared by squared correlations of marker genotypes plotted against physical distance between markers. The haplotyping algorithm was tested using a single simulated chromosome with a length of 1 Morgan  which is the average length for cattle chromosomes. Gains in reliability from genomic evaluation were tested using sums of estimated allele effects across all 30 simulated chromosomes. True haplotypes from the simulation allow proportions of correctly called linkage phases and paternal allele origins to be checked. Correct calls were summarized for each animal to determine how successful the algorithm was for different members of the pedigree. These estimates of genotype or haplotype accuracy from simulation are needed because true values are not available for comparison with real data. Genotypes  linkage phases and haplotypes were estimated for all animals and compared with their true genotypes and haplotypes from simulation. For each heterozygous marker  paternity was considered to be correctly called if the allele presumed to be from the sire was actually from the sire. Linkage phase was considered to be correctly called if estimated phase matched true phase for each adjacent pair of heterozygous markers. Effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) were simulated with a heavy-tailed distribution. Standard  normal effects () were converted to have heavy tails using the function 2. The locus with the largest effect contributed 2 to 4% of the additive genetic variance across five replicates  and the number of QTL was 10 000  which is greater than the 100 QTL used previously []. Small advantages of nonlinear over linear models for dairy cattle traits indicate many more QTL than previously assumed in most simulations. Similarly  human stature is very heritable (i.e. 0.8) but the 50 largest SNP effects account for only 5% of the variance []. If a few large QTL do exist  these causative mutations could be selected for directly instead of increasing density of markers everywhere. Five replicates of the simulated data were analyzed as five traits  and QTL effects for each trait were independent. Just one set of genotypes contained the five QTL replicates for efficiency as in []. All QTL were located between the markers; none of the markers had a direct effect on the traits. Error variance for each genotyped animal was calculated from the reliability of its traditional milk yield evaluation  which for cows might include only one or a few records with a 30% heritability but for bulls could include hundreds or thousands of daughter records. Daughter equivalents from parents were removed from total daughter equivalents to obtain reliability from own records and progeny (REL)  and error variance for each animal equalled additive genetic variance times the reciprocal of reliability minus one  i.e. s (1/REL -1). Two mixed density data sets were simulated  which included genotypes from both 500 000- and 50 000- marker chips  to determine if a few thousand higher density genotypes would be sufficient to impute  using program findhap.f90  the missing genotypes for the other animals genotyped with 50 000 markers. The first analysis included 1 406 randomly chosen young bulls with 500 000 markers and the other 32 008 animals with 50 000 markers. The second analysis had 3 726 bulls with 500 000 markers  including 2 140 older bulls that had 99% reliability plus the same 1 406 young bulls  and the other 29 788 animals had 50 000 markers. The vector of observed  deregressed observations () was modelled with an overall mean (Xb)  genotypes minus twice the base allele frequency (Z) multiplied by allele effects ()  a vector of polygenic effects for genotyped animals ()  and a vector of errors () with differing variance depending on REL: To solve for polygenic effects  equations for all ancestors of the genotyped animals are included along with   so that the simple inverse for pedigree relationships could be constructed []. Reliabilities of solutions for Zu +  were obtained from squared correlations of estimated and true breeding values and averaged across five replicates for 14 061 young bull predictions. Dense markers account for most but not all of the additive genetic variation  and the remaining fraction of variance is the polygenic contribution () assumed to be 10 and 0% of genetic variance with 50 000 and 500 000 markers  respectively. Values of  have been assumed to equal from 0 to 20% of additive genetic variance in most national evaluations of actual 50 000-marker data;  should increase with fewer or decrease with more available markers. An initial test with 500 000 markers indicated a 0.1% decrease in reliability and slower convergence with 5%  as compared to 0%  in the model. Linear and nonlinear models were both applied to the simulated data using the same methods as []. The nonlinear model was analogous to Bayes A []  and a range of values was tested for the parameter controlling the shape of the distribution for both marker densities. Approximate reliability formulas are needed because correlations of true breeding value (BV) with genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) are not available in actual data. The maximum genomic reliability that can be obtained in practice (REL) is limited by the maximum marker density and by the size of the reference population. As the reference population becomes infinitely large  reliability should approach 1 minus  because  is the residual QTL variance not traceable by the markers on the chip. Total daughter equivalents (DE) from the reference population can be obtained by summing traditional reliabilities (REL) minus the reliabilities of parent average (REL)  multiplying by the ratio of error to sire variance ()  and dividing by the equivalent reference size () needed to achieve 50% genomic REL []: Genomic reliabilities for individual animals can account for their traditional reliabilities  numbers of markers genotyped  quality of imputation  and relationship to the reference population. Animals that are less or more related to the reference population may have lower or higher DE. Accounting for individual relationships is automatic with inversion [] or can be approximated without inversion using elements of the genomic relationship matrix [  ]. Conversion of DE to genomic REL should account for the fact that genotyped SNP do not perfectly track all QTL in the genome if full sequences are not available. Multiplication by 1 -  prevents reliability to reach 100%. If all reference animals are genotyped at the highest chip density  the expected genomic REL for young animals without pedigree information can be calculated as: Each animal's traditional REL is converted to daughter equivalents (DE)  and these are added to DE adjusted for any additional error introduced by genotyping at lower SNP density. The reduced daughter equivalents from genomics (DE) can be calculated from the squared correlation between estimated and true genotypes averaged across loci (REL) for each animal as: The animal's total reliability REL is computed from the sum of the daughter equivalents as: Examples of actual and simulated LD patterns are in Figures  and   respectively. Squared correlations from actual or simulated genotypes were about equal on average for markers separated by 10 to 3000 kb  but actual genotypes had a wider range of values with more very high or low squared correlations that continued across more distant markers. Further testing or a modified algorithm may be needed to obtain a closer match. If true LD is higher than simulated  the reliability of genomic predictions should also be higher  but the advantages of higher density would be less if the lower density markers already have strong LD with the QTL. . . Measures of imputation success from 50 000 markers  500 000 markers  and the two mixed density datasets are in Table . Statistics are provided separately for animals with phenotypes in the reference population  labelled old  and animals without phenotypes  labelled young. In the single-density data sets  percentage of missing genotypes was 1.0% originally but after haplotyping only 0.07% were incorrect  i.e. 0.93% of the missing genotypes were imputed correctly. In the two mixed density data sets  80 to 86% of the markers were missing originally and 93 to 96% of these missing markers were imputed. The remaining 6.4% and 3.3% of alleles in the two datasets that were not observed and not imputed were set to population allele frequency. If only one allele was imputed  allele frequency was substituted for only the other  unknown allele  and these loci counted as half imputed. Many non-genotyped ancestors with 100% of markers missing originally had sufficiently accurate imputed data to meet the 90% call rate required for genotyped animals. Thus  1 117 ancestors could have their imputed genotypes included in the genomic evaluation. Nearly all of those animals were dams because most sires were already genotyped. Imputation of the remaining non-genotyped sires was difficult because they had few progeny and because most dams of their progeny were not genotyped. Paternal alleles were determined incorrectly for about 2% of the heterozygous markers for young animals and for about 4% for old animals in the single-density data. Rates of incorrect paternal allele calls were low because nearly all sires were genotyped  but increased to about 5% for young and 7% for old animals in the mixed-density data. The most popular sires and dams had 100% correctly called linkage phases and paternal alleles  whereas animals with fewer close relatives had somewhat fewer correct calls. Linkage phase was determined incorrectly for less than 2% of the adjacent pairs of heterozygous markers  except for old animals in the mixed-density data when only young animals had been genotyped at higher density. Five percent or fewer of the missing high-density marker genotypes were imputed incorrectly. The most frequent individual haplotype within a segment was observed on average 5 883 times and accounted for 8.8% of all haplotypes in the population. The most frequent estimated haplotypes were also the most frequent true haplotypes  and their frequencies were similar  averaging 9.2% true vs. 8.8% estimated frequency of the most common haplotype. High frequencies for fairly long haplotypes are not surprising given the pedigree structure and large contributions from popular sires in the recent past. Numbers of estimated haplotypes averaged 6 627 per 500-marker segment and were very consistent across segments with a SD of only 229. Numbers of true haplotypes averaged 2 735 and were smaller than estimated  possibly because genotyping errors inflated the estimated counts. Numbers of estimated haplotypes decreased to an average of 5 092 per 100-marker segment used with the 50 K single-density data  but the SD increased to 318. The number of potential haplotypes was 66 828 with two haplotypes per animal and 33 414 animals  as compared to only 6 627 observed. Thus  each estimated haplotype was observed about 10 times on average. With real genotypes  large numbers of haplotypes in a particular segment can indicate regions that are more heterozygous  regions with higher recombination rate such as the pseudo-autosomal region of the X chromosome []  misplaced markers on the chromosome map  or genotyping errors. Any markers placed by mistake on the wrong chromosome would generate high crossover rates with \"adjacent\" markers and seriously reduce the efficiency of haplotyping. Time and memory requirements using one processor were reasonable for all steps with 500 000 markers and are summarized in Table . Computations were performed on an Intel Nehalem-EX 2.27 Ghz processor. Simulation of the genotypes required 1.8 hours and 39 gigabytes memory. Storage of the resulting genotypes required 13 gigabytes for 500 000 markers; however  storage of haplotypes required only 2.5 gigabytes. The shared haplotypes were stored just once  and only index numbers were stored for individuals instead of full haplotypes. For the mixed density datasets  only the observed genotypes and the imputed haplotype index numbers were stored  rather than the imputed genotypes  which greatly decreased storage requirements. Haplotyping required two hours and 0.6 gigabytes of memory with 50 000 markers and 100 markers per segment for 33 414 animals. Time increased only to 2.5 hours and 3 gigabytes memory with 500 000 simulated markers and 500 markers per segment for this same population. Computing time increased much less than linearly with number of markers because most haplotypes were excluded as not matching after checking just the first few markers in the segment. Time was about equally divided between population and pedigree haplotyping steps  and memory required was about the same for each. Genomic evaluation required 8 gigabytes of memory and 30 hours to complete 150 iterations for five replicates with 500 000 markers. Convergence was poor for the highly correlated marker effects but was acceptable for the breeding value estimates. Squared correlations of true and estimated breeding values increased by < 0.1% after 150 iterations on average across replicates. Variance of the change in GEBV from consecutive iterations was about .00004 of the variance of GEBV at 150 iterations. Reliability of GEBV from the nonlinear model averaged 86.0% for young bulls when all animals were genotyped with 500 000 markers as compared with 84.4% using a 50 000-marker subset. This 1.6% reliability increase is similar to that obtained by doubling the number of markers from 20 000 to 40 000 with real data [] and indicates diminishing returns from greater marker density. The computed reliability from 8 974 bulls plus 4 348 cows and 50 000 simulated markers is 18.1% higher than the 66.3% obtained from 2 175 bulls in an earlier simulation using similar methods []  and is consistent with continued strong gains from more actual reference animals in both North America and Europe []. Table  shows results from the analysis of the two mixed densities as well as those from 50 000 or 500 000 single density datasets using the same five data replicates. Genotyping 1 406 bulls at higher density gave about half of the increase in reliability as genotyping all of the 33 414 animals at higher density. Initially  86% of genotypes were missing  but only 6% of genotypes were missing after haplotyping. With 3 726 bulls  reliability increased to 85.6% and the gain was 75% of that from genotyping all animals at high density. Reliabilities from a linear model with normal prior were about 1.5% lower than those from the nonlinear model with a heavy-tailed prior for both the 50 K and 500 K simulated data. Optimum parameter values for the prior distribution were about 2 with 50 K data and 4 with 500 K data  much higher than the 1.12 reported by Cole et al. [] from actual 50 K data. In linear models  the parameter equals 1.0. Advantages from nonlinear models averaged slightly more than those reported by Cole et al. [] and did not increase with 500 K data  perhaps because adjacent markers are highly correlated within breeds and large numbers of QTL with small effects on traits make isolation of individual marker effects difficult. Harris and Johnson [] reported no advantage from nonlinear models for higher-density  within-breed simulated data. Larger advantages would be expected if only a few large QTL were simulated  as in Meuwissen and Goddard []. If causative mutations become known  chips could be redesigned to genotype these directly instead of increasing density for all regions equally. Until now  patents have excluded known QTL from chip designs. Reliabilities expected with larger reference populations and larger marker densities are in Figure . Expectations in the graph are for yield traits using a single density  but combined densities instead allow genotypes to be imputed  bringing reliabilities much closer to those possible when all animals are genotyped at highest density. The graph reflects the 1.6% increase in reliability observed in this simulation. A larger reliability increase was expected from the 10% polygenic variance assumed in U.S. 50 000 marker evaluations. Reliability from 3 000 markers is based on previous studies of actual genotypes [  ]. . Calculations to obtain the REL in Figure  were as follows. For the 13 322 reference animals (proven bulls and cows)  REL averaged 87%  REL averaged 35%  the sum of REL minus REL was 13322(.87 - .35) = 6927  and the variance ratio assumed was 15. For the GEBV of young animals  the observed REL was 84.0% with 500 000 markers. Removal of the contribution from PA reduced this slightly to 82.5%. The remaining polygenic variation not captured by the 500 000 markers was not estimated but assumed to be only 1%. Thus  DE equalled 15(.825/.99)/(1 - .825/.99) = 74.8 and from this the value of  was 1389. The REL expected from different reference populations and marker numbers were calculated as follows. With 50 000 instead of 500 000 markers  DE is the same but REL from the observed reference population after removing the contribution from REL was 80.5% instead of 82.5%. This difference in REL gave a solution for  of 1 - .99(.805/.825) = 3.4% with 50 000 markers instead of 1% assumed with 500 000 markers. Similar math applied to REL from 3 000 vs. 43 000 markers with real data in another study [] gave a solution for  of 30%. Those values of  produced the differing REL expected with 3 000  50 000  or 500 000 markers  for example 72.8%  94.3%  96.5%  respectively  with 100 000 animals in the reference population. Methods to estimate proportions of correctly called genotypes or squared correlations of estimated and true genotypes are needed for individual animals so that REL can be included in the published REL. Observed reliabilities from actual genotypes may be lower than those from simulation [] and are affected by the distribution of QTL effects  LD among markers  and selection within the population. Current results differ slightly from those reported earlier by VanRaden [] because of improvements to the haplotyping algorithm  changes to the initial LD and crossover rate simulated  and optimization of the prior parameter for the nonlinear model. With linear mixed models  computation could be greatly reduced using eigenvectors and eigenvalues [] so that marker equations within chromosomes are diagonal []. Reliability gains from increasing marker density in the single breed simulated were small but could be larger if marker effects were estimated from multiple-breed data. The LD of QTL with adjacent markers is not well preserved across breeds with 50 000 markers but should be with 500 000 markers []. Thus  higher density genotypes may be more valuable for across than within-breed selection []. Pedigrees are not recorded for many animals in actual populations  and much of this information can be recovered even using low density genotyping. Algorithms for imputation are rapidly evolving to meet the demands of growing genomic datasets. Several programs such as those tested by Weigel et al. [] are available and may provide similar or better results with fewer markers or animals  but most were not designed for very large populations or very dense markers. Fortran program findhap.f90 requires little time and memory and is available at  for download. Official genomic evaluations of USDA have used findhap.f90 to impute and include genotypes of dams since April 2010 and 3 000-marker genotypes since December 2010. Further improvements to imputation algorithms will increase accuracy and allow smaller fractions of animals to be genotyped at highest density. New methods are needed for combining multiple densities  for example 3 000  50 000  and 500 000 markers  in the same dataset. During the 5 months of review for this manuscript  version 2 of findhap.f90 was released with better properties than those documented here for version 1. Use of pedigree haplotyping followed by population haplotyping can further improve call rates and reduce error rates with similar computation required (Mehdi Sargolzaei  U. Guelph  personal communication  2010). The expense of genotyping 1 000-2 000 animals at higher density can be justified for a large population such as Holstein  but larger benefits may be needed if similar numbers are required within each breed. Experimental design is becoming a more important part of animal breeding to balance the speed  reliability and cost of selection. With many new technologies and options available  breeders and breeding companies need accurate advice on the potential of each investment to yield returns. Costs of genotyping are decreasing rapidly  and imputation using less dense marker sets allows the missing genotypes to be obtained almost for free. Genotypes and genomic computations are rapidly expanding the data and tools available to breeders. Very high marker density increases reliability of within-breed selection slightly (1.6%) in simulation  whereas lower densities allow breeders to apply cost-effective genomic selection to many more animals. Numbers of reference animals affect reliability more than number of markers  and animals with imputed genotypes contribute to the reference population. New methods for combining information from multiple data sets can improve gains with less cost. Individual reliabilities can be adjusted to account for the number of markers and the accuracy of imputation. More precise estimates of reliability allow breeders to properly balance benefits vs. costs of using different marker sets. Computer programs that combined population haplotyping with pedigree haplotyping performed well with mixtures of 500 000 and 50 000 marker genotypes simulated for subsets of 33 414 animals. Population haplotyping methods rapidly matched DNA segments for individuals with or without genotyped ancestors  and pedigree haplotyping efficiently imputed genotypes of the non-genotyped parents and correctly filled most missing alleles for progeny genotyped with lower marker density. Accurate imputation can give breeders more reliable genomic evaluations on more animals without genotyping each for all markers. intercept (genetic base) true breeding value genomic daughter equivalents with all markers observed traditional daughter equivalents reduced daughter equivalents from genomics vector of errors genomic estimated breeding value ratio of error to sire variance equivalent reference size needed to achieve 50% genomic reliability vector of polygenic effects for each genotyped animal ratio of polygenic variance to additive genetic variance maximum genomic reliability for an animal with all markers observed reliability of parent average reliability from own records and progeny squared correlation between estimated and true genotypes averaged across loci for each animal animal's total reliability from all sources reliability of traditional evaluation vector of allele effects incidence matrix (= 1) for intercept vector of observations matrix of genotypes minus twice the base allele frequency additive genetic variance.

However  few studies have investigated these mechanisms in the case of animal diseases under commercial constraints. The paper proposes a method to simultaneously describe (1) the dynamics of transmission of a contagious pathogen between animals  (2) the growth and death of the pathogen within infected hosts and (3) the effects on their performances. The effectiveness of increasing individual levels of tolerance and resistance is evaluated by the number of infected animals and the performance at the population level. The model is applied to a particular set of parameters and different combinations of values. Given these imputed values  it is shown that higher levels of individual tolerance should be more effective than increased levels of resistance in commercial populations. As a practical example  a method is proposed to measure levels of animal tolerance to bovine mastitis. The model provides a general framework and some tools to maximize health and performances of a population under infection. Limits and assumptions of the model are clearly identified so it can be improved for different epidemiological settings. The breeding objective in most livestock species is to increase profit by improving performance efficiency. One way to reach this objective is to improve the animals' health  for example  through the implementation of appropriate management methods (e.g. chemotherapy  vaccination  and control of disease vectors). A more sustainable method consists in taking advantage  by selective breeding  of the within-breed variation that exists in the mechanisms of defenses against infectious pathogens []. Indeed  hosts have evolved resistance and tolerance defenses []  thus breeders may choose  as progenitors  animals with the highest levels of resistance  tolerance  or both. One the one hand  resistance is the ability of the host to reduce the success of infection or to increase the rate of clearance of the pathogens. On the other hand  tolerance is the ability to reduce the detrimental effects of the pathogens on the performances of the hosts  either directly or by limiting immunopathological mechanisms []. The rate of transmission diminishes naturally among resistant hosts but not necessarily among tolerant ones  as these harbor the pathogen with no or moderate loss in performance []. Resistance and tolerance are associated with fitness costs  which arise from the diversion of limiting resources away from biological processes related to performance []. If these costs are too high  they may outweigh the effectiveness of the chosen strategy. Direct evidence of such costs can be found in experiments in insects []  rainbow trout []  crustaceans []  wild birds [] and mice []. To decide whether improving resistance  tolerance  neither  or both is the most effective strategy  it is proposed to (1) characterize the dynamics of the pathogens within and between hosts in the population under study  (2) evaluate the impact of the infection on the performances of the population  and (3) choose the most effective strategy. The goal of this study is to illustrate the methodology with a non-lethal micro-parasitic disease in a population where hosts have different levels of resistance to multiplication of the pathogen and different levels of tolerance to damages induced directly by the pathogens. The model chosen here to depict the dynamics of transmission of the infection in a herd is a stochastic version of the SIS (S for susceptible  I for infected) model for the spread of a disease in a closed population of N individuals []. This model is appropriate for infections with no permanent immunity after recovery  i.e. individuals are susceptible to the infection  potentially get infected  may recover and become susceptible again. The time-scale of the disease process is assumed to be short compared to the life length of the host and no demographic turnover (natural birth or death) is considered. The area occupied by parasites and hosts is constant  so that numbers and densities coincide. There is only a single non-evolving pathogen species within infected hosts. Once infected  hosts are immediately able to infect other individuals (no latent period). Within the host  the number of pathogens increases following a sigmoidal growth curve and is directly related to the number of immune constituents of the host response to the pathogen  with no distinction between innate and specific immunity. Recovered hosts are as susceptible to infection as naïve hosts and re-exposure does not accelerate development of the disease. In mathematical terms  the process is described by a continuous time Markov chain  {C; t = 0 to T  i = 1 to N}  where C denotes the number of pathogens in the i host at time t. Units of time are chosen arbitrarily. The chain has three transition probabilities (over a small time interval <U+0394>t) reflecting the three events  i.e. invasion of a new host by the pathogen  its multiplication and its killing by the immune response of the host. The first transition probability is the probability the i susceptible host is infected by C pathogens: where o(<U+0394>t) tends to 0 when <U+0394>t is small  C is the minimum number of pathogens necessary to have infection  ß is the per-capita rate of successful transmission of C pathogens from an infectious host to a susceptible host upon contact with an infectious individual and during <U+0394>t  and I is the number of infectious hosts with which the i susceptible has contact. The second transition probability is the probability that a pathogen in an infected host gives birth to C new offspring  such that this host becomes infectious: where <U+03B3> is the pathogen growth rate. Right after becoming infected  pathogen growth in a host is approximately exponential but it slows down as it reaches a maximum (C)  at which it stops. The last transition probability is the probability that C pathogens are killed within the host: This equation follows from the dynamics between pathogens and immune factors  as observed in experimental studies [  ]. Parameter µ represents the maximum number of pathogens killed for each unit of R  with R being a generic index related to the number  at time t  of the different types of immune factors specific for that pathogen. Because the main interest is on the number of pathogens  the complexity of the immune response is greatly simplified when R increases at a rate (h) that is constant across time. The scaling parameter <U+03C1> varies from 0 to 1 and represents the extra investment in resistance of the i host with respect to µ. When C drops below C  the infection is assumed to be cleared. The Markov chain was simulated using the Gillespie algorithm []  which essentially uses exponential waiting times between events. For all simulations  it was assumed that two individuals in the population were initially infected. Simulation steps were executed until t reaches T units of time (= one replicate) and repeated over 50 replicates. Each cycle took around 4 hours to complete  so the population size was limited at 30 individuals  which is the average size of most dairy herds in the Walloon region of Belgium. The performance of an infected host decreases proportionally to the number of pathogens (C) and to investments of the host in tolerance []: where P is the performance of the i host at time t  when it is infected with C pathogens  <U+03C9> is the maximum amount of performance lost per pathogen (virulence). The parameter <U+03BB> is a scaling parameter representing the extra investment in tolerance. If <U+03BB> = 1  the host is completely tolerant and produces at a level identical to the one without infection. If <U+03BB> = 0  the host is not tolerant to the deleterious effects of the pathogen. Hosts invest part of their constitutive resources to resist or tolerate the pathogens and costs are assumed proportional to the investments in both types of defense. They are combined in an additive way: where P is the totality of the resources available to the host to insure performance (e.g.  production  reproduction  work) and to cope with an infection (resistance and tolerance). If no extra-investments are put in resistance and tolerance  all resources are allocated to insure the highest achievable level of performance in the absence of infection. Parameter c is the marginal cost of resistance and c is the marginal cost of tolerance (in units of performance). Values for both costs are constrained such that the factor within brackets remains positive (<U+03C1> c + <U+03BB> c = 1). A constraint was also set to insure P (equation 4) remains positive or null in totally non-tolerant individuals infected with K pathogens: <U+03C9> = P(1 - <U+03C1> c)/K. Typical patterns in performance as a function of number of pathogens are shown schematically in Figure  to illustrate the different ways resources can be allocated between resistance  tolerance and performance (costs are assumed equal for resistance and tolerance). Performances of hosts allocating none of the available resources to resistance and tolerance are the highest at the start of infection (P = P) and decrease as C increases. Numbers of pathogens remain below 20 among resistant hosts  and performances of tolerant hosts do not decline with increasing parasite burden. . The most profitable strategy  i.e. the one that will insure the lowest number of infected animals or the highest performance of the population  or both  was identified by weighing the allowed extra investments in resistance  tolerance  or both  against the effectiveness of each of these alternatives. Effectiveness was computed by comparing populations under the same infection process but in which animals invest ('yes' population) or not ('no' populations) in resistance  tolerance  or both. To do so  the number of infected hosts (I) and the overall performance (P = S P) were followed across time  and the area under the curves of P (AUC) and I (AUC) were obtained for t = 0 to T with the spline method of the procedure Expand of SAS[]. Subsequently  the incremental effects (<U+0394>E and <U+0394>E) were computed as the difference between corresponding 'yes' and 'no' populations: <U+0394>E = AUC - AUC  and <U+0394>E = AUC - AUC. Then  the most effective alternative was identified as the one with the highest values for <U+0394>E and <U+0394>E. Incremental effects were calculated for different sets of parameters (Table ). Two transmission rates were considered  with ß = 0.1 and ß = 0.5  which correspond to a new infection per 10 and 2 effective contacts  respectively. The minimum number of pathogens was set to C = 10 and the maximum to C = 500. The growth rate (<U+03B3>) was set at 0.5 new pathogens for each existing one and the value for µ was set to 0.25 or 1.0 to obtain killing rates equal to half or twice the pathogen growth rate. A convenient value of 100 was given to P  while virulence (<U+03C9>) was set at 0.1 or 0.2 units of performance lost per pathogen present. Individual extra investments in resistance and tolerance were drawn from uniform distributions with different extreme values to have low (U[0  0.5])  average (U[0  1])  or high (U[0.9  1]) levels of investments. Associated costs were drawn from uniform distributions within the allowable limits imposed by equations () and (): U [0  0.1]  U [0.1  0.2]  and U [0.2  0.5]. Finally  effects of low  average and high levels of extra-investments in resistance and tolerance on <U+0394>E and <U+0394>E were quantified using fixed linear models (proc GLM on SAS[]) that also contained the effects of ß  µ  and <U+03C9> for the characteristics of the pathogen  the averages at the population level of h  c and c for the characteristics of the hosts  and all first-order interactions. The resulting least-squares estimates were used to identify epidemiological situations for which investments in tolerance  resistance or both were effective. The number of pathogens within a host is shown in Figure  for 10 animals in a 'no' population with the following characteristics: ß = 0.5; µ = 0.1; <U+03C9> = 0.1; h ~ U [0  0.001]  and <U+03C1> = <U+03BB> = 0 for i = 1 to N. The duration and the number of pathogens generated were approximately the same for all animals because they depended on <U+03B3> = 0.5 (equation 2). However  the stochastic nature of the simulation resulted in a cloud of points for each C. On average  C was reached after 300 time units  so it was used as the upper limit for T because the Gillespie algorithm was slow to converge and because T = 300 insured the steady value C was reached among completely non-resistant hosts. . In Figure   the dynamics in C and P are shown for four individuals with different investments and costs of resistance and tolerance  and for an infection with ß = 0.5  <U+03B3> = 0.5  <U+03C9> = 0.2  h ~ U [0  0.1]  and µ = 0.25. When both <U+03C1> and <U+03BB> were high  C remained low and P did not change much across time (individuals <U+25A1> or +). Conversely  when <U+03C1> was low  C increased up to its maximum and the associated individual performance decreased (individual  in Figure ). Between these extremes  a wide range of different situations occurred. Initial performance (P) varied according to the costs and extra investments in tolerance and resistance (equation 3).  Associated costs are in parentheses. The number of infected hosts (I) and the overall performance (P) are given in Figure  as percentages of their maximum values (N and P  respectively) and for an infection with ß = 0.5  <U+03B3> = 0.5  <U+03C9> = 0.1  and µ = 0.25. At T = 300  all individuals in the 'no' population (Figure ) were infected (with the exception of one) and the overall performance was close to 50%  which is the minimum expected from equation  when all animals have zero tolerance and are infected with C pathogens.  The values are expressed as percentages of their maxima. When individuals invested more in resistance  only a fraction of the population got infected and AUC was low. For example  AUC decreased from 22 720 to 19 379 and 13 851 infected hosts in Figures  (<U+03C1> = 0.22)  4e (<U+03C1> = 0.46)  and 4h (<U+03C1> = 0.94)  respectively. When the average level of extra investments in tolerance was high (around 0.95)  the impact of I on P was almost zero (Figures  and ). Otherwise  P decreased as I increased  especially for low levels of tolerance (Figures  and ). This should have translated in an increase in AUC but  in this particular population  costs associated with tolerance were high (around 0.15) and initial performance was low. For example  P averaged 79.8 in Figure  (<U+03BB> = 0.95; AUC = 23 509) and 90.4 in Figure  (<U+03BB> = 0.25; AUC = 24 779). Values of <U+0394>E and <U+0394>E obtained for each combination of the parameters of Table  are shown in relation to <U+03C1> and <U+03BB> in Figure . Each dot corresponds to one specific combination of the parameter values. Effective combinations  those associated with both <U+0394>E>0 and <U+0394>E>0  represented 75.7% of all combinations. There was a tendency for <U+0394>E and <U+0394>E to increase with increasing values for <U+03C1> and <U+03BB>  respectively. However  there were also combinations of parameters for which high values for <U+03C1> or <U+03BB> were not effective  as revealed by the analysis of variance.  . Results from the analysis of variance identified significant (p < 0.01) effects of <U+03C1>  c  h  and µ on <U+0394>E  and of <U+03BB>  c  ß  and <U+03C9> on <U+0394>E. All first-order interactions were non-significant (p > 0.10). Incremental effects are given in Tables  and  for selected combinations. Overall  <U+0394>E was greater for higher values of <U+03BB> but  for moderately virulent (<U+03C9> = 0.1) and slow spreading (ß = 0.1) diseases  investments in tolerance were low or ineffective unless they incurred at low costs (Table ). Investing in resistance (Table ) was effective for infections that elicited moderate to high but not low (h ~ U[0  0.001]) immune responses in the hosts (unless levels of resistance were high). A general framework is proposed to provide insights into the effects of improved resistance and tolerance on the performance and size of an infected population. A clear distinction is made between effects of resistance on multiplication of the pathogen and effects of tolerance on damages induced by the pathogens. Hosts differ in the costs they incur to insure their particular levels of resistance and tolerance  and in the intensity of the response they mount against pathogens. Pathogens differ in their speed of spread between hosts  in virulence  and in the intensity of the response they elicit in the hosts. However  to be useful  the model must be validated and its limits and assumptions must be clarified  as will be discussed in the following  with examples mostly related to bovine mastitis. Model validation usually takes the form of a comparison between model outputs and real data but this was not possible here because reliable field data are scarce  difficult to measure or imprecisely defined [  ]. For example  estimates of costs associated with resistance and tolerance are limited in animals  in contrast to plants (see review by []). Tolerance has often been measured imprecisely as the overall ability to maintain fitness in the face of infection  irrespective of parasite burden. For example  cows infected with  have been classified as moderate and severe responders according to milk production loss in the non-challenged quarters []. In this case  it is in reality a measure of the combined effects of resistance and tolerance []. It was also a deliberate choice to present a generic model because parameters values are different among disease and host populations  so model outputs for one specific disease may not apply to another disease. For example  transmission rates have been estimated at 0.20 to 1.50 per 1000 quarter-days at risk for  mastitis [] but at 7 to 50 for  mastitis []. Similarly  killing rates have been estimated at 0.67 to 1.33 × 10 mL/cell per min in milk of cows [  ] and at 1.64 to 1.76 × 10 mL/neutrophil per min in dermis of rats inoculated with []. Model outputs will also depend on the virulence of the invading pathogens (<U+03C9>)  as exemplified by the different amount of milk loss at the first occurrence of clinical mastitis depending on bacteria species []  and on the type of performance (e.g.  yield  quality of products  or capacity for work) considered. As an alternative form of validation  the dynamics of C and P at the individual  and of I and P at the herd levels were evaluated. For instance  as expected  C was lowest in resistant and P was highest in tolerant hosts (Figure )  P remained stable across time when tolerance of the hosts was at its highest level  and I decreased faster when resistance of hosts was at its highest level (Figure ). Results from the analysis of variance also validated the model. The null value of <U+0394>E for h~U [0  0.001] was sensible because  at this low rate  pathogens cannot be killed  regardless of how much was invested in resistance. The fact that ß did not affect <U+0394>E may also be explained by the same transmission in 'yes' and 'no' populations  so AUC was close to AUC for any value of ß. As a final example  <U+0394>E was higher for ß = 0.5 than for ß = 0.1 because only few animals got infected with ß = 0.1  so improving tolerance of these few hosts was not beneficial at the population level. The strategy to build this model followed the current trend in epidemiology to begin with simple models and to add complexity only if the model fails to reproduce plausible epidemiological behaviors []. Several assumptions were made  some of which have been confirmed previously. One assumption was that available resources are partitioned between performance  resistance and tolerance. Indeed  experiences in poultry [] and other species [] have shown that individuals differ in their ability to allocate resources to their needs. This is also one of the factors evoked to explain the increased susceptibility of high yielding dairy cows to mastitis []. Lack of resources may lead to vicious cycles because hosts in poor condition are more susceptible to higher pathogen occurrence and infection intensity  which further weaken the condition of the host []. Another assumption is that investments in resistance and tolerance are linked through the constraint in equation  and this has been confirmed by []  where a negative relationship was found between resistance and tolerance in rodent malaria. Some assumptions of the model could also be relaxed with more complex equations that have been used in models examining the effects of mixed infection []  infectious dose [] and vaccination/treatment [] on transmission dynamics. Resistance could vary as a function of exposure to disease []. Availability of external resource can vary across time  as in Doesch-Wilson et al. []. In the model used here  individual infectious contacts were assumed independent and at random but models with heterogeneous mixing [] and that consider genetic susceptibility among relatives [  ] may be more appropriate. The course of infection within hosts can also be modelled more accurately  in line with the characteristics of the disease under study. For example  models with increasing complexity have been proposed to describe the fate of mastitis-causing  in infected cows [  ]. Models for co-evolutionary mechanisms between host and pathogens should be considered [] if the time scale is longer than the one used in this study. Other assumptions may be difficult to verify. For such assumptions  a set of arbitrary standard values for the parameters and different forms for equations should be tested in so-called sensitivity analyses. For example  the amount of loss in performance was assumed directly associated with pathogen load  although the most dramatic changes may occur at low or subclinical levels of disease  with diminishing effects of each additional parasite []. Two results from the effectiveness analyses are noteworthy  although they must be further evaluated in empirical studies. One is that the range of possible values of <U+0394>E and <U+0394>E for the different input parameters (Figure ) is wide. This emphasizes the need to accurately model the infection process and its impact on the population before deciding on the most effective strategy. For example  increasing host tolerance is theoretically less effective for improving performance of populations infected with pathogens that cause minor rather than major mastitis. Indeed  pathogens causing minor mastitis are less virulent (<U+03C9>) and less transmissible (ß) than those causing major mastitis []  so modest advantages of high tolerance would be offset by the associated costs. Likewise  selecting for better resistance to mastitis would be effective to restrict the size of a population epidemic if animals are infected with bacterial strains that are likely to be killed by neutrophils []  i.e. µ>0 in equation . Another noteworthy observation is that least-squares means for <U+0394>E were highest in highly tolerant populations  while <U+0394>E did not change between different tolerance levels. This suggests that selection for increased tolerance would be effective under commercial constraints. This is different from models applied to natural populations that predict an increase in the overall incidence of infection as the frequency of tolerant hosts increases []. In natural populations  tolerant hosts survive longer than non-tolerant ones  thus keeping the disease longer in the population and increasing the risk of exposure to disease. Here  the model is for an endemic disease in a population under commercial contraints  in which non-tolerant animals are kept even if they are sick (no natural death  no culling). Consequently  the risk of exposure to disease does not change  even if the pathogen population size (C) increases. In general  little is known about tolerance mechanisms in animals but their study should provide a good foundation for insuring health over the long term. Indeed  in the long term  advantages of being tolerant should be greater than those associated with resistance. For example  in non-evolving pathogen populations  advantages of being resistant decrease in parallel with the decline in disease frequency  while the advantages of being tolerant are maintained  or even increase if disease frequency rises []. In evolving pathogen populations  improved host resistance will pressure pathogens to evolve better mechanisms to evade host defense processes  potentially resulting in cyclical co-evolutionary dynamics. In contrast  tolerance does not interact directly with the pathogen and should not induce selection for counter-adaptations  although elevated levels of tolerance may allow pathogens to be more virulent []. Practically  in bovine mastitis  it the degree of tolerance of an animal can be estimated by the amount of milk loss per bacteria present in the quarter (CFU) using a model adapted from that proposed by [] for inbred strains of laboratory mice: where y is the milk yield at time t of the i cow (yield corrected for fixed and non-genetic random effects estimated from the genetic evaluation model) infected with I  i.e. the bacterial load for bacterial species j; b is the average tolerance against bacteria of strain j; B describes individual random deviations from the average tolerance with B ~ IID N(0  s²); and e are residuals with e ~ N(0  V)  where V accounts for the non-independence between repeated e. Such information could be collected from quarters of experimentally infected cows  as was done in the study of []. In summary  this paper presents a novel epidemic model to explore the effects of tolerance and resistance on performance and disease spread in a population. Although more research is necessary to validate the model and more empirical studies are needed to obtain values for the input parameters  the analytic approach can be used to find optimal strategies of disease control in commercial populations.

"Mapping of a milk production quantitative trait locus to a 1.056 Mb region on bovine chromosome 5 in the Fleckvieh dual purpose cattle breed"	"Authors: Ashraf Awad  Ingolf Russ  Martin Förster and Ivica Medugorac"	"Chair of Animal Genetics and Husbandry  Faculty of Veterinary Medicine  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich  Veterinärstr .13  80539  Munich  GermanyAshraf Awad  Martin Förster & Ivica Medugorac Tierzuchtforschung e.V.

Our objective here was to refine the position of this QTL and to define the candidate region for high-throughput sequencing.MethodsIn addition to those previously studied  new Fleckvieh families were genotyped  in order to increase the number of recombination events. Twelve new microsatellites and 240 SNP markers covering the most likely QTL region on BTA5 were analysed. Based on haplotype analysis performed in this complex pedigree  families segregating for the low frequency allele of this QTL (minor allele) were selected. Single- and multiple-QTL analyses using combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium methods were performed.ResultsSingle nucleotide polymorphism haplotype analyses on representative family sires and their ancestors revealed that the haplotype carrying the minor QTL allele is rare and most probably originates from a unique ancestor in the mapping population. Analyses of different subsets of families  created according to the results of haplotype analysis and availability of SNP and microsatellite data  refined the previously detected QTL affecting MY1 and PY1 to a region ranging from 117.962 Mb to 119.018 Mb (1.056 Mb) on BTA5. However  the possibility of a second QTL affecting only PY1 at 122.115 Mb was not ruled out.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that targeting families segregating for a less frequent QTL allele is a useful method. It improves the mapping resolution of the QTL  which is due to the division of the mapping population based on the results of the haplotype analysis and to the increased frequency of the minor allele in the families.

Our objective here was to refine the position of this QTL and to define the candidate region for high-throughput sequencing. In addition to those previously studied  new Fleckvieh families were genotyped  in order to increase the number of recombination events. Twelve new microsatellites and 240 SNP markers covering the most likely QTL region on BTA5 were analysed. Based on haplotype analysis performed in this complex pedigree  families segregating for the low frequency allele of this QTL (minor allele) were selected. Single- and multiple-QTL analyses using combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium methods were performed. Single nucleotide polymorphism haplotype analyses on representative family sires and their ancestors revealed that the haplotype carrying the minor QTL allele is rare and most probably originates from a unique ancestor in the mapping population. Analyses of different subsets of families  created according to the results of haplotype analysis and availability of SNP and microsatellite data  refined the previously detected QTL affecting MY1 and PY1 to a region ranging from 117.962 Mb to 119.018 Mb (1.056 Mb) on BTA5. However  the possibility of a second QTL affecting only PY1 at 122.115 Mb was not ruled out. This study demonstrates that targeting families segregating for a less frequent QTL allele is a useful method. It improves the mapping resolution of the QTL  which is due to the division of the mapping population based on the results of the haplotype analysis and to the increased frequency of the minor allele in the families. Consequently  we succeeded in refining the region containing the previously detected QTL to 1 Mb on BTA5. This candidate region contains 27 genes with unknown or partially known function(s) and is small enough for high-throughput sequencing  which will allow future detailed analyses of candidate genes. Recent developments in molecular biology and statistical methodologies for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping have made it possible to identify genetic factors affecting economically important traits. Such developments have the potential to significantly increase the rate of genetic improvement of livestock species  through marker-assisted selection of specific loci  genome-wide selection  gene introgression and positional cloning []. However  after an initial exaggerated enthusiasm animal geneticists  like their colleagues in human genetics e.g. [] have faced somewhat unexpected challenges. The first step in QTL mapping usually involves a complete or partial genome scan  where the mapping population is genotyped for markers covering the entire genome or only selected chromosomes  respectively. The QTL are then mapped using linkage analysis (LA) methods. The resolution of this mapping approach is low because relatively few new recombination events are generated in the single generation separating parents and progeny. Typically  the size of confidence intervals for the most likely QTL positions ranges between 20 and 40 cM. Fine-mapping approaches have been developed to reduce these confidence intervals e.g. []  leading in some instances to the identification of the underlying causal mutation []. These approaches are usually based on the addition of new families  new markers and the use of statistical methods combining linkage-disequilibrium and linkage (LDL) analysis. In general  the marker density is increased by adding a few tens of new markers (microsatellite markers or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) identified within the QTL region or candidate gene. At present  high-throughput SNP analysis provides the opportunity to genotype many animals for hundreds or even thousands of SNP per bovine chromosome []. Therefore  the limiting factors in QTL fine-mapping studies have now switched partly from marker density to the applied methods and designs. Use of linkage-disequilibrium (LD) information increases the precision of QTL mapping because it exploits the entire number of recombinations accumulated since the original mutation generating the new QTL allele occurred []. The degree of LD in livestock populations has attracted much attention because it provides useful information regarding the possibility of fine-mapping QTL and the potential to use marker-assisted selection. In cattle  previous reports using a low density microsatellite map (10 cM interval on average) and Hedrick's normalized measure of LD [] have shown that LD extends over several tens of centimorgans [    ]. However  an exceedingly low long-range and non-syntenic LD has been estimated [] when evaluated by the standardized chi-square measure of LD  which is related to the predictive ability of LD. Nevertheless  the extent of LD in cattle [] is greater than in humans [] but smaller than in dog []. Combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage (LDL) analysis [] makes it possible to exploit recombinations occurring both within and outside the pedigree and genotyped population. It also gives a clearer signal for QTL positions compared with LA or LD mapping alone []. Additionally  the LDL approach reduces the risk of false-positive QTL identification caused by accidental marker-phenotype associations when LA and LD are used separately  and also increases the power and resolution of QTL mapping by combining all available information []. In dairy cattle  several studies have reported the presence of one or more QTL affecting milk production traits on BTA5 e.g. []  but the results differ among studies with respect to the number of QTL detected  their positions  and the extent to which the milk traits are affected by the QTL. The present study aimed at refining the previously detected QTL affecting milk yield (MY1)  milk protein yield (PY1) and milk fat yield (FY1) during first lactation in the distal part of BTA5 in the Fleckvieh dual-purpose cattle breed []  and to define the candidate region for high-throughput sequencing. To achieve this  we sampled additional families carrying the low frequency allele of the putative QTL (minor QTL allele) and genotyped additional markers covering the most likely QTL region on BTA5. These new families were identified by combining results from QTL-mapping based on microsatellites and haplotype analysis based on SNP in a complex pedigree. Single- and multiple-QTL analyses based on the LDL method were performed in different sample-sets  in order to allocate the minor QTL allele to specific families and to use the increased frequency of the minor QTL allele for refined mapping. In this study  we analysed the same nine granddaughter (GD) families used in our previous study []  in which we identified three GD families (G01  G02 and G03) as heterozygous for a QTL located in the distal region of BTA5. The grandsires of these three GD families are designated as G01  G02 and G03  respectively. Grandsires G01 and G02 are half-sibs and have inherited the same haplotype in the distal region of BTA5 from their common ancestor A0 []. By target sampling (see haplotyping section  below)  we introduced two additional GD families; family G10 with 85 sons  and family G11 with 47 sons. Grandsire G10 (grandsire of family G10)  was connected through his dam to A0. Grandsire G11 (grandsire of family G11) is a son of grandsire G02. In addition  we identified all available progeny-tested maternal grandsons of grandsires G01  G02  G10 and G11 to add more  possibly recombinant  A0 haplotypes into the mapping population. In this way  we created three maternal grandsire (MGS) families  M02 with 21 grandsons  M10 with 32 grandsons and M11 with 33 grandsons  descendants of grandsires G02  G10 and G11  respectively. Samples of maternal grandsons were not available for grandsire G01. Thus  the analysis included 11 GD families: G01 to G11 and three MGS families (M02  M10 and M11). Figure  shows the relationships of all families included in this study. In some cases  mapping analyses were carried out on 173 additional animals available from other projects that are not descended from ancestor A0. Estimated breeding values (EBV) of the Fleckvieh bulls for milk production traits MY1  PY1  and FY1  (along with their reliability values) were obtained from the 2009 joint Austria-Germany genetic evaluation of the Fleckvieh population []. . A complex pedigree of 38 sires (squares) of GD families (G)  ten sires of daughter design (DD) families  three maternal grandsire (M) families and 26 sampled and genotyped relevant ancestors; the pedigree has been simplified by showing only ancestors who made it possible to trace haplotypes from family-sires to the most important ancestors (A0  A1  A2); furthermore  to reduce the complexity of the figure  ancestor A1 is represented more than once; correspondingly  letters and numbers within squares of family-sires represent the internal family ID; non-genotyped individuals are represented by smaller circles (females) and squares (males) marked with a diagonal line; the estimated haplotype of 25 markers () comprising a derived QTL allele affecting MY1 and PY1 with 97% CI between 117.962 Mb and 119.018 Mb is graphically presented by yellow bars above the individual's symbol; five other most frequent haplotypes are represented by five different coloured bars; introgression of Red-Holstein genes into the mapping populations is represented by ancestor A2 and the corresponding haplotype presented by a red bar; to reduce the complexity of the figure  77 low frequency haplotypes are omitted; the allelic composition of the respective haplotypes is presented within the figure; the pedigree    is a subset of the total material which can be constructed by keeping the families marked by a grey circle around squares and associated ancestors; pedigrees    and    are subsets of    which can be constructed by removing appropriate families as described in material and methods; the pedigree    consists of GD family G36 and animals across the entire mapping population but not descending from A0; the pedigree    is a sum of pedigrees    and   . Genomic DNA was prepared from semen using standard methods  and from whole blood samples with QIAamp Blood-Kits (Qiagen)  according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twelve evenly distributed microsatellite markers were added to the 28 microsatellite markers used in the previous study []. Twenty-one of these 40 microsatellite markers covered the most likely region containing the QTL in the distal part of BTA5 (Table ) and were used in most analyses of the present study. Previously analysed animals were genotyped only for the new markers  but the five new families (G10  G11  M02  M10 and M11) were genotyped for all marker sets []. For 11 of the 12 markers  relevant information was obtained from the MARC-ARS-USDA public database at  []. The new marker  was obtained by a targeted search for dinucleotide repeats in genomic regions with a low marker density. The unique sequences flanking the newly identified dinucleotide repeats were tested for informativity by genotyping a small set of animals first. Primers for the 12 new microsatellite markers were optimized using Primer3 (v.0.4.0) according to the bovine genome sequence data currently available (i.e. Baylor release Btau_4.0  ) and the appropriate fragment size in the currently designed marker set. New markers were divided into two PCR multiplex sets (Table ) that were combined again after PCR for electrophoresis and fragment analysis. The fragment analysis of the PCR products was performed on ABI377 and ABI Prism 310 sequencers. Genotypes were assigned using     and   (Applied Biosystems) software programs. We performed double genotyping of all families and ancestors using two independent runs. For ambiguous genotypes  the raw data were re-evaluated and animals were re-genotyped if necessary. SNP genotyping was carried out by Tierzuchtforschung e. V. München using the commercial Illumina Bovine SNP50 Bead chip featuring 54 001 SNP (; Illumina  San Diego) that span the bovine genome  excluding Y-chromosome. The genotype calling was performed with the GenCall application  as implemented in Illumina Bead chip Genotyping analysis software. This application computes a Gencall score for each locus  which evaluates the quality of genotypes. We included only animals with confirmed paternity and with a call rate above 0.98. Furthermore  we only used markers with a call rate above 0.90. We excluded all markers producing more than 1% paternity problems in pairs with confirmed paternity  and also excluded all markers that were non-informative in the Fleckvieh population or with an unknown chromosomal position. This yielded 43 806 informative SNP available for the whole-genome analysis in the Fleckvieh population  of which 1 976 are found on the BTA5. Two hundred and forty of these covered the region most likely containing the QTL in the distal part of BTA5 and were used in the present study. We performed SNP genotyping in two stages. First  75 animals i.e. the gransires of the nine initial GD families and their ancestors  and also a number of potential GD-family sires and their ancestors  were genotyped with the SNP chip and their haplotypes were reconstructed with the   program []. These 75 animals constitute a complex pedigree (Figure ) in which it is possible to trace the segregating haplotypes five generations back to some important ancestors of the Fleckvieh population  born in the 1960's and 1970's. This pedigree represents almost all of the important bull lines originating from a wide range of dams. Considering this  and the fact that a large proportion of the included bull dams are unrelated (no common grand-parents)  these 75 animals provide a good representation of the haplotype diversity in the breeding Fleckvieh population. Second  the new families (G10  G11  M02  M10 and M11) containing the target haplotype segment of ancestor A0 were genotyped with microsatellite markers and with the genome-wide SNP chip. These animals and 173 additional Fleckvieh animals not closely related to ancestor A0 (but genotyped with the SNP chip in other projects running in our laboratory) were also haplotyped using the   program. The relative positions of microsatellite markers were re-evaluated by the     program []. A physical map was constructed according to the sequence data of all the markers (Table ) using the basic alignment search tool (BLAST) and the latest cattle genome sequence . Our genetic data was used to resolve cases where more than one marker order was obtained from published linkage and physical maps. When our genetic data supported a marker order different from that of the public linkage map  but in accordance to the physical map  we modified the relative position (cM) of the markers along with the corresponding sequence. The linkage and physical maps were used as a framework to insert the newly designed marker () with the build option of the     program. The resulting final map (Table ) was used for all the following analyses. Joint linkage disequilibrium and linkage (LDL) analysis is a variance component approach and we used linear mixed models to estimate variance components as described previously []. Thereby  we used the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in the program  [] (version 1.76) to estimate IBD probabilities in general complex pedigrees []. To estimate LD-based IBD probabilities  we assumed the number of generations since the base population (mutation age) and the past effective population size to be 100  and the initial homozygosity at each microsatellite marker in the base population was set to 0.35. In addition  the program   exploits allele frequencies in the population. To calculate an unbiased estimation of allele frequencies in the Fleckvieh population  we performed allele counting within the complex pedigree. We counted both alleles of all genotyped founder individuals and only the maternal allele of descendents in the pedigree. Two complex pedigrees consisting of 2 089 (  ) and 1 038 (  ) animals  respectively  were analysed by   . The   pedigree included nine GD families from the previous study (G01 to G09)  two additional GD families (G10 and G11)  three maternal grandsire families (M02  M10 and M11)  some highly related animals and some important ancestors (paternal and maternal grandsires of phenotyped sons and of family sires). The    pedigree included two GD families (G01 and G02) found to be segregating for QTL in the previous study  two additional GD (G10 and G11) families and three MGS families (M02  M10 and M11) sampled according to the results of the haplotype analysis. For both LDL analyses  as implemented in the MCMC approach of the program     we used an initial burn-in of 500 iterations followed by 2 500 iterations  with parameter estimates collected for each iteration. To avoid entrapment in a local maximum  we performed two independent sampling procedures (i.e. two   runs with different random number seeds). Here we used three complex pedigrees for LDL mapping by SNPs. The first pedigree      was based on all progeny-tested Fleckvieh animals genotyped with the SNP chip  and consisted of 325 genotyped and phenotyped sons  and 16 genotyped and 382 non genotyped ancestors. The second pedigree      was based on progeny-tested animals that could be traced back to ancestor A0  and consisted of 175 genotyped and phenotyped sons  eight genotyped and 238 non genotyped ancestors. The third pedigree      was based on animals not related to ancestor A0 according to the known pedigree  and consisted of 144 genotyped and phenotyped animals  12 genotyped and 152 non genotyped ancestors. These pedigrees were analysed with   using a dense map of 240 SNPs covering the region from 112.650 to 124.780 Mb on BTA5  i.e. a region larger than the 97% confidence interval as determined by 1-LOD support interval []. Due to computing constraints  the total marker set was divided into five overlapping sets of 80 SNP each. Since IBD estimates are most accurate in the middle of an investigated marker set  we present log-likelihood ratio (LRT) values only for the internal 40 marker intervals within these windows (that is  excluding the most proximal and most distal 20 markers). We used the model described above  setting the initial homozygosity at each SNP in the base population to 0.75 and using an initial burn-in of 500 iterations followed by 2 500 iterations. The parameter estimates were collected after each iteration. Two independent MCMC sampling procedures (i.e. two   runs with different random number seeds) indicated convergence to a global maximum. We used the analysis method of Olsen et al. []  i.e. the same model as for single-QTL analysis  but including a random QTL effect of a specified marker bracket. That is  the bracket that showed the highest LRT in the single-QTL analysis was included as a random effect in the QTL model in turn  and the analysis was repeated. These analyses searched for an additional QTL  given that the QTL in the specified marker bracket is accounted for  and is similar to the fitting of cofactors []. The variance components and the logarithm of the likelihood () of a model containing a QTL as well as residual polygenic effects at position  ( ) were estimated by AIREML [  ]  which is an integral part of the   and  programs. The likelihood of a model without QTL effect ( ) was calculated on the basis of a polygenic model. The log-likelihood ratio (LRT) was calculated as double difference in  between models with and without a QTL  i.e. LRT = -2 ( ). The LRT test statistic is distributed approximately as chi-square with 1 degree of freedom []. The confidence interval (CI) for the QTL position was determined as 1-LOD support interval  which was constructed as the interval surrounding the QTL peak where the LRT exceeds LRT - 2 ×  (10)  where LRT is the maximum LRT-value for the tested QTL []. Genotypes for 40 microsatellite markers were available to build the BTA5 genetic map. In most of the LDL analyses  only the 21 most distal markers (Table ) covering the 97% confidence interval were considered. When we controlled if the genotype and haplotype data were plausible  the most distal marker ()  which was genotyped in previous projects []  showed extensive double recombinations with the 12 markers added in the present project. To reduce possible mapping errors  we excluded this marker from all subsequent analyses. Using the build option of the     program  we re-estimated the marker distances and order. The following changes with respect to the public USDA linkage map were made: (i) according to the physical map (i.e. bp position of release Btau_4.0) and confirmed by applying the build option of the     program to our own data  the positions of markers  and  are inverted (Table ); (ii) markers  and  are both at the same position (120.85 cM) on the USDA linkage map but  according to our genotypes and the physical map results  they are separated  placing  (120.38 cM) upstream of  (120.82 cM); (iii) the new marker developed in this study () is highly informative for linkage analysis and its relative position between  and  was estimated by applying the build option of the     program. The positions of both flanking markers  and  also changed (Table ). Using the algorithm implemented into the program   we haplotyped the 75 animals of the complex pedigree in Figure  with 1 976 SNP on BTA5 that are informative in the Fleckvieh population. Thus reconstructed haplotypes were used to identify families segregating for the QTL detected in the initial study []. As already shown by the microsatellite analysis  the grandsires of families G01 and G02 which are heterozygous at the QTL  inherited the same haplotype in the distal region of BTA5 from their ancestor A0 (Figure ). This was confirmed by the haplotype reconstruction using the 1 976 SNP. This A0 ancestral haplotype is named \"haplotype 1\" or ( ) and its A0 alternative haplotype \"haplotype 2\" or ( ). Family G03  previously declared as heterozygous for the target QTL [] but not identified here  has inherited haplotypes not related to  (Figure ). All animals with haplotype  (surrounding the putative QTL position) can be traced back to A0. Two of these  grandsires G10 and G11 are paternal and maternal grandsons of A0  and are very important Fleckvieh bull sires. We have collected samples of all the available progeny-tested sons of these two grandsires and all available progeny-tested maternal grandsons of grandsires G01  G02  G10 and G11  to add more recombinant A0 haplotypes into the mapping population. In total  485 animals were genotyped by the SNP chip and haplotyped for BTA5. By calculating the independent haplotypes in the complex pedigrees  and considering the traceability of all  haplotypes to A0  we estimated a very low frequency (<0.005) of  in the Fleckvieh population. Consequently  throughout the rest of this paper  the less frequent putative QTL allele embedded in this less frequent haplotype is referred to as the minor QTL allele. Thirty-seven microsatellite markers (three markers    and  showed extensive recombinations and were excluded) and the complex pedigree    were used for initial LDL mapping analyses. As shown in Figure   we observed a highly significant QTL effect (LRT = 20 to 22  i.e.  = 0.0000077 to 0.0000027)  but were unable to improve the mapping accuracy because of the presence of two or three peaks. . Joint linkage disequilibrium and linkage (LDL) analysis for three milk yield traits; Milk Yield (MY1)  Milk Protein Yield (PY1) and Milk Fat Yield (FY1) during first lactation using 37 microsatellites  a complex pedigree of 2 089 animals  EBV as phenotype and AIREML as implemented in   and  program. Chromosome length in centiMorgan (cM) on the X-axis  log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) values on the Y-axis. Solid triangles on the X-axis represent positions of markers included in the analysis. According to previous results []  and to the results obtained in the first part of this study  we have assumed that haplotype  has only introduced one QTL into the mapping population. Therefore  we performed a second LDL analysis using the 21 most distal markers  and limited to GD and MGS families descending from A0 and known to carry    i.e. pedigree    (Figure ). Unlike the analysis of pedigree     Figure  illustrates a single rather broad peak between positions 119.005 cM and 120.166 cM. However  this highly significant QTL ( = 0.000062 to 0.000021) is still mapped with a low accuracy  i.e. 1-LOD drop-off support intervals are 4.7 cM for FY1  10.4 cM for PY1 and 11.5 cM for MY1. . Joint linkage disequilibrium and linkage (LDL) analysis for three milk yield traits; Milk Yield (MY1)  Milk Protein Yield (PY1) and Milk Fat Yield (FY1) during first lactation using 21 microsatellites covered the most likely region containing the QTL in the distal part of bovine chromosome 5 (BTA5)  a complex pedigree of 1 038 animals  EBV as phenotype and AIREML as implemented in   and  program. Chromosome length in centiMorgan (cM) on the X-axis  log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) values on the Y-axis. Solid triangles on the X-axis represent positions of markers included in the analysis. Since the confidence interval achieved by LDL analyses using pedigree    was still too large for a positional candidate gene approach  we analysed pedigree    using the LDL approach. The results were similar to those obtained with microsatellite markers and pedigree     namely  multiple peaks suggesting multiple QTL or no QTL (Figure ). .

Chromosome length in Megabase (Mb) on the X-axis  log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) values on the Y-axis. To resolve this dilemma  we divided pedigree    into pedigree    consisting of all progeny-tested animals descending from ancestor A0  and pedigree    consisting of the remaining progeny-tested animals. The LDL analyses of    pedigree showed a moderately flat  non-significant test statistic along the investigated chromosomal segment (Figure ). Only LRT values for FY1 reached an indicative level of 3.99 (P = 0.046). Conversely  it was possible to map a QTL with pedigree    whose minor allele is most probably originating from ancestor A0 (Figure ). There were two distinct peaks; one with LRT values over 17 ( < 0.000037) for both MY1 and PY1 in a region of 0.5 Mb (from 118.107 to 118.606 Mb)  and one with a very high LRT value for only PY1 (LRT = 20.72   = 0.0000053) at position 122.115 Mb. Considering 1-LOD drop-off support intervals  the 97% confidence intervals were located between 117.962 Mb and 119.018 Mb (i.e. 1.056 Mb) for the QTL affecting MY1 and PY1  and between 121.800 Mb and 122.200 Mb (i.e. 0.400 Mb) for the QTL affecting only PY1. There were two additional peaks with LRT values over 15 in regions around the positions 115.650 and 116.300 Mb  but they were not included in the 97% confidence interval for PY1 and were not supported by the highly correlated MY1 trait. . Joint linkage disequilibrium and linkage (LDL) analysis for three milk yield traits; Milk Yield (MY1)  Milk Protein Yield (PY1) and Milk Fat Yield (FY1) during first lactation using 240 SNPs covered the most likely region containing the QTL in the distal part of bovine chromosome 5 (BTA5)  a complex pedigree of 308 animals  EBV as phenotype and AIREML as implemented in   and  program.

Chromosome length in Megabase (Mb) on the X-axis  log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) values on the Y-axis. The long homozygous region (~5 Mb) in ancestor A0 was shown (A0 Homo). The two identified peaks (located between 118.107 Mb and 118.606 Mb and at 122.115 Mb  respectively) may be due to either the presence of more than one QTL  or the presence of one QTL with carryover effects to another region. Thus  a multiple-QTL analysis was performed. Two-QTL analyses using pedigree    for MY1 and PY1 fitting a QTL at position 118.202 Mb revealed a single QTL affecting only MY1 at this location and an additional QTL affecting PY1 at position 122.115 Mb ( = 0.019). However  two-QTL analyses accounting for the QTL at position 122.115 Mb did not rule out a possible second QTL affecting PY1 at position 118.202 Mb ( = 0.019). The aim of this study was to refine the position of a previously mapped QTL by increasing the marker density in the region  target sampling of additional families and adapting fine mapping methods. According to our previous results [] and to results from the initial part of this study  we hypothesized the presence of a minor QTL allele with a strong effect  but at a very low frequency  in the Fleckvieh dual-purpose cattle breed. In such a situation  random sampling of additional families for confirmation and fine-mapping purposes can result in an increased frequency of the common QTL allele in the mapping design Thus  the capacity to differentiate between genetic background noise and the initially targeted QTL will be decreased. The reduced accuracy of QTL position estimates when using all genotyped animals (pedigrees    or   ) compared to a subset of animals (pedigrees    or   ) is counterintuitive to the general notion that the use of more information should result in better estimates. To further explore this unexpected result  we have investigated several possible explanations  including the effects of the haplotype distribution and the possibility of additional QTL. To study the haplotype distribution in the Fleckvieh population  485 animals were genotyped with the Illumina 50 K SNP chip. Of these  a subset of 144 animals were not progeny-tested and not relevant for QTL mapping  but were very informative for the study of haplotype distribution. In particular  considering the putative QTL affecting MY1 and PY1 located within the 97% CI (between 117.962 Mb and 119.018 Mb)  a haplotype of 25 markers ( ) covering this region was detected in 89 of 485 animals. This haplotype    most probably carrying the minor QTL allele  could be traced back to the ancestor A0 in all 89 cases (Figure ). The alternative haplotype    most probably carrying the common QTL allele  was found in 13 cases but was traced back to the ancestor A0 only in three. A perfect LD between the minor QTL allele and  (and only  ) would result in a relatively low allele frequency (0.137) of the minor QTL allele in phenotyped animals of pedigree     and in a frequency about double (0.254) in pedigree   . The mapping results did reflect this difference too. In contrast  consider the six markers located within the 97% CI (between 121.800 Mb and 122.200 Mb) of the putative QTL region affecting only PY1. Ancestor A0 is homozygous for a very long segment of this region i.e. from positions 118.266 Mb to 123.347 Mb (three SNP telomeric to the main peak of QTL affecting MY1 and PY1). This segment of 5.080 Mb includes 109 informative markers in the Fleckvieh population. Comparison of mapping results from pedigrees   (Figures )     (Figure ) and    (Figure ) revealed a highly significant QTL allele affecting PY1 only when the pedigree included families segregating for haplotype  (see comparison between Figures  and ). Excluding these families yielded LRT values below 3.99 ( > 0.045) for all three milk yield traits and for the complete investigated region (Figure   between 113.500 Mb and 123.700 Mb). We therefore mainly used the linkage information in the    pedigree ( always traceable to A0)  to map a QTL affecting both MY1 and PY1 in a 97% CI of 1 Mb. Haplotype and LDL analyses by microsatellite markers (Figures  and ) and SNP (Figures  and ) clearly suggest that the minor QTL allele associated with the putative QTL around the physical position 118 Mb (97% CI between 117.962 Mb to 119.018 Mb) has been introduced by ancestor A0 into the mapping population. The explanation of the second possible QTL that maps to the physical position 122.115 Mb and affects only PY1 is different. First  this QTL should also be associated with ancestor A0 haplotypes  i.e. absence of effect in the smaller    pedigree (Figure ). Second  both ancestor haplotypes at the physical position 122.115 Mb are most probably identical by descent (i.e. homozygous for a 5.080 Mb segment with 109 informative SNP). Therefore  ancestor A0 is most probably homozygous for the putative QTL at this position too. Third  this part of the haplotype is not unique to A0  but also segregates in other families  i.e. there is LD information for mapping  too. The relatively sharp LRT peak at position 122.115 Mb and homozygosity of A0 suggest an essential contribution of LD to this mapping result. Fourth  analyses with the two-QTL model did not rule out the possibility of a second QTL affecting PY1 within the candidate region on BTA5. And finally  despite the overall presence of haplotypes with a high IBD to ancestor haplotypes around position 122.115 Mb  the complete absence of this peak in    pedigree can be explained by either a novel mutation in ancestor A0 or by the incapacity of the method and design used here to map it in a relatively small pedigree like   . More reasonable explanations may be the lower statistical power of the pedigree     possible local inconsistencies in the map order (which was based on map release Btau_4.0)  the presence of a strong QTL at position 118.000 Mb with carryover effects to other regions  or a combination of all these explanations. The LDL analysis using SNPs and pedigree    indicate several peaks affecting MY1 and PY1 in the region investigated here. In principle  these results (Figure ) are comparable to the fine-mapping results reported on BTA3 by Druet et al. []. In this study  the authors have also first carried out mapping by linkage analysis and finally ended up with LDL analyses and multiple LRT peaks. We used larger overlapping marker windows (80 SNP) than Druet et al. []. By dividing the data set according to the results of linkage and haplotype analyses  most of the multiple peaks were explained as genetic background noise in a larger family set. The multiple peak profile could be explained by the heterogeneous LD structure within the QTL region or by the use of LD in the model when there is no LD information at all []. This might be increased by possible local inconsistencies in the map order  which was based on the draft assembly  or on comparative map information. Moreover  the method and the data structure may not make it possible to discard some regions even though they do not harbour the QTL []. To check for possible effects of the data structure on the reported mapping results  we tested regression of EBV on genetic distance from ancestor A0 for all carriers of haplotype 1 ( ). The apparent lack of this regression suggests that we are looking at a real QTL effect  and not an artifact of pedigree-tracking. Searching the region between 117.900 and 119.100 Mb for candidate genes revealed 27 genes  13 of which had no known function. Based on current biological information  the genes with partly known function could only be indirectly related to milk yield traits. In the present study  we have performed a haplotype-assisted extension of the mapping design and thus increased the allele frequency of the minor QTL allele in mapping families. Alternative analyses with family subsets resulted in a substantial reduction of the genetic background noise and an increased frequency of the minor QTL allele. Using these subsets  we succeeded in refining the map position of the previously detected QTL for milk production traits on BTA5 to a 1 Mb interval. In spite of implementing a two-QTL analysis  the possibility of a second QTL affecting only PY1 could not be ruled out. All in all  the results of both this study and the previous study by Awad et al. [] support the presence of a QTL affecting both MY1 and PY1 that is close to the centromeric part of the long homozygous region (~5 Mb) in ancestor A0. Therefore  positional cloning and high-throughput sequencing of the candidate region located between 117.900 Mb and 119.100 Mb should now be considered  but should also not neglect the second possible QTL around position 122.115 Mb.

Nonetheless  the best method may be case-dependent and a initial evaluation of different methods is recommended to deal with a particular problem. The availability of thousands of markers from high throughput genotyping platforms offers an exciting prospect to predict the outcome of complex traits in animal breeding using genomic information (the so-called genomic selection) and in personalized medicine. Besides production and other functional traits  genomic selection offers a novel challenge for discovering genetic variants affecting important diseases in humans  plants and livestock  and also for breeding resistant individuals to improve farm profitability. The statistical treatment of the genetic basis of these traits is not straightforward because multiple genes  gene by gene interactions and gene by environment interactions underlie most complex traits and diseases. Capturing all marker signals is currently challenging. Besides the large  small  problem  the statistical treatment of the categorical nature of a trait may increase parameterization. So far  methods dealing with genome-assisted evaluations have focused on traits expressed or recorded in a continuous and Gaussian manner []. However  other traits (e.g. disease  survival) are generally recorded in a binary or few-classed manner (e.g. healthy or sick  number of occurrences  status). Most methods dealing with genome-assisted evaluations may be extended in a relatively well known manner to analyze categorical traits []. A larger amount and various types of genomic information (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms  copy number variants or DNA sequencing) for several species are likely to be available in the future. Using this large amount of data may be highly informative  yet quite challenging for current methods from the point of view of computation efficiency. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection methods must be adapted to cope with these challenges. Machine-learning is becoming more and more popular to deal with the difficulties stated above  and has been previously applied in GWAS in humans [] and livestock []. Machine-learning methods aim at improving a predictive performance measure by repeated observation of experiences. They are model specification free  and may capture hidden information from large databases. This is appealing in a genomic information context in which multiple and complex relationships between genes exist. The ensemble methods  such as Random Forest (RF) algorithms [] and boosting []  are the most appealing alternatives to analyze complex discrete traits using dense genomic markers information  and have been previously applied in GWAS for human diseases [  ]. They may provide a measurement of the importance of each marker on a given trait and good predictive performance. Boosting has been previously applied in a genomic selection context for regression problems using the  loss function []. RF and boosting do not require specification of the mode of inheritance and hence may account for non-additive effects. Further  they are fast algorithms  even when handling a large amount of covariates and interactions  and can be applied to both classification and regression problems. The objective of this study was to present the threshold extension of two Bayesian regression methods that are used in genome-assisted evaluations (Bayes A and Bayesian LASSO)  a boosting algorithm for discrete traits  to describe more thoroughly the RF alternative to deal with discrete traits in a genome-wide prediction context  and to apply them to both simulated and real data to compare their predictive ability. Let  ={ } be a vector of phenotypes recorded in a binary fashion (0/1) from  animals genotyped for  markers  = { }. Four different methods were applied: two linear regressions using a Bayesian framework  and two machine-learning ensemble algorithms. A threshold version of Bayes A (TBA) model was proposed here  which is an extension of the Bayesian regression proposed by Meuwissen et al. []. The traditional threshold model [] postulates that there is an underlying random variable  called liability (<U+03BB>) that follows a continuous distribution  and that the observed dichotomy is the result of the position of the liability with respect to a fixed threshold (): The liability is taken as the response variable. The proposed modification consists of the linear regression of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coefficients on a liability variable with Gaussian distribution. The TBA can be described as follows: where   is the underlying liability variable vector for    is the population mean   is a column vector (×1) of ones;  = { } corresponds to the vector for the regression coefficient estimates of the  markers or SNP assumed normally and independently distributed a priori as   where  is an unknown variance associated with marker . The prior distribution of  is assumed to be distributed as the scaled inverse chi-square   with  = 4 and . Elements of the incidence matrix   of order  ×   may be set up as for different additive  dominant or epistatic models. In the more practical scenario  it takes values -1  0 or 1 for marker genotypes    and   respectively. The residuals () are assumed to be distributed as   with residual variance   as stated above. As in a regular threshold model  two parameters have to be set fixed (e.g. threshold and the residual variance are set to zero and one  respectively) since these parameters are not identifiable in a liability model. This method can be solved via the Gibbs sampler described in Meuwissen et al. []  with the simple incorporation of the data augmentation algorithm to sample the individual liabilities from their corresponding truncated normal distribution as described in Tanner and Wong []. The joint posterior distribution of the  liabilities is: The Bayesian LASSO described by Park and Casella [] and its version for genomic selection detailed in de los Campos et al. [] can also be extended to discrete traits []. As stated in the previous model  the response variable is a liability response (<U+03BB>) that follows a continuous distribution. The Bayesian threshold LASSO (BTL) can be solved as: where  is the vector of liabilities for all individuals   is the population mean   is a column vector ( × 1) of ones;  are the LASSO estimates with their respective incidence matrix  as described for model TBA. As a modeling choice   was considered the vector of independently and identically distributed residuals  as . In accordance with tradition  we fixed the threshold to be 0 and the residual variance to be 1 as described for model TBA; alternate choices result in the same model. In a fully Bayesian context  the LASSO estimates  can be interpreted as posterior modes estimates when the regression parameters have independent and identical double-exponential priors []. Park and Casella [] have proposed a conditional Laplace prior specification for the LASSO estimates of the form: where  is the residual variance  and  is a parameter controlling the shrinkage of the distribution. Inferences about  may be done in different ways []. To follow the Bayesian specifications  a gamma prior is proposed here for    with known rate () and shape () hyper-parameters  as described by de los Campos et al. []. Samples from posterior distributions of those estimates may be drawn from the Gibbs sampling algorithm described in de los Campos et al. []  with the corresponding data augmentation algorithm for liabilities  as described for TBA. Gradient boosting may be classified as an ensemble method []. This algorithm combines different predictors in a sequential manner with some shrinkage on them [] and performs variable selection. Gradient boosting forms a \"committee\" of predictors with potentially greater predictive ability than that of any of the individual predictors in the form: Each predictor   for   (1  )) is applied consecutively to the residual from the committee formed by the previous ones. This algorithm can be calculated using importance sampling learning ensembles as follows: (Initialization): Given data   let the prediction of phenotypes be  =   with  being the population mean. Then  for  in {1 to }  with  being large  calculate the loss function () for  where  is the SNP (only one SNP is selected at each iteration) that minimizes  at iteration   ( ;     ) is the prediction of the observation using SNP  at the current iteration  ( ) is the updated prediction at the previous iteration and (·) is a given loss function. The updated prediction at each iteration  may be expressed as  ( ) = ( )+·( ;     ) with  being some shrinkage factor that  without loss of generality  can be assumed constant and small (0<  <1)  but it may be optimized to balance predictive ability and computation time. Therefore  after the initialization  the algorithm flows as follows: Step 1: Compute residuals as   and fit the weak learner for each SNP  ( {1 ...  }) to current residuals  where  was set to 0.01. Step 2: Select SNP   where   i.e. the SNP minimizing the loss function. Step 3. Update predictions as  ( ) = ( )+( ;     )  ({1 ...  })  where ( ;     ) is the estimate for individual  obtained by regressing the current residual ( ) at iteration  on its genotype for the SNP selected in step 2. Step 4: Increase the iteration index  by 1  and repeat steps 2-4 until a convergence criterion is reached. Here  we used ordinary least square regression as predictor (; ) and two different loss functions: the  loss function (L2B)  which is a quadratic error term in the form ( -( ;     ))  and a pseudo-Huber loss function (LhB) in the form . The pseudo Huber loss function is a priori more appealing for discrete traits because it is continuous  differentiable  greater than or equal to the logit loss function and overcomes the disadvantage of the squared loss by becoming more linear when ( - ( ;     )) tends to infinite. The choice of the number of iterations    is a model comparison problem which may be overcome in many different ways [  ]. Here  a cross-validation design was used as described in González-Recio et al. []. More details on the gradient boosting can be found in Freund and Schaphire []  Friedman [] and González-Recio et al. []. Random Forest can be viewed as a machine learning ensemble algorithm and was first proposed by Breiman []. It is massively non-parametric  robust to over-fitting and able to capture complex interaction structures in the data  which may alleviate the problems of analyzing genome-wide data. This algorithm constructs many decision trees on bootstrapped samples of the data set  averaging each estimate to make final predictions. This strategy  called bagging []  reduces error prediction by a factor of the number of trees. A RF algorithm aimed at genome-wide prediction is described next  in a more extensive manner than the previous methods  as this is the first time that this algorithm is used in a genomic breeding value prediction context: Let  ( × 1) be the data vector consisting of discrete observations for the outcome of a given trait  and  = { } where  is a ( × 1) vector representing the genotype of each animal (0  1 or 2) for  SNP  to which  decision trees are built (see classification and regression tree theory e.g. []). Note that main SNP effects  SNP interactions  environmental factors or combinations thereof may be also included in  . This ensemble can be described as an additive expansion of the form: Each tree ( (; ) for (1  )) is distinct from any other in the ensemble as it is constructed from  samples from the original data set selected at random with replacement  and at each node only a small group of SNP are randomly selected to create the splitting rule. Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible until all the terminal nodes are maximally homogeneous. Then   is some shrinkage factor averaging the trees. The trees are independent identically distributed random vectors  each of them casting a unit vote for the most popular outcome of the disease at a given combination of SNP genotypes. Each tree minimizes the average loss function of the bootstrapped data  and is constructed using a heuristic approach as follows: 1. First  bootstrapped samples from the whole data set are drawn with replacement so that realization (    ) may appear several times or not at all in the bootstrapped set <U+03A8> = ( ...  ). 2. Then  draw  out of  SNP markers at random  and select the SNP   (1 ...  )  where  with (   ()) being a certain loss function. i.e. SNP  is the one that minimizes a given loss function at the current node  and is selected in this step. The algorithm takes a fresh look at the data that have arrived at each node and evaluate all possible splits. Many loss functions can be chosen (e.g. logit function  squared loss function  misclassification rate  entropy  Gini index  ...). The behavior of a given loss function may depend on the nature of the problem. The squared loss function is popular for continuous response variables  and the logit function for categorical responses. 3. Split the node in two child nodes according to SNP  genotype that one individual may or may not have (e.g. individuals with the risk allele will pass to a child node  and the remaining animals will pass to the other child node). 4. Repeat steps 2-3 until a minimum node size is reached (usually <5). The predicted value of the genotype   is the majority vote for the outcome at the terminal nodes (for regression problems  it is the average phenotype of the individuals in the node). Finally  a large amount of trees are constructed repeating steps 1-4 to grow a random forest. The forest may be stopped when the generalization error averaged across the out of bag samples (see section below) have converged. Convergence may be visually tested but it may also be determined using traditional methods for convergence testing of Monte Carlo Markov chains. Final predictions can be made by averaging the values predicted at each tree to obtain a probability of being susceptible. In a naïve 0 = non-susceptible/1 = susceptible scenario  individuals with probability <0.5 may be considered as non-susceptible. To predict observations of new individuals  their marker genotypes are passed down each tree  and the estimate of the corresponding terminal nodes is assigned to the new individual in each tree. The predictions of each tree in the RF algorithm are averaged for each animal to compute the final prediction. There are two main aspects that can be tuned in random forest: the first one is the number of SNP or covariates sampled at random for each node (). Generalized cross-validation strategies can be used to optimize . In high dimensional problems such as GWAS  Goldstein et al. [] have suggested  to be fixed to >0.1 . The algorithm may speed up for smaller  values. Nonetheless  cross-validation can be used to determine the best value of  for each trait  although at an expense of increasing computation time. Genetic background may influence the behavior of this tuning parameter. The second aspect is the criterion to select the best SNP to split the node. As commented above  different criteria may be used and the best choice may depend on the nature of the problem. Entropy theory seems the most appealing to evaluate genomic information on discrete traits (as concluded from pilot studies  results not shown). Other loss functions such as the -loss function or the misclassification rate could be implemented in an easy manner. Without loss of generality we show how to implement the entropy theory in the node splitting decision. The information gain (IG) for each covariate  drawn at random in a given node was calculated as described in Long et al. []: Suppose there are  individuals with genotype  (  {0  1  2}) at each SNP covariate  showing y = 1 (e.g. presence of disease) at such node  and  individuals with the same genotype with y = 0 (e.g. absence of disease). The information gain for each covariate  can be calculated as: where   and  is the entropy of the probability distribution of   and  is the set of all states that  can take ({0 1}). The SNP covariate with the highest IG at each node is used to split the node into two new child nodes  each one containing the individuals from the parent node with the risk or the non-risk allele  respectively. There are two features involved in the RF algorithm that deserve further attention: the out of bag samples  and the variable importance. The out of bag data (OOB) is an interesting feature of RF. Each tree is grown using a bootstrapped sample of the data  which leaves roughly one third of the observations out because some animals will appear more than once and others will not appear at all. The samples that do not appear are called the OOB samples. The OOB acts as a tuning/validation set at each tree and is almost identical to a -fold cross validation  removing the need for a set aside test or tune test. Tuning of parameters can be done along the RF using the OOB  and generalization error can be calculated as the error rate of the OOB [  ]. RF may use the OOB to provide an importance measure of predictor variables (SNP or environmental effects). The relative variable importance (VI) is estimated as follows. After each tree is constructed  the OOB are passed down the tree and the prediction accuracy of disease outcome is calculated using the chosen criterion (e.g. misclassification rate   loss function). Then  genotypes for the  th SNP are permuted in the OOB  and the accuracy for the permuted SNP is again calculated. The relative importance is calculated as the difference between these prediction accuracies (that of the original OOB and that of the OOB with the permuted variable). This step is repeated for each covariate (SNP) and the decrease of accuracy is averaged over all trees in the random forest. The variable importance may be expressed as a percentage of the accuracy obtained with the most important SNP  and provides insight in the level of association of the SNP with the disease. The SNP with higher VI may be of interest for prediction of trait susceptibility (e.g. disease resistance  low fertility) at low marker density  candidate gene studies or gene expression studies. Our own java code has been developed for implementing RF for categorical or continuous traits under a genome-wide prediction context  and is available upon request to the authors. Simulated and field data sets were used for the model comparisons. Description of these data is given next. QMSim software [] was run to simulate a population of thousands of animals genotyped for roughly 10 000 markers. First  1000 historical generations were generated in a population with effective size decreasing from 1400 to 400 to mimic a bottleneck  in order to produce a realistic level of LD for the platform used in the simulation. At this point  40 generations were generated to achieve a population size of 21 000 animals. Then  20 000 females and 300 males from the last historical population were selected as founders  followed by 15 generations of selection for estimated breeding values from best linear unbiased predictions and random matings. During these generations  replacement ratio were set at 0.83 and 0.45 for males and females  respectively. A random sample of 2500 animals in generations 11 to 14 was used as training set  while the whole generation 15 was used as testing set (1500 animals). Phenotypes were simulated as a Gaussian distribution with heritability equal to 0.25. Then  the phenotype of the animals was coded as 0 or 1 depending on whether their simulated phenotype was below or above  respectively  of the population average (using only generation from 11 to 14)  which creates a discrete scenario for the phenotypes. A genome was simulated with 30 chromosomes 100 cM long. Two scenarios with different numbers of QTL were simulated. In the first  three QTL were randomly located along each chromosome with effects sampled from a gamma distribution. This generated 90 QTL affecting the trait that still segregated in the training population. A second scenario with 33 QTL per chromosome was also simulated with a total of 1000 QTL having some effect on the trait and following a traditional infinitesimal model specification. Then  9990 bi-allelic markers were uniformly distributed along the genome and coded as 0  1 or 2  regarding the number of copies of the most frequent allele. Simulation was performed to obtain a linkage disequilibrium close to 0.33 (squared correlation of the alleles at two consecutive loci). Ten replicates were analyzed  and the mean and standard deviations are presented. A field data set was used here to illustrate the behavior of the methods in classification problems applied to genome-wide prediction of disease resistance in pigs. In this study we used one of the most important congenital diseases in pig industry as response variable: scrotal hernia (SH). Most affected individuals cannot feed effectively and consequently growth is affected []. This leads to higher feed costs  slower throughput  lack of product uniformity and consequent loss in income. In a nucleus breeding population  such individuals cannot be considered for use as breeding stock and effectively end up as culls. Heritability estimates around 0.30 and prevalence between 1% have been reported previously for this trait [  ]. Data were provided by PIC North America  a Genus Plc company. The data set contained records of scrotal hernia incidence (score 0 or 1) in 2768 animals from three different lines. Animals from two purebred lines (A and B) were born in elite genetic nuclei  where environmental conditions were better controlled and risk of infections was lower. Animals from a crossbred line (C)  from line A and other lines not used in this study  were born in commercial herds. Selection emphasis in line A was placed on reproduction and lean growth efficiency. Line B has been selected mainly for reproductive traits. Selection against scrotal hernia was equally emphasized in both lines A and B. The prevalence of the disease ranged between 1 and 2% in all lines. Genotypes of all animals with phenotypic records were obtained for 6742 SNP located in different genomic regions identified as candidate regions in previous studies [  ]. A comprehensive scan under the available marker density was performed with all chromosomes being covered. After genotype editing following Ziegler et al. []  5302 SNP were retained  and all 923 total animals from line A  919 from line B and 700 from line C were used. Fifty per cent of animals in the data set of each line were affected with scrotal hernia. For each individual and main effect for SNP  th  we defined two covariates  and   with  if the genotype was aa (0  otherwise)  and  if the genotype was AA (0  otherwise). Analyses within each line were performed leaving out the 15% youngest individuals  as testing set. The raw phenotype was used as dependent variable in a control case design. Note that systematic effects were not included as covariates for simplicity  although any covariate may be included in the algorithms without loss of generality. The predicted susceptibilities of animals in the testing set were the percentages of trees in a random forest that a given animal was considered as affected. Performance of the models was based on predictive ability to correctly predict genetic susceptibility in the testing sets. The true genetic susceptibilities of individuals in the simulated data set are known. However  true genetic merits are unknown in the field data case. Therefore  predictive ability was evaluated in a different manner in the field data  as described below. The true genetic susceptibilities were obtained from the simulations and followed a Gaussian distribution  whereas distributions of predicted susceptibilities were dependent on the model used. A Gaussian distribution was assumed for Bayesian regressions and an unknown distribution bounded between 0 and 1  representing the probability of individual  to be susceptible  for machine learning methods. Pearson's correlations were calculated between true and predicted genetic susceptibility merit for each model and simulated scenario. In addition  the area (AUC) under the receiving operating characteristic curve was calculated for each model in each simulation. This curve is a graphical plot of the sensitivity  or true . false positive rate (1 - specificity) for a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold changes []. The AUC can be used as a model comparison criterion and can be interpreted as the probability that a given classifier assigns a higher score to a positive example than to a negative one  when the positive and negative examples are randomly picked. Individuals with a true genetic susceptibility above or below the population average were assumed positive or negative cases  respectively. Models with higher values of AUC are desirable and are considered more robust. True genetic susceptibilities of individuals in the field data are unknown. Instead  estimated breeding values (EBV) for SH susceptibility obtained from routine genetic evaluation using the BLUP method [] were assumed as the true genetic values. Routine evaluations included 6.9 million animals in the pedigree and approximately 2.3 million records of SH. The effects of line  litter  farm  and month of birth nested into farm were included in the threshold animal model used in the analyses. This may indeed be a crude approximation because EBV were calculated under a linear model with strong assumptions of linearity  additivity  non migration or non selection  although millions of records and animals are used in these genetic evaluations and the accuracy ranged between 0.50 and 0.96 for 95% of the EBV. To minimize the issue of this approximation  animals were classified as susceptible or non-susceptible. Non-susceptible animals were those in the lower  percentile of the EBV distribution in each line  whereas those in the upper (1-) percentile were considered as susceptible (  {5 10 25 50}). Lower values of  selected the more extreme animals  thus a smaller approximation error is expected. Predicted accuracy was calculated between these EBV () and predictions () in the testing set from methods TBA  BTL  RF  L2B or LhB. The predictive accuracy was estimated using misclassification rate  the phi coefficient correlation  sensitivity and specificity. The phi coefficient correlation is the equivalent to the Pearson's product moment correlation for binary variables. It can be calculated as This coefficient may be not robust enough under certain circumstances such as those in which the categories are extremely uneven. Under these circumstances  has a maximum absolute value determined by the distribution of  and . Sensitivity and specificity for a given classifier may be computed as and Sensitivity measures the proportion of healthy animals that are identified as not being affected (TN = true negatives)  whereas specificity measures the proportion of affected animals that are correctly identified as such (TP = true positives). Values of sensitivity and specificity closer to 1 are preferred. Specificity and sensitivity are more informative than raw rate of misclassification  as the latter does not differentiate if misclassification is on true healthy or true affected animals. Furthermore  all animals in the respective testing sets were used to calculate the AUC statistic  described above  for each method within a line. Animals with SH were considered as positive examples  whereas animals without SH were considered negative examples. As stated before  AUC measures predictive ability and may be considered as a model comparison criterion. Higher AUC values are desirable  as mentioned above. Table  shows the average predictive ability (standard deviations in parentheses) across replicates  measured as Pearson correlation  between true and predicted genomic values  and also using the AUC statistic for each model on each simulated data set. Machine-learning methods showed higher averaged accuracy in the simulated data set than Bayesian regression  although with a large standard deviation across replicates. Smaller differences between Bayesian regressions and machine-learning were found in the simulated scenario with 1000 QTL. TBA and L2B were the methods showing poorest accuracy (0.26 ± 0.10 and 0.24 ± 0.04  respectively) in the scenarios with 90 and 1000 QTL  respectively. The boosting algorithm  both L2B and LhB  achieved the highest averaged accuracy (0.37-0.41) in the simulated data set with a smaller number of QTL. In contrast  methods BTL and LhB showed better predictive ability in the 1000 QTL scenario  0.35 ± 0.04 and 0.34 ± 0.06  respectively. Differences between methods within replicates were in accordance with the averages shown in Table   although standard deviations between methods across replicates were large. The AUC ranged between 0.61-0.66 for Bayesian regression and between 0.63 and 0.70 for machine-learning methods. Although similar values were found for all methods  RF showed higher and preferable classification performance according to this parameter (0.70 ± 0.07 for 90 QTL and 0.69 ± 0.04 for 1000 QTL). It is not possible to draw clear conclusions on the preferred method according to the number of QTL affecting the trait  in light of the results from the simulations. Nonetheless  there is a slightly better behavior of machine-learning on traits with a small number of genomic regions affecting the outcome of the trait. Previous studies have also shown good performance of boosting in dealing with different continuous traits in real data []. Bayesian regression showed larger Pearson correlations than ensemble algorithms in the scenario with a larger number of QTL. Method BTL achieved the largest Pearson correlation (0.38)  followed by TBA and LhB (0.33). Method RF showed the smallest Pearson correlation (0.22) in this simulated scenario and the largest AUC (0.72). This suggests that RF ranked individuals less accurately than other methods when a large number of QTL affects additively the trait  but the method is more accurate than other methods at discerning between healthy and affected individuals. It must be pointed out that the simulated scenarios are purely additive and other more realistic scenarios with a more complex interaction between genes and biological pathways might provide different results. The three data sets had a disease occurrence of 50%. The relative predictive importance obtained with RF for each SNP covariate  in each line is plotted in Figure . Many more SNP were identified as predictors of SH in line A than in line B and C  suggesting that many more genomic regions may be associated to SH in line A than in line B or C. Lines B and C showed few genomic regions with a large relative importance variable associated to the genetic resistance to SH. Thirty seven  four and six SNP had a larger relative variable importance than 50% in lines A  B and C  respectively. The odds ratio of SNP with VI > 50% ranged from 1.41 to 2.17 in line A  from 2.56 to 3.03 in line B and from 1.86 to 2.50 in line C  suggesting a considerable risk of being susceptible to SH of those animals carrying the unfavorable alleles. The SNP with the largest importance estimate (VI = 100%) in line C had also the maximum VI in line B  but had a VI < 21% in line A. These results suggest that the genetic variants presented in line B and C in this genomic region provide a relatively larger predictive ability of SH than genetic variants in the same genomic region in line A. The relative VI of the most important SNP in line A was lower than 2% in lines B and C  although other SNP in LD with those may have been detected in these lines. Fifty  44 and 48 markers with VI greater than 99.5 percentile were found in lines A  B and C  respectively. Most represented chromosomes were SSC4  SSC7  SSC14 and SSC17 in line A  SSC1  SSC2  SSC6 and X chromosome in line B  and SSC8 in line C. Validation of these results and conclusions about their role in genetic or biological pathways should be performed on different populations and studies. . Tables    and  show the predictive accuracy of each method within lines A  B and C  respectively. RF had an equal or better predictive accuracy in the pure lines at a = 0.05  0.25 and 0.50  than the rest of methods used in this study. Only L2B achieved a larger phi correlation (1.00) than RF (0.75) in line B at a = 0.05  and BTL showed higher accuracy at a = 0.10 in the purebred lines. Misclassification rate and sensitivity + specificity followed similar trends. RF and L2B were the most accurate at correctly detecting the most extreme animals in lines A and B  respectively  i.e. lower misclassification  and larger    sensitivity and specificity were achieved at a = 0.05. RF and L2B achieved misclassification = 0   = 1  sensitivity = 1 and specificity = 1 at a = 0.05 in lines A and B  respectively  which means a perfect classification of the most extreme animals. At this a level  TBA and BTL showed misclassification = 17%   = 0.71 in line A and misclassification = 14%   = 0.75 in line B  and were either less sensitive or specific than RF and L2B. RF outperformed BTL at a = 0.05  0.25 and 0.50 in lines A and B  whereas TBL achieved better predictive accuracy at a = 0.10. RF doubled the  obtained with TBA at a = 0.50 in line A  and was 12% larger in Line B. None of the methods was clearly preferred in the crossbred (line C)  where similar phi correlations were found for RF  TBA and boosting  with larger robustness for LhB at a < 0.50. No differences were found between RF  TBA and LhB to correctly detect most extreme animals in the crossbred line. The Huber loss function was more robust than the squared sum of residuals at analyzing binary traits  in accordance with its resemblance with the L loss function. RF showed consistently larger AUC values than the other methods whichever line (Table )  whereas a clear trend was not extracted from the AUC values of other methods. For instance  the boosting algorithms had larger AUC values (0.66-0.67) than Bayesian regression (0.62) in line C  but lower in line A (0.55-0.60 vs 0.64-0.65). This result also suggests that RF is less dependent on the choice of the threshold for classifying healthy and affected animals  providing larger stability to the classification. The true genetic architecture of SH is obviously unknown and no conclusions on its relationship with the performance of the different methods can be extracted. There was no clear relationship between the preferred method and the number of relevant genomic regions identified in each line (Figure ). The choice of the model to be used in genome-wide prediction of traits like SH may depend on the interest of the breeder. For instance  detection of susceptible animals was done more accurately in line A using RF  whereas the Bayesian regressions were preferred in line B. Thus  a different method may be desired depending on the objective of the breeding program. The model with higher sensitivity would be preferred in a breeding program aiming at eradicating a given disease or trait. In a specifity+sensitivity scenario  RF was the best method at a = 0.05  0.25 and 0.50  and it also showed the larger AUC values  regardless of the line. Results showed that RF had the lowest risk  among methods used here  of misclassifying animals for low-medium heritability discrete traits in all lines  although all methods had considerable misclassification risks at a = 0.50. However  in a disease resistance genome-assisted prediction context  for instance  we are mainly interested in correctly detecting the most susceptible or resistant animals (lower a values)  and RF seemed to perform slightly better than the Bayesian regressions to detect susceptibility to SH in this population  mainly in line A. Note that the threshold versions presented here incorporate  liability variables to be estimated in the model  increasing the parameterization of the models  and therefore hampering their predictive ability. Results from the analyses of the crossbred line were not conclusive  as different behaviors between methods were found for different a values. This may be explained by the larger genetic heterogeneity expected in line C which may not be captured with only 5000 markers. A small number of animals was used in the testing set and only punctual estimates are given here. This may be important at low a levels with a smaller number of records. Uncertainty about these estimates may be reported from their posterior densities [] in the case of Bayesian methods and using bootstrap or cross-validation strategies in the case of this version of RF []. Uncertainties are not reported in this study because this data set aims at serving just as an example of three different models applied to discrete traits in a genome-assisted prediction context without overloading the discussion. Furthermore  the preferred model may be case-specific. The misclassification rate and the logit function were also used as splitting criteria in RF but with poorer predictive ability (results not shown). Here  hyperparameters were set as fixed  although it is possible to assign them a prior distribution for their estimation []. Nonetheless  a minor improvement on predictive ability is expected if the ad-hoc choice of the parameters is within a sensible range of values. Two Bayesian regressions (TBA and BTL) and two machine-learning algorithms (RF and boosting) were proposed here to analyze discrete traits in a genome-wide prediction context. Machine-learning performed better than Bayesian regression with a small number of QTL with pure additive effects. RF seemed to outperform other methods in the field data sets  with better classification performance within and across data sets. It is an elegant method with an interesting predictive ability for studies on discrete traits using whole genome information. It is also easily interpretable as it is based on naïve decision rules. The boosting algorithms may achieve high predictive accuracy if a case-specific loss function is used  although it may be influenced by genetic architecture. Comparison between Bayesian regressions was dependent on the data set used  although the threshold version of the Bayesian LASSO seemed to be preferred to the threshold Bayes A. RF and boosting do not need an inheritance specification model and may account for non-additive effects without increasing the number of covariates in the model or computing time. Results from this study showed some advantages in the use of machine learning to analyze discrete traits in genome-wide prediction  although model comparisons for specific case problems are encouraged.

In this review  we discuss the application of SEM and related techniques for the study of multiple phenotypes. Two basic scenarios are considered  one pertaining to genetical genomics studies  in which QTL or molecular marker information is used to facilitate causal inference  and another related to quantitative genetic analysis in livestock  in which only phenotypic and pedigree information is available. Advantages and limitations of SEM compared to traditional approaches commonly used for the analysis of multiple traits  as well as some indication of future research in this area are presented in a concluding section. In animal breeding and quantitative genetics  relationships among phenotypic traits are traditionally studied via probabilistic relationships between them  using standard Multiple Trait Models (MTM) - see  for example  [  ]. Although such models can be used satisfactorily to infer how probable events are  they are not stable enough to predict how probabilities would change as a result of external interventions [  ]. In biological systems  phenotypic traits may exert causal effects between them. For example  on the one hand  high yield in dairy cows may increase the liability to certain diseases and  on the other hand  the incidence of a disease may affect yield negatively. Likewise  the transcriptome may be a function of the reproductive status in mammals and the latter may depend on other physiological variables. Such phenotypic relationships can be studied using statistical models that account for recursiveness and feedback between traits. Information regarding phenotype networks describing such interrelationships can be used to predict the behavior of complex systems  e.g. biological pathways underlying complex traits such as diseases  growth and reproduction  and ultimately it can be used to optimize management practices and multi-trait selection strategies in livestock. For instance  a correlation between traits  and  can be due to a direct effect of  on  (or  on ) or to extraneous variables that jointly affect  and . Knowledge about the causal structure underlying phenotypic relationships is necessary to predict the effect of interventions (e.g.  management practices) applied to trait  or . For example  if trait  affects   and  has no effect on   an intervention on  will cause changes on   but the reverse would not hold true. Similar situations can be considered from a genetic improvement standpoint. Conventionally  genetic correlation is defined as the proportion of variance that two traits share due to genetic causes  and it indicates how much of the genetic influence on two traits is common to both  e.g.  due to pleiotropism. However  different scenarios can cause a pleiotropic effect of a specific gene () on two traits ( and )  as illustrated in Figure : (a) the expression of the gene changes trait   and the phenotypic change on trait  affects trait ; (b) the expression of the gene acts on trait y  and the phenotypic changes on trait  modify trait ; or (c) the expression of the gene changes both traits directly  which may or may not have a phenotypic causal effect between them. Knowledge about these different sources of genetic correlation between traits could be used to further improve selection decisions and increase the genetic progress of breeding programs.     . Standard multi-trait statistical models could potentially detect a correlation between the two phenotypic traits and a pleiotropic effect of gene ; however  only gene-phenotype network and causal models would be able to distinguish the paths connecting them As an alternative to the traditional MTM used in animal breeding and genetics  Structural Equation Models (SEM; [  ]) can be applied to study recursive and simultaneous relationships among phenotypes in multivariate systems. Therefore  SEM can produce an interpretation of relationships among traits which differs from that obtained with standard MTM  where all relationships are represented by symmetric linear associations among random variables  i.e.  as measured by covariances and correlations. Unlike MTM  in SEM one trait can be treated as a predictor of another trait  providing a functional (causal) link between them. In the last few years  genetics has been used as a means to infer phenotype networks  including causal relationships among them []  and SEM or related methodologies have been employed for such tasks (e.g.  []). These applications of SEM to reconstruct phenotype networks considered genetical genomics studies with model species  using quantitative trait loci (QTL)  molecular marker  and or DNA sequence information to facilitate causal inference. However  even with livestock  in which genetical genomics studies are not common due to its cost  and reliable information regarding QTL or even sequence information may not be available  SEM have also been satisfactorily used to study phenotypic networks. SEM within a quantitative genetics mixed models context have been described by []. Many authors have used such an approach (e.g.  [  ])  but typically the causal structures are pre-selected using some sort of prior knowledge. More recently  Valente et al. [] have proposed a methodology that allows searching for recursive causal structures in the context of mixed models for the genetic analysis of multiple traits  showing that under certain conditions it may be possible to infer phenotype networks and causal effects even without QTL or marker information. In this paper  we briefly review SEM and present some of their applications for phenotype network reconstruction in genetical genomics studies  in which both phenotypic and molecular information is available  as well as in the context of classical quantitative genetic analysis of multiple phenotypic traits  using pedigree information. Structural Equation Models [  ] provide a general statistical modeling technique to estimate and test functional relationships among traits  which are often not revealed by standard linear models. When fitting a SEM to a set of variables  it is necessary to define a priori  for each variable  the subset of the remaining variables that have a (direct) causal effect on it. This information is called 'causal structure'  and can be represented as a directed graph in which variables (measured or unmeasured) constitute nodes and causal relationships are represented as directed edges between nodes. For example  consider the graph depicted in Figure   in which explanatory variables  and some additional (residual) variables  directly affect variables   which have also some causal relationships among them.         . The graph in Figure  can be represented by a set of structural equations  given by: where 's are model parameters representing the \"fixed effects\" of the  covariates on 's  and 's are structural coefficients representing the magnitude of the casual effects among 's. Hence  in matrix notation  a SEM can be represented as  =  +  +   where  is a quadratic matrix with zeroes in the diagonal and with structural coefficients  or zeroes in the off-diagonal  and      and  are appropriate vectors or matrices with the observations 's  exogenous variables 's  model parameters 's and residuals 's  respectively. Competing networks representing different causal structures among 's may be compared using some model selection criteria  such as likelihood ratio tests (LRT)  Akaike information criterion (AIC; [])  Bayesian information criterion (BIC; [])  or Bayesian model selection approaches (see  for example  []). Structural equation models have been intensively used in many fields  such as economics  psychometrics  social statistics  and biological sciences. In genetics  they have been used  for example  to study the relationships between phenotypic traits in humans  especially in the context of twin designs (e.g. [  ]). More recently  it has been also employed in quantitative genetics mixed model analysis  and on gene-phenotype network reconstruction  as discussed below. Thomas and Conti [] have pointed out that genetically randomized experimental populations that segregate naturally occurring allelic variants can provide a basis for the inference of networks of causal associations among genetic loci  physiological phenotypes  and disease states. In particular  the randomization of alleles that occurs during meiosis provides a setting that is analogous to a randomized experimental design  such that causality can be inferred within the classical Fisherian statistical framework. In this context  Schadt et al. [] have proposed a multi-step procedure to infer causal relationships between two phenotypic traits and a common QTL. More specifically  they have tried to disentangle the causal path involving the expression of a particular gene  a cis-acting expression QTL (eQTL)  and a complex trait (e.g. a disease trait)  to determine if they are related to each other following a causal  reactive or independent model. Such models (denoted here as Models C  R and I  respectively) can be represented as in Figure   in which the variables    and  denote the cis-acting eQTL  the transcriptional activity of the gene  and the complex trait  respectively. Model C depicted in Figure  refers to the simplest causal relationship with respect to   in which allelic variations in  change  by changing the transcriptional activity . Model R (Figure ) represents the simplest reactive model with respect to   in which the expression  is modulated by the trait . Lastly  Model I (Figure ) represents a situation in which the QTL  controls  and  independently. Schadt et al. [] have proposed a likelihood-based causality model selection (LCMS) test that uses conditional correlation measures to determine which relationship among a trio of traits (a transcriptional trait  a complex phenotype  and a common QTL affecting both) is best supported by the data. Likelihoods associated with each of the models (causal  reactive and independent models) have been constructed and maximized with respect to the model parameters  and the AIC criterion has been used to select the model best supported by the data. More specifically  the joint probability distributions of the three models depicted in Figure  have been described as: where  and  were assumed normally distributed about each genotypic mean at the common locus . With those settings  model-specific likelihoods were obtained and standard maximum likelihood estimation methods have been employed. Schadt et al. [] have applied their methodology to a mouse genetical genomics study comprised of large-scale genotypic  gene-expression and complex-trait data to identify genes related to obesity  and have been able to identify known and new susceptibility genes for fat mass  and to successfully predict transcriptional response to perturbation in such genes. Their procedure  however  is restricted to simple gene-phenotypes networks  focusing on the identification of genes in the causal-reactive interval considering a trio of nodes comprising a common QTL affecting the expression of a specific gene and a complex trait. Evidently  gene and phenotype networks can be much more complex  as the causal-reactive genes may be also interacting in a broader network through an intricate cascade of genes and phenotypic traits. More specifically with SEM  Li et al. [] have presented a methodology to analyze multilocus  multitrait genetic data. Their method extends that of []  not only by the number of loci and phenotypic traits studied  but also by different possible causal relationships among them  such that it provides a better characterization of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits. For instance  even if only a single locus and two correlated traits are considered  it allows for alternative recursive effects between phenotypes (Figure )  outside the causal-reactive interval explored by [].     . Arrows indicate the direction of causal effects and dotted lines represent unresolved associations between the two phenotypes (adapted from []) The method of [] comprises a series of five steps. First  single locus genome scans are run for each individual phenotype using a LOD-based test. Next  conditional genome scans are performed using one trait as a covariate in the analysis of another trait. As the authors mention  the choice of which trait(s) to use as covariates can be performed extensively or  alternatively  it may be guided by known biological relationships among the traits. In this setting  traits that are known to be upstream in the causal pathways should be employed as conditioning variables. The comparison between results from unconditioned and conditioned scans can give a first insight into the causal relationships among the phenotypes. For example  in model (8) of Figure    and  are unconditionally independent; however  conditioning on  will result in a nonzero partial correlation between them. By contrast  in model (9)   and  are unconditionally correlated  and by conditioning on  their dependence vanishes. When the QTL  and both traits  and  are causally connected  as in model (1)-(3)  the raw and partial correlations between them will all be nonzero  but they will change in magnitude depending on the signs of the path coefficients []. A third step on Li et al.'s [] procedure refers to the construction of an initial path model and its respective SEM representation. In the graphical SEM  each measured trait is represented as a node  including the QTL identified in steps 1 and 2. Edges should be directed from the QTL to the corresponding traits  and edges should be added also from conditioning traits to the responses whenever a significant difference in LOD scores (<U+0394>LOD) is observed. After the path models are constructed  they are assessed in terms of goodness-of-fit by comparing the predicted and observed covariance matrices and by significance tests for individual path coefficients. Finally  an additional step is performed to refine the model  by proposing and assessing alternative models  which are generated by adding or removing edges in the initial model  or by reversing the causal direction of an edge. The authors use a LRT approach to compare such models  but they also suggest that alternative model criteria could be used  such as the AIC or variations thereof  or predictive ability assessed through some cross-validation strategy. Steps 4 and 5 of model refinement and assessment may be also carried iteratively. Li et al. [] have carried out the genome scans with tests on every 2 cM using a permutation approach  followed by the SEM component of the analysis. They have applied the methodology proposed to the analysis of body weight and weights of the inguinal  gonadal  peritoneal  and mesenteric fat pads of a SM × NZB intercross population with 260 females and 253 male mice raised on an atherogenic diet  and concluded that SEM provide an insightful descriptive approach to the genetic analysis of multiple traits  allowing the characterization of pleiotropic and heterogeneous genetic effects of multiple loci on multiple traits  as well as the physiological interactions among traits. Another application of SEM for phenotype causal network inference has been presented by []  who propose a methodology to search for a set of sparser structures within a putative directed network of causal regulatory relationships among gene expression levels and eQTL in genetical genomics studies. Their method encompasses three steps. First  eQTL mapping techniques are used to identify chromosomal regions modulating the expression of genes. Secondly  regulator-target pairs are identified  such that a directed network can be obtained. Finally  sparser optimal networks are sought within the initial directed network using a SEM approach. Liu et al. [] have applied their methodology to a genetical genomics data on yeast containing information on expression levels of 4589 genes and genotypes for 2956 markers on 112 haploid offspring originating from a cross between a laboratory and a wild strain. They have detected a number of - and -acting eQTL and regulator-target pairs  from which a directed network comprising 28K+ regulator-target pairs was constructed. Based on a partition of this initial network  which comprises 168 genes involved in a cycle genes and all genes connected to the cycle genes by up to three edges and all the eQTL associated with these genes  a SEM analysis has been performed for its sparsification. The preliminary sub-network had 265 genes  241 QTL  832 edges connecting genes  and 640 edges connecting eQTL to genes. The resulting SEM network contained 475 edges connecting genes  and 468 edges connecting eQTL to genes. Some additional analyses have been performed to check for lists of genes with specific biological functions that were enriched on this network  revealing for example that 41.6% of the genes are involved in catalytic activity  and other 18% are involved in hydrolase activity. Also using QTL information to orient edges connecting phenotypes  Chaibub Neto et al. [] have proposed a methodology comprised of two main steps. First  an association network is constructed using either an undirected dependency graph (UDG; []) or a skeleton derived from the PC algorithm of Spirtes et al. []. Second  LOD score tests are used to determine causal direction for every edge that connects a pair of phenotypes  conditional on QTL affecting the phenotypes. They have assessed the performance of their methodology in simulations studies  showing that it can recover network edges and infer their causal direction correctly at a high rate. However  although their method can be applied to human studies and outbred populations  it depends heavily on the availability of reliable information regarding QTL affecting the phenotypic traits of interest. Nonetheless  as discussed by []  traditional QTL mapping approaches are based on single-trait analyses  in which the network structure among phenotypes is not taken into account. Such single-trait analyses may detect QTL that directly affect each phenotype  as well as QTL with indirect effects  which directly affect phenotypes upstream to the specific phenotype being analyzed. For example  consider the causal graph depicted in Figure   consisting of five phenotypes (-) and three QTL (-). The outputs of single-trait analyses under this scenario are given in Figure . Now  when a multi-trait QTL analysis is performed according to the actual phenotype causal network  detecting indirect-effect QTL is avoided by simply performing mapping analysis of each phenotype conditional on their parents (i.e.  upstream phenotypes). For example  in Figure   if a QTL analysis for phenotype  is performed conditionally on trait   only QTL  will be detected because  is conditionally orthogonal to  and   the two QTL with indirect effects (through  and ) on . . On Panel b  dashed and pointed arrows represent direct and indirect effects of QTLs on phenotypes  respectively Hence  traditional QTL mapping approaches that ignore the phenotype network result in poorly estimated genetic architecture of phenotypes  which may hamper correct inferences regarding causal relationships among phenotypes. In view of this drawback of traditional QTL analyses and phenotype network reconstruction methods  Chaibub et al. [] have suggested a methodology that simultaneously infers a causal phenotype network and its associated genetic architecture. Their approach is based on jointly modeling phenotypes and QTL using homogeneous conditional Gaussian regression models and a graphical criterion for model equivalence. The concept of randomization of alleles during meiosis and the unidirectional relationship from genotype to phenotype are used to infer causal effects of QTL on phenotypes. Subsequently  causal relationships among phenotypes are inferred using the QTL nodes  which might make it possible to distinguish among phenotype networks that would otherwise be distribution equivalent. All phenotype network reconstruction approaches discussed so far rely on information regarding QTL affecting the phenotypes  or on the availability of genetic marker information for the joint inference regarding phenotype network and genetic architecture. Such QTL are used as parent nodes on putative networks  facilitating inferences on the remainder of the network  either on the construction of preliminary undirected graphs or on the establishment of causal relationships. However  SEM have also been used to study relationships among phenotypic traits in the context of classical quantitative genetics and animal breeding  even if molecular marker or QTL information is not available. A methodology to insert SEM within a mixed effects model applied to quantitative genetics has been described by []  and since then applied by many researchers working with different species and phenotypic traits. Some details regarding this methodology and examples of application are described below. A SEM with a specific causal structure and random additive genetic effects can be written as [  ]: where is a ( × 1) vector of phenotypic records on subject ;  is a ( × ) matrix of structural coefficients describing the chosen causal structure;  represents the effects of exogenous covariates as linear regressions  in which the matrix contains the covariates and  is a vector of 'fixed' regression coefficients; and are ( × 1) vectors of random additive genetic effects and model residuals  respectively  which are both associated with the subject. Furthermore  and are assumed to be distributed as   where  and  are the additive genetic and residual covariance matrices  respectively. The model for  animals can be described as  =    +  +  +   with: where    and  are  respectively  vectors of phenotypic records  additive genetic effects and model residuals sorted by trait and subject within trait  and  and  are incidence matrices relating effects in ß and  and . This model may be rewritten as [- ]  =  +  +   so that an equivalent reduced model can be obtained as []: The resulting sampling distribution of  given the location parameters and the residual covariance matrix is: where  = . By reducing the SEM  the location and dispersion parameters are transformed into parameters of a standard MTM [  ]  as indicated below: where     and . In addition  the joint distribution of  and  is: with  and . Here         and  are respectively the vectors of fixed effects  additive genetic effects  model residuals  and the genetic and residual covariance matrices of an MTM. Hence  it is seen that SEM and MTM are equivalent models  i.e.: However  an MTM is just-identified []  such that changes in parametric values necessarily result in some change in the joint distribution of . Conversely  SEM carries extra parameters in   resulting in an unidentifiable likelihood function. Nevertheless  it is possible to introduce constraints in SEM to achieve parameter identifiability []. A constraint which is typically sufficient is coercing the residual covariance matrix  to be diagonal  as in the examples discussed below. After defining the causal structure and achieving parameter identifiability  one may apply standard statistical methodologies (e.g.  []) to make inferences about model parameters. SEM models have been used to study simultaneous and recursive relationships between phenotypes in various species and breeds  such as dairy goats []  Landrace and Yorkshire pigs []  Holstein (e.g.  [  ]) and Norwegian Red (e.g.  [    ]) cattle. The phenotypic traits studied span from production (e.g. milk yield in dairy cattle and body weight in pigs) to reproductive (e.g. gestation length and calving ease in dairy cattle  and litter size in pigs) and health-related traits (somatic cell score and mastitis incidence in dairy cattle). In addition  some extensions of the methodology proposed by [] have been suggested  such as threshold models with structural coefficients functioning at the level of liabilities ([    ])  and models with heterogeneous structural coefficients  such as time- and yield-dependent coefficients (e.g.  [    ]). Some details on these applications of SEM in animal breeding and quantitative genetics are provided below. De los Campos et al. [  ] have presented the first applications of SEM to study recursive or simultaneous effects between traits within a quantitative genetics mixed effects models. De los Campos et al. [] have compared four SEM specifications to study relationships between somatic cell score (SCS) and milk yield (MY) in first-lactation Norwegian Red cows using a sire model. Model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood and the models are compared via BIC. Results indicated a recursive effect from SCS on MY  providing evidence that the negative association between MY and SCS is more likely to be due to an effect of infection (measured indirectly by the SCS) on production than to the opposite direction (i.e.  a dilution effect). These results are corroborated by de los Campos et al. []  who have studied the relationship between MY and SCS in dairy goats. The data consist of repeated measurements in each half of the udder of the animals. Again  a negative effect of SCS on MY has been observed and the evidence in favor of a dilution effect is not strong. In addition  the authors have found simultaneity of effects between SCS from the left and right halves of the udder. Also working with MY and SCS data in dairy cattle  Wu et al. [] have extended the simultaneous and recursive model of [] to accommodate possible population heterogeneity. A Bayesian analysis via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods has been employed on test-day data of first-lactation Norwegian Red cows. Once more results suggest large negative direct effects from SCS to MY and small reciprocal effects in the opposite direction. In addition  estimated effects between MY and SCS are larger in the first 60 d of lactation than in the subsequent period  and also appear to be yield-dependent  larger in higher producing cows than in lower producing cows. Another study concerning the relationships between MY and SCS has been conducted by Jamrozik et al. [] with Canadian Holstein data. The authors have considered multiple-trait random regression animal models with heterogeneous (across lactations and days in milk intervals) simultaneous and recursive links between phenotypes  which are implemented using Bayesian methods via Gibbs sampling. However  in this case  model comparisons based on Bayes factors indicated superiority of simultaneous models over recursive parameterizations. To infer simultaneous and recursive relationships between binary and Gaussian characters  Wu et al. [] have proposed a Gaussian-threshold model within the general framework of SEM  and used such a methodology to study the relationships between clinical mastitis (CM) and MY in Norwegian Red cows. The first 180 d of lactation were arbitrarily divided into three periods of 60 days each  in order to investigate how these relationships evolve in the course of lactation. The recursive model shows negative within-period effects from (liability to) CM to MY in all three lactation periods  and positive between-period effects from MY to (liability to) CM in the following period. The results suggest unfavorable effects of production on liability to mastitis  and dynamic relationships between mastitis and test-day MY in the course of lactation. A related application of Bayesian linear-threshold SEM has been presented by König et al. []  who have studied the relationships between claw disorders and test-day MY in Holstein cows in eastern Germany. Four different claw disorders (digital dermatitis  sole ulcer  wall disorder  and interdigital hyperplasia) have been scored as binary traits and analyzed separately. Recursive models at the phenotypic level consider a progressive path of lagged relationships describing the influence of test-day milk yield (MY1) on claw disorders and the effect of the disorder on milk production level at the following test day (MY2). As expected  positive structural coefficients have been estimated for the gradient of disease with respect to MY1  and negative coefficients have been obtained for the rate of change in MY2 with respect to the previous claw disorder. Other applications of Gaussian-threshold SEM with heterogeneous structural coefficients have been presented by de Maturana et al. [  ] to explore biological relationships between gestation length (GL)  calving difficulty (CD)  and perinatal mortality (or stillbirth; SB) in dairy cattle. An acyclic model has been assumed  where recursive effects exist from the GL phenotype to the liabilities (latent variables) to CD and SB and from the liability to CD to that of SB considering four periods regarding GL. The results indicate that gestations ~274 days long (three days shorter than the average) lead to the lowest CD and SB levels  and confirm the existence of an intermediate optimum of GL with respect to these traits. Working with health and fertility traits in dairy cows  Heringstad et al. [] have employed trivariate recursive Gaussian-threshold models to analyze two fertility traits (calving to first insemination - CFI  and nonreturn rate within 56 d after first insemination - NR56) together with a disease trait  either clinical mastitis (CM)  ketosis (KET) or retained placenta. The estimated structural coefficients of the recursive models indicated that presence of KET or retained placenta lengthens CFI  whereas causal effects from CM to fertility are negligible. Recursive effects of disease on NR56  and of CFI on NR56  are all close to zero. The authors conclude that selection against disease is expected to slightly improve fertility (shorter CFI and higher NR56) as a correlated response and vice versa. Finally  Varona et al. [] have presented an analysis of litter size and average piglet weight at birth in Landrace and Yorkshire using a standard two-trait mixed model (SMM) and a recursive mixed model (RMM). On the one hand  in Landrace  results in terms of posterior predictive model checking support a model without any form of recursion or  alternatively  a SMM with diagonal covariance matrices for all random effects considered  i.e. additive genetic  permanent and temporary environmental effects. On the other hand  in Yorkshire  the same criterion favors a model with recursion at the level of temporary environmental effects only  or  in terms of the SMM  the association between traits is shown to be exclusively due to an environmental (negative) correlation. In concluding remarks the authors suggest that the choice between a SMM or a RMM should be guided by the availability of software  by ease of interpretation  or by the need to test a particular theory or hypothesis that may be better formulated under one parameterization and not the other. To fit a SEM  the matrix  of coefficients defining the causal structure must be specified. In all applications of SEM in quantitative genetics so far  the causal structure was assumed known  (e.g.  [  ])  or just a few putative structures selected using some prior knowledge were compared (e.g.  [      ]). However  it may be argued that even without information on QTL it may be possible to infer (at least partially) the causal relationships among phenotypic traits using data-driven algorithms that search for a causal structure. For example  there are algorithms that use the notion of d-separation [] to explore the space of causal hypotheses so as to arrive to a causal structure (or a class of observationally equivalent causal structures) that is capable of generating the observed pattern of conditional probabilistic independencies between variables. As an example  here we describe how such search can be performed for the model = + . A recursive causal structure can be represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)  which is a set of variables (or nodes) connected by directed edges (arrows). Pairs of connected nodes represent direct causal relationships. A path in the causal structure is a sequence of connected variables. Unconditionally  flows of dependence between variables in the extremes of paths may take place  unless there is a collider (variable with arrows converging at it  like  in  <U+2192>  <U+2190> ) in the path. Colliders block the flow of dependency in a path  which makes  and  independent in the structure above. Conditioning on a variable that is not in the extremes of the path switches its status regarding the flow of dependence through it  i.e. if the variable is a collider it allows the flow  whereas if it is a non-collider it blocks the flow. Two variables  and  in a DAG are said to be d-separated conditionally on a subset  of remaining variables if there are no path between  and  such that all its nodes allow the flow of dependence (i.e.  no path between  and  in a DAG such that all the colliders or its descendants are in  and no non-colliders are in ). Under some assumptions  d-separations in the causal structure of a SEM result in conditional independencies in the joint probability distribution of . This is used to guide the selection of a causal structure or a class of equivalent causal structures (different causal structures that result in joint distributions presenting the same set of conditional independences) that is compatible with the joint distribution of the data [  ]. Methodologies such as the IC algorithm [  ] have been developed to explore the connection between recursive causal structures and joint distributions and recover underlying DAG structures (or a class of observationally equivalent structures). Based on a given correlation matrix  this algorithm performs a list of queries about conditional independencies between variables. Assuming that such independencies reflect d-separations in the underlying DAG  the algorithm returns a partially oriented graph as output  which generally results on an important constraint on the initial causal hypothesis space that could be used to fit the SEM. Partially oriented graphs are graphs with directed and undirected edges representing a class of equivalent causal structures. Considering a set  of random variables  the IC algorithm can be described by the following steps: For each pair of variables  and  in   search for a set of variables  such that  is independent of  given  . If  and  are dependent for every possible conditioning set  connect  and  with an undirected edge. This step results in an undirected graph . Connected variables in  are called adjacent. For each pair of non-adjacent variables  and  with a common adjacent variable  in  (i.e.   -  - )  search for a set  that contains  such that  is independent of  given  . If this set does not exist  then add arrowheads pointing at  ( <U+2192> <U+2190> ). If this set exists  then continue. In the resulting partially-oriented graph  orient as many undirected edges as possible in such a way that it does not result in new colliders or in cycles. The goal of the first step of the algorithm is to obtain a graph that specifies pairs of traits that are directly connected by an edge  because variables that are adjacent in the underlying causal structure are not d-separated (hence they are not probabilistically independent) given any possible set of variables. The second step aims to orient edges by searching for unshielded colliders (structures where a collider is directly caused by two non-adjacent variables). Non-adjacent parents of a collider variable are d-separated given at least one set of variables  but not if conditioned to any set of variables that contains the collider. The observational consequence of this is the probabilistic dependence between the non-adjacent parents conditionally on every possible set of variables that contains the common child. The third step performs every further edge orienting that does not result in a new collider or in a cycle. Additional constraining of the output may be achieved by incorporating background knowledge like time precedence or other prior beliefs [  ]. The decisions about declaring pairs of variables as conditionally dependent or not are based on partial correlations inferred from a sample  which involves some degree of uncertainty. To account for that  decisions may be made by testing null hypotheses of vanishing partial correlations or  in a Bayesian approach  using highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for the partial correlations. The IC algorithm was developed based on the connection between causal structure and joint distribution  which requires some assumptions []. Maybe the strongest assumption refers to causal sufficiency: it is assumed that every variable that influences two or more variables within the set of studied variables is already within this set. In other words  it is assumed that there are no hidden causes of two or more variables. Considering that residuals in a SEM account for the sum of the effects of the parents of each trait that are not included in the model predictor  the consequence of the causal sufficiency assumption is the absence of sources of residual covariance among traits  i.e. residual covariance matrices must be diagonal []. However  as mentioned earlier  this model constraint (i.e.   to be diagonal) is already adopted in recent applications of SEM in animal breeding in order to achieve model identifiability. Therefore  the assumptions of the IC algorithms are not stronger than the assumptions considered in recent application of SEM in quantitative genetics. In those applications  not only covariance matrices of random variables are assumed to be structured (usually diagonal)  but the causal structure itself is assumed to be known. Valente et al. [] have adopted a SEM setting with a diagonal residual covariance matrix  as in [    ]. Within this construction  a recursive causal structure that is compatible with the joint probability distribution of the data may be searched using the IC algorithm. In the formulation described in the section above  model residuals are regarded as independent  and recursive effects are used to model (interpret) patterns of co-variability between observable variables. However  in a mixed SEM (as presented by []) with independent residuals  associations between observed traits are explained not only by causal links between them  but also by genetic reasons. Therefore  the unobserved correlated genetic effects considered in this context may confound the causal structure search if one tries to perform it based on the joint distribution of the phenotypes. Take as an example the causal structure depicted in Figure   where there are recursive relationships among phenotypes  through   with uncorrelated residuals ( ... ) and correlated additive genetic effects ( ... ). The connection between the causal structure among phenotypes and their joint probability distribution does not hold in a model where genetic effects are uncontrolled hidden variables. For example  given such causal structure  would be expected to be independent of  given   but this may not hold because of the correlation between  and .     . The arcs connecting 's represents genetic correlations (adapted from []) Nonetheless  as indicated by []  genetic relationship information between individuals gives a means of \"controlling\" for this confounder. Within this context  Valente et al. [] have proposed an approach to search for acyclic causal structures in which d-separations are reflected as conditional independencies on the distribution of phenotypes after taking into account the additive genetic effects (i.e.  the distribution of the phenotypes conditionally on the genetic effects). Given the model settings presented above  i.e.  a SEM that accounts for additive genetic effects  the covariance matrix of the phenotypic vector can be expressed as: Note that  -   -   and  -   -   are the covariance matrices of additive genetic effects  and of residuals  obtained from a standard multiple trait mixed model that accounts for covariance between genetic effects and residuals from different traits  but not for causal relationships between phenotypes [  ]. The covariance matrix of can be then rewritten as   and the covariance matrix between traits conditionally on the additive genetic effects can be represented as . Therefore  estimates of  can be used to select a causal structure among phenotypes. In Valente et al. []  the (co)variance matrix  is inferred using Bayesian MCMC methods  in which samples are drawn from the posterior distribution of . These samples are used then to obtain measures of uncertainty about this matrix  while accounting for uncertainty of all other parameters included in the reduced MTM. In summary  the overall statistical approach proposed by [] consists of three stages: A Bayesian MTM is fitted  and posterior samples of  are obtained. The IC algorithm is applied to the posterior samples of  to make the statistical decisions required. Specifically  for each query about the statistical independence between variables  and  given a set of variables  and  implicitly  the genetic effects: Obtain the posterior distribution of residual partial correlation  . These partial correlations are functions of . Therefore their posterior distribution can be obtained by computing the correlation at each sample drawn from the posterior distribution of . Compute the 95% HPD interval for the posterior distribution of  . If the HPD interval contains 0  declare  as null. Otherwise  declare  and  as conditionally dependent. Lastly  a SEM using the selected causal structure (or one member within the class of observationally equivalent structures retrieved by the IC algorithm) is fitted  as in []  such that causal relationships (i.e.  recursive effects) can be estimated. Valente et al. [] have validated their methodology using simulated data with different causal structures and sample sizes  showing that it can indeed recover the underlying causal structure among phenotypic traits. A first application of such methodology with real data has been presented by Valente et al. []  who have studied relationships among five traits (birth weight  weight at 35 days of age  age at sexual maturity  average egg weight  and rate of lay) in meat-type quail. The data include 854 females phenotyped for all five traits  and a pedigree file with a total of 10 680 birds. The posterior distributions of the partial correlations obtained are not very sharp  such that different HPD interval contents have been used for the statistical decisions  namely 0.7  0.75  0.8  0.85  0.9  0.95 probabilities. Some null partial correlations have been detected; however the structures returned are completely undirected (Figure ). In this application the edges were oriented based on time sequence information regarding the expression of each trait.  []  . Edges connecting two traits represent non-null partial correlations  as determined by Highest Posterior Density (HPD) intervals with different contents: Panel (a): 0.7  Panel (b): 0.75  0.8  0.85  Panel (c): 0.9  and Panel (d): 0.95; the five traits considered are BW: Birth weight  W35: Weight at 35d  SM: Age at sexual maturity (1 egg)  EW: Average egg weight  and NE: Rate of lay (number of eggs) Structural equation models are able to express causality among traits. However  one may fit a SEM with causal structures that do not express the actual causal relationship among traits. The inference of the causal structure is a much harder task than just describing data by a stochastic model. As discussed in this review  using the IC algorithm and related techniques involves accepting specific assumptions  from which the causal sufficiency seems to be the strongest one. In this regard  applying the IC algorithm may be regarded as a causal structure inference only if one is willing to accept the causal assumptions. Otherwise  the application of such algorithms can be viewed simply as a causal structure selection for SEM constructed with diagonal residual covariance matrices. Nonetheless  the latter applications may still produce interesting and useful results such as the generation of causality hypotheses for further research and investigation. Such hypotheses can then be supported or dismissed by additional data collected from other studies  or they might be tested experimentally through controlled interventions. In genetics  for example  a putative causal mutation could be ultimately tested using gene knockout or knockdown methodologies. However  quite often  randomized experiments are not an alternative due to logistic or ethical constrains  and one is restricted to the analysis of observational studies. In this context  SEM and causal search tools like the IC algorithm are handy. Moreover  in genetics and genomics studies  causal inference is aided by the concept of Mendelian randomization []  in which allelic variants are randomized to zygotes during meiosis and eventually passed on from parents to offspring  analogously to a randomized experimental design. Applying SEM-related methodologies to QTL analysis and gene mapping with multiple traits not only allows inference regarding causal relationships among phenotypes  but it also enhances detection power and precision of estimates  with the additional advantage of a distinction between direct and indirect genetic effects of QTL on each trait []. In addition to DNA polymorphism information and knowledge about genes or QTL that can be used as parent nodes in phenotype network reconstruction  the joint analysis of multilayer large-scale \"omics\" data such as transcriptome  metabolome and proteome can certainly provide added information and enhance the ability to infer causal phenotype relationships  although it also brings another level of statistical  computational and data mining challenge []. Moreover  structural and functional data such as gene sequence  gene localization  transcription binding sites  gene ontology  and metabolic pathway among others can also be used post hoc to verify and test putative gene and phenotype networks []. Such data can be used also as a priori information to aid network inference  the same way it has already been used in other \"omics\" applications such as microarray data []. SEM have also been used in the context of quantitative genetics analysis of multiple phenotypic traits when QTL or genomic information is not available []  allowing a different interpretation of relationships among traits relative to standard multiple trait models traditionally used in animal breeding  where all relationships are represented by symmetric linear associations among traits. As discussed previously  in all applications of SEM in animal breeding so far  the causal structure was assumed known or just a few putative structures were compared. More recently  Valente et al. [] have proposed a methodology that allows searching for recursive causal structures in the context of mixed models and quantitative genetics. Their approach involves a first step of data adjustment for genetic effects  which otherwise act as confounders of causal effects between phenotypic traits. In Valente et al. [  ]  a classical infinitesimal additive genetic model involving a relationship matrix  constructed from pedigree information has been considered for such task. As an alternative  if high density molecular marker data is available (e.g.  SNP genotypes)  more efficient genetic merit prediction approaches can be employed such as Bayesian regression techniques [] or kernel methods []. This is a topic which deserves further investigation to assess the impact of better estimation of genetic effects on the ability to uncover causal links between phenotypes. Some other areas related to phenotype network inference that would also warrant additional research refers to the development of (parametric or non-parametric) methods to deal with non-Gaussian traits  as well as search algorithms and software suitable to handle huge number (on the level of thousands) of variables. Lastly  and specifically in the context of animal and plant breeding  extra research is required to study how knowledge regarding causal effects between traits could be explored for the development of more efficient breeding programs and agricultural production enterprises. In summary  SEM provide a flexible and insightful approach for the genetic analysis of multiple traits  allowing the characterization of pleiotropic and heterogeneous genetic effects of multiple loci on multiple traits  as well as causal relationships among phenotypes  which can be used to predict behavior of complex systems  e.g. biological pathways underlying disease traits. More specifically with livestock  SEM can be used to infer phenotype networks in the genetic analysis of quantitative traits  such that the effect of external interventions can be better predicted. This may foster the development of more efficient breeding programs and optimal decision-making strategies regarding farm management practices.

A relatively small number of markers was sufficient to explain most of the genetic variation for egg weight and body weight. During the first decade of the 21st century  there has been a rapid development of genomic selection tools. Through the application of genomic selection []  marker information from high-density SNP genotyping can increase prediction accuracies at a young age  shorten generation intervals and improve control of inbreeding []  which should lead to higher genetic gain per year. Many simulation studies have shown the benefits of this technology  depending on heritability  number and distribution of effects of QTL  population structure  size of training data set used to estimate SNP effects  and other factors []. However  studies on real data are still scarce. If practical application of genomic selection is to be implemented in chicken breeding  as already done for dairy cattle []  it must prove its advantage over traditional methods and be used in a way that maximizes the use of available information. The accuracy of EBV derived from large numbers of markers for within-breed selection is difficult to evaluate analytically and must be validated by correlating predictions to phenotype in the target population (usually the generation following training). One of the challenges in genomic prediction of breeding values is that not all phenotyped individuals are genotyped. One approach to exploit all available information is to first estimate breeding values of genotyped individuals by pedigree-based methods using all data  including phenotypes on non-genotyped relatives  and then use deregressed estimates of those EBV for marker-based analyses [  ]. This two-step approach may  however  result in suboptimal use of information. Another recently developed method uses a combined pedigree and genomic covariance matrix  which can incorporate both genotyped and non-genotyped animals [  ]. However  these methods are computationally demanding and require careful scaling of the genomic relationship matrix to be consistent with the pedigree-based relationship matrix. The reduced animal model was proposed by Quaas and Pollak [] to make breeding value prediction under the animal model less computationally demanding. It fits the full relationship matrix for parents and absorbs the equations for non-parents. Nowadays  the development of powerful computers makes the reduction of computing cost less relevant for pedigree-based analyses but the reduced model can also be used to exploit marker-based relationships. In breeding programs using marker information  individuals that have been used for breeding (i.e. parents) are more likely to be genotyped than unselected non-parents. Estimating breeding values for genotyped animals and absorbing non-genotyped progeny into their equations can make full use of all available data. With this approach  there is no need to construct the inverse of the combined pedigree and genomic covariance matrix of Legarra et al. []. The objectives of this study were to implement a reduced animal model to estimate breeding values using high-density SNP genotypes  to evaluate the accuracy of breeding values estimated using high-density SNP genotypes in the generation following training in a layer breeding line  and to compare the accuracy of alternative methods of breeding value estimation. Data on nine traits collected during the first 22 weeks of production were recorded on 13 049 birds from five consecutive generations in a single brown-egg layer line: egg production (ePD  percent hen average); age at sexual maturity (eSM  d); weight of the first three eggs laid by the hen (eE3  g) and shell color (eC3) collected from same eggs by Chroma Meter that measures lightness (L) and hue (as a function of a red-green (a) and a yellow-blue (b) scale). A second set of egg quality traits collected at 26-28 weeks (early  e) included average weight of eggs (eEW g); egg color (eCO) eggs; shell quality measured as puncture score - a non-invasive deformation test averaged over points of the shell (ePS  Newton); albumen height (eAH  mm); and yolk weight (eYW  g). For birds selected on the basis of early (e) trait data  also late (l) production (42-46 weeks of age) traits were recorded: body weight (lBW  g); egg production (lPD  percent hen average); puncture score (lPS  Newton); egg weight (lEW  g); albumen height (lAH  mm); egg color (lCO  Lab); and yolk weight (lYW  g). Early and late egg quality measurements were averages of records on three to five eggs. In total 2 708 animals were genotyped for 23 356 segregating SNP (minor allele frequency >0.025; maximum proportion of missing genotypes <0.05; maximum mismatch rate between parent-offspring pairs <0.05; parentage probability >0.95)  using a custom high-density Illumina SNP panel. Of the genotyped animals  1 563 were females with individual phenotypes and 1 145 were males without phenotypes. The genotyped set included sires and dams used for breeding in generations 1 to 5 and some progeny from generation 5. Breeding values were estimated for two stages of selection. To represent selection at a very young age  when own performances and phenotypes on female sibs were not yet available  training used all phenotypic data excluding generation 5  and validation was performed on 290 genotyped female individuals from generation 5. To represent selection of males at a later age  when phenotypes on female sibs are available  phenotypes of 2 167 non-genotyped hens from generation 5 were added to the training data but validation individuals were unchanged. A basic description of these data is given in Table . Because of the data structure  a reduced animal model was applied with all parents genotyped and many non-genotyped non-parent progeny with phenotypes. In this approach  a distinction is made between genotyped individuals  including all parents  for which the full relationship matrix is fitted  and non-genotyped non-parent individuals. The following model was applied  following White et al. []: where  is the ( x1) vector of observations   is the (25 × 1) vector of generation-hatch-line fixed effects   is the ( x25) incidence matrix for fixed effects   is the ( x1) vector of breeding values of genotyped individuals  with variance-covariance matrix    is the ( × ) matrix with element  = 1 if the  th observation is on genotyped individual   zero otherwise   is an ( × ) diagonal matrix with element  = 1 if observation  is on a non-genotyped individual  zero otherwise   and  are ( × ) incidence matrices with elements in rows for non-genotyped individuals that correspond to the columns identifying sires and dams set to 1  and zero's elsewhere.  is the (Nx1) vector of random errors which has variance  for observations on genotyped individuals and  for observations on non-genotyped individuals  ignoring the effect of parental inbreeding on Mendelian sampling variance in progeny. Population size and avoiding the mating of close relatives insured low inbreeding in this population. Furthermore  variance component estimates from a full animal model and the reduced animal model described above  using pedigree relationships  were very close. Thus  ignoring the effect of parental inbreeding on Mendelian sampling variance in progeny is expected to have a negligible impact on results. Three models were used to predict breeding values of individuals in generation 5: PBLUP - Reduced animal model using pedigree relationships. GBLUP - Reduced animal model using marker-based relationships for genotyped birds  with covariance matrix derived by the method of VanRaden []  using allele frequencies based on all genotyped animals. Bayes-C-p - A genomic prediction method similar to Bayes-B of Meuwissen et al. []  except for the estimation of the proportion of SNP with zero effects (p) and assuming a common variance for all fitted SNP  with a scaled inverse chi-square prior with  degrees of freedom and scale parameter   as described by Habier et al. []. The prior for p was uniform (0 1). The chain length was 160 000 iterations  with the first 50 000 excluded as the burn in period. In this analysis  the average genotype (number of 'B' vs. 'A' alleles) of the genotyped parents was used to fit SNP genotype effects to the pre-adjusted mean performance of their non-genotyped progeny. To account for different residual variances for progeny means  residual variances were scaled using weights derived from   where  is the number of phenotypes included in the mean []. All models included the fixed effect of hatch within generation  either fitting it in the model (for PBLUP and GBLUP) or pre-adjusting the data by subtracting solutions from a single trait animal model that included all observations and pedigree relationships (for Bayes-C-p). The PBLUP and GBLUP analyses were performed using ASREML [] and Bayes-C-p using GenSel []. The correlation between EBV with hatch-corrected phenotype (as described above) in the validation data sets divided by square root of heritability and regression of hatch-corrected phenotype on EBV were used as measures of accuracy and bias of EBV  respectively. Another comparison of methods was based on selecting the top 30 individuals from the 290 available for validation based on EBV for each trait and comparing the average hatch-corrected phenotype of the selected individuals. Marker based parental average (PA) EBV were also calculated for animals in the validation sets to evaluate the extent to which improvements in accuracy with use of markers resulted from more accurate estimates of Mendelian sampling terms versus more accurate EBV of the parents. This was possible in this population because parents of both sexes were genotyped. To check if combining marker-based estimates with PA increases accuracies of estimates  as suggested by VanRaden et al. [] for dairy cattle  linear regression of pre-adjusted phenotypes on PA and genomic EBV was performed; if GEBV capture all pedigree information  then adding PA to the regression model is not expected to increase the ability to predict phenotype in validation animals. Estimates of heritability from single-trait pedigree-based animal models fitted to the whole data set are shown in Table . Estimates were low to moderate for production and shell quality and moderate to high for all other egg quality traits  as expected. Estimates of heritability for early traits were higher than for the corresponding late traits. Variance components for the late traits may be biased because only selected birds had the opportunity to obtain phenotypes for these traits. Marker-based EBV had  in general  a higher predictive ability than estimates using pedigree relationships (Figures  and ) for all traits and for early and late selection scenarios. The advantage of GBLUP over PBLUP is due to the fact that realized marker-based genetic similarity between animals deviate from pedigree-based relationship coefficients. In addition  marker-based EBV are not affected by pedigree errors  although they are affected by genotyping errors and errors in DNA sample identification. As shown in Figure   marker-based relationships varied substantially around pedigree relationships. The regression of marker-based on pedigree-based relationships was 0.88 for all individuals and 0.97 for validation individuals  demonstrating on average good agreement between both types of relationships. The correlation between the two relationship measures was 0.68 and 0.72 for all and validation individuals  respectively. . Accuracy is the correlation between predicted breeding values and hatch-corrected phenotype in the validation set divided by square root of heritability from Table 2. . Accuracy is the correlation between predicted breeding values and hatch-corrected phenotype in the validation set divided by square root of heritability from Table 2. . The difference in accuracy between GBLUP and PBLUP was smaller for selection at a later age than at an early age  when data on sibs of selection candidates were available (Figures  and ). This extra information increased the accuracy of all methods and particularly of PBLUP. Using marker-based relationships increased accuracies up to over two-fold for early selection and by up to 88% for late selection. Proportionally  the highest gain in accuracy was achieved for traits with the lowest heritability. Accuracies obtained with GBLUP were on average slightly larger than those with Bayes-C-p. Several simulation studies have shown that the accuracy of Bayesian methods is higher than that of GBLUP [    ] but a simulation study reported by Daetwyler et al. [] has shown that the relative performance of GBLUP depends to a large extent on the genetic architecture of the trait. Also  studies on real data in dairy cattle have shown that GBLUP can be equally accurate or even superior in prediction for traits for which no individual QTL explains a large proportion of the variation [  ]. Correlations for selection at an early age between EBV obtained by PBLUP and GBLUP ranged from 0.48 to 0.70 across the traits; from 0.46 to 0.71 between EBV from PBLUP and Bayes-C-p; and from 0.79 to 0.97 between EBV from GBLUP and Bayes-C-p. This indicates that reranking of top individuals is very likely between pedigree- and marker-based methods but limited between GBLUP and Bayes-C-p. This was confirmed by the average performance of the top 30 individuals selected with different methods (Table )  which was similar for marker-based methods but somewhat different for the group selected based on pedigree EBV. A similar tendency was observed for ranking at late selection but correlations between EBV from different methods were higher for this scenario. The presence of bias in EBV was evaluated by regressing phenotypes of validation individuals on their EBV. On average  these regression coefficients tended to be lower than the expected value of 1: 0.9 for PBLUP  0.8 for GBLUP and 0.86 for Bayes-C-p  which suggests that EBV overestimated differences in phenotypes of progeny. This bias may be due to selection not being properly accounted for by the single-trait analyses or due to the assumption of normality for genotypic values not being valid. However  the mean squared deviation of the regression coefficients from 1 was lowest for Bayes-C-p  0.05  compared to 0.06 for PBLUP and 0.07 for GBLUP  suggesting that estimates from Bayes-C- p were least biased. Sib information tended to improve the performance of all methods in this regard for most traits. The proportion of markers with zero effect (p) is estimated from the data in the Bayes-C-p method. Habier et al. [] have shown that  if there is enough information in the data  (1- )k is a good estimate of the number of QTL affecting the trait when k unlinked SNP with normally distributed effects were simulated and genotypes used for training included genotypes at the QTL. In the case of more realistic simulations  where QTL genotypes were not included as markers but the effects were estimated based on k linked markers  the number of markers fitted was higher than the number of true QTL  but the tendency for lower estimates of p for scenarios with more QTL did hold []. The posterior means of p (Table ) suggest that a high proportion of markers should be included in the model to explain a substantial part of the genetic variation for the majority of traits in our data; estimates of p ranged from 0.19 to 0.99  which suggests that between 111 and 19 541 markers explained variation for the analyzed traits (Table ). The large number of associated markers with relatively small effects explains the good performance of GBLUP  which assumes a polygenic determination of traits. However  GBLUP also performed well for egg weight and body weight  which had very high estimates of p. The results suggest that a limited number of markers explain most of the genetic variation for body size in chickens. This can be due to these markers being linked to or in linkage disequilibrium with QTL and/or due to markers capturing pedigree relationships []. The accuracy of estimates of p depends on the information content of the data and on mixing in the Monte Carlo Markov Chain  which can be poor for Bayes-C- p. Two independent chains with a high (0.99) or a low (0.1) starting value for p were used to verify convergence of p. For some traits (eE3  eEW  lEW  eCO  lBW)  both chains converged to the same value with a clearly peaked posterior distribution but for other traits 160 000 iterations were not sufficient for the two chains to reach the same posterior means  as the posterior distribution of p was relatively flat. This difference may reflect differences in genetic architecture of the traits. For traits with a high estimate of p (i.e. with few markers associated)  convergence was obtained quickly and the standard deviation of the posterior distribution of p was small but for traits for which many markers were fitted in the model  the standard deviation of p was high  which suggests that models with different numbers of markers had similar likelihoods. Nevertheless  lack of convergence in p  i.e. different estimates depending on starting value  had almost no impact on the accuracy of EBV. There was also no substantial difference between early and late selection scenarios with regard to convergence of estimates of p. Only for ePD and lCO did the inclusion of additional information from sibs make the posterior means of p from different chains more similar to each other. In dairy cattle  genomic predictions are often combined with pedigree information [] before obtaining final genomic EBV. In our study  lEW was the only trait for which adding pedigree-based information significantly improved predictive ability. The increase in the R-square of the regression equation to predict hatch-corrected phenotypes from generation 5 when adding PBLUP to marker-based EBV was significant (p < 0.05) only for lEW for GBLUP and Bayes-C-p  for which the R-square increased from 0.174 to 0.189 and from 0.187 to 0.203  respectively. Increases in R-square were not significant (p > 0.05) for all other traits using both methods. This suggests that in this dataset  the markers capture most of the pedigree information  likely because all the parents were genotyped. For most traits  the predictive ability of the marker-based EBV was not substantially lower for traits measured at a late age (Figures  and )  although late traits were only recorded on selected individuals and estimated heritabilities for late traits were generally lower than for the corresponding traits measured at a younger age. This indicates that having records only on selected parents did not limit the ability to estimate marker effects. In Figures  and   the difference between the accuracy of marker- versus pedigree-based parental average EBV (e.g. GBLUP-PA vs. PBLUP) reflects the gain in information from more accurate EBV of parents when using markers  while the difference between the accuracy of marker-based parental average EBV and marker-based individual EBV (e.g. GBLUP-PA vs. GBLUP) arises from markers providing information on Mendelian sampling terms. For ePS and ePD and eSM  the increase in accuracy at an early age could be attributed mostly to better estimates of parental EBV. For all other traits  increases in accuracy were primarily based on markers providing information on Mendelian sampling terms. For EBV for selection at a later age  the improvement originated mostly from Mendelian sampling terms  probably because the pedigree parental average EBV were much more accurate than at the earlier age. The reduced animal model was used to incorporate genomic information into genetic evaluation using GBLUP. It was possible to use this model here because all the parents were genotyped  thus data from non-genotyped individuals could be included without loss of information. If some parents are not genotyped  the 1-step methods that combine pedigree-based and genomic relationships can be used to avoid loss of information [  ]. An alternative to the 1-step method is the use of deregressed EBV [  ] but this involves approximations and a potential loss of information. In fact  the model used here represents a special case of the 1-step method of Legarra et al. []  where all non-genotyped individuals in the data are non-parent progeny. In this case  the only pedigree-relationships that are used are those between genotyped parents and their non-genotyped progeny. Without inbreeding  the expectation of these relationships is equal to 0.5  both based on pedigree and based on genomic data  because progeny receive half of their alleles from each parent. Thus  in this special case  combining genomic and pedigree relationships does not require the rescaling that is typically required for the 1-step approach []. In addition to avoiding the need for rescaling  this special case allows equations for non-parents to be absorbed  as in the reduced animal model  which reduces computational demands  although the main computational task of inverting the dense genomic relationship matrix of genotyped individuals remains. By absorbing non-parents  computing time for the reduced animal model is proportional to n  where n is the number of genotyped animals  while the number of animals with phenotypes has a negligible impact on computing time. Computing time for Bayes-C-p is proportional to the number of markers and to the number of records. The reduced animal model can also easily be extended to a multi-trait setting  following standard multiple-trait animal model procedures. Finally  applying a reduced animal model makes it possible to use weighted genomic relationship matrices that accommodate differential weights on SNP  depending on their effects  similar to the Bayesian model averaging methods []. Use of a weighted genomic relationship matrix in a multi-trait setting  however  requires further work. Increases in accuracy were evaluated when selection is at a very early age  prior to phenotypes being available on selection candidates or their sibs  and at a later age. Late age selection represents a scenario in which genomic information is used to increase accuracy of selection in existing layer breeding programs  particularly in the case of males  which are primarily evaluated based on sib information in current breeding programs. Early age selection represents a scenario in which the benefits of genomic selection are capitalized on by also reducing the generation interval from the traditional one year to half a year  as proposed by Dekkers et al. []. Using these results  breeding programs exploiting genomic information can be optimized  including scenarios where only male candidates are genotyped and where population sizes are reduced to capitalize on the effect of GEBV on rates of inbreeding. The use of low-density SNP panels needs to be evaluated [] to reduce costs of genotyping  but this was beyond the scope of this research. In this study  the size of the training data was limited compared to what is available in dairy cattle and increasing its size is expected to further increase the accuracy of GEBV. Reduced animal model approaches can be used to estimate breeding values from high-density SNP data when all parents have been genotyped. Marker-based methods improve the prediction of future performances compared to the classical pedigree-based approach  with most of the accuracy increase due to improved estimation of Mendelian sampling terms. The advantage of marker-based methods is greater for selection at a young age  before information on sibs of selection candidates is available. The accuracies of methods that assume equal variance for all SNP  such as GBLUP and of those that allow differential weighting and shrinkage of SNP effects are similar.

The resulting mating lists accommodate optimal contributions of parents to future generations  in conjunction with other factors such as progeny inbreeding  connection between herds  use of reproductive technologies  management of the genetic distribution of nominated traits  and management of allele/genotype frequencies for nominated QTL/markers. This paper describes a mate selection algorithm that is widely used and presents an extension that makes it possible to apply constraints on certain matings  as dictated through a group mating permission matrix. This full algorithm leads to simpler applications  and to computing speed for the scenario tested  which is several hundred times faster than the previous strategy of penalising solutions that break constraints. The much higher speed of the method presented here extends the use of mate selection and enables implementation in relatively large programs across breeding units. Mate selection is the process of choosing mating pairs or groups i.e. simultaneous selection and mate allocation of animals entering a breeding program []. This can be carried out before mating  to make decisions for the active mating group  but it can also be carried out at other stages. Mate selection can cover almost all of the decisions to be made in a selection program  including culling among juveniles  decisions on semen and embryo collection or purchase  migration of breeding stock  active matings and backup matings. It can also be used to set up investment matings  e.g. assortative matings to invest in increased genetic variation  stock migration to invest in the benefits of better connection  progeny testing to invest in future information  and generation of first-cross females to invest in future maternal heterosis []. Mate selection does not cover decisions on which animals to measure for which traits  including genotyping decisions  but it can cover most other decisions. Mate selection analysis results in a mating list  which is used to make the decisions described above. The outcome is driven by an objective function that should include the full range of technical  logistical and cost issues that prevail. This list of motivating issues can be very long  with some examples being genetic gain  genetic diversity  progeny inbreeding  use of reproductive technologies  targeting genotype frequencies for key markers  managing trait distributions  keeping within a budget and not breaking logistical constraints or constraints that reflect the attitudes of the breeder. Mate selection analysis leads to the progressive use of scientific principles in a practical manner that accommodates real constraints  along with practitioner experience and attitudes. This paper relates to the inclusion of logistical constraints in mate selection analysis  such as lack of ability for a natural mating bull to cover more than a given number of cows  or to operate on more than one farm. In particular  this paper handles constraints related to animal grouping  where matings are not permitted between certain groups. This can be due to Geographical separation  or quarantine barriers. Perceptions of compatibility  for example where the female group \"Heifers\" should only be mated with the male group \"Low birth weight EBV bulls\". Cases where \"virtual matings\" are necessary  for example where immature juveniles are selected as part of a multi-stage selection/culling process  and the male group \"juveniles\" night only be permitted 'mate' with the female group \"juveniles\". Practical experience with mate selection implementations shows that proper attention to such constraints can be critical. Mate selection solutions that break important constraints are generally difficult to fix \"manually\". Thus  the practitioner must be satisfied with the proposed solution. The objective of this paper is to present a mate selection method that achieves such grouping constraints directly  without involving solutions that break the constraints  and to compare its performance with an existing approach that is based on penalising illegal solutions that arise during analysis. In order to present the new method  a full description of the underlying mate selection algorithm is provided since  to date  it has not been presented elsewhere  despite its relatively wide use. Whenever the consequences of a particular mating set can be evaluated by simply summing the value of each mating carried out  we can use linear programming in a relatively simple manner to find the optimal mating set []. However  for most animal breeding problems  the value of a mating depends on which other matings are made. For example  the decision to mate a particular bull with a cow will be increasingly inhibited if the bull is used for an increasing number of other cows  as this will result in more inbreeding in the long term. Similarly  the value of mating a bull with cows in two different farms to increase genetic connection is decreased if many other such matings already give a good connection. Alternatively  if the aim of a given mating program is to generate bimodality of the genetic value for intramuscular fat  in order to target two different product markets  the mating value will decrease if most other matings have the same outcome. To handle such issues  we need a more flexible method that evaluates the impact of each complete mating set analysed. The method to analyse mate selection used in this paper is based on an evolutionary algorithm  which loosely mimics a biological process evolving towards an optimal solution. The terms \"generation\"  \"genotype\"  \"phenotype\" and \"fitness\" will be used to help illustrate this method  and these should not be confused with similar terms used for the animal breeding application itself. A mate selection analysis  as used in this paper  has three key components (Figure ) that are used iteratively over \"generations\" to derive the optimal solution:  []. A problem representation component that uses a vector of numbers (analogous to a multilocus genotype) and translates these numbers to a representation of a solution (analogous to a phenotype)  which in this case is a mating list. An objective function component that evaluates each phenotype to calculate its fitness (analogous to selective advantage). An optimisation component that uses the fitness value for each of the genotypes that it has produced to help select  mutate and recombine existing genotypes to provide new candidate genotypes. A key advantage of this approach is that the optimisation engine is highly disjointed from the problem itself. It does not \"know\" or \"understand\" the problem  it simply delivers candidate solutions  in a raw form  and receives feedback on the value of each of these. This means that the problem itself can become increasingly complex  without the need to increase the complexity of the optimisation machinery. Importantly  the objective function can evaluate a whole mating set  including the types of interactions between matings described above. Given this disjointed nature of the optimisation engine  the current paper does not include a detailed description of the optimisation engine that it uses to generate results. It is based on Differential Evolution (DE) []  with adaptations described by []. Two strategies can be used to constrain the solutions (mating lists or \"phenotypes\") []:  Broken constraints are diagnosed within the objective function  and the resulting fitness value is penalised. A hard penalty is one that generally renders the solution uncompetitive for use by the optimisation engine to help make new candidate solutions. A soft penalty is less stringent  with penalties chosen such that solutions that break constraints are exploited earlier in the analysis  but become uncompetitive as an optimal solution is approached.  This strategy requires a more detailed treatment at the problem representation stage to ensure that no candidate solution (or \"phenotype\") breaks the constraint(s). Penalising is generally easy to carry out. It only requires the diagnosis of constraint breakage for each solution  and ideally an extent of breakage. The latter is important whenever all initial solutions are illegal. In this case  rewarding the solutions that are less illegal with higher fitness values allows the method to move forward and eventually leads to legal solutions. This can  however  result in an analysis that effectively consists of two stages; if the range of possible fitness values for legal solutions is 0 to 1  then applying a 100 unit penalty for each broken constraint will lead to legality  but with little emphasis on the desired attributes of legal solutions. Once fitness values become positive  there will be progress towards a legal solution of high merit. However  during this second phase  a great deal of selection pressure can be taken up in maintaining legality  with typically most candidate solutions being of no value as they break one or more constraints  resulting in high computing times. The mate selection driver described in [] can be used for simple scenarios that place no grouping constraints on the pattern of mating (Table ). It gives a good example of translating \"genotype\" (the numbers underlined in Table ) to \"phenotype\" (the tick marks  or mating list). Based on this mate selection driver: the underlined numbers in Table  drive the three matings noted  and these are the values to be optimised.  (second column for males  second row for females) is the number of matings for which each animal should be used  and this in turn drives selection  including the extent to which each animal is used. An animal is culled if this is set to zero. The ranking criterion is simply a real number assigned by the optimisation algorithm  one for each mating  and these numbers are ranked to give the column Rank. This is not a ranking on merit  but simply an order of presentation to drive the mate allocation part: The first ranked male mating is the single mating of male 3 and it is thus allocated to the first available female mating (the one nearest to the left) - the only mating of female 1. The second ranked male mating is the first mating of male 1 and it is thus allocated to the second available female mating (the one second nearest to the left) - the only mating of female 3. The third ranked male mating is the second mating of male 1 and it is thus allocated to the third available female mating - the only mating of female 4. Notice that the mate allocation part of this simple algorithm breaks no constraints i.e. the row and column sums of matings match the numbers of matings () to be generated for each candidate. The optimisation engine operates with the underlined numbers \"in ignorance\" of this algorithm  except through eventual effects on fitness  just as the biological methods to select  mutate and recombine DNA operate \"in ignorance\" of the phenotypic outcome  except through eventual effects on fitness. To invoke the mate selection driver of []  we need to constrain  to declared limits for each candidate while achieving the targeted total number of matings (). These constraints are presented here to help illustrate the application of the grouping algorithm later on. The one inevitable constraint is to have a non-negative  for each candidate  and this is easily achieved by using the \"Fixing\" strategy  constraining the raw solution variables to be non-negative. The other constraints that are usefully applied through the Fixing strategy are:  : The maximum value for . For example  Maxuse = 1 mating for natural mating females  30 matings for natural mating bulls  1 000 matings for artificial insemination bulls  or the number of semen doses left for a deceased bull.  : The minimum value for  given that the individual will be used at least partly. For example  if a bull is to be selected for natural mating  we might specify a minimum female group size of Minuse = 15 for that bull  as mating groups of less than this size may not acceptable to the breeder. In this case  = 0 is permitted  as are  > or =15.  : The absolute minimum value for . This is generally zero  but may be set higher  for example when a breeder has a given number of semen doses available for a favoured bull  and insists that these should all be used. The raw variables for  for each candidate are non-negative integers that are initially generated by the optimisation engine (Figure ) but constrained to meet the above three limits  first with setting to 0 or Minuse for values between these  with a linearly greater probability of moving to the closer constraint  followed by setting to Maxuse or AbsMinuse for values that still violate one of these two constraints. These constraints are maintained during an iterative process until <U+2211>  = : while <U+2211>  is different from   a candidate is chosen at random  and has one mating added (if <U+2211>  < ) or subtracted (if <U+2211>  > )  and this action is reversed when a constraint is violated. A slight modification is made to reduce the probability of allocating a mating to any male that has  = 0. This speeds convergence  as an optimal solution often has many males with  = 0. The full mate selection algorithm  with grouping constraints  is referred to as GroupFix  as it uses a fixing strategy  rather than a penalising strategy  to ensure that group mating permission constraints are observed. Extra variables to be optimised are used to give relative weightings that help determine the target number of matings in each male by female group combination  and this works in conjunction with a mate selection driver to give solutions that are always legal. This method should not be confused with the \"Mate selection by groups\" method []  which does not involve grouping constraints. The motivation of the method in [] is simply to speed computation  using cluster analysis to form multiple groups for each sex  then allocating  of matings at the level of these groups  followed by individual mate selection. Table  shows an example calculation of relative weightings (W)  used to set the target number of matings for each group combination. For each female group  the aim is to reach a set of relative weightings  one weighting for each male group  that sum to one; these will be used to help set the target number of matings within each male group for the prevailing female group. A permission matrix shows which group combinations are permitted for mate allocations  with 1 for permission and 0 for no permission. The action type for each male × female group combination depends on the permission matrix. For a given female group: There is no action (denoted by a period) wherever permission = 0. If only one male group is permitted the action type is 1 for that group and the final relative weighting is 1. Otherwise  the action type is \"Opt\"  denoting that an optimal raw weighting value () has to be found by the optimisation engine  for all permitted male groups except the last male group. If the last male group is permitted  and one or more other male groups are also permitted  its action type is \"Calc\"  meaning that its relative weighting is to be calculated as shown below. This means that the number of raw weightings () to be optimised to manage grouping is between zero  when only one male group is permitted for each female group  and (number of female groups) × (number of male groups -1)  or  ( - 1). Table  shows an example set of values from the optimisation engine  which are used as raw weightings (). Each of these has been constrained to between 0 and 1 by truncation. Relative weightings () for the i  j male  female group are computed from the raw weightings as: for  <  and when the last male group is not permitted: W = R/<U+2211>R; for  <  and when the last male group is permitted:  for  =  :  where  is the number of positive raw weightings  plus 1 if the last male group is permitted. The last male group is treated differently because it has no raw weightings  and its relative weighting is contingent on the raw weightings for the other male groups. With reference to Table   this gives the following sensible outcomes: All columns of  sum to one. When the mean value of all R > 0 is 0.5   for the last male group  if permitted  is the average of . When the mean value of all R > 0 is < 0.5   for the last male group is above the average of   and vice versa. When all R = 0  W for the last male group = 1. When one or more R = 1 and the rest = 0   for the last male group  if permitted  = 0. These results give an efficient coverage of relative weightings to be used for target number of matings per group combination  with a minimal number of raw weightings to be optimised. The next set of steps will define the target number of matings to be carried out within each male by female group combination for the current solution. These are driven by  values for individual candidates  as in Table   plus a raw weighting () for each group × group combination that is marked \"Opt\" in Table . This will be followed by individual mate allocations using the ranking criterion values  one per male candidate  as in Table   to satisfy these target numbers for the current solution. Notice that  values  ranking criterion values and  values are supplied for each solution by the optimisation engine (Figure ). For each female group  the target number of matings for the whole group is the product of the number of candidates and the selection proportion declared by the user for that group. [It is also possible to optimize the selection proportions by adding them to the list of parameters to be optimised  effectively giving an optimised multistage selection scheme]. Constraining the total number of matings for each female group to match this target follows the iterative process of adding/subtracting matings from individual candidates  as described above for the no-grouping case. The target number of matings for each group combination is then initiated. For each female group   the target number of matings with each male group  is set using the weightings  described above  giving  as the number of matings for each group × group combination: with additional steps to ensure integer outcomes  using  to set the probabilities of each group being perturbed to give equality. The  values can break constraints on male use  for example where <U+2211> Nm exceeds the sum of maximum use of the males from group . This is handled by iteratively reallocating target matings from the male group that breaks a constraint to another randomly chosen male group that can accept the change required from it  with this reallocation taking place within a female group that can accept the change at both the source and destination male groups. Given  values that do not break overall male use constraints  the total number of matings for each male group is then constrained to match this target following the iterative process of adding/subtracting matings from individual candidates  as described above for the no-grouping case and for females in the grouping case. At this stage  we have the number of matings to be allocated to each candidate of each sex  together with a target number of matings for each group combination. The next step is to make the individual mate allocations. The optimisation engine provides a ranking criterion for each male mating  as in Table . Typically each male has zero or multiple matings to make  and there is a ranking for each mating  rather than for each male  such that matings for a given male are generally dispersed throughout the ranked list. For the current solution to be evaluated for the objective function  male matings are accessed sequentially according to their position in this ranked list. Each male mating is allocated to the next available female mating (from left to right on row 2 in Table ) that is both unallocated and legal according to group permissions. For this purpose  female matings can be listed in an arbitrary order that is fixed for the duration of the analysis. However  sorting the female list on attributes of importance in the objective function tends to speed up convergence  as this provides a smoother response surface for the optimisation engine to climb. Moreover  optimising the order of accessing female matings increases the flexibility of covering the response surface  making valleys to be crossed less deep. When this process is completed  the number of individual mate allocations within each group combination will match the target set for each group combination. This method works for oocyte harvesting with  fertilisation (IVF)  or indeed in fish species where IVF is easily managed  since the multiple matings of a single female can each be covered by a different male. However  a slightly different treatment is required for cases involving  fertilisation following superovulation  as in classical multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) practices. The male assigned to the first mating to be allocated to a MOET female has to be used for all her remaining matings. The GroupFix algorithm was tested by comparing its speed and pattern of convergence with a penalising strategy. Various penalties were applied in the latter for solutions that break one or more grouping constraints. An example dataset was generated using PopSim  available at . Three separate breeding farms each mated 25 males to 100 females each year with: the first progeny born when parents were 3 years old; culling for age after 5 (8) mating cycles for males (females); selection on an economic index using BLUP EBV; random adult annual survival of 95%; and a 80% calving rate for females. These breeding programs were set up with a complete age structure and then run for ten mating cycles. The problem tackled here was to set up the next mating round  across farms. All live males and females of appropriate age were considered as candidates for selection. There were 443 male candidates and 596 female candidates with a requirement to make 341 matings across farms and groups  of which 287 matings were in the active mating group combinations that do not involve juveniles or embryos (see Table ). Table  shows the group mating permission matrix that was used. This matrix is formed by the practitioner and this can involve some subjectivity  for example in the rules that define which bulls are used for artificial insemination. This example involves non-active 'virtual' matings  which are produced by the analysis but not intended to be implemented in reality. Virtual matings involving existing juveniles and predicted embryos (as predicted from the previous mating round) can be useful to include in the analysis  for example to help inhibit the high use of a bull in the current mating round which has already contributed greatly to the next generation  as evidenced by the number of juvenile and embryo progeny. The penalising strategy was invoked by reducing the fitness of a solution by a weighting factor times the number of matings that take place within group combinations that contain a zero in the group mating permission matrix. Weightings used were 100  which in this case effectively make the rest of the objective function irrelevant for illegal solutions  and lower weightings were used in different treatments to give softer constraints  . 0.1  0.01  0.005 and 0.001. The objective function used for the test example was a function of the mean EBV index of the predicted progeny  the coancestry among the parents used in the mating set  weighted by their use  and the mean inbreeding of the predicted progeny. A general description is given here  with details in Additional file   appendix. The relative emphasis on the mean index versus coancestry was set in the light of their response surface (Figure ). The curved frontier in this figure shows the range of possible outcomes of optimal contributions (number of matings allocated to each candidate)  with each point reflecting a different relative weighting on mean progeny index versus parental coancestry [see []]. However in this case  the frontier accommodates the grouping constraints in Table   using the GroupFix algorithm for all treatments  so that the same conditions prevail for each treatment during its main run. . See text for details; from the MateSel tool in Pedigree Viewer  available at . The software used to run the current tests can manage the balance between mean index and parental coancestry in several ways. Here we used a target of 25 degrees  where 0 degrees corresponds to the maximum progeny index response and 90 degrees to minimum parental coancestry (see Figure ). An optimal solution has been reached at the point on the frontier that corresponds to 25 degrees (Figure )  with the trailing path showing the progress of the DE algorithm towards this point. When other component criteria are included in the objective function  such as progeny inbreeding  the frontier point is generally not reached. However  the software used manages the outcome such that the optimal solution will lie close to the target 25 degree line in Figure . In this study  progeny inbreeding was given a moderate negative weighting of -1  or a zero weighting  as described below. Figure  shows fitness of the best solution by generation of the DE algorithm for each strategy  with a weighting of -1 for progeny inbreeding. The best solution in the first generation of the evolutionary algorithm for the Groupfix method gave values of 7.30  0.0054 and 0.0076 for the mean progeny index  mean progeny inbreeding and mean parental coancestry  with the latter figure being low due to essential panmixia. In generation one million of the Groupfix algorithm  these figures were 10.53  0.0021 and 0.0485.  strategy converged essentially after about 100 000 generations  when it had reached 99.5% of the fitness from generation one million compared to the fitness from generation one (itself the best of 50 randomly generated legal solutions). This stage was reached in 3559 seconds on a 2.4 GHz laptop computer. At this stage  the best penalising strategy was 78.5% converged  which was reached by the GroupFix strategy by generation 216. None of the penalising strategies converged even close to the optimal solution after one million generations of the DE algorithm  with regular small improvements still being made up to that stage. Of course the optimal solution and maximal fitness are the same for all strategies  illustrating that the penalising strategies performed very badly indeed. In fact  the best of these strategies at one million generations (23 327 CPU seconds) had a lower fitness than the GroupFix strategy had reached by generation 1057 (29 CPU seconds). . This figure censors results for those strategies and generations in which the best solution breaks a constraint  and this is seen as gaps in the plot for each strategy; the right-hand graph gives generation on a logarithmic scale to help differentiate the strategies; the strategies are GroupFix and the four penalising strategies denoted by their penalty weighting  Pen  as labelled on the right-hand graph. Strategies Pen = 0.01 and Pen = 0.005 cross over at about generation 150 000. A lower penalty weighting allows some evolution towards a useful solution simultaneously with the process of developing legal solutions. This can be seen by the higher fitness for lower weightings in earlier generations in Figure . In later generations  fitness is also higher for lower weightings  except for the lowest weighting strategy (weight = 0.005). This is likely because the direction of evolution while illegal solutions prevail is not fully appropriate to that under full legality  and overall progress in fitness becomes impaired for this strategy because of the long periods in which legality is absent. With a very small weighting of 0.001 on illegal solutions  no legal solution features as the most-fit solution in the one million generations that these analyses were run for. It is essentially not possible to predict the best weighting to use in a penalising strategy  such that some testing would be required for each problem. For this example  the negative weight on progeny inbreeding is the only component in the objective function that impacts the mate allocation part of the mate selection algorithm. Setting this weighting to zero renders the pattern of mate allocation inconsequential  given that group legality is maintained. Under these circumstances  convergence is generally quicker; in this case  the GroupFix strategy had reached 99.5% of the optimal solution after 46 659 generations. At this stage  the best penalising strategy was 70.7% from the optimal solution  which was reached by the GroupFix strategy by generation 81. The best penalising strategy at one million generations (24 071 CPU seconds) had a lower fitness than the GroupFix strategy had reached by generation 2325 (78 CPU seconds). Various mate selection algorithms have been described in the literature  with differing levels of functionality. Analysis based on linear programming [] works when the value of a mating is independent of which other matings are done. However  this does not cover issues such as parental coancestry or connection between herds  where the whole portfolio of matings must be evaluated. Simulated annealing [] and evolutionary algorithms [    ] have been used to address this shortcoming  as well as a two-step approach of selection followed by mate allocation []. However  none of these methods allow inclusion of grouping constraints  as described in this paper. The GroupFix method generates candidate mate selection solutions that do not break declared grouping constraints and gives much improved flexibility and robustness in mate selection operations compared to other methods. As noted by one referee  no general proof is offered that the GroupFix algorithm accesses the full legal solution space. However  a test was carried out whereby a legal solution was produced independently from the GroupFix algorithm. This was treated as if it were an optimal solution that was to be found by the GroupFix algorithm  by using an objective function that compared the current mate selection set to this \"optimum\" mate selection set. The GroupFix algorithm was successful in finding this solution. The GroupFix algorithm has been used extensively since 2007 in several operational breeding programs  with the biggest runs involving several thousand candidates for selection. It produces a dramatic increase in speed of mate selection analyses for scenarios that involve at least a moderate degree of grouping constraint. In this study  the alternative penalising strategies were several hundred times slower  and in fact none of these approached reasonable convergence for the scenarios tested. The GroupFix method is important for application of mate selection methods that integrate decision making across issues in progressive breeding programs. It gives a general framework for setting and managing the types of grouping constraints that animal breeders would like to impose. It also enables accommodation of overlapping generations by including groups that constitute the complete age structure and life cycle of animals  including for example embryos and pregnant females  along with candidates for the active mating group. This is an alternative to other approaches for handling overlapping generations [  ]. Another prospect of the method is running mate selection analyses simultaneously across multiple herds. This gives opportunity to manage issues such as quarantine barriers and transport costs  for example by reducing the fitness of a solution by a weighting factor times the total transport distance that the solution dictates for live bulls. Policies on managing issues such as direction of genetic change  genetic diversity  genetic variation for specified traits  and gene marker profiles can be set or influenced at a regional or breed level. For example  the association for an endangered breed might set a policy recommendation to set the target degrees in Figure  at 35 degrees  to give more emphasis to genetic diversity. For complex runs involving many issues  it is useful to adjust weightings and other controlling factors in a dynamic fashion. An example would be to change the target from 25 degrees to 35 degrees in Figure  during the analysis  and observe the impact on all component outcomes. This gives opportunity to explore the overall response surface and discover what outcomes are possible  before settling on a mating list to be adopted. The analyses carried out in this paper used the author's program MateSel  with some additions to permit test runs based on penalising illegal solutions. MateSel executable code is freely available as part of the Pedigree Viewer program at  The GroupFix method presented enables the use of mate selection for the implementation of progressive breeding programs in a wide range of scenarios  including programs across breeding units  with attention paid to the genetic and practical issues involved.

Key factors for success are the use of large populations and powerful statistical tools. Moreover  we believe that the statistical methods we have developed to efficiently study outbred AIL populations will increase the number of organisms for which in-depth complex traits can be analyzed. In domestic animal populations  F crosses between divergently selected outbred lines are commonly used to map QTL []. However  only one generation of recombination occurs  in an F pedigree (gametes of the F generation) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) can be strong along the chromosomes. This long-range LD can be used to detect associations between QTL and markers even at a low marker density  e.g. one marker per 10 or 20 centiMorgans (cM) [  ]. However  because of the extensive LD  using an F design results in large confidence intervals for QTL locations [] that potentially contain hundreds of genes. To map QTL with a higher resolution  it is necessary to adopt a fine-mapping strategy that would ideally produce a QTL peak covering a chromosome region small enough to contain only a few genes. Such a strategy would facilitate identification of candidate mutations. Precision of fine-mapping relies on the use of dense SNP marker maps that provide genotypic information at cM or sub-cM intervals. However  using a high or medium high marker density in an F population provides only a moderate improvement in the resolution because the population has undergone only one generation of recombination []. In such a population  most of the marker alleles are inherited together and share the same genetic information i.e. they are Identical By Descent (IBD) within the same haplotype block []. Reducing the extensive linkage disequilibrium present in an F population requires breeding additional filial generations by repeated intercrossing  i.e. using F individuals to generate an F generation and so on  to form an Advanced Intercross Line (AIL) pedigree []. Each generation of breeding introduces new recombination events and thereby decreases LD between markers and QTL. Thus  an AIL makes it possible to re-analyze and fine-map QTL originally detected in the F generation. Here  we developed new methods to fine-map QTL using data from an AIL produced from outbred lines. We used a nine-generation AIL pedigree produced from an intercross between two lines of chickens divergently selected for body weight at 56 days of age []. All animals in the pedigree were genotyped using SNP markers located at approximately 1 cM intervals in nine chromosomal regions where significant or suggestive QTL had previously been identified in an independent F intercross between the lines [  ]. The nine regions were screened for QTL influencing body weight at 56 days of age (BW56)  with the objective of replicating previous results and reducing the size of the confidence intervals containing the QTL. To create the AIL used in this study  a large intercross pedigree was set up by crossing individuals from two divergent chicken lines  i.e. a High Weight Selected line (HWS) and a Low Weight Selected line (LWS)  which were obtained as follows. A selection experiment initiated in 1957 was designed to select two chicken lines for high- and low-body weight from the same base population  which consisted of crosses between seven partly inbred lines of White Plymouth Rock chickens. Then  individuals with a high-body weight at 56 days of age (BW56) were selected as parents for the line HWS and chickens with a low BW56 were selected as parents for the line LWS []. The AIL was initiated with HWS and LWS individuals from generation 40 [] for which sex-averaged mean body weights at the age of selection were1522 g (SE: ± 36 g) for HWS and 181 g (SE: ± 5 g) for LWS animals. The observed mean heterozygosity  H  at all autosomal loci  after 40 generations  was 0.146 in line HWS and 0.156 in line LWS []. To create the AIL  10 HWS males were mated with 22 LWS females and 8 LWS males were mated with 19 HWS females to produce 83 F. The number of individuals produced in subsequent generations varied (Table ); about 100 individuals for generations F  F  F  F and F; 405 individuals for generation F because F animals have accumulated the highest number of recombinations and are expected to provide the best resolution for QTL mapping; and 437 individuals for generation F  which is a suitable size to detect QTL in regions where genetic polymorphism may have been lost by genetic drift during the last generations of the intercross. Breeding conditions differed for producing the F versus previous generations  i.e. fewer sires and younger dams were used to produce the F  resulting in smaller egg size and ultimately smaller animals (Table ). This was accounted for in our statistical model by correcting for a generation effect. Nine chromosome regions (see Table ; segment names follow the Jacobsson et al. [] nomenclature) containing significant or suggestive QTL for body weight detected in the original F population [  ] were chosen for this study. DNA was extracted from blood samples by AGOWA (Berlin  Germany). Fifteen individuals from each parental line were genotyped for approximately 13 000 genome-wide SNP markers  as described by Wahlberg et al. []. A subset of 304 segregating SNP was selected from the nine QTL regions to  in the best possible way  discriminate between alleles inherited from the HWS and LWS lines. For SNP markers that are bi-allelic  a marker that discriminates between alleles inherited from the HWS and LWS lines would have a high frequency (p) of one allele in the LWS line  and a high frequency (q) of the other allele in the HWS line. In the ideal case  p(HWS) = q(LWS) = 1 (i.e. fixation for alternative alleles in the two lines)  the molecular signature of the markers is sufficient to determine the line of origin of any allele without uncertainty. As this situation rarely occurred for the markers available in the present study  markers were selected as follows: First  differences in marker allele-frequencies between the HWS and LWS lines were evaluated for all markers in the QTL regions. Then  markers were selected based on decreasing differences in marker allele frequencies between the lines  and on their positions at regular intervals on the chromosome segments. In the present study  only 33% of the markers were considered highly informative with allele frequencies p(HWS) =0.9  and q(LWS) =0.7 or vice versa. All individuals in the AIL ( = 1529) were genotyped for these markers using the GoldenGate assay (Illumina  CA) at the SNP technology platform in Uppsala (Sweden). When detecting QTL by the variance component method  the covariance matrix (<U+03A0>) of the random QTL effect must be estimated as an IBD matrix i.e. a * matrix that contains  at a given genomic position  the expected number of alleles IBD between all pairs of individuals in the studied population or pedigree []. Therefore  to perform a genome-scan for QTL using a variance component based analysis  an IBD matrix is needed for each tested genome position t. IBD matrices can be estimated using methods based on descent tree likelihood []  by Monte Carlo Marcov Chain methods []  or deterministically []. For the present study  we used a deterministic IBD estimation method that utilizes pedigree  genotype and haplotype information to infer IBD probabilities based on the approach described by Pong-Wong et al. []. The use of haplotype information together with deterministic IBD estimation is  in the present case  motivated by its computational efficiency. Most IBD estimation approaches [] are based on genotype and pedigree information only  whereas marker-phases (or related measurement of the alleles inheritance pathway thorough the pedigree)  which are needed to obtain the final IBD probabilities  are estimated alongside the IBD by the algorithm. Deterministic methods [  ] only use informative markers (where marker phase can be inferred without uncertainty) and therefore only uses part of the available information  whereas iterative methods [  ] provide better precision in IBD estimation  but also higher computational demand. However  if haplotypes are estimated by an independent routine  and included in the input data  it can increase the amount of information available for the deterministic algorithm. Here  we use an algorithm that first estimates haplotypes using a Genetic Algorithm based method []  and subsequently includes this haplotype information to improve the accuracy of the deterministic IBD estimation. Because the present study involves analysing several times the same genomic region to test different hypotheses about the population structure  several versions of an IBD matrix are computed for the same locus. This is thus more efficient to isolate the computationally demanding part of the analysis (recursive haplotype estimation) in a preliminary step that only needs do be done once for each genomic region  and then to adopt a fast deterministic IBD estimation algorithm for the second step that is repeated several times for each locus. Due to the recursive approach  the deterministic IBD estimation algorithm [] is also flexible. IBD probabilities are computed recursively from the first (F0) to the last (F8) generation  which makes it possible to include a genetic covariance structure among the founder individuals of the pedigree. This covariance can be computed independently based on population history []  or based on genetic data []. The algorithm simply reads the matrix of covariance between founders of the pedigree as input data  and computes the IBD relationship of the last generations as a function of the given founder population structure. Here  we estimated IBD probabilities recursively in the AIL pedigree as in []  taking the covariance among the founders into account []. Haplotypes were used as input if they were deemed robust [] but individual marker genotypes were used when haplotype estimates were uncertain. The estimated IBD matrices at each tested location  t  were then used as input in the variance component (VC) QTL analysis. The classical VC approach to map QTL assumes that QTL alleles in the founder population are uncorrelated [  ]. Since the VC approach makes no distinction between the line origin of the alleles  this approach is not suitable to analyse outbred crosses between divergent lines [  ]. Therefore we used a VC approach [] that accounts for correlation among QTL alleles within the founder lines. Consider the variance component model with uncorrelated founder allele effects: where  is the vector of individual phenotypes   the vector of fixed effects   the design matrix of fixed effects   a vector of random QTL effects  and  the vector of residual effects. The variance of  is then given by where <U+03A0> is the genotype IBD matrix calculated at chromosome position    is the genetic variance due to the QTL   is the identity matrix  and  is the residual variance. An alternative  and equivalent  presentation of model (1) is [  ]: where * is the vector of the effects of  independent and identically distributed (iid) base generation QTL alleles  assumed normally distributed with variance    is the number of individuals in the base generation   is an incidence matrix of size  ×  that relates individuals with the QTL alleles in the base generation  and  is the residual vector with variance . The assumption of uncorrelated QTL allele effects in the base generation  implies that in model (2): V(v*) =  where I is an identity matrix of size . Equivalently in model (1)  the sub-matrix corresponding to the first  rows and the first  columns of <U+03A0> (i.e. IBD relationships between the founders at locus  ) is an identity matrix. In crosses between divergent lines  QTL allele effects should be correlated with the origin of the base generation line. This is the underlying assumption of common linear regression based methods used for QTL mapping in outbred crosses [  ]. To consider the correlation of the alleles in the founder lines when mapping QTL  under the assumption that QTL are not fixed within the founder lines  we introduce and as the correlations between the effects of founder QTL alleles from lines A and B  respectively. Then  the covariance structure of v* is not  any longer as in model (2)  but instead: where and are estimated as in []. When QTL alleles are fixed in the founder lines  as assumed in linear regression based QTL mapping [  ]  = = 1. The example given here illustrates a case where the founder population includes one individual from line A and three individuals from line B. The AIL population studied in the present article was obtained by crossing 30 LW with 29 HW animals. Since average body weights can vary considerably between generations (Table ) and sexes  we fitted a mixed linear model with generation and sex as fixed effects. We computed the score statistic at each marker as in [] to test for QTL in the nine chromosome regions. Markers were assigned to their genomic locations using the dense consensus chicken genetic map [  ]. First  we computed the score statistic at 1 cM intervals in the genome  using model A: without including a polygenic effect in the model. Second  we calculated the score statistic at each marker  using model B: which differs from model A by including a random polygenic effect () in the model. The polygenic effects were calculated based upon the additive genetic relationship matrix between all animals in the pedigree. When a significant QTL was detected in the chromosome segment scanned with either of the two alternative hypotheses (A or B)  we tested whether the level of fixation within lines ( was significantly different from zero (i.e. H:  = 0). For simplicity  the correlation between effects of founder QTL alleles was assumed to be the same in both lines. Therefore  the same value of  was considered for the LWS and HWS lines. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare three alternative models that were defined based on assuming i) independence of alleles ( = 0)  ii) fixation of alleles ( = 1)  and iii) segregation of alleles (0 <  < 1). When model iii) was declared most likely (0 <  < 1)  correlations within the LWS and HWS lines (and ) were estimated separately following the same approach as in the Flexible Intercross Analysis (FIA) described by Rönnegård et al. (2008) []. Significance thresholds for the scans were derived using randomization testing. Residuals estimated from the null model  =  +  (model A) or  =  +  +  (model B) were permuted. One thousand replicates of the phenotypic data were simulated with   (or  for model B) where  is the vector of permuted residuals   and ã are the estimated fixed and random effects obtained from the null model. For each replicate  the score statistic was calculated at every tested position in the selected region. As in Valdar et al. []  the maximum score value from each replicate was then fitted to a generalized extreme value distribution using the evd library in R [  ]. 5% and 1% significance thresholds were then estimated respectively by the 95% and 99% quantiles of the fitted distribution. In scans using model A (without a polygenic effect)  all nine QTL regions identified with the original F population [  ] also contained significant QTL with the AIL pedigree. A QTL profile including all chromosome segments is in Figure . The QTL on chromosome 7 () was split into multiple peaks that together covered most of the selected chromosome segment  whereas the other segments              and  contained a single QTL peak. In the scans using model B (with a random polygenic effect)  only    and  contained significant QTL (Figure ). . The score statistic is plotted against the position in Mb for each of the nine analyzed chromosome segments; the 5% experiment-wise significance threshold is given as a horizontal dashed line Estimates of locations and genetic effects for all the QTL are summarized in Table . QTL positions reported in Table  are the maximum point (mode) of the curve. As model B provided the strongest statistical support for the QTL  the allele effects reported in Table  were measured at the location supported by model B when the peaks for both models did not coincide.  and  mapped to the same position in scans with model A or B.  was located within the same large interval (24 to 38 Mb) as previously  with a 4 Mb difference between estimates from scans using models A and B. Similarly  for  the same location was found with a 4 Mb difference between estimates from scans using models A (60 Mb) and B (64 Mb). For   two peaks were detected at 9 and 11 Mb with both models but the peak at 9 Mb was more significant in the scan with model B. Average effects of QTL alleles at            and  were as expected: negative for the LWS alleles and positive for the HWS alleles. Effects of QTL alleles at  and  were cryptic  contrary to the original observation []  with a positive effect for LWS alleles and a negative effect for HWS alleles. Since QTL-mapping with AIL increases resolution compared to F designs  it is possible to test whether the studied segments contain one or several regions that contribute to the QTL effect. The QTL profiles initially obtained (Figure ) suggested that several segments might contain more than a single signal. Therefore  a second scan was performed for the segments for which the detection of a QTL was replicated with model A. In this case  only the phenotypes of individuals from the last generation (F  n = 400)  with the lowest linkage disequilibrium  were included. IBD between these individuals were  however  computed using the genotypes from all individuals in the pedigree to obtain the best possible QTL genotype estimates. In this scan  a two-QTL model was fitted to evaluate the evidence for multiple linked QTL in these regions. In these analyses  the genetic variance of one of the two QTL in the region was included in the null model of the VC analysis while that of the other was included as a main effect. These analyses showed that there were two independent effects in the  region at approximately 20 Mb and 35 Mb and these were named  and   respectively. The two regions  and  are considered as different QTL in the rest of the manuscript (Table ). For several QTL segments  the peak obtained with the AIL was narrower than with the original F2 population  which illustrates the higher resolution of QTL mapping using AIL. Figure  compares QTL peaks obtained with the F population and with the AIL for  on chromosome 1 and  on chromosome 7. The peak width of  with the AIL was about 1/3 of the peak with the F design (Figure ). The single QTL () on chromosome 7 identified with the F pedigree could be separated into two narrow QTL with the AIL (Figure ). Due to recombinations accumulated in successive generations  the size of the QTL region was also considerably smaller in the scan carried out with the AIL than that with the F design for    QTL  whereas the peaks for  still covered the entire genotyped segment (Figure ).                                                                                                                                                                                             A preliminary analysis indicated that independence of the alleles was common in the present pedigree. We hereafter considered allele independence as the null hypothesis and then tested for possible fixation or segregation within the lines. When comparing the likelihood of these two alternative hypotheses of fixation (<U+03C1> = 1) or segregation (0 < <U+03C1> <1) of QTL alleles within founder lines  segregation was identified for  (P < 0.02) and for one () of the two QTL on chromosome 7 (P < 0.05). For the other QTL  the model assuming independence (<U+03C1> = 0) of the alleles could not be rejected. At   the estimated correlation of the allelic effects was 0.14 in the LWS line and 0.74 in the HWS line. For   the within-line correlation was 0.61 for LWS and 0.88 for HWS. For these two regions  the FIA model [] indicates a higher level of fixation within the HWS line than within the LWS line. For each base generation allele at  that was transmitted to at least seven descendants  the substitution effect was calculated (see Figure ). Alleles from both HWS and LWS lines had both positive and negative effects on body weight  with more dispersion of the effects in the LWS line (Figures  and )  where allelic effects varied from-105 g to +103 g (mean = -21 g). Alleles from the HWS line had mostly positive effects  ranging from -75 g to +90 g (mean = 22 g)   . In A  allelic effects are plotted sorted by effect-size and line origin  in B and C density distributions of the allele substitution effect are given for LWS (B) and HWS (C) alleles  respectively Analysis of data obtained with an advanced intercross line originating from inbred founders is straightforward because alternative alleles of the markers are fixed in each founder line. In such designs  it is sufficient to collect the data from later generations in the pedigree and then use standard QTL mapping software developed for inbred intercross populations for the analysis. The major difference between the F and the following generations of the AIL is the increase in recombination events. However  QTL analysis with an AIL originating from outbred founders is not trivial because fixation of neither markers nor QTL can be assumed in the original lines. In order to maximize the power to replicate QTL detection and fine-mapping using an AIL produced from outbred founders  we propose that the genotypes and phenotypes of all the individuals in the pedigree and not just of those from later generations should be collected and analysed. In our work  we have applied this strategy to an experimental chicken dataset and analyzed the data for nine genomic regions for which significant or suggestive QTL had been previously identified with an F design between the same chicken lines [  ]. Two alternative models were used for QTL detection: (1) a model (A) without a random polygenic effect  which detected significant QTL in all nine regions and (2) a more stringent model (B) that included a random polygenic effect  which reduced the number of significant QTL to five regions. This difference in number of QTL detected is due to the fact that the covariance matrix of the polygenic effect included in model B is by definition very similar to the covariance matrix of the QTL effect when marker information is poor. The information content estimated from the IBD coefficients [] appeared indeed to be lower in some regions where QTL was detected in model A but not in model B (). However  one of the low information content regions () was nevertheless detected in both models. This makes it difficult to determine whether the loss of QTL with model B is due to false positive signals obtained with model A  or to the fact that marker information content is simply too low to distinguish between a QTL effect and a polygenic effect in a multigenerational intercross pedigree. Based on our results  it can be concluded that  and  contain QTL that are strongly supported by both models. The allelic effects in these regions are positive for the HWS allele and negative for the LWS allele  as expected in an AIL resulting from a cross between two divergently selected lines. In addition to these five significant QTL regions detected with both models  the remaining regions (  and ) are likely to contain QTL based on the analyses using model A. This may be resolved by further analyses with more informative markers. Eight QTL acted in the same direction in both the F population and the AIL i.e. the effect of their HWS alleles were additive and led to higher BW56 as in []  while two QTL acted in opposite directions. This difference can be explained by the lack of fixation of QTL alleles within the founder lines (as illustrated by the range of estimated allelic effects in Figure )  where alleles with positive and negative effects were present in both the HWS and LWS lines. Since multiple alleles exist in both lines  the estimated difference between the average effects of alleles inherited from HWS and LWS animals is a mixture of high and low effect alleles. Thus  when analyzing a particular generation in a population  the results will depend on the actual set of alleles sampled from a limited number of ancestors. As the number of founders for each generation is rather small  genetic drift will have an influence on the results. It is worth noting that several of the QTL confirmed in our study were not detectable using methods that assume allelic fixation in the founder lines. Their detection relied on the use of a variance component approach that does not assume fixation. Another potential explanation for the difference in observed effects is epistasis  which is known to be strong among QTL in this pedigree []. Therefore  the size of the genomic region containing the QTL and the direction of its effect depend on the genetic background at other loci. Differences in allele frequencies at interacting loci might influence the marginal effects of QTL and even lead to genetic effects that change direction depending on the allele frequency at the loci with which it interacts. Although an in-depth study of epistasis is beyond the scope of this paper  preliminary tests provide some strong evidence for epistasis in this pedigree  with  e.g.  the LWS allele of  having a positive effect when combined with the HWS allele of  but a negative effect when combined with the LWS allele. A third possibility is that recombination in subsequent generations has disrupted linkage disequilibrium between linked QTL so that the QTL effect at the position tested in the current study deviates significantly from the one observed in the F generation. The nine selected chromosome segments were first scanned for single QTL using a variance component approach. The assumption of a single QTL in each segment appears valid for all regions but . When including all phenotype data from the F-F generations  the segment containing  had a complex QTL profile indicating multiple independent genetic effects. A two-QTL analysis was then performed including only the phenotypic data from the F generation. Since linkage disequilibrium is lower in this last generation  resolution should be higher when using this smaller dataset. In this analysis  the QTL region splits into two significant QTL at 20 and 35 Mb (Figure ). The peak observed between the two peaks at 30 Mb in the single-QTL scan is not significant  indicating that it is most likely a false \"ghost\" signal due to linkage with the two neighbouring regions. Our scan permits the detection of QTL that segregate within the parental lines. Thus  it is a powerful approach to detect QTL in crosses produced from divergent outbred lines. It identified ten QTL in nine distinct chromosome regions. Two regions ( and ) showed significant (p < 0.05) within-line correlations between allele effects. The estimated correlation of the within-line allele effects  calculated from the FIA model  was higher within the HWS line (0.74) then within the LWS line (0.14) for . This was consistent with the variability among allele substitution effects shown in Figure   which is larger among LWS alleles than among HWS alleles. For the remaining eight QTL  we could not reject the null-hypothesis of independent allelic effects (even within-line). Since the parental lines had been divergently selected and display highly divergent phenotypes  a stronger correlation of allelic effects in the founder lines was expected. However  segregation within lines is not unlikely  because the lines were not inbred  the QTL effects were rather small and the time of divergence between the lines was relatively short. This finding could  however  also be explained by a lack of power in the segregation analyses in this pedigree since it contains a large number of founder alleles with rather few observations for each inherited allele. Here  we have produced  genotyped and analyzed a large AIL obtained from outbred parents. Most of the QTL originally detected in the F population were confirmed  which indicates that appropriately sized replication populations and powerful statistical tools are crucial to refine original QTL findings and dissect the genetics underlying complex phenotypes. Replicating the detection of the QTL and fine-mapping their location with an AIL strengthen the original findings  and validate AIL as a valuable tool to explore the genetic basis of complex traits. We also believe that the methods available now to analyze outbred intercross populations can be useful for in-depth genetic studies of a wider range of organisms and can provide answers to research questions that are not approachable using inbred model organisms.

"Genetic differentiation of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) populations in Serbia  based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses"	"Authors: Saa Maric  Andrej Razpet  Vera Nikolic and Predrag Simonovic"	"Faculty of Biology  Institute of Zoology  University of Belgrade  Studentski trg 16  11001  Belgrade  SerbiaSaa Maric  Vera Nikolic & Predrag Simonovic Biotechnical Faculty  Department of Animal Science  University of Ljubljana  Groblje 3  1230  Domale  SloveniaAndrej Razpet"	"No Co-Author"	"14 January 2011"	"BackgroundThe structure and diversity of grayling () populations have been well studied in most of its native habitat; however the southernmost populations of the Balkan Peninsula remain largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of Serbian grayling populations  detect the impact of stocking and provide guidelines for conservation and management.MethodsEighty grayling individuals were collected from four rivers (Ibar  Lim  Drina and Rzav). The mitochondrial DNA control region (CR; 595 bp of the 3'end and 74 bp of flanking tRNA) and the ATP6 gene (630 bp fragment) were sequenced for 20 individuals (five from each locality). In addition  all individuals were genotyped with 12 microsatellite loci. The diversity and structure of the populations as well as the recent and ancient population declines were studied using specialized software.ResultsWe detected three new haplotypes in the mtDNA CR and four haplotypes in the ATP6 gene of which three had not been described before. Previously  one CR haplotype and two ATP6 gene haplotypes had been identified as allochthonous  originating from Slovenia. Reconstruction of phylogenetic relations placed the remaining two CR haplotypes from the River Danube drainage of Serbia into a new clade  which is related to the previously described sister Slovenian clade. These two clades form a new Balkan clade. Microsatellite marker analysis showed that all four populations are genetically distinct from each other without any sign of intra-population structure  although stocking of the most diverse population (Drina River) was confirmed by mtDNA analysis. Recent and historical population declines of Serbian grayling do not differ from those of other European populations.ConclusionsOur study shows that (1) the Ibar  Lim and Drina Rivers grayling populations are genetically distinct from populations outside of Serbia and thus should be managed as native populations in spite of some introgression in the Drina River population and (2) the Rzav River population is not appropriate for further stocking activities since it originates from stocked Slovenian grayling. However  the Rzav River population does not represent an immediate danger to other populations because it is physically isolated from these."

The purpose of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of Serbian grayling populations  detect the impact of stocking and provide guidelines for conservation and management. Eighty grayling individuals were collected from four rivers (Ibar  Lim  Drina and Rzav). The mitochondrial DNA control region (CR; 595 bp of the 3'end and 74 bp of flanking tRNA) and the ATP6 gene (630 bp fragment) were sequenced for 20 individuals (five from each locality). In addition  all individuals were genotyped with 12 microsatellite loci. The diversity and structure of the populations as well as the recent and ancient population declines were studied using specialized software. We detected three new haplotypes in the mtDNA CR and four haplotypes in the ATP6 gene of which three had not been described before. Previously  one CR haplotype and two ATP6 gene haplotypes had been identified as allochthonous  originating from Slovenia. Reconstruction of phylogenetic relations placed the remaining two CR haplotypes from the River Danube drainage of Serbia into a new clade  which is related to the previously described sister Slovenian clade. These two clades form a new Balkan clade. Microsatellite marker analysis showed that all four populations are genetically distinct from each other without any sign of intra-population structure  although stocking of the most diverse population (Drina River) was confirmed by mtDNA analysis. Recent and historical population declines of Serbian grayling do not differ from those of other European populations. Our study shows that (1) the Ibar  Lim and Drina Rivers grayling populations are genetically distinct from populations outside of Serbia and thus should be managed as native populations in spite of some introgression in the Drina River population and (2) the Rzav River population is not appropriate for further stocking activities since it originates from stocked Slovenian grayling. However  the Rzav River population does not represent an immediate danger to other populations because it is physically isolated from these. The recent natural dispersal area of the European grayling () extends westward to France and Great Britain  northward across Fenoscandinavia and northern Russia  eastward to the Ural Mountains near the Kara River [] and southward to the headwaters in the drainage areas of Ibar (Serbia) and Lim (the Ljuca River  Montenegro) Rivers in the western Balkans. Fossil evidence suggests that European grayling inhabited Europe long before the Pleistocene cold periods []  corroborating the pre-glacial introgression of grayling and its expansion across Europe  as also suggested by Weiss et al. []. Numerous DNA marker-based studies on population genetic structure  phylogeography and phylogeny of European grayling are now available for various geographic regions (e.g. [])  as well as on local scales (e.g. []). Studies on the matrilineal phylogeography and post-glacial dispersal routes of European grayling have revealed 27 haplotypes in the ND-5/6 and cyt-b/D-loop (CR) regions of mitochondrial DNA []  58 haplotypes in the D-loop (CR) region [] and 30 ND-1 haplotypes in the ND-5/6 gene region []. All the results suggest the existence of distinct Danubian clades  as well as Central-Eastern  Central-Western  Northern/Northeastern and mixed clades []. Rather distinct grayling clades were detected in the Adriatic region and in the Loire basin with a single haplotype (At1) that is highly divergent compared to those of the remaining clades []. The assumed refugial region for (i) the Northern/Northeastern-European clade was the area north of the Caspian and Black Seas  (ii) the Central-Eastern European clade  the ice-free tributaries of Vistula and Elbe Rivers  (iii) the Central-Western Europe  the ice-free tributaries of Rhine  Main and upper Danube  and (iv) the Danubian clades  the lower Danube drainage area  i.e.  in the Balkan Peninsula []. Based on CR mtDNA sequence analyses and calibration of molecular clock applied to the nucleotide divergence of these sequences between the major grayling clades with a CR mutation rate of 1% per million years (MY)  Froufe et al. [] have dated the colonization of Europe to the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary around 4.6 to 1.6 million years ago (MYA)  far before the onset of Pleistocene ice age. However  during the late Pleistocene and Holocene glaciations  it is assumed that secondary contacts occurred in all drainages  e.g. in the upper reaches of the rivers Main  Danube  Elbe and Rhine (Lake Constance) []. Koskinen et al. [] have revealed that a substantial proportion of molecular variation (44%) in European grayling exits between populations  whereas Gum et al. [  ] have revealed that about 25% of the total genetic variation is explained by differences between major drainage systems  about 11 to 20% by differences between populations within drainages and about 57 to 64% by differences within populations. The Balkan Peninsula along with the Apennine and Iberian Peninsulas  were a refuge area during the Pleistocene glaciations and therefore might represent crossroads of different evolutionary patterns and processes [  ]. The Balkan Peninsula  in contrast to the Apennine and Iberian Peninsulas  is poorly explored (except Slovenia). This part of Europe  very important for post-glacial faunal evolution and colonization  is noted as a biodiversity hotspot [  ]. The last (Würm) glaciation in Europe ended ~10 000 years ago coinciding with both colonization of the present grayling habitat and decline of grayling populations. Based on the 34 European populations (none from the Balkans)  between 1000 to 10000 years ago  population sizes were reduced to 0.03-1.2% of their historical sizes []. An even more recent decline of European grayling populations throughout central Europe  due to pollution  habitat destruction  river engineering  predation from piscivorous birds and overfishing [      ]  is also characteristic to Serbian grayling populations. Jankovic [] has reported results for six Serbian rivers with grayling populations (Drina  Lim  Uvac  Jadar  Studenica and Ibar). The populations from Uvac  Jadar and Studenica Rivers went extinct  while one new population was established in the Rzav River through stocking with fish originating from an unknown source population from Slovenia. Population decline leads to an increase in management activities that involve rearing and stocking grayling  which may cause a change in genetic architecture and extinction of natural populations []. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the genetic diversity of grayling populations in Serbia  using two mtDNA loci (CR and ATP6)  in order to clarify the phylogeography of grayling populations in this previously unstudied part of its native range. Additionally  12 microsatellite loci were analyzed  in order to (i) characterize the genetic variability and differentiation  (ii) compare recent and historical declines in previously studied European populations [] with that of Serbian populations and (iii) examine whether it is possible to identify non-introgressed indigenous populations of grayling for future management and supportive breeding. Eighty grayling individuals from four Serbian locations across the Danubian drainage were collected by electrofishing and angling between 2007 and 2008 (Table  and Figure ). Fin clips were sampled and stored in 96% ethanol. Total DNA was isolated from this tissue using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega)  following the supplier's instructions. . Names of sampling sites are listed in Table 1 Fifty-seven haplotypes from GenBank (accession numbers AF522395-AF522452) were used for the phylogenetic analysis and outgroup taxa included three individuals of  (AF522453)   (AF522454) and  (AF522455). The number of geographical rivers sampled for Serbian grayling in this study was limited and could not be increased because the four rivers included are the only ones remaining in Serbia today  with native grayling occurring only in three of these (see Introduction  Jankovic []). Two mtDNA loci  control region (CR) and ATP6 were amplified in 20 individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The complete CR [1043 base pairs (bp)] and 162 bp of the flanking tRNA were amplified using the LRBT-25 and LRBT-1195 primers []. The complete ATP6 gene (648 bp) was amplified using the L8558 and H9208 primers []. The following PCR conditions were used: each reaction mixture (30 µL) contained 21.6 µL HO (21 µL HO for ATP6)  3 µL 10 × PCR buffer  0.75 µL 10 mM of each primer  1.2 µL 25 mM MgCl (1.8 µL 25 mM MgCl for ATP6)  1.5 µL 0.2 mM dNTP  0.2 µL Fermentas  polymerase and 1 µL of template DNA (~100 ng of genomic DNA); the cycle parameters were as follows: initial denaturation (95°C  3 min) followed by 32 cycles of strand denaturation (95°C  45 s)  primer annealing (55°C  45 s) and DNA extension (72°C  60 s). All PCR amplifications were performed in a programmable thermocycler GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Amplified DNA fragments were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and subsequently isolated from the gel using the QIAEX II gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). All sequencing reactions were prepared using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The 3'end of the 595 bp fragment of the mtDNA CR with the 74 bp of flanking tRNA were sequenced using primer LRBT-1195 []. The 5'end of the 630 bp ATP6 fragment was sequenced using primer L8558 []. The amplified  fluorescently labeled and terminated DNA was salt-precipitated and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Twelve microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized as previously described i.e. BFRO004 []  BFRO005 to BFRO008 []  BFRO010 and BFRO011 []  BFRO013 []  BFRO015 to BFRO018 []. They were amplified in 80 individuals using fluorescently labeled forward primers. The following PCR conditions (10 µL reactions) were used: 6.325 µL HO  1 µL 10 × PCR buffer  0.25 µL 10 mM of each primer  0.6 µL 25 mM MgCl  0.5 µL 0.2 mM dNTP  0.075 µL Fermentas  polymerase and 1 µL of template DNA (~100 ng of genomic DNA); the cycle parameters were as follows: initial denaturation (94°C  3 min) followed by 30 cycles of strand denaturation (94°C  45 s)  primer annealing (55°C  30 s for BFRO004 to BFRO010  and 60°C  30 s for BFRO011 to BFRO018) and DNA extension (72°C  5 s). Fragment analysis was performed on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer and genotyped using GeneMapper v4.0. DNA sequences were aligned using the computer program ClustalW []. Sequence polymorphism was assessed using DNAsp ver. 4.10 [] and sequence divergence was estimated by the net nucleotide divergence (D) using MEGA version 2.1 []. Aligned haplotypes were imported into the program PAUP Version 4.0b10 [] for phylogenetic analysis. Neighbour-Joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were carried out for phylogenetic reconstruction. For the NJ analysis  a HKY85 model of substitution was chosen. Support for the nodes was obtained with 1000 bootstrap replicates. For the MP analysis  insertions or deletions (indels) were included as a fifth character  and the inferred phylogeny was estimated with 50% majority rule consensus tree. A heuristic search (1000 replicates) with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping was employed to find the most parsimonious trees. Relations among haplotypes were also determined using the TCS 1.2 program [] with a connection limit fixed at 24 steps to include all the different haplotypes. Gaps were analyzed as a fifth character. Microsatellite allele frequencies  expected (H)  non-biased (H) and observed (H) heterozygosities were calculated with GENETIX 4.04 []. FSTAT 2.9.3.2 [] was used to calculate deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (HWE)  allelic richness and pair-wise F values  all based on 1000 permutations. Genetic relationships between individuals were estimated as the proportion of shared alleles at each locus  i.e. allele sharing distances (D) []. A matrix of D was used to construct Neighbour-Joining trees of individuals and populations with POPULATIONS software []. Recent population declines (2N-4N generations ago) can be detected with BOTTLENECK 1.2.02 [] using the recommended stepwise mutation model (SMM) and the two-phase model (TPM) with 95% of single-step mutations and variance mutation size set to 12. To detect historical population declines  the coalescent analysis approach implemented in MSVAR 1.3 assuming strict SMM was used []. For the exponential model  we followed the settings used by Swatdipong et al. [] with a five-year generation time discarding the first 10% of 2 × 10 iterations. Population structure was inferred using the STRUCTURE program []  which seeks solutions for a given number of clusters K applied to genotypic data in such a way that each cluster is in or close to Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium []. For runs estimating ln Pr(X|K) under a certain K  different run lengths were used (from 20000 to 100000 burn-in and 100000-2000000 total length  repeated 7 times for each K) depending on convergence. We applied the <U+0394>K method [] to estimate the most probable K. Three new haplotypes were detected by sequencing the mtDNA CR: Da25  Da27 and Da29. Haplotype Da25 was present in the Rzav River population with a 100% frequency and in the Drina River population with a 40% frequency. Haplotypes Da25 and Da24 share synapomorphies at positions 622  625  626 and 635  and at position 708 with haplotypes Da22 and Da23 (See additional file : Variable nucleotide positions for CR haplotypes). Haplotypes Da22  Da23 and Da24 were observed in the population of the Sava River drainage area in Slovenia []. Haplotype Da27 was dominant in the samples from all localities in Serbia  with a 100% frequency for the Ibar and Lim Rivers and a 40% frequency for the Drina River. Haplotype Da29 was present exclusively in the Drina River population with a 20% frequency. Haplotypes Da27 and Da29 differed at five polymorphic positions and their genetic distance is about 0.75%. Haplotype Da27 and Da29 and haplotype Da25 differed at nine and ten polymorphic positions  respectively  and the genetic distance between these is about 1.5%. Sequencing of the ATP6 gene revealed four haplotypes (Soc18  Slo  BoDr and Bal). Haplotype Soc18 had already been described in the population of Soca River in Slovenia [] while in Serbia it was found only in samples from the Rzav River with an 80% frequency. The other three haplotypes had never been described before. Haplotype Slo was present in the populations of the Rzav River with a 20% frequency and the Drina River with a 40% frequency. Haplotype Bal was dominant in the sample analyzed here and was present in the populations of the Ibar and Lim Rivers with a 100% frequency and in the Drina River with a 40% frequency. Haplotype BoDr was found only in the Drina River samples with a 20% frequency. Unlike the mtDNA CR for which up to 10 polymorphic positions were identified among the three haplotypes  only three polymorphic positions were detected in the four ATP6 haplotypes and all were silent mutations. The synapomorphic position 34 discriminated between haplotypes Soc18 and Slo and haplotypes Bal and BoDr  which differed by two polymorphic positions at most  i.e. by a genetic distance of up to 0.32% (See additional file : Variable nucleotide positions for ATP6 gene haplotypes). Combining three CR and four ATP6 haplotypes produced four combined haplotypes (Table )  since the samples that possessed different ATP6 haplotypes (Soc18 and Slo) shared the same CR haplotype Da25. Reconstructing phylogenies by both Neighbour-Joining and parsimony methods revealed that haplotype Da25 and the Slovenian haplotypes from the Sava River drainage area form a sister clade of the new clade containing haplotypes Da27 and Da29 from the Danube River drainage area of Serbia (Figure ). Both sister clades form the new Balkan clade. . NJ phylogram based on the data set of Weiss et al. [] including 58 haplotypes plus three new sequences of the 3'end of the 595 bp fragment of mtDNA CR and 74 bp of flanking tRNA (Phe) from the Serbian part of Danubian drainage; the tree was rooted with  and  sequences of mtDNA CR; node support is shown by per cent bootstraps for NJ (1000 replicates) above  and maximum parsimony consensus (1000) below; italicized taxa represent newly sampled haplotypes The minimum spanning haplotype network of genealogical relationships among the haplotypes revealed that haplotype Da25 is closest to haplotype Da24 in the Slovenian group of haplotypes in the Sava River drainage area (Figure ) from which it differed by a single mutation  while it differed by nine or more mutations from other Slovenian haplotypes from the same drainage area (Da22 and Da23). Haplotypes Da27 and Da29 constitute a special group in the network and occupy a position which is most closely related to the Slovenian group of haplotypes from which they differ by six or more mutations.  []. Lines  regardless of length  represent single mutational events and link the haplotypes; small black circles represent missing or theoretical haplotypes; the three haplotypes found in Serbia are in black Allelic richness ranged from 1.58 to 4.08 and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.16 to 0.47. The highest levels of allelic richness (4.08)  observed (0.47) and expected (0.49) heterozygosities were detected in the Drina River samples  while those of the Rzav and Ibar Rivers had very low levels of heterozygosity. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were detected (Table ). Recent bottleneck was detected in the Rzav River (SMM and TPM)  P < 0.05. Mode-shift test also revealed distortion from L-shape allele frequency distribution in the same river. Coalescent analyses assuming an exponential population growth/decline estimated that the population decline started 1000 - 10 000 years ago with the present population sizes representing 0.03-0.44% of the historical sizes (Figure ).  [] . Pairwise F comparison revealed significant differences among all populations (Table ). This was also visible in the D based tree (Figure ) and in the individual clustering results by Structure  where four clusters corresponded roughly to the four populations from Serbia (Figure ). Further intra-population partitioning using Structure did not reveal any new cluster and no hybrid population was detected. (See additional file : The original data used to perform this analysis). . Individuals from the Drina  Lim and Ibar Rivers are labeled with circles  squares and triangles respectively  Rzav is unlabeled . Black lines separate sampling sites  the most probable K = 4 is based on <U+0394>K method []; no further structures were detected in subsequent rounds and within sampling locations (K = 1) Two combined haplotypes  Da27Bal and Da29BoDr are autochthonous for populations from Serbian waters while haplotypes Da25Soc18 and Da25Slo originate from Slovenia (Table ). The practice of stocking with grayling was common in many European countries [    ]. Despite the absence of written records on stocking in Rzav and Drina Rivers with grayling fry originating from Slovenian hatcheries  testimonies from the older members of the Anglers' Association of Arilje do agree that grayling was introduced into the Rzav River from Slovenia in the 1980's. This is supported by the fact that haplotype Da25 also occurs in Slovenian populations (unpublished data). The 0.75% genetic distance between autochthonous Da27 and Da29 haplotypes for which the mutation rate is estimated at about 1% per million years [    ]  suggests that a time period of about 750 thousand years separates the two haplotypes involving probably two independent colonization events. This assumption is supported by the even greater genetic distance (~1.35%) occurring between the two groups of haplotypes (Da22  Da23) and (Da24  Da25) in the Slovenian grayling sub-clade. Within the Balkan clade  the division between northern (Slovenian) and southern (Serbian) populations is obvious. This northern/southern differentiation has also been recorded in another Danubian salmonid species i.e. huchen () on the basis of microsatellite data []. The grayling Balkan and the Scandinavian clades are sister clades (Figure )  suggesting a common ancestry in the drainage areas of Black and Caspian seas. This is in agreement with the ancestral character of the grayling populations from a Danubian refugium in relation to the northern populations [  ]. The intermediate position of the Da29 haplotype on the network between northern Balkan and Scandinavian clades supports this statement. Da29 could be considered as the basal haplotype of the Balkan clade  with the genetic distance between Da29 and other haplotypes ranging between 0.75 and 1.65%  which is equivalent to the time scale of 750 000-1.65 million years when grayling of northern  Slovenian and southern  Serbian clusters differentiated. This is similar to the distance (~1.5%) found between the two northern and southern Alpine clades []. Including the ATP6 gene to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships in European grayling clades is not very useful at present because most studies are based on CR or other mtDNA sequences. Analyzing the ATP6 gene in grayling populations of Serbia confirms the division  previously observed from CR sequencing results  into two subclades (the northern i.e. Slovenian and the southern i.e.Serbian) in the Balkan clade defined by the synapomorphy at position 34 of the ATP6 gene (see additional file ). Results obtained so far suggest that the ATP6 gene will be a useful marker for future investigations on European grayling populations  since it provides interesting information on genetic variability. This could be important for decisions in conservation and management of grayling populations. In terms of microsatellite diversity (allelic richness  observed and expected heterozygosities)  populations from this study are comparable to other populations [  ]. F pairwise comparisons and Structure analyses reveal a strong divergence between Serbian grayling populations  which is not characteristic of Slovenian grayling in the Danubian drainage [  ]. Recent bottleneck has been shown in population from the Rzav River  which has suffered a recent decline. In addition  the Rzav River habitat is relatively small and was initially stocked with (presumably) a small number of fish from Slovenia. Serbian locations represent the furthest grayling habitats from the maximal extent of ice sheets [] and possibly grayling glacial refugium (or closest to it). Nevertheless the historical decline of Serbian populations is comparable with other European populations analyzed by Swatdipong et al. [] and is dated between 1000 and 10 000 years ago. The Rzav population shares 19 out of 21 alleles (90%) with Slovenian populations (Sava  Obrh and Unec combined)  while the Drina  Lim and Ibar populations share 47  56 and 53% of alleles with Slovenian populations  respectively. The two alleles in the Rzav population not shared with Slovenian populations are found in other Serbian populations  which means that there is no Rzav specific allele. This is not surprising since the river was not naturally inhabited by grayling. While stocking of the Rzav River is confirmed both by the mtDNA haplotypes (100% Da25) and the 90% alleles shared with Slovenian populations  the situation in the Drina River is different. Although 40% of the Drina River samples had the Da25 haplotype  hybridization with non-native grayling was not detected by nuclear markers. The percentage of shared alleles with the Slovenian populations was lowest in Drina River (47%)  most likely because the population had already the highest genetic diversity prior stocking. Influence of stocking in the Drina River was not detected in its tributary i.e. the Lim River  which is in accordance to the generally low migration rates for the species [    ]. While Lim and Ibar Rivers are inhabited by native non-introgressed grayling of lower genetic diversity  the Drina River population is admixed and the most diverse in the region. Serbian grayling populations are genetically distinct from Slovenian and other European populations. In order to preserve their overall genetic diversity and integrity  further stocking of non-native fish from other regions or from allochthonous populations in the Rzav River should be stopped. Populations from the Ibar and Lim Rivers (which show no signs of introgression of non-native grayling)  as well as the population from the Drina River should be regarded as native and subject to proper management. The population from the Drina River is the most diverse in this study and the only one with the mtDNA haplotype Da29. It probably represents the most valuable genetic resource in the region. However  any future management such as supplementary stocking of hatchery-reared Drina River grayling should take into consideration genetic testing prior formation of brood stock  because introgression has been detected. Since the area studied here represents only a minor part of the Balkan Peninsula  genetic polymorphism of the grayling within the region as a whole may be even higher  because grayling from the countries adjacent to Serbia (i.e.  Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina) have not been studied so far.

Traditional genetic evaluation of livestock combines only phenotypic data and probabilities that genes are identical by descent using the pedigree information. Genetic markers for many loci across the genome can be used to measure genetic similarity and may be more precise than pedigree information []. Genomic relationships can better estimate the proportion of chromosomes segments shared by individuals because high-density genotyping identifies genes identical in state that may be shared through common ancestors not recorded in the pedigree. A genomic relationship matrix () can be calculated by different methods [  ]. As an entire population is unlikely to be genotyped in livestock species  Legarra et al. [] and Misztal et al. [] have proposed the integration of the numerator relationship matrix () and  into a single matrix (). A BLUP evaluation using  called single-step genomic evaluation has been successfully applied in dairy cattle []. Besides the computation of   no further modifications in the standard mixed model equations used in animal breeding have been needed []. The formula for  includes the expression  -   which is the difference between genomic and pedigree-based relationships. If  is inflated  deflated or in some other way incompatible with   the weighting of the pedigree and genomic information will be incorrect. Various  used in a genetic evaluation by Aguilar et al. [] have resulted in different scaling and accuracies of EBV. Estimates of the additive variance using  may be much larger than those using []. Different  can lead to different accuracies of EBV []. These differences could be due to an incorrect scaling of  relative to . The first objective of this study was to apply different genomic matrices to analyses of litter size in a swine population and evaluate the impact of those  on EBV and estimates of variance components. The second objective was to develop a strategy to create an optimal  that is easy to create and yields reasonably accurate EBV and estimates of the additive variance. Data of litter size (total number born per litter) for 338 346 sows  of which 1 919 were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip  were analyzed. Genotypes of their 70 sires were also available. Genotyped females were crosses of two pure lines derived from the same breeds  and they were born in a two-year span. After quality control procedures  44 298 markers remained and were used to estimate genomic relationship coefficients. In the quality control analysis  SNP were excluded if: the minor allele frequency was smaller than 0.05  the marker mapped to the sex chromosomes  the chi-square statistics for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium from males and females differed by more than 0.1  or more than 20% of animals had missing genotypes. Phenotypes were collected in genetic nucleus (pure lines) and commercial herds (line crosses) and the parental lines were included as fixed effects in the model to account for differences in the genetic backgrounds. All analyses were carried out with the complete data set and with a subset containing only genotyped females and three generations of pedigree (5 090 animals). Records were analyzed using an animal model. Fixed effects included parity order  age at farrowing (linear covariable)  number of services  mating type (artificial insemination or natural service)  contemporary group  sow line and sire line (parents of animals with phenotype). Contemporary groups were defined by season  year and farrowing farm. The numerator relationship matrix was obtained with pedigree information on 382 988 animals. Prediction error variances (PEV) were obtained by inversion of the coefficients matrix of the mixed model equations. In the animal model  the inverse of the numerator relationship matrix () was replaced by  that combines the pedigree and genomic information []: where  is the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix and  is the inverse of the pedigree-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals. Comparisons involved several genomic relationship matrices. First   was obtained following VanRaden []: where  is an allele-sharing matrix with m columns (m = total number of markers) and n rows (n = total number of genotyped individuals)  and  is a matrix containing the frequency of the second allele (p)  expressed as 2p. M  was 0 if the genotype of individual  for SNP  was homozygous 11  was 1 if heterozygous  or 2 if the genotype was homozygous 22. Frequencies should be those from the unselected base population  but this information was not available. Instead the frequencies used were: 0.5 for all markers ()  the average minor allele frequency ()  and the observed allele frequency of each SNP (). The last option assured that the average off-diagonal element was close to 0. For  only  the second allele was the one with smaller frequency. A different matrix with observed frequencies  was obtained by modification of the denominator as in Gianola et al. []: where p and q are expectations of allele frequencies following a Beta distribution with hyperparameters a and ß. The values for the hyperparameters were the same as observed in the genotyped animals. A normalized matrix was obtained to have average diagonal coefficients equal to 1: The denominator should assure compatibility with A when either the average inbreeding is low or the number of generations low. Higher levels of inbreeding in the genotyped population can be accommodated by substituting \"n\" in the denominator of  by the sum of (1 + F) across genotyped animals  where F are individual inbreeding coefficients derived from pedigree. Different from the numerator relationship matrix  values on the diagonal of  can be smaller than 1. An average diagonal of 1 can also be obtained by multiplying (4) by a constant. A similar relationship matrix with sample variance of 1 was used by Kang et al. []. The genomic matrix is positive semidefinite but it can be singular if the number of loci is limited or two individuals have identical genotypes across all markers. It will be singular if the number of markers is smaller than the number of individuals genotyped. To avoid potential problems with inversion   was calculated as  = w + (1 - w)  where w = 0.95 and  is a genomic matrix before weighting. Tests showed that the value of w was not critical. Aguilar et al. [] reported negligible differences in EBV using w between 0.95 and 0.98. Christensen and Lund [] suggested that w could be interpreted as the relative weight of the polygenic effect needed to explain the total additive variance  such as:   where  is the variance explained by the markers. The joint distribution of breeding values of genotyped () and non-genotyped animals () is: and the variances of the conditional posterior distributions are: The additive variance is on average the same for the entire population  and coefficients of  and  need to be compatible in scale. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using the EM algorithm []. Statistics of pedigree-based and genomic relationship coefficients for genotyped animals ( or ) are in Table . In  and   the same allele frequency was used for all markers  and the average of both diagonal and off-diagonal elements was greater than the coefficients in . The average minor allele frequency was 0.26. The distribution of frequencies of the second allele was nearly flat (Figure ). For  and   the average diagonal coefficients were smaller than the pedigree-based coefficients. The average off-diagonal coefficients were zero in both matrices  similar to . This allowed obtaining a matrix with average diagonal elements equal to 1 () and average off-diagonal elements equal to zero. For all genomic matrices  diagonal coefficients had greater variance than the pedigree-based coefficients. Off-diagonal genomic coefficients had a greater variance only for  and . Greater variance was expected between the elements of  than  because genomic relationships reflect the actual fraction of genes shared whereas pedigree-based coefficients are predictions. Predictions have smaller variance than the variable predicted when the prediction error is not zero. . Observed frequencies of the second allele Estimates of variance components obtained with the full data set are in Table   and estimates from the subset are in Table . The differences observed in the complete data set were negligible  most likely because genomic relationships were a small fraction of all relationships. Compared to estimates obtained with   most of the additive variance estimates using the genomic relationships in the smaller dataset were inflated. The inflation was approximately inversely proportional to the difference between the average diagonal and the off-diagonal elements of . The highest inflation was with   for which this difference was only 0.51. The additive variance estimates were the same for  and  despite different averages but with similar differences between average diagonal and off-diagonal elements  0.66 and 0.68  respectively. Estimates in the smaller data were similar using  and   which had very similar diagonal and off-diagonal element averages. Legarra et al. [] have demonstrated that a normalized genomic matrix  as  = /trace()  allows the same expectation of variance for breeding values of genotyped and non-genotyped animals. Assuming that a genomic relationship matrix standardized such as  produces realistic estimates of additive variance  the use of genomic information resulted in smaller standard errors (0.30) than only pedigree information (0.44). Estimates of breeding values for genotyped animals were on average similar regardless the choice of . Table  presents correlations between breeding values obtained with different relationship matrices. Small differences were observed in the ranks obtained with different genomic matrices. However  these differences have direct implications on selection decisions and genetic progress. For instance  if 597 animals (top 30%) were selected using   456 animals among the 597 would also be selected using . For other genomic matrices  the number of animals selected in common with  was: 567 for   568 for   593 for   and 554 for *. Correlations between pedigree-based EBV and EBV obtained using either  or  were similar. When applied to dairy data  Aguilar et al. [] have found substantially higher accuracies for  with allele frequencies equal to 0.5 than with either current or estimated base allele frequencies. When the allele frequency is p  the relative contribution to the diagonal of  is (2p) for the first homozygote  (1-2p) for a heterozygote  and (2-2p) for the second homozygote. With p = 0.5  these contributions are 1  0  and 1  respectively. When the allele frequencies are assumed different from 0.5  these contributions are different for each homozygote. For example  contributions with p = 0.2 would be 0.16 for the first homozygote  0.36 for the heterozygote  and 2.56 for the second homozygote. Consequently  rare alleles contribute more to the variance than common alleles. It would be interesting to compare the results with a normalized matrix from  by multiplying and deducting a constant as in VanRaden []. However  in our experience such matrices were not positive definite. Subtracting of a constant from  might be helpful if this does not create a negative eigenvalue. Statistics on computed breeding values with various relationship matrices are in Table . The means can be clustered in two groups  one for matrices based on the observed allele frequencies where the average off-diagonal is 0  and another for the remaining matrices. When the average off-diagonals were larger than zero  all genotyped animals were related with positive coefficients. The assumption that all animals are related may create biases especially when animals of interest have both phenotypes and genotypes. The exact impact of large off-diagonals is a topic for future research. Estimates of accuracy obtained using PEV with different genomic matrices are in Table . On average  the increase of accuracy from genomic information was for genotyped animals only. The increases were higher for females because of their lower initial accuracy. The accuracies varied depending on the genomic matrix used. Assuming that additive variance and accuracy estimates are most realistic with   the accuracies using non-normalized  were inflated. VanRaden et al. [] have presented computed and realized genomic accuracies for a number of traits  and found the computed accuracies to be inflated. Pedigrees may include many generations into the history of the population but must end eventually. In standard genetic evaluations  founder animals are the earliest generation recorded and the assumption is that they do not share genes from older ancestors. Relationship and inbreeding coefficients from later generations are estimated as deviations from the founders' relatedness. Genomic analysis typically reveals that founder animals actually share genes identical by descent  which shift relationship and inbreeding coefficients up or down. Genomic and pedigree-based matrices should be compatible in scale to be integrated. Ideally  genomic relationships should be estimated using the allele frequencies from the unselected base population. This information can be rarely extracted from historical data and approximations must to be used. Errors in the allele frequency estimates may result in biased relationships and consequently biased GEBVs  especially for young animals []. Yang et al. [] have proposed a genomic relationship matrix that uses the genotyped animals as the base population. They have presented a slightly different formulation than used here for the diagonal elements of . Using the genotyped population as base   would have to be re-scaled according to  but allele frequencies in the base population would not have to be estimated. Coefficients of  had greater variance than the corresponding elements of . The variance was greater because individuals equally related in the pedigree have more or less alleles in common than expected. Genomic analysis achieved higher accuracies probably because genomic information improved prediction of the Mendelian sampling terms. More differentiation within families and reduction of co-selection of sibs are expected with genomic-assisted selection because Mendelian sampling can be better estimated. As a result  inbreeding across generations is expected to increase more slowly than it would increase with standard evaluations []. We considered only phenotypes of crossbred animals. The performance of crossbred animals is considered a different trait than the performance of purebred animals in routine evaluations of this population. Using a multitrait model  one can predict EBV for elite animals as parents at the nucleus and commercial level simultaneously. However  only additive inheritance is considered in this model and differences in allele frequencies between pure lines are ignored. Cantet and Fernando [] have shown that ignoring segregation variance could lead to unbiased predictions that do not have the minimum variance. More suitable models should be used to account for heterosis when the objective is to rank crossbred animals [  ]. Estimates of additive variance were sensitive to the choices of  when a greater part of the pedigree was genotyped. An entire genotyped population is rarely found in livestock species  and pedigree and genomic information have to be combined. Estimates of relationships are always relative to an arbitrary base population in which the average relationship is zero. Genomic and pedigree-based relationships must be relative to the same base to be combined in the  matrix. We chose to use the animals with unknown parents in  as the base  and we modified  accordingly. Because there were no changes in the genetic base  the same additive variance is expected when including the genomics coefficients. A practical solution to avoid inflation of the additive variance is to re-scale  to obtain average diagonal elements equal to 1  when off-diagonal elements are already on average zero. In the data set analyzed  average off-diagonal elements equal to zero were obtained using the observed allele frequencies. Several studies have indicated accuracy gains with the inclusion of genomic information in genetic evaluations via marker regression or identical-by-descent matrices [    ]. However  some experiences in the dairy industry  however  have indicated that actual improvement may differ from expected because of inflation of genomic breeding values and reliabilities [  ]. Biases in genomic predictions can be related to incorrect weighting of polygenic and genomic components. The combined pedigree-genomic relationship matrix provides a natural way to weight both components for optimal predictions. In addition  a single-step genomic evaluation eliminates a number of assumptions and parameters required in multiple-step methods  and possibly delivers more accurate evaluations for young animals. The single-step procedure can be easily extended for multiple-traits analysis  and can handle large amounts of genomic information. Extensions to account for other distributions of marker effects  i.e.  large QTL or major genes  are also possible [  ]. Nevertheless  computational efforts may be an issue long-term because the genomic matrix needs to be created and inverted. Estimates of the additive genetic variance with pedigree or joint pedigree-genomic relationships are similar when the differences between the average diagonal and the average off-diagonal elements in  are similar to those in . Adding the genomic information to  results in lower standard errors of additive variance estimates. Accuracies of EBV with the pedigree-genomic matrix are a function not only of the average of diagonal and off-diagonal elements of   but also of the difference between these averages. The accuracy estimates may be inflated with non-normalized . Matrix compatibility can be obtained by using observed allele frequencies and re-scaling the genomic relationship matrix to obtain average diagonal elements equal to 1. If allele frequencies in the base population are different from 0.5  rare alleles contribute more to the genetic resemblance between individuals than common alleles.
