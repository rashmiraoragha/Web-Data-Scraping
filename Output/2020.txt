We demonstrate the BayesXII algorithm using the prior for BayesC  a Bayesian variable selection regression method  which is applied to simulated data with 50 000 individuals and a medium-density marker panel (<U+2009>50 000 markers). To reach about the same accuracy as the conventional samplers for BayesC required less than 30 min using the BayesXII algorithm on 24 nodes (computer used as a server) with 24 cores on each node. In this case  the BayesXII algorithm required one tenth of the computation time of conventional samplers for BayesC. Addressing the heavy computational burden associated with Bayesian methods by parallel computing will lead to greater use of these methods. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data have been adopted for whole-genome analyses  including genomic prediction [] and genome-wide association studies []. Bayesian regression models are widely used in genomic prediction  where the effects of all markers are estimated simultaneously by combining the information from the phenotypic data and priors for the marker effects and other parameters such as variance components or membership probabilities. Most of the widely-used Bayesian regression models differ only in the prior used for the marker effects. For example  the prior for each marker effect in BayesA [] follows a scaled t-distribution  whereas in variable selection regression  the prior for each marker effect is a mixture distribution  such as BayesB []  BayesC []  BayesC [] and BayesR [  ]. In these Bayesian regression models  closed-form expressions for the marginal posterior distributions of parameters of interest  e.g.  marker effects  are usually not available. Thus  inferences from most Bayesian methods are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods  where statistics are computed from a Markov chain that is constructed such that the stationary distribution of a random vector  is equal to the posterior. It has been shown that statistics computed from such a Markov chain converge to those from the stationary distribution as the chain length increases []. In Bayesian regression models for genomic prediction  the vector  has a length about equal to the number  of markers or a multiple of it if auxiliary variables such as locus-specific marker effect variances are introduced to the analysis as in BayesA or BayesB. A widely used method to construct such a Markov chain is Gibbs sampling. In Gibbs sampling  at step   each component of the vector  is sampled from the conditional distribution of that component given all the other components sampled up to that point []. In some Gibbs samplers proposed for Bayesian variable selection methods such as BayesB [  ]  BayesC [] or BayesC []  for example  within each step  each variable in the vector  is sampled conditionally on all the other variables. This includes  for each marker   its effect  the effect variance and a Bernoulli variable indicating whether the effect is zero or non-zero  as well as all non-marker effects and the residual variance. These are examples of a single-site Gibbs sampler where each variable is iteratively sampled conditional on the current values of all other variables. In practice  chains of about tens of thousands steps are typically used in whole-genome Bayesian regression models [  ]  and within each step of the chain  Gibbs sampling requires iteratively sampling at least  unknowns. Medium-level marker panels are often used in whole-genome prediction projects in animal breeding  where  is about 50 000 or larger. Thus  Bayesian regression models are usually computationally intensive  and commonly used strategies to sample these  unknowns efficiently are demanding. The Ergodic theorem of Markov chain theory states that statistics computed from an increasingly long chain converge to those from the stationary distribution []  whereas no such theory demonstrates that convergence can be achieved from an increasing number of shorter chains. It has sometimes been suggested that parallel computing can be adopted in MCMC by using multiple processors to obtain several short chains in parallel and then pooling the statistics computed from these short chains. In this case  caution is needed to make sure these short chains have converged to the stationary distribution. Combining several short chains will reduce the Monte Carlo variance of the computed quantities  but this may not yield statistics from the stationary distribution. Thus  to rapidly construct a single long enough chain in parallel is key to addressing the problem of the long computing time in Bayesian regression models. This is difficult because a Markov chain is an iterative process  and it can not be broken into several independent processes. Parallel computing has been used in whole-genome prediction with Bayesian regression models by parallelizing the computations  including vector additions and dot products  associated with each marker at each step of the chain. To parallelize the computations  vectors are split up and additions or products are done in parallel on multiple processors [  ]. These strategies can be used for most methods involving matrix or vector calculations. Speedup from these approaches  however  is limited  because marker effects still need to be sampled iteratively. Another appealing approach is to parallelize the Gibbs sampling for all markers within each step of the chain. In a single-site Gibbs sampler  however  sampling of a marker effect is from the full conditional distribution  which is the conditional distribution of this marker effect given the current values of all the other markers. Thus  parallelizing Gibbs sampling would not be feasible unless the full conditional distributions do not depend on the values of the variables being conditioned on  i.e.  unless the full-conditionals are independent. In this paper  we show how the full conditional distributions of the marker effects can be made independent within each step of the chain. This is done by augmenting the marker covariate matrix by adding  new rows such that columns of the augmented marker covariate matrix are mutually orthogonal. The phenotypes corresponding to the augmented rows of the marker covariate matrix are considered missing. The objective of this paper is to propose a fast parallelized algorithm for Bayesian regression models that we call BayesXII  where “X” stands for Bayesian alphabet methods and “II” stands for “parallel”. In this paper  the prior for BayesC  a Bayesian variable selection regression method  was used to demonstrate the BayesXII algorithm. Use of this approach with other priors  such as those in BayesA  BayesB or Bayesian Lasso  should be straightforward. Simulated data for 50 000 individuals with genotypes from a medium-level marker panel ( 50 000 markers) were used to compare the computational efficiency of the BayesXII algorithm with the conventional sampler for BayesC. In Bayesian linear regression models  for simplicity and without loss of generality  we assume that individuals have a general mean as the only fixed effect. Phenotypes of  genotyped individuals are then modeled as where  is the vector of  phenotypes   is the overall mean   is the  marker covariate matrix (coded as 0  1  2)   is a vector of  random additive marker effects and  is a vector of  random residuals. A flat prior is used for . The prior for the residual  is  with . The columns of  are usually centered prior to further computation. In BayesC  a Bayesian variable selection method  the prior for the marker effect is a mixture of a point mass at zero and a univariate normal distribution with null mean and a common locus variance  with  [  ]. In Gibbs sampling  the full conditional distribution of   the marker effect for locus   when  is non-zero  can be written as where  stands for all the other parameters and    is the th column of   and  is the solution to The derivation of the full conditional distributions of other parameters of interest in Bayesian regression models are shown in . In commonly-used Gibbs sampling  the sample for each marker effect    can not be obtained simultaneously  i.e.  in parallel  because samples for other marker effects    appear in the term  on the right-hand-side of ()  i.e.  the full conditional distributions of the marker effects are not independent. One solution is to orthogonalize columns of the marker covariate matrix  such that the term  in () becomes zero. A data augmentation approach [] to obtain a design matrix with orthogonal columns is described below. Let  be the incidence matrix for the Bayesian regression analysis. Following Ghosh et al. []  we show here how to augment  as  such that where  is a square matrix of dimension  and  is a diagonal matrix. Thus  and  can be obtained using Cholesky decomposition (or Eigen decomposition) of    the right-hand-side of (). Our choice of  is   where  is an identity matrix and  is set to be the largest eigenvalue of . In practice  a small value  e.g.  0.001  is added to  to avoid computationally unstable solutions. A small numerical example of ODA can be found in . Employing ODA  Bayesian linear regression models can be written as: where  denotes a vector of unobserved phenotypes that are introduced into the model   and    are obtained using () with   and . In the BayesXII algorithm  the full conditional distribution of  when  is non-zero  under model ()  which was derived in   can be written as: where the mean and variance parameters are free of the values of the other marker effects . Thus  the full conditional distributions of the marker effects are independent  and thus  samples for each marker can be obtained simultaneously and therefore in parallel. Note that  does not change  and only  needs to be computed at each step of the MCMC chain  where the number of operations for this is always of order  regardless of the size of . In the BayesXII algorithm  sampling marker effects at each MCMC step  however  requires sampling of the vector  of unobserved phenotypes. At each step of the MCMC chain  each element of the “missing” phenotypes  is sampled from independent univariate normal distributions as: Note that the means of these normal distributions can be computed in parallel as described in . Once the means are computed  each element in  can be sampled in parallel. The derivation of the full conditional distributions of other parameters of interest in the BayesXII algorithm and parallel implementation of the BayesXII algorithm using Message Passing Interface (MPI) [] are shown in . A dataset of 60 000 observations with a medium-density marker panel was simulated using software XSim [] to compare the BayesXII algorithm with the conventional sampler for BayesC. Publicly available genotypes for a medium-density marker panel ( 42 000 markers after quality control) were obtained for 100 German Holstein cattle (). Then  haplotypes of these 100 individuals were estimated from their genotypic data using the software WinHap []. Starting from a base population of these 100 individuals  random mating was simulated for 100 generations  and continued for one more generation to increase the population size to 60 000 individuals  which were then used in the analysis. A random sample of five percent of the total number of loci were selected as quantitative trait loci (QTL)  and their effects were sampled from a univariate normal distribution with mean zero and variance one. The QTL effects were scaled such that the genetic variance from the last generation was 1.0. A trait with a heritability 0.3 was simulated by adding independent residuals to the genetic values. In our analysis  a randomly sampled subset of 50 000 individuals was used for training and the remaining 10 000 individuals were used for testing. This dataset was used to compare the BayesXII algorithm with the conventional sampler for BayesC. For both BayesXII algorithm and conventional sampler for BayesC  five Markov chains of length 100 000 were generated from five different sets of starting values for marker effects sampled from a normal distribution with null mean and variance calculated as   where  is the genetic variance   is the allele frequency for locus   and  is the probability that a marker has a null effect. Prediction accuracies  which are calculated as the correlation between estimated breeding values and adjusted phenotypic values  in the testing population were used to compare these two methods. The correlation between estimated breeding values of these two methods for the testing population was investigated to: (1) confirm that the BayesXII algorithm can provide about the same prediction accuracy as the conventional sampler for BayesC; and (2) quantify the relative convergence of the BayesXII algorithm and conventional sampler for BayesC. Our BayesXII algorithm was implemented using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) []  which is a message-passing standard for distributed memory programming. The speed of our parallel implementation of the BayesXII algorithm was tested on a server with up to 24 nodes in the same rack  and there were 24 cores on each node. The authors state that all data necessary for confirming the conclusions presented in this article are represented fully within the article. The speed of the BayesXII algorithm is shown in Table . The total runtime for the BayesXII algorithm was sped up nearly linearly by the number of computer processors. Using 576 processors (24 nodes with 24 cores on each node)  the BayesXII algorithm required about 47 min to obtain samples for a chain of length 100 000. However  the conventional sampler for BayesC running on one node and one core required about 7900 minutes for the same chain length  which was about 170 times slower than the BayesXII algorithm. Prediction accuracies were obtained from five chains of length 100 000 for each method. The potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) was used to diagnose the convergence of the Markov chain [  ]. Using conventional sampler for BayesC  convergence required about 3000 iterations (PSRF value for the marker effect variance was smaller than 1.1)  where the prediction accuracy of BayesC was 0.5139. The correlation between estimated breeding values from the BayesXII algorithm with those from the conventional sampler for BayesC for the testing population was larger than 0.99 when the chain for the BayesXII algorithm was longer than 50 500  where the prediction accuracy for the BayesXII algorithm was 0.5104. The trajectory of the prediction accuracy of the BayesXII algorithm is provided in the . In summary  the BayesXII algorithm requires 17 times more samples than the conventional sampler for BayesC to obtain about the same prediction accuracy. Considering that the BayesXII algorithm was 170 times faster than the conventional sampler for BayesC using 24 nodes with 24 cores on each node (i.e.  about 25 minutes for a chain of length 50 500)  the BayesXII algorithm required one tenth of the computation time in the conventional sampler for BayesC.  Whole-genome Bayesian multiple regression methods are usually computationally intensive  where a MCMC chain comprising tens of thousands of steps is typically used for inference. In this paper  a strategy to parallelize Gibbs sampling for each marker within each step of the MCMC chain was proposed. This parallelization is accomplished using an orthogonal data augmentation strategy  where the marker covariate matrix is augmented with  new rows such that its columns are orthogonal. Then  the full conditional distributions of marker effects become independent within each step of the chain  and thus  samples of marker effects within each step can be drawn in parallel. Ideally  the BayesXII algorithm can be accelerated by  times  where  is the number of computer processors  up to  times  where  is the number of markers. In this paper  the full conditional distributions that are needed for BayesC with orthogonal data augmentation (BayesXII) were derived and the speed of the BayesXII algorithm was evaluated. In the simulation data with 50 000 individuals and a medium-density marker panel ( 50 000 markers)  the BayesXII algorithm reached about the same accuracy as the conventional sampler for BayesC in less than 30 minutes on 24 nodes with 24 cores on each node. In this case  the BayesXII algorithm required one tenth of the computation time as conventional sampler for BayesC. The time and space complexity for sampling marker effects  the most time-consuming task  in the BayesXII algorithm and conventional sampler for BayesC  are shown in Table   where the big  notation [] is used. Time complexity represents the number of elementary operations  such as multiplication and addition  performed by an algorithm. Space complexity represents the amount of storage required by an algorithm. In Bayesian regression model implementations such as BayesC  the most time consuming task is sampling the marker effects from their full conditional distributions. The time complexities for two different computational approaches  BayesC-I and BayesC-II  for conventional sampler for BayesC are () and   for which the details are described in . In the BayesXII algorithm  however  the marker effects can be sampled in parallel within each step  using ()  and the time complexity is . Ideally  the computations at each step of the MCMC chain can be accelerated by  times  where  is the number of computer processors  up to  times  where  is the number of markers. In our simulated data  the speed performance of the two computational approaches for conventional sampler for BayesC should be similar and only the first approach is shown in \"Results\" section. After marker effects are sampled at each step of the MCMC  the computational complexity for sampling residual variances and marker effects variances in the BayesXII algorithm at each step are () and ()  which are negligible compared with the complexity of sampling marker effects. In conventional samplers for BayesC  the computational complexity for sampling residual variances at each step is () for BayesC-I and  for BayesC-II. The time complexities for computations to build prerequisite matrices that are done only once for the BayesC-I  BayesC-II and BayesXII algorithms on a single-core are ()   and . The computing time for these “only-once” computations  however  is trivial compared to that for sampling marker effects. For example  in the BayesXII algorithm  the time complexity for computation to build the augmented matrix  as in () on a single core is . In ()  the two tasks are: (1) computation of   where  is an  matrix; and (2) Cholesky decomposition of a positive definite matrix of size . Parallel computing approaches for the first of these two tasks is given in . The computing time for the Cholesky decomposition in the second task is relatively short  requiring about 5 minutes for  on a workstation with 4 cores and 64G memory. In the BayesXII algorithm  the marker covariate matrix is augmented by adding  new rows such that its columns are orthogonal. Compared with the conventional sampler for BayesC  the  “missing” phenotypes are sampled at each step of the MCMC chain in the BayesXII algorithm. This makes the convergence of the BayesXII algorithm slower than for the conventional sampler. Thus  the ratio of the number  of markers and the number  of individuals may affect the convergence of the BayesXII algorithm. We simulated new datasets with 1000 markers and different number of individuals. A random sample of five percent of those 1000 markers were selected as QTL. Figure  shows the effect of sample size on the convergence of the BayesXII algorithm  where the number of steps required for the BayesXII algorithm to obtain similar estimated breeding value as conventional sampler for BayesC was shown for different  with . It can be seen that fewer iterations are needed as more individuals () become available. This is happening in genomic prediction as more individuals are genotyped. Effect of sample size on the convergence of the BayesXII algorithm. Number of MCMC steps required for the BayesXII algorithm to obtain similar estimated breeding value as conventional sampler for BayesC using a low-density marker panel (1000 markers) In the BayesXII algorithm  the marker covariate matrix is augmented by adding a matrix  to make all columns of the augmented marker covariate matrix orthogonal to each other. However  with high-density marker panels (e.g.  whole-genome sequence data)  a large amount of memory will be used to store   and the Cholesky decomposition of what may be a huge square matrix of size  is required  which can be very slow or infeasible. Thus  we propose another approach below. Markers are partitioned into small groups  and a square matrix  is generated to orthogonalize columns of the marker covariate matrix in group  such that marker effects for markers in the same group can be sampled in parallel at each step. For example  for a marker covariate matrix partitioned into  groups    the augmented marker covariate matrix can be written as: where and  is a diagonal matrix for group . Note that the way in which markers are partitioned into small groups may affect the convergence. A fast parallelized algorithm called BayesXII is proposed in this paper. Ideally  the computations at each step of the MCMC chain can be accelerated by  times  where  is the number of computer processors  up to  times  where  is the number of markers. In a simulation analysis with 50 000 individuals and a medium-density marker panel  the BayesXII algorithm reached about the same prediction accuracy as the conventional samplers for BayesC within one tenth of the computation time for the conventional sampler. In conclusion  we believe that the BayesXII algorithm is a practical alternative for accelerating Gibbs sampling for some applications of Bayesian regression models  such as those encountered in genomic prediction. Addressing the heavy computational burden associated with Bayesian regression models by parallel computing will lead to greater use of these models. Meuwissen THE  Hayes BJ  Goddard ME.

Detailed derivation of the full conditional distributions of the marker effect for locus  in conventional sampler for BayesC is in Fernando and Garrick []. As shown in []  the full conditional distribution of  in BayesC  when  is non-zero  is where  stands for all the other unknowns and    is the th column of   and  is the solution to: It is worth noting that two approaches are available to compute the right-hand-side of (). The first approach  BayesC-I  corresponding to () is briefly described below.  Initially: Compute  with  Compute   which is the vector  corrected for all fixed and random effects  using their current values  and Store  in the memory. Then  for each locus at each step of MCMC: Before sampling the marker effect  the right-hand-side of () is updated as  then once a new value of   denoted by   is sampled   is updated as  The second approach  BayesC-II  corresponding to () is briefly described below.  Initially: Compute    and   then  Store these matrices in memory. Then for each locus at each step of MCMC: Before sampling the marker effect  the right-hand-side is computed as where  is the th column of  and  is the jth diagonal element of . Note that the number of operations to sample marker effects for each locus at each step of the MCMC is of order  in the first approach and of order  for the second approach. Thus  the computational complexities for sampling marker effects in conventional sampler for BayesC are () for the first approach and  for the the second approach. The space complexities are () for storing  in the first approach and  for storing  in the second approach. The full conditional distribution of  in the BayesXII algorithm  which is shown below  can be obtained from () and () by replacing  with    with  and  with . Note that columns of the augmented covariate matrix  are orthogonal.

Thus they are presented as below without derivations. where    is the number of markers in the model at each step. Note that  can be written as: As shown above  in the BayesXII algorithm  all marker effects can be sampled simultaneously in parallel within each step of the chain. Given  available computer processes  markers can be split into  groups  and each computer process can be used to sample marker effects in the corresponding group. A graph to demonstrate such a parallel implementation for sampling marker effects at each step is shown in Fig. . Parallel implementation for sampling marker effects at each step in the BayesXII algorithm. The -th process will calculate the number of  marker effects on group   and  In many modern programming languages  such as R  Python and Julia  libraries are available to take advantage of multiple processors and GPUs for parallel computing of many matrix or vector operations. The descriptions given below are only to illustrate the main principle underlying parallel computing  which involves distributing calculations across processors. Actual implementations may be different and will depend on the programming language  the library and the hardware used. To sample the unobserved phenotypic values using ()  a matrix by vector product  is needed. Here we describe how parallel computing can be used to compute the product of a matrix  by a vector .

In addition to the benefit of reducing the computing time  this approach can also address the limitation that  may be too large to be stored on a single computing node () by distributing the  across several nodes.

Genotyping of triploid individuals is important both for selective breeding programs and unravelling the underlying genetics of phenotypes recorded in triploids. In principle  the developed method can be used for genotype calling of other polyploid organisms. Polyploidy is widespread in plants and exists both in vertebrate and invertebrate animals [  ]. In aquaculture species  triploidy can be induced by pressure-shocking newly fertilized eggs  resulting in unreduced gametes in the females []. In such induced triploids  the shocking of eggs prevents the second polar body from leaving the secondary oocyte during meiosis []. This results in a triploid cell  in which two sets of chromosomes are inherited from the mother  and one set from the father. This practice is commonly used by the aquaculture industry to produce sterile fish for farming  and by wildlife management for stocking of sterile game fish for recreational purposes. The Thermo Fisher GeneTitan platform is commonly used to genotype Atlantic salmon using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips []. However  genotyping of triploids is currently not possible using the supplied Thermo Fisher software  which limits research projects for triploids of any species. The goal of this study was to develop a method for calling genotypes for triploid individuals using the output from the Thermo Fisher GeneTitan instrument. Secondary aims were to develop methods for dam- and sire-specific assignment of induced triploid offspring  and to use maternal inheritance to triploid offspring to map the maternal recombination pattern. Although the genotype calling method was tested only by using diploids and triploids  in principle  it can be extended to other ploidies as well. DNA was sampled from 381 triploid Atlantic salmon and genotyped on a Thermo Fisher SNP chip array with 56 177 SNPs (56 k chip). Triploidy was verified by visually identifying four distinct clusters of transformed allele strengths per individual  namely ‘contrast’ and ‘size’ (see []). Two individuals showed a correlation of genotypes higher than 0.99 (likely  duplicated or contaminated samples) and were removed  leaving 379 triploid individuals. In total  3158 diploid individuals from the parent generation were also genotyped  using either the same 56 k chip or a 220 000 SNP chip (220 k chip)  which had 52 458 (52 k) SNPs in common with the 56 k chip. Downstream analyses were performed using the 52 k common SNPs  or a subset of these. Two candidate parents had apparently duplicated genotypes  likely due to duplicated samples. After removal of duplicates  the number of individuals in the candidate parent dataset was equal to 3156. In addition  914 diploid Atlantic salmon and 116 of their previously parentage assigned parents were used to compare genotype calling methods. In total  853 of the 914 diploid offspring had both parents assigned  i.e. trios. The 914 diploids were called using both the method developed here and using Thermo Fisher’s APT software  the Affymetrix power tools (APT) []. The parents were genotyped using one of the two SNP chips described above and  thus  the same 52 458 SNPs were used in all downstream analyses. Additional details are provided in the subsection ‘’ below. Observations of  (also known as ‘Delta’) were obtained for each DNA sample from the file ‘AxiomGT1.normalized-summary.txt’  which is produced by the APT software [  ]. The  and  are the signal strengths observed by the GeneTitan instrument for the two possible alleles (called  and ) for each SNP. Thus  the possible genotypes for a given SNP are    and  for diploid and      and  for triploid individuals. The R package “mclust” [] was used for calling both diploid and triploid genotypes  fitting up to three and four genotype clusters  respectively  in a single dimension (the contrast). The clustering models assumed that the contrast is a mix of normally distributed variables  one for each genotype cluster  allowing for different expectations and variances for each cluster  depending on the model. The mclust package attempts to identify the underlying distributions by choosing the most likely out of two possible models for each genotype cluster. The two models are: (1) the ‘E’ model  in which each genotype cluster is assumed to have equal variances  and (2) the ‘V’ model  in which the genotype clusters can have different variances (see []). Not all markers will have all biologically possible clusters represented; e.g. markers of low minor allele frequency may only show the most common cluster(s). Thus  the two models are tested with the assumption that there are one  two  three  or four (for triploids only) genotype clusters in the data for a given locus. That is  for all biologically possible numbers of genotype clusters  both models (‘E’ and ‘V’) were fitted. This means that for triploid individuals  a marker could have up to four clusters (     and/or )  resulting in 4<U+2009>*<U+2009>2<U+2009>=<U+2009>8 models being tested  while for diploid individuals up to three clusters are possible (   and/or )  resulting in 3<U+2009>*<U+2009>2<U+2009>=<U+2009>6 models. The integrated complete likelihood (ICL) for all models  defined as in [] (a higher ICL is favorable)  was calculated using the mclust package. ICL was chosen rather than the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) because of its tendency to favor well-separated clusters (see “” for more information). For each number of clusters   the model with the highest ICL was saved  i.e.   where  for triploids and  for diploids. Then  the model with the highest ICL () was assumed to produce genotypes with the lowest genotype error rate and  thus  was chosen to classify the genotypes. Mclust uses the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for all models  which adjusts the parameters until the most likely set of parameters is found for each model. When no starting parameter values are set  mclust uses the mean contrast of each marker as a starting point for all possible genotype clusters in the first EM-iteration. In some cases  this may result in mclust choosing a local optimum for the parameter estimates due to  e.g. uneven numbers of individuals in the different genotype classes or DNA sample bias due to differences in DNA quality (see “”). To obtain better starting values  the initial numbers of individuals in each genotype group (  where  is the chosen number of clusters) were predicted by using a rough estimate related to the SNP allele frequency (see ). Then  initial clustering was done by sorting the individuals by contrast values and initially assigning the first  individuals to the first (left-wise) cluster   to the second cluster  etc. The contrast means of the initial clusters were set as starting values in the EM-algorithm and used as priors for the cluster means. Further details are in . In cases where all four triploid clusters are found (i.e. all genotype groups are represented for the locus in question)  the lowest cluster (with respect to contrast) is assumed to correspond to genotype   the second to genotype   etc. The same logic applies to diploids  except that there are up to three possible clusters. If three or fewer clusters are identified for triploids  the correspondence between left-to-right cluster number and genotype value is less obvious  similar to the case of diploids having two or fewer clusters. In such cases  the genotype calls are determined by the mean contrast of each cluster. Distributions of estimated mean contrast values for all markers that are predicted to have three or four clusters for diploids and triploids  respectively  are in Fig. . The estimated mean of each cluster in Fig.  is used to call genotypes for markers with less than the maximum possible number of clusters  i.e. markers with less than four clusters for triploids and less than three clusters for diploids. These estimated reference contrast means were approximately -<U+2009>1.76 (=<U+2009>)  0.16 (=<U+2009>)  and 1.94 (=<U+2009>) for diploids  and -<U+2009>1.97 (=<U+2009>)  -<U+2009>0.50 (=<U+2009>)  0.75 (=<U+2009>)  and 2.14 (=<U+2009>) for triploids. These contrast means were estimated using the entire 56 k chip  where 44 431 and 38 792 of the 56 177 SNPs had a maximum number of clusters for diploids and triploids  respectively. Mean contrasts across markers. Distribution of mean contrasts across all 56 177 markers with three (diploids  top panel) or four (triploids  bottom panel) predicted genotype clusters  as estimated by the expectation maximization method Some SNPs will not have all four (triploids) or all three (diploids) clusters because  for example  they might be fixed or have very high or very low allele frequencies. For such markers  the following approach was used: (1) retrieve the estimated mean contrast of each genotype cluster  and (2) find the closest reference contrast mean from the markers that had the maximum number of clusters (see Fig. ) and set the genotypes to be the same as for these reference clusters. However  if two or more cluster contrast means are closest to the same reference cluster  the locus will not be used (defined as no-calls). This was the case for 950 of 11 746 SNPs in the diploid group with less than three clusters and for 4041 out of 17 385 markers in the triploid group with less than four clusters. After choosing a model  the probabilities of belonging to each of the possible clusters are calculated for each contrast  and the cluster with the highest probability is chosen. The uncertainty is then the probability of the genotype belonging to any of the other clusters (1 minus the probability of belonging to the most likely cluster). If the uncertainty exceeds 0.15  the genotype value is defined as a no-call (i.e. a missing genotype). The threshold of 0.15 was chosen as this is the default threshold used by the APT software and  thus  provides a good comparison between the methods. Varying this threshold will result in different marker call rates  however we have not investigated the effects of varying this threshold on downstream analyses. In addition to our mclust implementation  genotypes of the 914 diploid individuals were also called by using standard Thermo Fisher APT software based on the following three-step procedure: step 1: DQC-step: generate dish quality check (DQC) values for each sample and exclude samples below a chosen threshold  step 2: call genotypes for all remaining samples and calculate sample call rates  and step 3: call genotypes again using only the individuals from step 2 with call rates above a chosen threshold (see [] for more background and information). Thus  individuals from step 3 have higher call rates than those from step 2. On a general basis  Thermo Fisher recommends setting the DQC threshold at 0.82 and the sample call rate threshold at 97%. However  we visually inspected the curves of ordered DQC- and call rate values  and set the threshold manually. An uncertainty value (‘confidence’ in Thermo Fisher terms) is estimated by APT for each call from each sample  which is equivalent to the uncertainty calculated by mclust. The recommended and default threshold for this uncertainty is 0.15  which is what we used both for calling with APT and mclust to provide a fair comparison of the two methods (see [] for more information). All 914 diploids had genotypes from step 3  while of the 116 known parents  104 had genotypes from step 3 and 12 from step 2. The 914 diploid individuals were genotyped using both APT and mclust with two goals in mind: (1) to compare the genotype calling accuracy between the two methods  and (2) to investigate if a threshold on absolute  or  could be used to identify high-quality markers with reduced genotyping errors  where   i.e.  is the difference in  between the two most likely numbers of genotype clusters (for the best model of each cluster number). Exclusion ratios (ER) between offspring and known parents were used as the main statistic for benchmarking the methods  in addition to some other support statistics (see “”). Exclusions are Mendelian mismatches between offspring and parent(s)  and the ER is the number of exclusions between an offspring and its parent(s) divided by the number of SNPs where the genotypes are called for both offspring and parent(s). See Tables  and  for an overview of the combinations of genotypes between trios that were regarded as exclusions when offspring are diploid and triploid  respectively. Given the sex of triploid parents  additional erroneous genotypes can be identified using the maternal-specific inheritance to triploid offspring (see Table ). Of the 914 diploid offspring  853 had both parents known. Thus  genotypes were called for 914 offspring  but comparisons using exclusion ratios were based on 853 known trios. For the triploid offspring  304 known trios were used (see text regarding parentage assignment and parental sex prediction of triploids in “” and “” sections). The fraction of parents to triploids represented in the data was unknown. An exclusion-based approach was used to assign diploid parents to triploid offspring. Neither triploid nor diploid offspring can be opposite homozygotes (i.e. have exclusions) relative to their true parents through Mendelian inheritance of alleles. For example  a parent with genotype  at a given SNP cannot have offspring with genotype  (diploid)/ (triploid) at that SNP. However  since genotype errors can occur  a relatively small number of exclusions should be expected even in true parent–offspring pairs. The expected number of exclusions between an offspring and a non-parent individual depends on their genomic relationship  i.e. greater relatedness between individuals usually means a smaller number of exclusions. ER was used for parentage assignment instead of the number of exclusions to account for variation in individual call rates due to differences in DNA quality. Only markers for which triploid  and with parent call rates ><U+2009>95% were used in the parentage assignment. ER were calculated for each pair of offspring and candidate parent. An assignment ER-threshold of 0.002 for offspring–candidate duos was applied  which means that all candidate parents with ER below this threshold for an offspring were assumed the true parents. See “”  for more detailed information regarding the choice of ER threshold. When using pressure-shock induced triploidy in fish  the offspring receives two sets of chromosomes from the mother and a single set from the father (see “” section). As a result  certain genotypes are not possible for a true mother of the offspring but are possible for the true father. For example  a triploid offspring with marker genotype  implies that the true mother should have at least one allele   i.e. the true mother cannot have genotype  at that marker. Likewise  if the offspring has a marker genotype of   the true mother cannot have genotype . In contrast  true father and offspring can have any genotype combination  except opposing homozygotes. Using this information  true mothers and fathers can be distinguished. The “mother-specific exclusions” were used along with opposing homozygotes to construct mother exclusion ratios  coined ‘mother.ER’  which was calculated by dividing the number of mother exclusions by the number of markers for which both the offspring and the candidate mother had called genotypes. In addition  ER from non-mother-specific exclusions were also used when constructing the ‘mother.ER’ shown in our results. The same markers were used to calculate candidate ‘mother.ER’  as was used in parentage assignment (see above). By pressure induced triploidy  the second polar body is not extruded during Meiosis II []. This implies that the sister chromatids formed during Meiosis I in the mother are still found within the ovum  along with the alleles passed down by the father  making the cell triploid. The sister chromatids passed down from the mother are identical  except for any recombinations that might have occurred during prophase I []. For markers for which the father is homozygous ( or )  the paternal allele state (i.e. a single  or ) of the offspring can be deduced  implying that maternal inheritance at that locus can also be deduced. Thus  markers for which the father is homozygous and the mother heterozygous can be used to map maternal crossovers with high accuracy given a relatively high density of such markers for multiple known offspring–mother–father trios. At the centromere  recombination is suppressed  and two identical alleles are thus inherited from the mother. On each chromosome arm  the maternally inherited alleles shift from homozygotes to heterozygotes at the location of the first crossover. A second maternal crossover (further away from the centromere) will cause the maternal alleles to shift back from heterozygous to homozygous. Hence  the triploid offspring genotypes can be used to study the recombination patterns of different chromosomes  simply by comparing genotypes of diploid parents and triploid offspring  without phasing of genotypes. This method of recombination mapping is essentially the same as gene-centromere mapping in gynogenetic diploids []  except that induced triploids do have paternal inheritance  which is lacking in gynogenetic diploids. In total  304 trios of triploid offspring with assigned mothers and fathers were used to estimate maternal recombination rates. To retain the majority of the markers and still have high enough marker quality to interpret the downstream results  we chose a  threshold of 50 and marker call rate thresholds of 0.80 for the triploid offspring and 0.95 for diploid parents. Each marker had to be mapped to a given chromosome and have at least 50 trios with informative genotypes (i.e. homozygous father and heterozygous mother). This resulted in 27 130 informative markers with a maternal recombination estimate (see Fig. ). The markers used were placed on the ICSASG_v2 Atlantic salmon genome reference assembly [  ]. Without filtering SNPs  the numbers of SNPs for diploid offspring predicted to have one  two  or three clusters were 155  3970 and 48 333  respectively  when using APT and 2008  7534 and 42 916  respectively  when using mclust. For each SNP called by mclust  there were two possible models: heterogenous and homogenous cluster variance. The heterogenous cluster variance model was chosen for 68% of the SNPs for diploids and for 49% of the SNPs for triploids. Using mclust  the numbers of SNPs for triploid offspring predicted to have a single  two  three  or four clusters were 3149  3528  10 708  and 38 792  respectively. Of the 9542 SNPs with less than three clusters called by mclust for diploids and that were used in downstream analyses  724 were given 100% no-calls  due to insufficient separation of clusters (see subsection “New genotype calling method” in “”). For triploids  there were 3620 such markers. Figure  shows indicator statistics of mclust marker calling quality in diploids for different thresholds of . Increasing  resulted in a lower ratio of SNPs with one or two clusters for diploids  while the ratio of SNPs with three clusters increased. Furthermore  the ratio of Mendelian errors (ER) decreased as  increased  indicating that increasing the threshold for  improves calling quality. This was supported by the decreasing ratio of missing genotypes (‘NoCalls’)  which indicates that higher thresholds for  results in retaining SNPs that have good separation of genotype clusters  i.e. SNPs with a low call uncertainty. The red horizontal lines in Fig.  show the values achieved by using the genotype calls from APT with all SNPs included in the analyses. APT achieved fewer Mendelian errors (ER) and fewer missing genotypes (‘NoCalls’) than our mclust implementation when all SNPs were used. Mclust needs a  threshold of ~<U+2009>110 to obtain similar levels of ER and no-calls as APT  which resulted in the use of ~<U+2009>7500 fewer SNPs. Effect of varying the  threshold for marker selection. Statistics for diploid offspring/parent trios when varying the  threshold for marker selection when genotypes are called by the mclust algorithm. ‘1 cluster’  ‘2 clusters’ and ‘3 clusters’ show the percentage of markers predicted to have one  two  and three clusters. ‘ER’ is the exclusion ratio shown in percent for trios. ‘NoCalls’ is the percentage of missing genotypes and ‘Removed markers’ shows the number of markers which are removed. The horizontal red lines show the values found for ‘ER’ and ‘NoCalls’ when using genotype calls from APT Figure  shows the same statistics as Fig.  after removing SNPs below an  threshold (note: not )  i.e. a threshold on the  of the most likely model. All investigated  thresholds result in higher ER and NoCalls than was achieved by APT without SNP quality filtering. Because the variability of ER and no-calls seemed erratic  we decided not to use  as a marker quality filtering statistic in downstream analyses.

Markers with red  green  cyan and purple indicate 1  2  3 and 4 predicted genotype clusters  respectively  while the gray bars shows the total number of markers for each value of  The QC filtering of SNPs for parentage assignment based on triploid  and parent call rates ><U+2009>95% resulted in retaining 35  375  238  and 13 258 SNPs with one  two  three  and four genotype clusters  respectively  which resulted in the use of 13 906 SNPs for this parentage assignment. The ER between offspring and their first  second  third  and less likely candidate parents are shown in the top panel of Fig.   while the bottom panel zooms in on the best fitting parent candidates. The lowest ER between all triploid offspring and their third most likely candidate parent (i.e. the closest-fitting non-parent) was ~<U+2009>0.003. Consequently  a 0.002 assignment threshold for offspring–candidate duos was applied  which also fitted well  based on visual inspection of Fig. . In other words  the candidate parent in any duo with an ER<U+2009><<U+2009>0.002 was assigned and assumed to be a true parent. At least one parent was assigned to all 379 triploids  and 304 were assigned both parents. Lacking assignments were likely due to genotypes of some parents being absent in the dataset. Triploid exclusion ratios. Exclusion ratios (ER) for duos of triploid offspring and diploid parents are shown for the duos with lowest ER (red)  second-lowest ER (green)  third-lowest ER (turquoise) and 2000 randomly sampled ER from fourth lowest and above (purple) A similar procedure as for parentage assignment was used for assignment of mothers of triploid offspring  using the mother exclusion ratios (‘mother.ER’). Figure  shows the ‘mother.ER’ between assigned  unassigned  and random pairs of offspring–parent candidates (note that ‘Assigned’ in Fig.  is for parentage assignment  not mother assignment). The minimum ‘mother.ER’ of the third-best parental candidates was ~<U+2009>0.022  thus we set the ‘mother.ER’ assignment threshold at 0.02. Any assigned parent with a ‘mother.ER’<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02 was assigned as mother  and any assigned parent with ‘mother.ER’<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02 was assumed to be the true father. This resulted in 58 assigned mothers and 65 assigned fathers. No mothers were assigned as fathers  or vice versa. In total  304 offspring were assigned both their mother and father (the same as the two parents assigned above)  14 were assigned a mother only  and 61 were assigned a father only (i.e. as above  all individuals were assigned a father  a mother  or both). No offspring were assigned two apparent mothers or two apparent fathers. Triploid maternal exclusion ratios. Maternal exclusion ratios (mother.ER) for duos of triploid offspring and diploid candidate mothers are shown for the assigned (green) and unassigned (maroon) duos and 2000 generated ‘mother.ER’ values from randomly sampled parent candidates  i.e. both sampling males and females which can possibly be true mothers (grey) In addition to the  threshold statistic explored above  marker call rate is another marker quality statistic that is often employed when analyzing genotype datasets. Marker call rate is related to ICL  as both call rate and ICL use call uncertainty as a measure of marker quality.  provides a probabilistic penalization of the mixture model likelihood []  whereas marker call rate is the fraction of genotypes that fall below a pre-defined uncertainty threshold. We chose the uncertainty threshold of 0.15  i.e. all genotype calls above this threshold were defined as no-calls (missing genotypes) for both triploid offspring and diploid parents. Table  shows that increasing either the marker call rate threshold or the  threshold tended to decrease Mendelian errors  i.e. decrease the ER  but also increased the number of removed markers. Note that  for the parents  we always used a marker call rate threshold of 95%. Figure  shows the estimated maternal recombination fraction along each of the 29 chromosomes in the Atlantic salmon genome by looking at where the triploid offspring inherited the homozygous (/) or heterozygous () allele from the mother (see “”). The region with the lowest maternal recombination fraction on each chromosome was at the centromere  where recombination is known to be suppressed. In []  chromosome 8 was reported to be metacentric  but in Fig.  it appears as acrocentric or telocentric. However  the p-arm of chromosome 8 contains highly repetitive regions and  therefore  few or no markers from this region may be represented on the SNP chip (personal communication with S Lien  see also []). Triploid maternal recombination events. The fraction of heterozygous ( and ) alleles inherited from mothers for informative loci along each of the 29 chromosomes in Atlantic salmon. The x-axis is marker position on each chromosome and is scaled by chromosome size. All markers are required to have at least 50 trios with informative genotypes Sterile triploid Atlantic salmon have been produced for decades and differences in traits between the triploid and diploid Atlantic salmon have been observed []. To assign parentage  to identify population background  or to perform any kind of genetic analysis of triploids with genotype data requires methods for genotype calling in triploid individuals. Calling SNP genotypes using sequencing data relies on the number of alleles that is called at a certain locus  and to know how this pattern varies for the two homozygous and the different heterozygous genotype groups [  ]. Conceptually  this differs from calling genotypes based on the aggregated light signal created by the Thermo Fisher GeneTitan instrument  as investigated here  because each allele has already been called in the sequence data. To the best of our knowledge  no official software for calling triploid genotypes using output from the Thermo Fisher GeneTitan instrument currently exists. However  software for polyploid genotyping has been created by other groups  such as the R package fitPoly [  ]. We chose to use mclust due to our familiarity with its functionality and its substantial documentation  frequent updates  and extensive use. Both mclust and fitPoly use mixture models and the EM algorithm to estimate parameters. Thus  fitPoly and mclust implementations may give similar results but significant differences cannot be ruled out. See “” subsection below for more discussion on this. However  a comparison between mclust and fitPoly was outside the scope of this study. In []  Serang et al. use graphical Bayesian modelling to incorporate information on population allele frequencies or parental genotypes into the model to achieve increased genotype calling accuracy. Although we did not use information on allele frequencies or parental genotypes  this information could be used to increase the accuracy of the genotype calling  as shown in []. However  we estimated starting values for the EM algorithm and priors for the cluster means based on a rough estimate of allele frequencies (see ). Another approach could be to correct genotypes by using allele frequency information after genotype calling has been performed. Unlike in []  offspring and parents were not called using the same method in our dataset. If any bias in the calling procedures used by APT or mclust exists  it can lead to incorrectly assuming that there are fewer Mendelian inconsistencies when calling genotypes using APT in both parents and offspring  as opposed to calling parents with APT and triploid offspring with mclust. We have not investigated whether this is the case in our dataset. Although we focused on Atlantic salmon  the method can be extended to other polyploid species  e.g. in plants []. Genotypes were called in both triploid and diploid offspring through Gaussian finite mixture modelling using the EM algorithm  implemented in the R package mclust. The R packages fitTetra 1.0 [] and fitTetra 2.0 [] were developed by the same group that developed the fitPoly package [  ]  and they all use the same underlying EM-based algorithm for genotype calling. However  fitTetra 1.0/2.0 are limited to calling tetraploid genotypes only. Both fitTetra 1.0/2.0 [  ] and fitPoly [  ] assume a common variance for all genotype clusters for a marker by transforming the intensity signal ratios to obtain approximately constant variance. Our implementation runs two models for each marker  one model that assumes equal variance and another model that allows for heterogeneous variance of the clusters  where the model with the highest ICL value is assumed to be the best. With our implementation  it seems that both models are useful  as 68 and 49% of the markers had heterogenous cluster variance for diploids and triploids  respectively. The reason for the difference between rate of markers with heterogenous cluster variance between diploids and triploids is unknown  but it can be hypothesized that the increased overlap of clusters in triploids causes mclust to prefer the heterogenous cluster variance model. Both fitTetra 1.0 and 2.0 use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to score models. However  genotype clusters are well separated for markers with high quality  which harmonizes well with the ability of ICL to penalize models with a low degree of cluster separation []. Variation in DNA quality in a sample dataset can affect the signal intensities from DNA hybridizing with the probes on the SNP chip [  ]. This can result in clusters being distributed non-Gaussian. The algorithm can fit additional Gaussian clusters to account for violations of model assumptions []. Hence  the number of fitted clusters can exceed the number of biological genotype groups. Biernacki et al. [] showed that BIC tends to overestimate the number of clusters when the model fits the data poorly. Since genotype clusters are expected to have different contrast means (i.e. separated clusters)  and since factors such as heterogeneous sample quality can result in model assumptions to be violated  we chose ICL over BIC as a model selection criterion. All genotype calls were given an estimate of uncertainty based on the probability of the genotype belonging to another cluster than that with the highest probability. The threshold for this was set to 0.15  which means that all genotypes with an uncertainty ><U+2009>0.15 were no-calls (i.e. missing genotypes). Decreasing the threshold for uncertainty would decrease the call rate of each marker and  thus  the number of markers used in downstream analyses. In our opinion  results from the downstream analysis indicate that the genotype calling method was appropriate and gave reliable and trustworthy results. Salmonids have been through several genome duplication events and their genomes are in a state of re-diploidization from the last genome duplication event  which resulted in a tetraploid genome []. That is  different regions of the Atlantic salmon genome are still in a tetraploid state. When creating SNP chips for such a genome  it is necessary to ensure that the SNP is in a region of the genome that is not duplicated  or that the SNP is in a tetraploid region where only one of the homologues is polymorphic for the SNP (“semi-fixed”). Having markers targeting “semi-fixed” SNPs can complicate the calling procedure because shifts in contrasts can be observed. For example  for a “semi-fixed” SNP with possible genotypes //  the contrast for the marker targeting this SNP can be shifted towards the right (i.e. towards the ‘’-allele). Furthermore  hybridization affinity between the probes on the SNP chip may not be equal for the - and -alleles  which can also result in shifts of contrasts for the genotype. The problem of duplicated regions and/or differences in allele affinity for hybridizing with the probe is expected to be worse in triploids. Tetraploid regions in diploids become hexaploid regions in triploids  potentially resulting in more severe shifts in allele affinity compared to normal diploids (or tetraploids). In addition  since triploids have two heterozygote groups  there is an elevated risk of overlap between the clusters (see Fig. ). We did not investigate to what degree any of the SNPs on our chip were affected by such semi-fixed SNPs. APT uses the BRLMM-P algorithm  which was developed by Affymetrix (now Thermo Fisher) []. Many elements of the BRLMM-P algorithm are similar to the current implementation of mclust  e.g. estimation of contrast cluster means and variances and use of priors. However  one key aspect that differentiates APT from the mclust implementation is the use of covariances between different cluster means []. Currently  software limitations prevent this from being implemented with mclust. Another difference is that APT provides uncertainty estimates for each genotype call from markers that have only one genotype class (e.g. monomorphic markers within dataset)  while mclust does not. Thus  no-calls are produced for such markers by APT but not by mclust. Although possible  we did not investigate implementing this in mclust. This could account for some of the increase in ER when the  threshold is low  since the fraction of markers with one cluster was increased (Fig. ). Figure  shows the distribution of estimated mean contrasts in each of the four genotype clusters for markers with three/four (for diploids/triploids) predicted clusters. Note that these distributions are across all markers (containing many different marker clusters skewed in different directions)  and therefore there is more overlap between clusters than would be the case for individual markers. There was also some evidence for a widening of the contrast space from diploids to triploids  i.e. the contrast cluster means ranged from -<U+2009>1.76 (=<U+2009>) to 1.94 (=<U+2009>) for diploids and from -<U+2009>1.97 (=<U+2009>) to 2.14 (=<U+2009>) in triploids. All DNA extractions were normalized to the same concentration  so the reason for this difference in range is not known. However  normalization of DNA concentration is not only based on the initial concentration of DNA  but also on the concentration of other components such as protein  which may result in a higher final DNA concentration for the triploids. In any case  the contrast means  as expected  overlapped more in triploids than in diploids because of the two heterozygote clusters  making it more difficult to distinguish between clusters. Figure  shows the distribution of  for markers with one to four predicted clusters for triploid individuals. The markers that had four predicted clusters seemed to be able to achieve higher  than what was possible with fewer predicted clusters. Markers with three or less biological clusters are expected to have low minor allele frequencies (MAF). For such markers  the number of observations within some of the clusters is likely very small  making estimates of cluster parameters less precise  and thus limiting ICL due to uncertain clustering. APT uses pre-determined priors for means and variances  with equal priors for all markers as default. These priors were also used in the current study. A small fraction of the induced triploids is expected to have failed triploidization. If any of the individuals assumed to be triploid are in fact diploid  calling accuracy is expected to decrease. However  the presence of diploids in the triploid dataset was deemed unlikely in this study  as inspection of (transformed) allele strength distributions revealed four distinct clusters for all individuals that were assumed to be triploids (see “”). To compare our mclust implementation with APT  we called the same diploid offspring with both mclust and APT. In Fig.   it is clear that  without marker quality filtering  APT achieved lower Mendelian error rates compared to our implementation of mclust. When markers were filtered based on   around 7 to 8000 markers had to be removed before Mendelian error rates achieved with mclust and APT were comparable. Figure  also shows that  without marker quality filtering  the percentage of missing genotypes (no-calls) was higher for mclust than for APT. Knowing the parents’ sex enabled us to identify more Mendelian exclusions for triploid offspring (see Table ) than for diploid offspring (see Table ). As a result  exclusion rates for diploid and triploid offspring could not be directly compared. Higher error rates are expected in triploids due to more overlapping genotype clusters (e.g. Fig. ). Because of this  the genotype error rate (or e.g. ER) should be estimated separately for triploids. We used APT to call the parents of both triploid and diploid offspring. Consequently  there may exist bias in favor of APT. Hence  mclust may appear to give more mismatches than APT between genotypes of offspring and parents (always called with APT)  which would affect the estimated Mendelian error rate (ER) for both diploid- and triploid offspring. A threshold of  was chosen to retain high-quality markers for parentage assignment of diploid parents to triploid offspring. This arbitrarily large number was chosen to ensure that accurate parentage assignment was used in downstream analyses. Note that the threshold of  was only used for parentage assignment of the triploids  not in downstream analyses  where other thresholds were investigated and chosen. The fact that parentage could be assigned to a substantial number of triploid offspring with clear differences in exclusion rates for assigned parents compared to non-assigned parents is an indication that the calling of triploid genotypes was successful. Parent sex prediction  comparisons between our implementation and APT  and mapping of maternal recombinations  all depend on correct parentage assignment. This is another indication that both the triploid genotyping and parentage assignment were successful and accurate. Applying an ER-threshold of 0.002 worked well in this dataset but may not be applicable in all situations (it may depend on  e.g. the SNP chip  genotype errors  or relatedness between individuals in the sample). The ER-threshold should be set lower than the minimum ER of the third most likely candidate for all duos (assuming that duplicates or clones of parental DNA are not present in the data). Furthermore  (visual) inspection of the ER distribution is required to locate the probable region of true parental ER’s. Parentage assignment using high-density SNP genotypes and exclusions (opposing homozygotes) is frequently used for parentage assignment of diploid offspring (e.g. [  ]). Parentage assignment in triploid Pacific oyster () offspring with diploid mothers and autotetraploid fathers was performed by Miller et al. [] using microsatellite markers. Nonetheless  we are not aware of any case where triploid offspring have been assigned diploid parents using high-density SNP data. Accurately identifying sex in salmonids using genotypes is not trivial [  ]. In pressure-induced triploids  the fact that mothers contribute two alleles to their offspring and fathers one allele can be used to separate the already assigned parents into mothers and fathers. Two assigned “mothers” or “fathers” indicate a false assignment  either by incorrectly assuming triploidy in diploid offspring or by duplicated parental samples. In our analysis  all assigned parents were consistently assigned as either fathers or mothers across all triploid offspring. Since the parent candidate dataset included closely-related individuals  several candidates were likely closely related with the true parents. Close relatives of the mother will have a high fraction of genotypes that resemble the genotypes of the true mother  which gives such candidates relatively low ‘mother.ER’  even compared with the true father (Fig. ). In the ER-based parentage assignment (Fig. )  sex of the parent was not considered. Still  we observed some differences in ER between the sexes  with lower average ER for mother–offspring pairs. This may be explained by the fact that the mother contributes two alleles and the father one allele. For example  if the true mother has genotype   the triploid offspring can have genotypes  and . In contrast  a true  father can have triploid offspring with genotypes    and . The latter genotype is more likely to be misinterpreted as  (see Fig. )  generating a false exclusion genotype. Figure  shows an increase in maternal recombination rates when moving away from the predicted centromeric region for all 29 chromosomes []. By visual inspection  the centromeric regions for the most part aligned well with what was reported by Lien et al. []. However  chromosome 8 was reported to be metacentric in []  while we observed it to be acrocentric or telocentric probably due to a lack of markers on the p-arm of chromosome 8  see “”. Figure  shows that inheritance of maternal alleles was highly dependent on the distance between the locus and the centromere. For loci that are heterozygous in the mother and close to the centromere  the offspring usually inherited two identical maternal alleles  while for loci far from the centromere the offspring usually inherited two different maternal alleles. Thus  the inherited alleles are not expected to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Estimating the number and position of recombinations is possible for each individual mother by searching for transitions from homozygous to heterozygous maternal inheritance. Figure  shows the fraction of offspring that inherited heterozygous alleles from the mother at different positions along each chromosome (only informative genotypes were included  i.e. heterozygous mother and homozygous father). There were signs of interference for all chromosomes in Fig. . Under a model of no interference  secondary recombinations on the chromosome arms would frequently occur. Instead  all chromosomes showed a rapid increase in the fraction of heterozygous maternal alleles when moving away from the centromere  with little indication of secondary recombination (which would result in homozygous inheritance of maternal alleles). For some of the bigger acrocentric chromosomes  the maternally inherited heterozygous fraction approached 1 before it started to decline. This was most prominent for chromosome 9 and might suggest that interference was affected by distance from the last recombination event. Since induction of triploidy by pressurization occurs after prophase  the pattern of recombination should not be different when ordinary oocytes are formed for haploid inheritance of alleles. Because this study focused on genotyping polyploids  and specifically triploids  further investigations on the implications of maternal recombinations were deemed outside the scope of the current study. Other ways of producing triploid individuals are possible  such as mating tetraploids with diploids [  ]. In such cases  the methods used here for genotype calling and ER-based parentage assignment can still be used (given that genotypes can be called for the tetraploid parent)  but the methods used here for parent sex detection and mapping of recombination events are not necessarily applicable. We have developed a technique for genotyping triploid individuals using allele signals from the Thermo Fisher GeneTitan genotyping platform  or other platforms that use light intensity for estimating the allele hybridization ratio. Using the called triploid genotypes  diploid parents could be assigned to induced triploid offspring and sex of the assigned parents could be predicted. No a priori information about the parents was needed  except their genotype information (not including any sex-linked markers). Furthermore  the genotypes of triploid offspring and their assigned parents were used to map maternal recombination events along the chromosomes. The methods and results of this study can be used for further genetic analyses (genomic prediction  genome-wide association studies) of phenotypic traits recorded in triploids as well as their genetic covariance with phenotypic traits recorded in diploids.

In the first iteration of the expectation maximization (EM) procedure  the overall mean for each variable is normally used as starting parameters for  by mclust []. In our experience  this may lead to incorrect classifications  and informative starting parameters and priors can be used to increase classification accuracy. As with APT  the contrast variable was deemed the most informative with respect to genotype classification  and informative starting values and prior parameters were thus estimated for this variable. Assuming that DNA is sampled from random individuals in a population  the number and size of clusters depend on the allele frequency of the marker. For example  if the allele frequency of allele  is 50%  in diploids  we would expect to see equally-sized clusters for the two opposing homozygotes ( and ) and a heterozygote  cluster with twice the size of either the - or the -cluster. If the minor allele frequency is low  some genotype classes may be absent from the data  leading to a reduced number of clusters. As discussed in the main text  the maternal inheritance of alleles for induced triploid offspring depends on the maternal recombination rate. This may result in genotype groups not strictly adhering to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. However  it should still be better to have slightly imprecise starting estimates and priors compared to using the overall contrast mean as the starting point for all genotype clusters. When estimating informative priors and starting parameters for mclust for a defined number of possible cluster classes (e.g.  in triploids)  the number of individuals in cluster class C (i.e. having genotype C) approximately follows a binomial distribution: where  is the success probability (affected by the allele frequency  but not necessarily equivalent to it). A priori  the  parameter is unknown  but can be roughly estimated from normalized contrast values : where  is the contrast value for the marker obtained from the Thermo Fisher genotyping platform for an individual   is the maximum and  is the minimum contrast values for the marker. Each SNP on the chip is a collection of probes. The light signal produced when the different alleles are hybridized with probes for a single marker on the SNP chip can reach maximum intensity when 100% of the probes are hybridized. However  it is not certain that 100% of the probes hybridize with alleles  and thus the contrast range may vary. By transforming the contrast range such that the normalized contrasts are in the range between 0 and 1  we are able to use  as the success parameter in a binomial distribution. From this  we can roughly estimate the number of genotypes in each genotype class as: where  is total number of individuals genotyped for this marker and  is the binomial probability of observing  successes in  trials with success probability . For the marker in question  contrast values were then sorted from smallest to largest  and the first  observations were used to estimate   the next  observations were used to estimate   etc. Finally   was used as both an input starting parameter vector and a prior by mclust for the contrast cluster means (corresponds to  in []). A vector of  was used as starting proportions. All initial and prior variance parameters (see text regarding  in []) were set to 0.06 since this is also the prior variance used by the APT software and should provide a good comparison of the methods. Both the means and the variances are updated in every iteration of the EM-algorithm  ending with the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The models assume a normal distribution for each cluster with different means. For the models ‘E’ (equal) and ‘V’ (varying)  the variances are either equal or different  respectively  for all clusters.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MAP status of 1644 Holstein and 649 Normande cows  using either two (controls versus cases) or three classes of phenotype (controls  non-clinical and clinical cases)  revealed three regions  on  (BTA) chromosomes 12  13  and 23  presenting significant effects in Holstein cows  while only one of those was identified in Normande cows (BTA23). The most significant effect was found on BTA13  in a short 8.5-kb region. Conditional analyses revealed that only one causal variant may be responsible for the effects observed on each chromosome with the  (BTA12)   (BTA13)  and  (BTA23) genes as good functional candidates.ConclusionsA sequence-based GWAS on cows for which resistance to MAP was accurately defined  was able to identify candidate variants located in genes that were functionally related to resistance to MAP; these explained up to 28% of the genetic variance of the trait.

These results are very encouraging for efforts towards implementation of a breeding strategy aimed at improving resistance to paratuberculosis in Holstein cows. Paratuberculosis  also referred to as Johne’s disease (JD)  is an infectious  contagious  and incurable disease caused by  subsp.  (MAP). Worldwide  no country is known to be free of MAP; it primarily affects domestic ruminants  and a high bovine herd prevalence (up to 50%) has been reported in Europe []. In cattle  while adult-to-calf transmission is possible in utero or via contaminated colostrum or milk  the main route of transmission occurs via the uptake of MAP-infected feces by calves. After a transient phase of shedding  calves undergo a latency phase that can last for several months or years. Subclinical symptoms of the disease include weight loss and reduced milk production together with a humoral immune response and fecal shedding; because of this  subclinical cases may continue to contaminate their environment for years. Clinical cases finally develop chronic diarrhea and severe emaciation  ending in death. Thus  JD has substantial adverse effects on animal welfare as well as a detrimental economic impact on the cattle sector []. There are no effective treatment protocols and vaccination (which provides only partial protection) is limited because it can induce a false positive reaction at the intradermal test used for tuberculosis detection []. For this reason  several countries have initiated programs for the control of JD with the objective of reducing MAP contamination  mainly by testing animals  culling seropositive animals and preventing the exposure of calves  which are the most susceptible animals in infected farms []. However  these programs have a high cost and a limited efficiency in clearing MAP mainly because of the disease’s long periods of latency (from infection to seropositive conversion or fecal shedding) and incubation (from infection to clinical symptoms) []. These periods also vary greatly among individuals  as does the amount of bacteria shed by infected cattle  which suggests the existence of individual variability in resistance to MAP. As recently reviewed by Brito et al. []  various studies have shown the role of host genetics in resistance to MAP and have estimated heritability values for this trait between 0.03 and 0.27. In addition  numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted using genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at low []  medium [      ]  or high [    ] densities as well as whole-genome sequences [  ] imputed from data of the 1000 Bull Genomes project []. These GWAS analyses have led to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance/susceptibility to MAP on all  (BTA) autosomes  with the most frequently identified QTL located on BTA1  6  7  and 23. Unfortunately  the results of genetic analyses (heritability estimates and QTL identification) differ quite a bit among published studies. These inconsistencies may arise from multiple factors such as differences in the population analyzed  disease prevalence in the population  the statistical model applied  and the definition used for the MAP-resistant phenotype. The studies mentioned above generally defined phenotypes based on a single measurement of serum ELISA  milk ELISA  MAP culture in feces or tissue  or PCR on feces  which may result in an incorrect diagnosis due to (i) the lack of sensitivity of these tests []  (ii) the lack of concordance between ELISA and fecal culture tests []  (iii) the potential misidentification of unexposed individuals as resistant  and (iv) variability in longitudinal serological and fecal shedding patterns among animals []. To avoid these drawbacks  the present work was designed as a case–control study based on confirmed phenotypes. Only confirmed positive or negative individuals were included  based on the criteria previously defined from a longitudinal study of MAP fecal shedding and serological patterns in dairy cattle []. To avoid a putative bias of non-exposure  the negative animals were born in the same herd and in the same period as the positive animals. In total  1644 Holstein and 649 Normande cows with relevant and accurate contrasted phenotypic profiles (control and non-clinical/clinical cases) were genotyped with a medium-density SNP chip (50 K SNP); whole-genome sequences (WGS) were subsequently imputed using the 1000 Bull Genomes reference population (run6) []. Here  we present the results obtained from GWAS analyses conducted in both Holstein and Normande cows on the imputed WGS datasets. Animals of certified parentage were recruited from 2034 French herds enrolled in paratuberculosis control plans. From these herds  mainly located in the northwestern region of France (Fig. )  cows were recruited based on their serological status. Serum samples were analyzed by ELISA (Idexx  Montpellier  France  or Idvet  Montpellier  France). Based on a prior study []  tests were considered positive if the S/P value (sample optical density over positive control optical density  as a percentage) was 90% or higher  and negative if S/P was lower than 45% (Idexx) or 60% (Idvet). For each cow  at least two ELISA tests were carried out  with at least 8 months between the tests. Strict conditions had to be met for negative cows to be included as controls. They had to be at least 48 months old  to exclude animals still in the latency period. In addition  only cows born in the same herd and the same period (±<U+2009>1.5 months) as affected cows were retained  in order to maximize the potential for exposure to MAP. All animals with conflicting results were removed from the analysis. All cows that presented concordant serological statuses  either positive or negative  were then subjected to additional standardized ELISA and PCR analyses in a single laboratory (Laboratoire Départemental du Bas-Rhin  LD67  Strasbourg  France) with the same test kits throughout the experiment (Idexx for serology; Adiagene (Saint Brieuc  France) for PCR MAP quantification in the feces); an animal was only retained if its subclinical status or control phenotype was confirmed. Cows were considered to be shedders if the qPCR threshold cycle (C) was 35 or less  and non-shedders if it was 40 or more. All samples with intermediate results (35<U+2009><<U+2009>C<U+2009><<U+2009>40) were considered to be of uncertain status and were excluded from the study. Regarding the Elisa test  the threshold of 45 was used. Both tests had to provide concordant results. Based on these requirements  1465 control cows were confirmed and 658 were eliminated; and 1138 subclinical cases were confirmed and 580 were eliminated. In addition  clinical cases (245 Holstein and 74 Normande) were identified by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by the presence of MAP in feces. Finally  following this rigorous protocol  the statuses of 2453 cows (1759 Holstein and 694 Normande)  for which well conserved blood samples were available for DNA extraction  were confirmed as positive non-clinical or clinical cases or negative controls. These phenotypes were coded in subsequent analyses in one of two ways: (i) 0/1/2 for controls  non-clinical cases  and clinical cases  respectively  and (ii) 0/1 for controls and cases (non-clinical and clinical)  respectively. Locations of herds enrolled in control plans and number of cows recruited Animals with confirmed phenotypes were genotyped using the BovineSNP50 (50 K  Illumina Inc.  San Diego) Beadchip. After quality control  43 801 autosomal SNPs were retained. The filters used were those applied in the French national evaluation system []: individual call rate higher than 95%  SNP call rate higher than 90%  minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 1% in at least one major French dairy cattle breed  and genotype frequencies in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with ><U+2009>10. Animals that were incompatible with their parents (when all genotypes were available) were excluded. In the end  2293 cows (1644 Holstein and 649 Normande) were kept for the genetic study (Table ). Then  the 50 K SNP genotypes were imputed to whole-genome sequences (WGS). A two-step approach was applied in order to improve the accuracy of imputed genotypes of the WGS variants []: from 50 to 777 K high-density (HD) SNPs using FImpute software []  and then from imputed HD SNPs to WGS  using the Minimac software []. In spite of a longer computing time  Minimac was preferred to FImpute for the imputation of WGS because it infers allele dosages in addition to the best-guess genotypes. Compared to best-guess genotypes  allele dosages are expected to be more correlated to the true genotypes [] and to lead to better targeting of causative mutations in GWAS analyses []. Imputations from 50 K to the HD SNP level were performed using within-breed reference sets of 776 Holstein and 546 Normande bulls that were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) []. WGS variants were imputed from HD SNP genotypes using WGS of 2333  animals  from the 6th run of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project [  ]. These animals represent 51 cattle breeds and include 544 Holstein and 44 Normande individuals. In the Normande breed  the number of animals with whole-genome sequences was rather limited but we identified most of them as influential ancestor bulls with a high cumulated contribution to the breed (74%). We applied the protocol described in [] and produced 23 781 173 and 23 610 986 autosomal variants for the Holstein and Normande cows  respectively. The precision of imputation from HD SNP to sequence level was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R) calculated with the Minimac software []. In order to remove variants with low imputation accuracies  only variants with an R value higher than 30% and a MAF higher than 1% were retained for further association analyses  i.e. 7 914 731 and 7 673 760 variants for Holstein and Normande  respectively  with a mean R close to 81% (R classes between 30 and 80% included a limited number of variants). We performed single-trait association analyses between all variants and the MAP resistance/susceptibility phenotypes (0/1/2 and 0/1). All association analyses were performed using the  option of the GCTA software (version 1.24)  which applies a mixed linear model that includes the variant to be tested []. The categorical nature of the phenotype (2 or 3 classes) was not accounted for in this model assuming a normal distribution. where  is the vector of individual phenotypes;  is the overall mean;  is the additive fixed effect of the variant to be tested for association;  is the vector of predicted allele dosages  varying between 0 and 2;  is the vector of random polygenic effects  with  the genomic relationship matrix (GRM) that is calculated by using the HD SNP genotypes []  and  the polygenic variance that is estimated based on the null model  and then fixed while testing for the association between each variant and the trait of interest; and  is the vector of random residual effects  with  the identity matrix and  the residual variance. No other fixed effect was included in the model. Indeed  because of the experimental design  it was not possible to test the usual factors of variation such as herd effect (only a few selected records retained per herd) or effects of age or season. In order to account for multiple testing  we estimated the number of independent chromosome segments  by applying the formula of Goddard []   with   the effective population size and   the length of the genome in Morgans. We assumed that five SNPs were needed to saturate and summarize each segment and we applied the Bonferroni correction to the thresholds by considering 50 000 independent tests. Therefore  the 5% genome-wide threshold of significance corresponded to a nominal  value of 10 (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>6). After identification of the lead variant in a given region  variants with significant effects that were located less than 500 kbp apart were grouped in the same QTL region. Then  the boundaries of QTL regions were determined by considering the positions of variants that were included in the upper third of the peak. The process was repeated with the next top variants. When two consecutive QTL regions had overlapping confidence intervals  they were grouped in a unique QTL region. Variants that were located within QTL regions were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) [] based on the UMD3.1 bovine reference genome assembly. In order to determine if the presence of multiple significant variants in a genomic region was a reflection of distinct causal mutations or due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a single causal mutation  conditional analyses were carried out in the most significant QTL regions using the  option of GCTA []. Conditional association analyses were performed by including in the model the most significant variant as a fixed effect and by testing all variants that were not in strong LD with the conditional variant (r<U+2009><<U+2009>0.9). Genetic and residual variances were estimated using the genomic relationship matrices calculated from HD genotypes. Heritability estimates for phenotypes 0/1 or 0/1/2 were similar and high for both Normande and Holstein cows; they ranged from 0.51 to 0.57 depending on the phenotype and on the breed (Table ). Then  we tested the significance of effects for more than 7 million variants in Normande and Holstein cows for both the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes. In total  2446 variants (SNPs or indels) presented significant effects (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>6) in at least one analysis (Fig. ). In Normande cows  we identified 41 variants with significant effects for the 0/1 phenotype  but no variant reached the level of significance for the 0/1/2 phenotype. In Holstein  1566 and 1719 variants had significant effects for phenotypes 0/1 and 0/1/2  respectively. Variants with significant effects were located on BTA23 in Normande cows and on BTA12  13  and 23 in Holstein cows (Fig. ). In the Holstein breed  variants that exhibited the most significant effects were located on BTA13  with a -log() value up to 38.1 for the 0/1/2 phenotype. -log() values plotted against the position of variants on  (BTA) autosomes for the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes of Normande and Holstein cows All variants with significant effects were grouped into four  eleven  and nine QTL for the Normande 0/1  Holstein 0/1  and Holstein 0/1/2 analyses  respectively (Table ). The four QTL found in Normande cows for the 0/1 phenotype were located between 24.8 and 32.6 Mbp on BTA23 (Fig. ). As shown in Fig.   the effects of this region were also very close to significance for the 0/1/2 phenotype in the same breed (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.99). In neighboring regions on BTA23  we also identified four QTL for the 0/1 phenotype (23.5–28.8 Mbp) and three QTL for the 0/1/2 phenotype (25.1–28.4 Mbp) in Holstein cows. -log() values plotted against the position of variants on  (BTA) autosome 23 for the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes of Normande and Holstein cows However  in Holsteins  the most significant effects were found on BTA13 (Fig. ) and to a lesser extent on BTA12 (Fig. ). The QTL detected on BTA13 was located in a very narrow 8-kpb region  and the variant showing the most significant effects (rs109570209) was located at 63 502 566 bp in both the 0/1 and 0/1/2 analyses. Moreover  although no significant QTL was observed in this region in Normande cows  the analysis revealed a narrow peak that was located exactly in the same region  and the variants with the highest -log() values were located at 63 502 649 and 63 502 566 bp (Fig. ). Finally  in Holstein cows  the remaining QTL were located on BTA12. For the 0/1 phenotype  six distinct QTL were located between 68.9 and 80.1 Mbp  while for the 0/1/2 phenotype five QTL were detected between 67.9 and 77.3 Mbp (Fig. ). -log() values plotted against the position of variants on  (BTA) autosome 13 for the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes of Normande and Holstein cows -log() values plotted against the position of variants on  (BTA) autosome 12 for the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes of Holstein cows It should be noted that these results were based on the UMD3.1 bovine reference genome assembly. In this assembly  the QTL regions on BTA12 and 23 are of limited quality and the corresponding number of QTL may be overestimated. Thus  we realigned these regions on the most-recent ARS-UCD1.2 assembly  with the results presented in Fig. . For the QTL on BTA13 and 23  we found few changes  i.e. the most-recent assembly was very similar to the UMD3.1 assembly for the variants located in these regions. In contrast  on BTA12  the analysis with the most recent assembly detected a smaller number of QTL (e.g.  three for the 0/1/2 phenotype in Holstein versus five with the UMD3.1 assembly) located within a shorter interval (5 Mbp with ARS-UCD1.2 versus 9.4 Mbp with the UMD3.1 assembly). -log() values plotted against the position of variants on UMD3.1 and ARS-UCD1.2 assemblies of  (BTA) autosomes 12  13  and 23 for the 0/1/2 phenotype of Holstein cows Functional annotations revealed that 74% of the 1868 distinct variants located within the confidence intervals of the QTL were intergenic (65% for 0/1 in Normande  81% for 0/1 in Holstein  and 70% for 0/1/2 in Holstein) (Table ). Therefore  the remaining variants were located in genes  mainly in introns (16%) and upstream regions (7%)  and more rarely in downstream regions (1.4%)  exons (0.5% missense and 0.5% synonymous)  3' UTR regions (0.3%)  and 5' UTR regions (0.1%). Depending on the breed and the phenotype analyzed  the QTL linked with MAP resistance/susceptibility had confidence intervals that ranged in size from 1.5 kbp to 1.6 Mbp  and contained between 3 and 456 variants with significant effects. A minority of the QTL detected were located entirely in intergenic regions (one QTL in the Normande 0/1 analysis  on BTA23; three QTL in the Holstein 0/1 analysis  two on BTA12 and one on BTA13; and four QTL in the Holstein 0/1/2 analysis  three on BTA12 and one on BTA13)  while all other QTL contained variants located in 1 to 28 distinct genes. All the QTL found on BTA23 in the three analyses were located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region  which is known to be particularly gene-rich. In each of the three analyses  the QTL that contained the largest number of genes were located around 27 Mbp. Here  within an interval of 1 Mbp  26 and 28 genes were detected in Normande and Holstein cows  respectively. Although a large number of genes was located on BTA23  we identified a limited number of positional candidate genes within the confidence intervals of all of the QTL that we detected: 31  42  and 38 in the Normande 0/1  Holstein 0/1  and Holstein 0/1/2 analyses  respectively (Fig. ). The majority of these genes (29) were located on BTA23 and found in all three analyses. Two other genes  also located on BTA23  were shared in the 0/1 analyses of both breeds  while nine genes (4 on BTA12 and 5 on BTA23) appeared to be specific to the Holstein breed only (0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes)  and two genes were identified in only one analysis (Holstein 0/1). Number of overlapping candidate genes located in confidence intervals of QTL among Normande 0/1  Holstein 0/1  and Holstein 0/1/2 analyses and lists of corresponding genes Therefore  we were able to identify positional candidate genes in all QTL regions except the QTL located on BTA13  i.e. the region that presented the most significant effects in Holstein cows. The confidence interval of this QTL  which was very narrow  contained only intergenic variants. However  two genes are located in the upstream region ( at 63 408 786–63 490 256 bp) and in the downstream region ( at 63 632 327–63 670 697 bp) of this QTL. The results discussed so far were obtained following the removal of variants with poor imputation accuracy or low MAF. When  instead  we considered all the variants of this region  including those imputed with poor accuracy (R<U+2009><<U+2009>0.3) and/or with a MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01  we obtained another picture of the GWAS results. Figure  presents these results for the 0/1/2 phenotype in both Normande and Holstein cows. In this region  variants with the highest imputation accuracies were located in the vicinity of the BovineSNP50 variant (rs110002750 at 63 500 701 bp) in the intergenic region between the  and  genes. The closest variants that were located in genes were imputed with a very low accuracy and were therefore excluded from the GWAS analysis. However  their significance levels were similar to those found for the intergenic variants with the most significant effects. Therefore  it is likely that the confidence interval of this QTL also includes these variants with low imputation R  and is larger than initially indicated (~<U+2009>70 kb vs 1.5 kb)  meaning that this QTL probably also comprises  and . -log() (dots) and R (line) values  calculated by Minimac  plotted against the position of variants in the [63 480 000-63 550 000] interval on  (BTA) autosome 13 for the 0/1/2 phenotype of Normande and Holstein cows. Intergenic variants in blue  Bovine SNP50 variant in red   genic variants in yellow  and  genic variants in purple In order to distinguish multiple true causal mutations in a QTL region from those caused by LD  the variants with the most significant effects in each region  namely the top variants in Table  (11  1  and 10 distinct variants for BTA12  13  and 23  respectively)  were tested in conditional analyses. Each of the top variants was individually included in the mixed model (1) as a fixed effect in addition to the variant to be tested in analyses of Holstein cows for both the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes (see Additional file : Figure S1). Of the 11 variants added in the model for BTA12  only one removed the effects of all other variants tested on this chromosome  and only for the 0/1/2 phenotype. This variant was located at 70 127 519 bp (rs41667085) in an intronic region of the  gene  which encodes the multidrug resistance-associated protein 4  and was the variant on BTA12 that presented the most significant effect on the 0/1/2 phenotype (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.7). Interestingly  for the 0/1 phenotype  it ranked 62nd in the peak (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>10.3); instead  the variant with the most significant effect on this phenotype was located at 70 723 087 bp (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>10.8). For the 0/1 phenotype  none of the 11 variants tested in the conditional analyses completely removed the peak. However  two variants located in the  gene  at 70 053 503 and 70 052 385 bp  had significant effects on the 0/1 phenotype and ranked 8th and 9th  respectively  in the QTL peak. Thus  this gene is a strong candidate also for the 0/1 phenotype. Conditional analyses of BTA13 included both the variant located at 63 502 566 bp (rs109570209)  which had the most-significant effects on both the 0/1 and the 0/1/2 phenotypes  but also the neighboring variants located at 63 502 649 (rs380877320) and 63 500 701 (rs110002750)  that had effects that were closest to the level of significance in Normande cows. None of these intergenic variants completely removed the signal for either of the two phenotypes. Of the ten variants included in conditional analyses of BTA23  five completely removed the peak for both phenotypes. Three were located in genes  at 25 181 661 bp (rs209183236) in  (intron)  26 733 104 bp (rs470365293) in ENSBTAG00000023541 (intron)  and 28 085 410 bp (rs109539043) in  (upstream region). The two others were located in intergenic regions at 25 554 248 bp (rs210655104) and 28 012 299 bp (rs209284762). Individual diagnostic tests for paratuberculosis are known to lack sensitivity and specificity  and these characteristics have been put forward as explanations for the low heritability of MAP-related traits that has been reported in the literature. Since the study of Settles et al. in 2009 [] to the most recent publication in 2019  13 GWAS analyses have been conducted for traits linked with bovine paratuberculosis [            ]. These studies examined various numbers of animals and SNPs  and all succeeded in identifying genomic regions associated with MAP resistance/susceptibility. However  when taken together the results were generally poorly concordant. As mentioned before  many factors are likely contributing to these discrepancies  but one of the main ones  in particular  is the difficulty of properly characterizing the MAP status of cows due to (1) the long latency and incubation periods of the disease and (2) the lack of sensitivity of and concordance between milk ELISA and fecal culture. In our study  we put a great deal of effort into defining accurate phenotypes. Control cows were chosen from affected herds and among those born in the same month as confirmed cases  this strategy being designed to increase the probability of their exposure to MAP. In addition  control cows were tested at least four times  as successive tests are known to be often inconsistent []  and all cows had to be old enough for the latency period to be over  to limit the risk of false negative results. These constraints led to the exclusion of many animals from the study. Affected animals were selected from those that had previously been tested positive and their status was confirmed here with both ELISA and PCR tests; therefore  in order to include an affected cow for further analysis  we required both blood and fecal samples  and the lack of samples for many clinical cases resulted in their exclusion from the study. Because of all these conditions  only a small proportion (~<U+2009>5%) of all potential animals were included in the analysis. All confirmation tests were performed in a single laboratory with the same ELISA and PCR testing protocols throughout in order to make the results more reliable and comparable. Consequently  we are confident that the phenotypes used here accurately reflected the true status of the cows regarding MAP infection: not affected or affected with or without clinical signs. The case–control design modified the distribution of the phenotypes and concentrated on the most extreme animals. In addition  it contributed to a much more balanced distribution of phenotypes than in the overall population of affected herds. Altogether  these choices resulted in heritability estimates that were much higher (around 50%) than those previously reported in the literature (3 to 27%) []. By removing the intermediate phenotypes  which were considered to be of uncertain status  our study likely overestimated heritability coefficients through the selection of individuals with extreme phenotypes. However  a part of our higher estimate can be explained by our focus on better-defined and thus likely more-heritable phenotypes. Nevertheless  these high estimates must be considered as specific to this selected study group  which strongly deviates from the general population  and are likely to be biased by this kind of selective genotyping. All cows were genotyped with the Illumina SNP50 BeadChip. We intentionally did not use a low-density chip in order to reduce the potential impact of the reduced accuracy of imputation to 50 K. Imputation to HD  using 788 Holstein and 551 Normande key ancestors as a reference  is known to be very accurate []. We were then able to take advantage of the work of the 1000 Bull Genomes project to impute genotypes of the cows at the WGS level to directly identify candidate variants for resistance to paratuberculosis in Holstein and Normande cows. Our original design was intended to be the same in both Holstein and Normande breeds  with a full dataset for approximately 1500 cows in each breed. However  Holstein and Normande cows represent 64% and 9% of French herds  respectively  and it was much more difficult to recruit Normande than Holstein cows. For this reason  the final dataset was much smaller in the Normande (649) than in the Holstein (1644) breed  which clearly affected detection power; with a predefined significance threshold (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>6)  we identified more QTL regions with more significant effects in Holstein than in Normande cows. In the Holstein analysis  we detected 9 (0/1/2 phenotype) and 11 (0/1 phenotype) QTL  located on BTA12  13  and 23  while only four significant QTL (0/1 phenotype)  all located on BTA23  reached the significance level in the Normande analysis. Nevertheless  by analyzing both breeds independently  we were able to confirm the effects of the QTL located on BTA13 (with significant effects in Holstein and close to the significance threshold in Normande) and BTA23 (significant effects in both breeds). Another strategy would be to validate the three Holstein QTL in the Normande breed. Accordingly  the Bonferroni correction is limited to the number of candidate SNPs tested in the Normande breed. With this approach  the QTL on BTA13 would be validated (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.7) whereas the QTL on BTA12 would remain non-significant. However  additional data are needed in the Normande breed to increase the size of the population examined and improve the balance between numbers of case and control phenotypes. By arbitrarily defining QTL regions in 1-Mbp-intervals  we identified several QTL on BTA12 and 23. However  for each of these chromosomes  conditional GWAS led to the identification of variants that each explained all the effects detected on BTA12 (rs41667085 in the  gene) and on BTA23 (rs209183236 in   rs4703655293 in ENSBTAG00000023541  rs109539043 in   and rs210655104 and rs209284762 in intergenic regions). These results suggest that the identified variants could be the causative variants  or at least in strong LD with the causative variants. On both BTA12 and 23  we identified a large region that contains variants with significant effects. It could be due to the long-range LD that exists in these regions and/or  as shown by large segments with low imputation accuracy in QTL regions on BTA12 and 23  to local misassemblies of the bovine reference genome assembly UMD3.1. Moreover  for some QTL  conditional analyses failed to remove the peak. This could indicate that several causal mutations that affect resistance to paratuberculosis are located in this region. Indeed  it is important to note that all these results were obtained using the UMD3.1 reference genome assembly  as for run6 of the 1000 Bull Genomes project  which was used for WGS imputation. When we compared the results obtained from different genome assemblies (ARS-UCD1.2 versus UMD3.1)  the QTL regions on BTA13 and 23 were relatively well conserved  and we did not observe major changes for the variants located in these peaks. Instead  the QTL identified on BTA12 (a region of limited quality in UMD3.1) were located within a narrower peak in the ARS-UCD1.2 genome assembly (5 Mbp  versus 9.4 Mbp with UMD3.1 for the 0/1/2 phenotype)  which was more consistent with the results that we obtained from the conditional analyses (a single QTL in the region). Notably  although this study estimated relatively high heritability values for resistance to paratuberculosis  we found only a limited number of genomic regions associated with this trait in both breeds. Nevertheless  in Holstein cows  when we analyzed only the QTL with the most significant effects on each chromosome  the cumulative effects of the detected QTL explained 16 and 28% of the genetic variance of the 0/1 and 0/1/2 phenotypes  respectively. For both phenotypes  the QTL that explained the largest phenotypic variance was located on BTA13 and was responsible for 8% (0/1 phenotype) and 16% (0/1/2 phenotype) of the genetic variance  despite the fact that the resistance allele was present at a high frequency (0.91). Other QTL individually explained between 2 and 6% of the total phenotypic variance. Several previous GWAS analyses have reported QTL on BTA23 that are associated with resistance to MAP  in the vicinity of the MHC [      ]  while only one previous study  a meta-analysis conducted in US Holsteins based on 50 K SNP genotypes  found QTL at<U+2009>~<U+2009>70 Mbp on BTA12 and<U+2009>~<U+2009>65 Mbp on BTA13 []. McGovern et al. []  who performed a GWAS on imputed whole-genome sequences  identified two SNPs associated with the humoral response to MAP on BTA13  at 62 037 755 bp and 66 373 805 bp  i.e. on either side of but quite far from the QTL we detected (63 497 960–63 506 532 bp) and outside its confidence interval. In this study  we did not find the QTL detected on the other chromosomes and  in particular  those located on BTA1  6 or 7  which were the most commonly detected QTL for resistance to paratuberculosis in Holstein cows [              ]. In each of the QTL regions detected here  we were able to identify genes of interest  some of which have been previously associated with traits related to the intestine or with responses to infection in mice  rats  or humans. Both  and  have been associated with intestinal inflammation and abnormal intestinal morphology (mucosa  goblet cell  enteroendocrine cell  or epithelium). Of all the genes located in the vicinity of the MHC on BTA23    ENSBTAG00000006864  and  have been linked to abnormal intestinal morphology or physiology  whereas   ENSBTAG00000013919  ENSBTAG00000038397  and  are involved in bowel diseases (Crohn’s disease  ulcerative colitis  syndromic diarrhea  gastrointestinal ulcer  or tricho-hepato-enteric-syndrome). Some of these genes have also been associated with an abnormal response to infection (  ENSBTAG00000006864  and )  increased/decreased susceptibility to bacterial infection ( and ENSBTAG00000006864)  or induced colitis ( and ). As bovine paratuberculosis is an enteric disease caused by the MAP bacterium leading to granulomatous enteritis  all of these genes are good functional candidates to explain inter-individual differences in resistance/susceptibility to paratuberculosis. In the QTL regions detected on BTA12  13  and 23  the best candidates appear to be  respectively      and  because they contain ( and ) or are the closest () to the variants with the most significant effects. In addition  we note here that our analyses of control/case (0/1) and control/non-clinical case/clinical case (0/1/2) phenotypes did not lead to exactly the same results. Although heritability estimates of both phenotypes were very similar in both breeds  there were differences in the GWAS results. In Holstein and Normande cows  depending on the phenotype  the number and identity of QTL detected differed (larger number for the 0/1 phenotype)  as well as the functional candidate genes  probably reflecting different biological functions that contribute to each phenotype. For example  analysis of the 0/1 phenotype led to the detection of more QTL on BTA23 in both breeds and on BTA12 in Holsteins. In addition  on BTA12  QTL effects were more significant for the 0/1 phenotype than for the 0/1/2 phenotype. In contrast  the effects detected on BTA13 were much more significant for the 0/1/2 phenotype (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>38.1) than for the 0/1 phenotype (-log()<U+2009>=<U+2009>18.5). Since all the cows in this study were born in the same herd and within the same period as the infected cows  and therefore probably exposed to MAP  the control/case phenotype  which was mainly associated with the QTL located on BTA12 and 23  should reflect a cow’s ability to be resistant to MAP. Instead  distinguishing between non-clinical and clinical cases reflects the potential for a MAP-infected animal to postpone manifestation of clinical signs of the disease. Thus  these results appear to be concordant with the best functional candidate genes found in each QTL region  with the  (BTA12) and  (BTA23) genes appearing to be directly involved in responses to infection  whereas the  gene (BTA13) was previously found to be associated with intestinal inflammation or abnormal morphology in mice. In this study  we demonstrate that a focus on the most accurate phenotypes increases heritability estimates. These accurate phenotypes  combined with genotypes imputed to the whole-genome sequence level  made it possible to identify three chromosomal regions with important effects on resistance/susceptibility to MAP. In each of these regions  we were able to pinpoint one candidate gene that could be functionally related to MAP infection (    and ) with candidate variants that could be either causal variants or in strong LD with the causal variants. Due to the large percentage of genetic variance explained  these QTL merit inclusion in future genomic evaluations with an appropriate weight. However  these QTL do not explain all of the relevant genetic variance  and the best model may very well end up containing QTL and markers from throughout the whole genome. Our results for the Holstein breed are very encouraging for strategies that aim at implementing selection for improved resistance to MAP. In the Normande breed  the study design was too limited to allow us to draw any general conclusions; efforts are underway to enlarge the sample pool in order to increase detection power.  These data (genotypes and phenotypes) are part of a reference population used for genomic selection and have commercial value.

Previously  we showed that genetic factors explain 40% of the variation in end of lay bone quality and we detected a quantitative trait locus (QTL) of large effect on chicken chromosome 1. The aim of this study was to combine data from the commercial founder White Leghorn population and the F2 mapping population to fine-map this QTL and understand its function in terms of gene expression and physiology.ResultsSeveral single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 1 between 104 and 110 Mb (galGal6) had highly significant associations with tibial breaking strength. The alternative genotypes of markers of large effect that flanked the region had tibial breaking strengths of 200.4 vs. 218.1 Newton (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.002) and  in a subsequent founder generation  the higher breaking strength genotype was again associated with higher breaking strength. In a subsequent generation  cortical bone density and volume were increased in individuals with the better bone genotype but with significantly reduced medullary bone quality. The effects on cortical bone density were confirmed in a further generation and was accompanied by increased mineral maturity of the cortical bone as measured by infrared spectrometry and there was evidence of better collagen cross-linking in the cortical bone. Comparing the transcriptome of the tibia from individuals with good or poor bone quality genotypes indicated four differentially-expressed genes at the locus  one gene   ()  having a nine-fold higher expression in the genotype for low bone quality. The mechanism was -acting and although there was an amino-acid difference in the CBS protein between the genotypes  there was no difference in the activity of the enzyme.

Previously  we showed that genetic factors explain 40% of the variation in end of lay bone quality and we detected a quantitative trait locus (QTL) of large effect on chicken chromosome 1. The aim of this study was to combine data from the commercial founder White Leghorn population and the F2 mapping population to fine-map this QTL and understand its function in terms of gene expression and physiology. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 1 between 104 and 110 Mb (galGal6) had highly significant associations with tibial breaking strength. The alternative genotypes of markers of large effect that flanked the region had tibial breaking strengths of 200.4 vs. 218.1 Newton (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.002) and  in a subsequent founder generation  the higher breaking strength genotype was again associated with higher breaking strength. In a subsequent generation  cortical bone density and volume were increased in individuals with the better bone genotype but with significantly reduced medullary bone quality. The effects on cortical bone density were confirmed in a further generation and was accompanied by increased mineral maturity of the cortical bone as measured by infrared spectrometry and there was evidence of better collagen cross-linking in the cortical bone. Comparing the transcriptome of the tibia from individuals with good or poor bone quality genotypes indicated four differentially-expressed genes at the locus  one gene   ()  having a nine-fold higher expression in the genotype for low bone quality. The mechanism was -acting and although there was an amino-acid difference in the CBS protein between the genotypes  there was no difference in the activity of the enzyme. Plasma homocysteine concentration  the substrate of CBS  was higher in the poor bone quality genotype. Validated markers that predict bone strength have been defined for selective breeding and a gene was identified that may suggest alternative ways to improve bone health in addition to genetic selection. The identification of how genetic variants affect different aspects of bone turnover shows potential for translational medicine. Bone fractures and other forms of skeletal damage are a challenge for laying hens [] and are the result  at least in part  of progressive osteoporosis []. Osteoporosis in hens is ultimately the result of the physiological changes that occur because of the start of reproductive activity. At this stage  the hen starts to form medullary bone []  which is a specialised bone formed as an adaptation for laying a calcareous cleidoic egg. Medullary bone provides a reserve of calcium for mineralisation of the eggshell and it is very labile  turning over rapidly with the daily cycle of egg laying []. This rapid turnover is characterised  as in the structural cortical bone  by osteoblastic and osteoclastic remodelling [  ]  but there is a rapid change in the rate of mineralisation that depends on the stage of shell calcification. Osteoblast activity in structural cortical bone at this time is minimal  since resources transfer to the medullary bone while osteoclast bone resorption continues. Overall  this is thought to lead to a reduction in the integrity and mass of the structural bone over the period of laying  which can be exacerbated by any imbalance in calcium supply from the diet []. These factors are in turn predictive of breaking strength []  which in turn are predictive of likelihood of fracture or deformations [  ]. Whereas undoubtedly housing and nutrition must be optimised to ensure good bone health in laying hens  we believe that genetics offers an important route to reduce bone fractures []  especially with the increased challenges to hen welfare posed by alternative housing []. We have shown that genetics has a clear potential to improve bone health without detriment to production traits: in our previous work  we found that genetic factors underlie the variation in the susceptibility of individual birds to osteoporosis and bone fracture []. Some studies have described quantitative trait loci (QTL) for bone quality in chickens related to osteoporosis  usually from crosses of radically different breeds in which body mass can be an issue [  ]  but few have looked within a commercially relevant layer population as investigated here. Divergent selection from a commercial pedigree founder breed on the basis of a bone index (BI)  which comprises several bone strength and other traits  resulted in the production of high (Hi) and low (Lo) bone strength lines of laying hens  but with no change in body weight []. Selection resulted in the Hi line showing an improvement in tibia strength of over 50%  without any adverse effect on egg production or egg quality. The bones of the hens from the Hi bone strength line have fewer osteoclasts  and consequently suffer less bone resorption during the laying period  resulting in a lower rate of endosteal cortical bone loss and greater accumulation of medullary bone than those from the Lo line []. In these hens  there were differences in the degree of collagen cross-linking []. Pyrrolic cross-link content of collagen  known to be correlated with osteoporosis in hens  was higher in the humerus and tibiotarsus of the Hi line selected hens []. Using an F2 population created from the Hi and Lo lines  a QTL of large effect was characterised on chicken chromosome 1 []. In the work reported here  we have fine-mapped this QTL and combined the data with next-generation sequencing of RNA from the bones of hens segregating for markers of the QTL. Ultimately  the genetic markers identified can be used to select for better bone strength  which will reduce the propensity for osteoporosis and  in turn  bone breakage. Few of the many QTL detected in GWAS studies for human osteoporosis have been functionally characterised []. Understanding the potential underlying causes that can be deduced from the identification of the genes involved in this QTL may lead to understanding the causes of osteoporosis  suggest new management or nutritional solutions for hens  and potentially lead to a better understanding of bone loss in other species. Population 1 was an F2 population (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>372) that was described previously []. It was created by crossing high and low bone quality lines produced by divergent selection of the founder breed [  ] (Fig. ). The QTL on chromosome 1 was originally discovered in this population. The population was used to improve the precision of the location of the QTL with informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the locus. The measured phenotype was tibial breaking strength and genotyping was performed with microsatellite markers as described previously [] and SNPs that are listed in Additional file : Table S1. Schematic diagram of the populations used for fine mapping and characterising a QTL for bone quality on chromosome 1. Numbers of generations between the populations are indicated to the left and the year  number of animals  phenotypes and genotypes are in the text boxes to the right Population 2 was a later generation (sampled in 2006  see Fig. ) of the founder breed used to generate the divergently selected population that was used to create the F2 population where the QTL was discovered []. It is a White Leghorn breed used in the production of LSL hybrid layers (Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH). With the ability to obtain high-density genotyping and a larger number of animals  the population allowed better precision for mapping the QTL. As in all the populations for which bones were measured in this study  hens were housed in individual cages to facilitate egg recording. Phenotype for tibia breaking strength  body weight and egg production were available for 1595 hens. DNA was prepared from red blood cells using DNAzol (Invitrogen). Hens were genotyped for 144 SNPs as described in the section on genetic markers below and in Additional file : Table S2. To increase power and reduce cost only the top and tail of the population were genotyped. Bone strength is influenced by body weight in hens  as witnessed by its negative weighting in the bone index used to divergently select hens that formed the founder population for the QTL analysis []. For this reason and to avoid biasing the sample towards heavier and lighter hens  we chose to select equal numbers of hens from the top and tail of the distribution of the population after ranking the hens using the residuals generated after fitting body weight using regression analysis. The equation derived from the data was tibia breaking strength (N)<U+2009>=<U+2009>53.0<U+2009>+<U+2009>0.0946 body weight (g). Hens laying less than 230 eggs were removed  since these can have stronger bones and do not form part of the normal distribution  as was done in the original QTL study []. Equal numbers of individuals from the top and the tail of the population were selected and 998 animals were genotyped. This represented 63% of the population. The phenotype was tibial breaking strength and genotyping was performed with 144 SNPs on chromosome 1. Further studies were undertaken and samples were collected from the founder breed in subsequent years to characterise the locus and its effects. Samples (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>111) for genotyping and phenotyping were taken from the 2010 generation (Fig. ) of the founder breed using a targeted sampling approach  which was used to provide further independent confirmation of the locus effect. As in the other populations  only hens laying more than 230 eggs were analysed. To obtain the best power with the resources available  samples were collected only from hens at post-mortem if  after being tested for breaking strength  the bones were more than 1.5 standard deviations from their predicted breaking strength (PBS). PBS was calculated using a training set of 200 hens. The equation was produced by regressing tibial breaking strength against body weight and total egg production. (PBS<U+2009>=<U+2009>90.5<U+2009>+<U+2009>(-<U+2009>0.687 egg production)<U+2009>+<U+2009>(0.1239 bodyweight)). The distribution of the ‘residual’ between the observed and predicted breaking strength based on the 200-hen training set was used to define 1.5 standard deviations. This ensured that we did not bias the results since larger hens have stronger bones and hens that lay significantly fewer eggs due to pauses in production can have stronger bones as do out-of-lay hens []. Hens with four or less follicles or with any evidence of reproduction abnormality such as internal ovulations were rejected at post-mortem. The phenotype was tibial breaking strength and genotyping was performed with the Ost106225194 and Ost112522587 SNPs. Samples of mid-shaft tibia bone were collected from the 2012 generation (Fig. ) for the preparation of RNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and to make bone density measurements. This allowed the characterisation of expression differences related to the QTL. Thirteen sires and 50 dams were genotyped for SNPs Ost106225194 and Ost112522587 and offspring from heterozygous individuals were prioritised for the detection of homozygotes by genotyping the same markers. Homozygous hens (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>34 /; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>22 /) were phenotyped at the end of their productive cycle at 70 weeks of age. RNA was prepared from mid-shaft tibia. The measured phenotype was mid-shaft cross-sections of tibia that were taken for radiographic measurement of cortical and medullary bone density  volume and area. The animals used for NGS of bone RNA were selected from these (see section on NGS). Genotyping was performed with Ost106225194 and Ost112522587 SNPs. Samples were obtained from the 2013 generation (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>66) using the same sampling strategy as for Population 4  but samples were collected for evaluating specific properties of bone material at 70 weeks of age to understand how the genotype might result in the observed bone strength phenotype (Fig. ). The measured phenotype was concentration of homocysteine in the plasma towards the end of peak egg production (48 weeks of age) and end of production (70 weeks of age). A subset of these animals  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>19 per genotype  with matching physiology with regard to stage of egg formation were further analysed for bone mechanical properties  bone microstructure  chemical composition of the cortical and medullary bone  mineral crystallinity and crystal orientation and collagen maturity using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Genotyping was performed with Ost106225194 and Ost112522587 SNPs (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>33 /; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>33 /). Population 6 was a White Leghorn line that was not related to the other populations. We used it to provide material for the measurement of CBS enzyme activity as described in the respective sub-section. It consisted of embryos from a White Leghorn population maintained at the Roslin Institute  which was found to carry the SNP rs316554658 that resulted in a predicted amino acid difference. Sires and dams heterozygous for this SNP were bred and the resultant eggs were incubated. At day 15  the embryo livers were harvested and stored at -20 °C prior to use in the assay  and a sample of blood was taken for DNA preparation to confirm the genotype of the embryo. The measured phenotype was CBS enzyme kinetics and genotyping was done with SNP rs316554658. For fine mapping  SNPs in the QTL region were sourced in a number of ways. SNPs were sourced from dbSNP [] along chicken chromosome 1 for use in the F2 cross. A more targeted set of SNPs was defined from sequence information [] from White Leghorn breeds between 81.1 and 128.8 Mb on chromosome 1 (galGal6). This corresponded to the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the original QTL. The number of SNPs was reduced from 91 455 to 15 761 by using only those segregating in all the sequenced breeds  and finally to 193 using those that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.2 in all three breeds. This list was reduced furthermore by removing SNPs in close proximity to each other and by biasing the density to be higher at the perceived peak and reduced at the tails of the region. Around 25 SNPs failed the test for ability to construct an Illumina Golden Gate assay. The SNP list was supplemented by SNPs that were derived from the alignment of EST sequences from the following genes located in the target region:                            and . The full list of genotyped SNPs is in Additional file : Table S2. One hundred and forty-four SNPs were genotyped on Population 2 using the Illumina Golden Gate assay on the Illumina BeadXpress platform. The Illumina Bead Studio Genotyping Module software was used to analyse SNP data and  as a first quality control  to remove poor quality or uninformative SNPs. From the 119 SNPs obtained from sequence data  only 13 were informative in the F2 cross  whereas in the case of the SNPs discovered using EST sequences  19 out of 39 were informative. The 95% CI of the QTL was chr1: 75 624 794-124 047 308 bp (galGal6) and the region covered by the new markers was chr1: 77 312 158-124 272 094 with an average distance of 0.336 Mb (SD 0.183) between SNPs. For Population 1  the 32 informative SNPs from those detailed above were genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate assay on the Illumina BeadXpress platform. The Bead Studio Genotyping Module software was used to analyse SNP data. These SNPs were added to the genetic map for chromosome 1 to determine the QTL position in the F2 Population 2. The new F2 map is in Additional file : Table S1. The map was used as previously [] using the QTL mapping method of Haley et al. [] but implemented using gridQTL []. Genotyping with SNPs Ost112522587 and Ost106225194 to define parents or individuals for Populations 3  4 and 5 with the desired genotype was carried out by LGC (LGC  Middlesex  UK)  assay reference Chr1_112522587200 and Chr1_1062251946  respectively. SNP rs316554658  which was predicted to result in an amino-acid change  was diagnosed using RFLP after amplification with primers CBS_NS_F (5' CGT CTG GTG AAG GGG AAT AA 3') and CBS_NS_R (5' TCC CTT TTC AGC TGC TCA GT 3'). This resulted in an amplified product of 596 bp using genomic DNA as target (Chromosome 1  106 922 247–106 922 842). When digested with the restriction enzyme HpyCH4V  the amplification of allele  gives products of 289  166  93 and 48 bp (the restriction site at position 289 in the PCR product is part of a codon for Q at position 498 in the CBS protein  therefore ). Digestion of the allele  product (part of a codon for K at position 498 in the CBS protein) gives digestion products of 382  166 and 48 bp. This was used to genotype Population 6 to allow identification of individuals that differed in their CBS amino acid sequence and to collect tissue to assess the function of the enzyme. Mid-shaft tibia bone total RNA samples were prepared from 70-week old hens from Population 4 for which the egg was in the shell gland to reduce any effect of the egg calcification cycle. RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen Ltd.  Renfrewshire  Scotland). RNA was treated with DNAse I and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen  Manchester  England)  concentration and quality were checked with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific; Waltham  MA USA). Half of the samples were homozygous for the low bone breaking strength genotype (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8) and the other half (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8) were homozygous for the high bone breaking strength genotype. Total RNA samples (1 µg) were prepared for mRNA sequencing using the Illumina Truseq RNA Sequencing protocol. Resulting libraries were quality-checked on an Agilent DNA 1000 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies  South Queensferry  UK) and then clustered onto a paired end flowcell using the Illumina v3 cluster generation kit at a concentration of 8 pM. One hundred cycle paired-ended sequencing was carried out on the HiSeq 2000 using Illumina v2 Sequencing by Synthesis kits (Illumina  Little Chesterford  UK). An Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at Edinburgh Genomics generated between 40 and 60 million RNAseq reads per sample (819 million in total). Quality control of the raw data was evaluated using the FastQC package [] (Babraham bioinformatics  Cambridgeshire  England). Reads were adapter-trimmed using cutadapt version 1.3 [] with the parameters-q 30-m 50-a AGATCGGAAGAGC. Differential expression of genes or tags was assessed using edgeR version 3.6.8 []  a package in the bioconductor suite [] implemented in R []. The likelihood that the expression of genes differed between the genotypes was estimated using a general linear model in the edgeR package. Genes with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 were reported as of interest. A fuller version is available in Additional file . The data were submitted to the European nucleotide archive (study accession PRJEB6782) and have been used in the annotation of the chicken genome []. Examination of genes of interest using the NGS data was performed manually using Tablet v1.17.08.17 [] to ascertain the location of polymorphisms in each bird and these were annotated to the sequence using Seqbuild (DNASTAR  Inc. Madison  WI). Assembly of short reads to produce the  mRNA sequence was made using Staden Gap5 v1.2.14-r []. The  gene is considered to be present in the chicken genome based on a prediction. It has the Ensembl transcript ID ENSGALT00000026110 at position chr1:111 011 700–111 029 467 (galGal6). Another gene shares sequence similarity in some of the exons with  and is named the - gene (); it has the Ensembl transcript ID ENSGALT00000026104 and is located upstream from  at position chr1:110 980 772–110 999 637 (galGal6). ENSGALT00000026110 and ENSGALT00000026104 are 1836 bp and 1938 bp long  respectively  and the identity over the regions that align is equal to 73.5% (1106/1505) with 14 gaps using ‘Matcher’ in mEMBOSS []. The sequences differ sufficiently for defining specific PCR assays to investigate their relative expression.  gene expression was measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR); a standard curve was used to quantify expression of  and measurements were standardised using the  () as reference gene  the expression of which did not differ between genotypes (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.585). The overall methodology for quantification was as previously described in [  ]. cDNA for measurement was prepared from mid-shaft tibia samples from the Ost112522587/Ost106225194  / (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) and / (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>25) genotypes from Population 4. Because two versions of the gene appear to exist in the chicken genome as stated above   and   we measured both to confirm which gene was differentially expressed. In the process  we established that the  gene was not highly expressed using the <U+0394><U+0394>ct method [] to estimate the fold difference in expression of the two genes in the same samples. The  primers for qPCR avoided polymorphisms that were known to be within the locus: CBS-F2a  TTGGGCTGAAGTGTGAACTC; CBS-R2  TCAGGACATCCACCTTCTCC; product length 233 and for CBSlikeF2  GCTCCGGAGTCTAACATTCG; CBSlikeR  ATCACCACCATGTGGACCTT product length 164 bp. Using 16 samples of RNA extracted from mid-shaft tibia bone for NGS  which represented eight samples of each genotype (Ost112522587/Ost106225194  / vs. /) that were in the same reproductive state  the version of  represented by ENSGALT00000026110 was expressed on average 815<U+2009>±<U+2009>157-fold higher than  when calculated from the quantitative PCR data. For this reason  we confined subsequent measurements to the  gene. Allelic imbalance of  expression in hens that were heterozygous at the Ost112522587 SNP from Population 4 was determined by amplification of cDNA derived from bone of 10 heterozygous hens using primers CBSgenoF1  GTGGAACGTCAGTGTTCAGG; CBSgenoR1  AAGGCTGAACTTTTCCAGCA followed by digestion with HpyCH4V restriction enzyme. This yields DNA products of 132 and 68 bp for the  allele associated with low bone strength or leaves the fragment uncut at 200 bp for the  allele associated with high bone quality. Products were run on a 3% agarose gel containing Sybrsafe (Invitrogen  Paisley  Scotland). The intensity of the bands was calculated using ImageJ 1.32 () on images taken using a G:Box imager (Syngene  Cambridge  UK). The sum of the intensity of the 132-bp and 68-bp band was compared with the 200-bp band intensity expressed as a fraction of the total area under the curve using a paired  test. A coding variant was detected at position 498 in  coding for glutamine (Q) or lysine (K) giving rise to two allozymes. Estimation of the activity of CBS in liver expressing the protein that contains these alternative amino-acids was based on the production of cystathionine in the presence of varying substrates (L-homocysteine 0.1–5 mmol/L  serine constant at 5 mmol/L) and cofactors (S adenosylmethionine 200 µmol/L and pyridoxal phosphate 50 µmol/L []. All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. In brief  liver samples from day-15 embryos harvested from Population 6  which segregated for the alternative alleles  were homogenized (Ultraturrax  IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG  Germany) in an extraction buffer containing protease inhibitor. Protein concentrations of the homogenate supernatant were estimated using a Pierce™ Coomassie blue assay (Thermo Fisher  UK) and 100 µg of protein was included in the assay in a total volume of 50 µl and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally  150 µl of acetonitrile (VWR Chemicals Leicestershire  UK) was added to precipitate proteins and the supernatant retained for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) measurement  see below. The Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) and the maximum activity (Vmax) were estimated by plotting a double reciprocal plot using the rate of cystathionine production at each homocysteine concentration; 50  40  30  20  10  5  2 and 1 mM. LC–MS measurements for homocysteine and cystathionine levels in samples from the CBS enzyme activity assay were performed by a selected reaction monitoring assay on an amaZon ETD IonTrap Mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics  GmbH  Bremen  Germany) coupled to an Ultimate HPLC (Dionex) system  for more details (see Additional files  and ). In addition  the method was used to measure plasma homocysteine for validation of the commercial kit as described below. Plasma homocysteine was measured using the kit HY4036 (Randox laboratories  County Antrim  UK) based on enzymatic conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine by CBS. Plasma was treated prior to measurement with lipoclear (Vetlab supplies  West Sussex  UK) to remove circulating lipids. In humans  the homocysteine assay relies on low endogenous levels of circulating cystathionine to work  but it was not clear if this was true in chickens. To ascertain if concentrations measured by the kit were the same as those measured using LC–MS  a set of samples was measured by both methods. Comparison of the respective measurements resulted in an R-squared value of 92%  which suggested that the biochemical method worked adequately to detect homocysteine in chicken plasma. Among the main morphological and biomechanical properties  tibia breaking strength was determined by a three-point bending test using a material testing machine (JJ Lloyd LRX50  Sussex  UK) as previously described []. Cross-sections of the tibia bone were radiographed in a Faxitron 43855D soft X ray apparatus using Kodak MRE-1 high-resolution mammography film in Min-R2 cassettes with a single Min-R intensifying screen. Each exposed plate included a 16-step aluminium wedge  with 0.25-mm increments  for calibration purposes. Exposed films were developed using an automatic processor and then digitised using a Kodak LS-75 film scanner. Measurement of the radiographic density and proportion of medullary and cortical bone in the tibia was made using the software package ImageJ 1.32 (). Each tibia bone was automatically delineated from the background and the mean radiographic density (pre-calibrated in mm of aluminium equivalent) of the whole bone was measured. The proportion of medullary and cortical bone type was calculated directly from the X-ray by delineation []. : Tibia bones were stored in a freezer at -<U+2009>20 °C until analysed for bone physicochemical material specific properties (e.g.  bone microstructure  chemical composition of the cortical and medullary bone  mineral crystallinity and crystal orientation  and collagen maturity) using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques as fully described in Additional file  and briefly below. : The chemical composition of bone tissues (cortical and medullary bone) were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy as previously described []. The relative amounts of water  proteins (collagen)  lipids  phosphate and carbonate in the bone samples were determined from the peak area of the absorption bands associated with the characteristic molecular groups of each component [  ]. In addition  the absolute water  organic matter  carbonate and phosphate contents in bone were determined by thermogravimetry (TGA) in selected samples. For these analyses  about 25 mg of the powdered bone were introduced into a crucible and analysed using a TGA system from METTLER-TOLEDO (mod. TGA/DSC1). A heating rate of 20 °C/min was used for registering the TGA curves. -: Tibiae cortical bone (about 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 cm) samples cut from the diaphysis were analyzed in transmission mode with a single crystal diffractometer equipped with an area detector (D8 SMART APEX from Bruker) and Mo radiation (50 kV and 30 mA; 0.5 mm collimator). A quantitative estimation of the degree of orientation of apatite crystals (Angular spread; AS) in the cortical bone was determined from the angular breadth of bands displayed in the intensity profile along the Debye–Scherrer ring associated with the 002 reflection of apatite mineral []. To improve the resolution in Population 1  which is the original F2 used to detect the QTL on chromosome 1  27 new informative markers from those used on Population 2 were added to the original map. The F value for the QTL improved from 13.2 in the original publication to 16.0 for the tibial breaking strength trait  from 7.9 to 10.9 for humeral breaking strength  and from 9.3 to 12.3 for the bone index compound trait. Overall  the position of the QTL became more consistent at 363–365 cM compared to the original estimates and the 95% confidence interval decreased (Table ). When the most significant SNP from the association study was fitted as a covariate  the QTL effect was in great part removed (Fig. ). Evidence for a QTL affecting bone strength in an F2 population on chicken chromosome 1 (solid line) and with the most significant SNP from the association study fitted as a covariate (dashed line) For Population 2  the 2006 generation of the study population  which was measured at 70 weeks of age  egg production  body weight and tibia breaking strength (mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>SD) of the population were equal to 240.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>10.9 eggs  1623<U+2009>±<U+2009>162 g and 206.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>42.1 Newton  respectively (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1595). The results of the association analysis using the 32 SNPs that segregated at the QTL are in Table . The average effect size for markers with significant effects is around 15 Newton between the homozygotes with the additive effect representing half this value. The alternative combined genotypes for the most significant SNPs of large effect and flanking the region (Ost112522587/Ost106225194; / vs. /) had tibial breaking strengths of 200.4 vs. 218.1 Newton (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.002). In 2010  the founder population (Population 3) was re-sampled and 111 individual hens were identified that differed in their predicted versus their observed tibial breaking strength by more than 1.5 of a standard deviation in each direction. When subsequently markers for bone quality were identified (Table )  these individuals were genotyped for two of the markers with a large effect that flanked the region (SNPs Ost112522587 and Ost106225194). Hens segregating for the Ost112522587 genotype displayed a large difference in tibial breaking strength although the high bone strength genotype was poorly represented in the sample; :  198.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>7.2 Newton  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>83; :  225.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>13.4 Newton  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>26; and :  261.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>27.1 Newton  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2. This difference was significant when fitting body weight as a covariate (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) and represents an additive effect of about 32 Newton. There was no significant difference in body weight  egg breaking strength  or egg number between genotypes. The size of the effect may have been inflated by the selection procedure for the top and tail distribution of bone strength. With the identification of predictive markers  it was possible to prioritise families  which were likely to contain offspring that would be homozygous at the markers by genotyping the parents (Population 4). Individuals homozygous at Ost106225194 and Ost112522587 did not differ for body weight or eggshell strength (Table ). The cortical density and cortical bone volume were greater  although not significantly (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.09 and 0.06  respectively)  in the group associated with the high bone strength genotype (/). However  the most striking difference was for the medullary bone. The medullary area and volume were smaller  but the medullary bone was denser in the high bone strength genotype (Table ). To understand what expression differences may exist between the genotypes at the QTL  eight hens from each homozygous genotype were selected for transcript profiling by NGS. The hens were a sample of the population represented in Table . As in the whole population  there was no difference in body weight or egg production and all hens had an egg in the same position in the shell gland. Analysis of the RNAseq data highlighted five genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the genotypes using a nominal FDR of 0.05 (Table ). All of these differentially expressed genes mapped to the refined QTL that define good and poor bone strength  with the exception of the gene on chromosome 4  (Fig.   and Table ). In addition  with the exception of the gene on chromosome 4  they were expressed at a higher level in the low bone strength genotype. The most significant transcript    had a P value of around one order of magnitude greater than that of any of the other gene transcripts that passed the significance threshold (Table ).

The genes marked in red are those considered significant  the majority are in the region of the mapped QTL on chromosome 1 The differential expression of  was confirmed (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) by qPCR in a larger population of birds including the animals used in the NGS represented in Table . The expression of the  gene was 10.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) in the low bone strength genotype (/) vs. 3.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>25) in the high bone strength genotype (/). To reinforce the observation and to demonstrate if the effect was a  or trans effect  expression of each allele in heterozygotes was examined. In heterozygotes from the same generation for which  expression in bone was measured (Population 4)  the relative expression of alleles  and  was significantly different (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). The expression of allele  was much higher than that of allele  (0.90<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 versus 0.10<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10). This suggested that expression of allele  was<U+2009>~<U+2009>9 times that of allele  within an animal. To probe further into the underlying physiology and chemistry of the effect of the different alleles  we carried out a detailed examination of circulating homocysteine and of bone properties in the alternative genotypes. In a sample from Population 5  hens homozygous for the alternative alleles at the  gene displayed several statistical differences in bone quality (Table ). While there was no difference in the gross measures of mechanical bone strength  there was a significantly higher circulating level of homocysteine at 48 and 70 weeks of age in hens with the / genotype. The / genotype is associated with lower bone quality. Several morphometric and physico-chemical measurements differed significantly in this population. In particular  the cortical bone density  its degree of mineralization (PO/Amide I)  cross-linking of collagen LNK 1660/1690  degree of crystal orientation (inversely related to AngSpread002 and crystallinity index CI 1030/1020) were lower  whereas the amount of carbonate in bone mineral was higher in hens with the / than in those with the / genotype (Table ). In contrast  there were no effects in the degree of medullary bone mineralization or chemical composition and  as in our previous observations  there was no difference in egg production or eggshell strength between the genotypes (Table ). Using the NGS data  it was possible to build on the  predicted sequence  ENSGALT00000026110  and to determine the sequence of the two genotypes. This data defined a slightly longer 3' end in the transcript than in the database and suggested a transcription start site that corresponded to the second predicted exon. The sequence was submitted to ENSEMBL (EMBL Accession number LR588428). Using this information  the coding sequence was predicted to have 524 amino-acids. There were nine SNPs in the cDNA that formed two haplotypes. These were previously described and can be found in dbSNP as rs317751309  rs736880045  rs315389726  rs314405634  rs314750178  rs316841302  rs15382187  rs317686139 and are determined in the sequence LR588428 to be synonymous. The exception was an amino-acid altering the SNP at position 111 013 071 (galGal6) and at position 1579 in the sequence LR588428  which is annotated as rs316554658. This alters amino-acid 498 in the predicted CBS protein from a lysine (K) AAA to a glutamine (Q) CAA. These are respectively a charged and an uncharged but polar amino-acid. The lysine version is associated with the high bone strength genotype. The SNP rs316554658 was genotyped using RFLP as described above. The Vmax and Km values were derived from samples taken from individual embryos that were homozygous for the amino-acid difference in the CBS sequence. We found no statistical difference in the activity of CBS allozymes measured in the liver of embryos homozygous for the amino-acid 498 coding difference. The kinetic parameters for the two allozymes were; lysine form Km  0.51<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.10  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6; glutamine form Km  0.62<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.13  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>9 and lysine form Vmax  107.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>44.0  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6; glutamine form Vmax  157.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>52.4  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>9. Our results provide strong evidence that differences in the sequence surrounding the  gene are responsible for the observed phenotypic effects of the QTL on bone quality that was previously observed [] and fine-mapped in the current study. Specifically  the difference in expression between individual hens that carry different combinations of the alleles is persuasive. There are a number of reasons  besides the obvious large difference in expression  which lead us to this conclusion. Cystathione beta synthase has a key role in the methionine cycle as part of the one-carbon metabolic cycle in the production of sulphur-containing-amino-acids and is involved through its substrate in bone health []. CBS acts on its substrate  homocysteine  to regulate the conservation of methionine or the synthesis of cysteine via the trans–sulfuration pathway. The  gene has been reported to be highly expressed in embryonic and post-natal bone [] and there is considerable evidence that high homocysteine levels  may affect collagen cross-linking and hence osteoporosis e.g. [  ]. However  there is limited evidence to support any specific mechanism. Early studies suggested that high levels of homocysteine resulted in higher solubility of collagen from a small number of affected individuals [] and it is suggested that the mechanism may be a decrease in the activity of lysyl oxidase  which catalyses the crosslinking of collagen observed in vivo in chicks []. However the effect was not observed in vitro  so the inhibition was not assumed to be direct []. There were other genes for which the fold change in expression between the genotypes was much less than that for   three at the same locus as  on chromosome 1 and one on chromosome 4.  () is involved in ribosomal production but the literature focuses on its effects on extracellular matrix gene expression  tumor growth  and metastasis of cancer cells []. There are no reports of effects on bone although the extracellular matrix can of course include collagens.  () plays a role in conserved signal transduction pathways and may be part of a mechanism that maintains sodium balance in cells []. There is one report that suggests that it may play a role in osteoclast differentiation [].  () is a component involved in the catalysis of glycolysis of proteins. We found no reports of a role in bone  but it is involved in blood cell glycolysis. The gene that was not at the locus on chromosome 1 was - () and is principally recognised as an RNA binding molecule with anti-viral properties  but it has also been mentioned as a potential candidate for osteoporosis in a study on human monocytes []. Since we started with the discovery of a QTL in an F2 population  we fine mapped the locus by returning to the founder population from which the high and low bone strength hens used in the cross were divergently selected. This allowed us to benefit from access to more recombinants. The same denser marker set was also used in the original F2 population and both approaches  as expected  identified a similar region. The SNPs at the QTL were highly significantly associated with tibia strength  with an additive effect of<U+2009>~<U+2009>8 Newton in breaking strength. This represents a large effect given a population mean for breaking strength of<U+2009>~<U+2009>200 Newton. As expected for a genuine QTL  the addition of more markers in the F2 population improved the confidence of the result and therefore narrowed down the region. The QTL seems to be located on chromosome 1 between 104.1 and 110.4 Mb on the galGal6 assembly  whereas the flanking markers from the F2 population put the location at galGal6  Chr 1: 107.0-113.1 for bone index and the bone index component  tibiotarsus breaking strength  although the estimated QTL peak position for the humerus breaking strength was galGal6  Chr 1: 90.2 Mb. The positions for the bone index and tibiotarsus QTL were strongly supported by the evidence from the NGS expression data from mid-shaft tibia from individuals with the Ost112522587/Ost106225194; / vs. / genotypes. Between the two genotypes  we observed a group of genes with differences in expression that clustered around the gene with the largest expression difference   on chromosome 1 (galGal6  Chr 1: 111 011 730-111 028 603). Expression data from heterozygotes for the low and high bone strength alleles showed allelic imbalance in the expression of . This clearly indicated that the difference in expression was due to a cis-acting effect and not a trans-acting effect. In other words  it was unlikely that there was any involvement of a transcription factor transcribed from the region  acting on expression  as this would affect both alleles. In a complementary paper  we have identified a region of six tandem repeats in the promoter region of the  gene  which resulted in differences in the level of methylation and transcriptional activity  and which segregates with the alternative genotypes []. This may explain the differences in expression. However  applying Occam’s razor  the simplest possibility for the observed differences in bone strength between the genotypes might be the difference in the predicted amino-acid sequence of the  gene at position 498 from a lysine (K) to a glutamine (Q). Differences in expression could be the result of differences in feedback mechanisms if the enzyme activity was more or less active than the ‘wild type’ gene and protein. However  the results from the allelic imbalance study does not support the hypothesis that the observed effects were due to differences in feedback because of a faulty copy of the CBS enzyme. If a faulty copy of CBS was present  we would expect both copies to be equally affected by any feedback in a heterozygous individual and this was not the case. Of course  it could be that a combination of differences in the enzyme and a site in the promoter or enhancer through which the feedback mechanism works could be linked  but this seems less likely. Finally and more directly  we did not observe a difference in the activity of the two allozymes when they were tested. The chicken and the turkey genomes predict a glutamine (Q) at position 498 in the CBS protein  and glutamine has a non-charged polar side chain. Lysine (K)  which has a charged side chain seems universal in predictions from other bird genomes. Lysine is also present in the chicken at this position when the glutamine codon is not present  as we have seen in this study. Reptiles feature glutamine (Q) or aspartic acid (D) at this position in the CBS protein; these amino-acids possess a charged side chain with a negative charge. In mammals  it seems that threonine (T)  another non-charged polar side chain amino-acid  is almost universal. Therefore  there is no indication that the charge at the position is conserved or that the difference in charge at this position might lead to a large effect on the enzyme’s activity. The results of the assays of enzyme activity in our study confirmed this with neither Vmax nor Km differing between the forms. The level of plasma homocysteine  which is the substrate for the CBS enzyme  differed significantly between the genotypes at 48 and 70 weeks of age  with plasma concentrations of homocysteine being about 2 µMol/L higher for  hens than for  hens at both ages. The difference is relatively small (~<U+2009>10%)  in comparison to the difference in expression of the gene that is about nine-fold. In a study on human patients  in which groups from the extreme ends of the observed range were constituted  the means for plasma homocysteine were 7 and 28 µMol/L []. In our population  the maximum and minimum levels of homocysteine observed were 6 and 26 µMol/L. If we used a similar approach to that of the human study  the extreme groups would have means of 12 and 23 µMol/L  respectively. Therefore  the distribution of homocysteine values in the plasma from a normal population of chickens varies to a similar extent to that observed in humans. In humans  the correlations observed between plasma homocysteine and collagen cross-links [] were across a much larger range of plasma homocysteine concentrations than what we observed in this study. Therefore  contrary to what was expected  we observed both higher gene expression and higher homocysteine levels in the plasma of carriers of the  allele associated with lower bone strength. At least  this is consistent with the observation that higher plasma homocysteine is associated with poorer bone quality. Since we have established that there is no large difference in the activity of the enzyme between genotypes  we could expect higher gene expression to be correlated with increased protein activity and a potential reduction in the substrate homocysteine []. Certainly  the presence of inactivating mutations in the  gene results in hyperhomocysteinemia []. It is also stated that mutations in CBS result in only mild increases in plasma homocysteine but these are more evident after a methionine load  with more marked effects being observed in defects of the re-methylation pathway []. Across the different analyses performed in this paper  we see a consistent effect of the  genotype being associated with greater bone strength. The exceptions were the analyses involving small numbers of hens  but this is almost certainly an effect of power. For example  for the samples used for NGS  the difference in cortical density tended to show a denser structure only for the  genotype although the medullary bone was significantly denser in individuals with the  genotype. However  there was a very clear effect on gene expression. Similarly  in the samples for which we examined the physicochemical properties of the bone between genotypes  we did not observe a significant effect on the bone mechanical properties but there were clear effects on the bone mineral chemistry and structure properties. Specifically  there was a higher degree of mineralization and higher degree of crystal orientation in cortical bone in individuals with the  genotype  which was accompanied by lower MinCO 1415 in the tibia cortical bone. All these characteristics are typical of more mature bone  which has a higher degree of mineralization. This could be caused by a decreased turnover rate that slows down the renewal of bone tissue [  ]. There was also more crosslinking of collagen in the tibial cortical bone (LNK 1660/1690)  which is characteristic of older bone tissue. This suggests that the bone from the stronger genotype was associated with greater mineralisation  which is consistent with its higher density  the bone is also more mature  possibly with a higher degree of cross-links in the collagen which is not favoured by high homocysteine levels and therefore agrees with the observed lower plasma homocysteine []. Mineralization of the bone organic matrix occurs via the oriented nucleation of apatite crystals within the collagen fibre gaps as well as in the outer surface of collagen fibrils []. Any change in collagen structure caused by different levels of homocysteine could impact the mineralization of bone as in osteomalicia or osteogenesis imperfecta  which are caused by an alteration of collagen structure and produce abnormal mineralization of the organic matrix [    ]. These differences in bone properties are in contrast to the observations made between the divergently selected lines that were used to create the original F2  which were derived from the same line []. Between these lines there were no effects  although exercise did result in changes to the physico-chemical attributes of the bone []  many of which are similar to those observed in this study  including the increased cross-linking. However  in that study the bones were sampled from hens that probably differ at many genetic loci as they were selected on the trait  not on a specific genotype. Whereas  in the samples examined in our study for the physico-chemical attributes of the bone  the hens were selected on a single genetic locus. Although the locus explained a relatively large effect  this was still small compared to the difference between the selected lines that gave rise to the F2 individuals that were initially used to discover the QTL []. Indeed this exemplifies the problems of studying the individual locus underlying variation in a quantitative trait. Even if the locus effect is relatively large  it is still likely to reach a magnitude that  for many measurements related to the trait  would require extremely large numbers of animals to resolve at a physiological or biochemical level how exactly the genetic locus exerts its effect. There are a number of independent studies that have identified genetic loci for bone quality by using mainly crosses between fast and slower growing chicken strains with a risk of confounding effects of body weight; these studies include QTL that show relatively wide confidence limits  some which coincide with the QTL studied in this manuscript []. Our study and other previously published ones have located a number of loci across the genome  which are potential candidates for bone quality  some of which may be relevant to layers  often featuring bone density or mineral content [      ]. Although some report QTL on chromosome 1  these do not appear to coincide with the QTL that we fine-mapped in this study [  ]. Using a genome-wide association approach in one of the populations in this study  loci with a larger effect than the  loci have been observed  which suggests we can make progress in finding the underlying mechanism for these loci if large enough samples can be assembled []. We have confirmed and fine-mapped a genetic locus that affects the mechanical and physico-chemical properties of bone in laying hens. The physico-chemical properties of the bones from the two genotypes suggest that greater mineralisation and maturity of collagen cross-linking may be responsible for the improved quality of bone. We have identified a gene that encodes an enzyme  i.e. the  gene  which shows significantly different levels of expression between genotypes at the QTL. Adjacent genes to  are also differentially expressed  which suggests that a -acting enhancer operates at the locus. The genotype associated with higher expression of the  gene and poorer bone quality shows a small but significantly increased expression in the enzyme’s substrate  homocysteine. A number of studies have shown effects of raised plasma homocysteine in relation to poor bone quality but the effects reported here are small by comparison to those studied in humans. Although there are differences in the CBS protein sequence at one amino-acid  we cannot detect a difference in enzyme activity that could explain the observed phenotype in bone quality  and the difference in expression of the gene and the effect on the substrate concentration are not consistent. Therefore  although we have confirmed and extended the observations on this locus and have revealed the underlying cause of the phenotype  which is a localised region of gene expression differences  we cannot say that we have proven that  is the gene responsible. It may be necessary to look at other genes in the region to answer the question of which gene or genes make a difference to bone quality. From a practical point of view  in the meantime  markers at this locus can be used to improve bone quality and nutritional interventions to modify homocysteine levels and thus improve bone quality are possible.

In fact  with a large dataset including 80k individuals  the predictive performance of deep learning methods was similar or slightly better than that of parametric methods for traits with non-additive gene action. For prediction of traits with non-additive gene action  gradient boosting was a robust method. Deep learning approaches were not better for genomic prediction unless non-additive variance was sizable. Quantitative genetics theory was established a century ago when Sir Ronald Fisher introduced the infinitesimal model []. Theory was mainly developed in the absence of directly observable genotypic data and persisted for decades. However  with the advent of DNA sequencing technologies  the understanding of the genetic background of complex traits has increased. Using the large amounts of molecular genetic data that are currently collected  several studies indicated that epistasis is pervasive in agricultural species [  ]. However  for prediction of complex traits  the additive model is typically a default assumption in conventional statistical methods since additivity is a close approximation in most cases. Nevertheless  some methods free of assumptions about the genetic architecture of loci that underlie complex traits have been suggested for the prediction of complex phenotypes. These methods include machine-learning techniques and genetic algorithms [  ]. Machine-learning methods focus on prediction without using a pre-conceived model. On the other hand  conventional statistical approaches formalize relations between variables in the form of explicit mathematical models with parameters that are interpretable in the context of some theory. Machine learning is increasingly used to deal with problems in analyzing big data and in situations where the number of parameters is much larger than the number of observations. Machine learning has been extensively applied in image processing data  audio recognition and text mining  and the learning algorithms are model specification free and may capture unforeseen information from high-throughput datasets []. This is appealing in genomic association studies where important signals may be clustered within genic regions composed of upstream and downstream UTR  introns and exons. The boundaries between genic regions are determined by patterns in the nucleotide sequences. Moreover  interaction between loci is prevalent and recombination hotspots are not uniformly distributed across the genome. Some advanced machine-learning algorithms such as ensemble methods and deep learning (DL) algorithms might help in genome-enabled prediction. Ensemble methods  such as random forests (RF) [] and boosting []  are appealing machine-learning alternatives to conventional statistical methods to analyze complex traits using high-density genetic markers. Indeed  these methods have been already used in genomic prediction using both real and simulated datasets [    ]. Boosting and RF are model specification free and may account for non-additive effects. Moreover  they are fast algorithms  even when handling a large number of covariates and interactions and can be used in both classification and regression problems. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine-learning procedures that were originally inspired by the structure and function of the brain and essentially describe a class of neural networks with a large number of nodes and layers. In genomics  DL algorithms have been applied in many areas  largely driven by massive increases in computing power and access to big data. DL algorithms such as the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) might be able to exploit unknown patterns of linkage disequilibrium and of interactions between markers. Recently  some studies have examined DL performance in prediction of complex traits in human and agricultural species [   ]. Bellot et al. [] concluded that CNN was competitive to linear models for the prediction of human complex traits  but they did not find any trait where DL outperformed the linear models significantly. Ma et al. [] reported that DL performed better than genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) in prediction of wheat traits. Similarly  Montesinos-López et al. [] concluded that DL was better than GBLUP when genotype<U+2009>×<U+2009>environment (G<U+2009>×<U+2009>E) interaction was ignored for the prediction of wheat and maize traits. Waldmann [] using simulation and real pig data found that a shallow MLP performed better than GBLUP and Bayesian LASSO. In short  so far  the evidence does not point to a uniformly better performance of DL methods. Actually  the performance of DL was dismal in some instances examined in Bellot et al. []. Most agricultural and human traits have a multifactorial inheritance  with multiple and complex relationships among genes  and between genes with environments. Moreover  linkage disequilibrium across the genome creates ambiguous patterns that complicate the prediction of unobserved phenotypes. Perhaps  DL might be able to better exploit the unknown pattern of disequilibrium among SNPs and capture interaction effects across the genome using large available genotypic and phenotypic data. As such  our objective was to evaluate the predictive ability of two DL methods (MLP and CNN) versus two popular ensemble methods  namely gradient boosting (GB) and RF  with two parametric methods  GBLUP and Bayes B  used as benchmark. The context was whole-genome prediction of real bull fertility with simulations used to supplement the study. A real dataset consisting of 11 790 US Holstein bulls with sire conception rate (SCR) records was used. The SCR evaluation represents the US national phenotypic evaluation of dairy bull fertility. This evaluation of bull fertility is based on cow field data  i.e.  confirmed pregnancy records  and it is considered a phenotypic rather than a genetic evaluation because the fertility estimates include both genetic and non-genetic effects. The current model for evaluating bull fertility considers not only factors related to the bull under evaluation  but also factors (nuisance variables) associated with the cow that receives the unit of semen []. The SCR records were obtained from 30 consecutive evaluations provided to the US dairy industry between August 2008 and August 2018. These 30 SCR evaluations are available at the CDCB website (). The estimated genomic heritability of SCR is 0.30 []. The reliabilities of the SCR records  calculated as a function of the number of breedings  were also available. For bulls with multiple fertility evaluations  the most reliable SCR record  i.e.  the SCR record with the most breedings  was used in the analyses. Genome-wide SNP data for the US Holstein bulls were kindly provided by the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository (CDDR). A total of 60 671 SNPs used for genomic evaluation in the US dairy cattle [] were selected for genetic analysis. SNPs that mapped to chromosome X  had a minor allele frequency lower than 5%  missing rate higher than 5%  and a -value for Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium less than 10 were removed from the genotype data using PLINK 2.00 []. After quality control  57 749 SNPs were retained for genomic prediction. We used stochastic simulation to attain a better understanding of the performance of the deep learning methods under various genetic architectures. A quantitative trait was simulated based on the observed genotypes consisting of 57 749 SNPs from two datasets. The first dataset was composed of the 11 790 individuals with SCR records and the second dataset involved 80 000 genotyped bulls provided by CDDR. To measure the predictive ability of the different methods used  two scenarios of number of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) were considered  either small (<U+2009>=<U+2009>100) or large (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000). QTN locations were distributed across the genome in two different ways: (i) clustered QTN randomly sampling one-third of QTN from the SNPs across the genome as core QTN  with two SNPs surrounding each core QTN also treated as QTN  and (ii) randomly located QTN across the genome. Two scenarios of gene action were simulated: purely additive and a combination of additive  dominance and two-locus epistasis effects. Hereafter  we call the latter as “non-additive gene action”. The additive and non-additive effects were generated as follows. The allele substitution effects () were drawn from a standard normal distribution and each was formulated as   where  and  are additive and dominance effects  respectively  and  is the allelic frequency with . In order to produce a purely additive trait  the dominance effect was set to zero. The additive genetic values were calculated by multiplying the genotype codes by the QTN substitution effects and summing over the QTN. The phenotypic value of each individual  () was created by adding a normally distributed residual  to the sum over QTN (genetic values) as shown below: where  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 ..  ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 …) is an element of the incidence marker matrix for additive genetic effects () and  is a random residual  where  is the residual variance. Genotypes were coded as 0 for “”  1 for “”  and 2 for “” to capture additive effects. The simplest type of epistasis is a two-locus model in which each locus has two alleles interacting with each other. Epistasis was simulated only between pairs of QTL including additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>additive (A<U+2009>×<U+2009>A)  additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>dominance (A<U+2009>×<U+2009>D)  dominance<U+2009>×<U+2009>additive (D<U+2009>×<U+2009>A)  and dominance<U+2009>×<U+2009>dominance (D<U+2009>×<U+2009>D) effects. Each QTN interacted with three surrounding QTN. The elements of the incidence matrix () for modeling dominance effects were equal to 0  1 and 0 for genotypes “”  “” and “”  respectively. We simulated overdominance only because incomplete dominance may be partly captured by an additive model  which would not be the case for overdominance. Once the two loci involved in the interaction were defined  an interaction matrix was created via a Hadamard product of corresponding elements of the additive () or dominance () genotype matrices. For instance  a coefficient of 0 was assigned if two genotypes were 0 0 or 0 -  a coefficient of<U+2009>1 if the two genotypes were 1 1  a coefficient of 2 if the two genotypes were 1 2 or 2 1 and a coefficient of 4 if the two genotypes were 2 2. It should be noted that the final coding for A<U+2009>×<U+2009>D or D<U+2009>×<U+2009>A interaction matrices was 0  1 and 2  since the genotype code for the dominance matrix was 0 and 1. The codes for the D<U+2009>×<U+2009>D interaction matrix were 0 or 1. Each pair of interacting loci was assigned four types of interaction effects: (i)   (ii)   (iii)  and (iv) . Here   and  represent the  and  QTN. Each type of epistatic effects was sampled from a gamma distribution with the parameters shown in Table . The effect sign was sampled to be positive or negative  each with probability 0.5. The phenotype was created by adding  to the sum of simulated additive  dominance and epistatic QTN effects: where      and  are the A<U+2009>×<U+2009>A  A<U+2009>×<U+2009>D  D<U+2009>×<U+2009>A and D<U+2009>×<U+2009>D epistatic effects between QTN  and   respectively. Parameters used for the simulation of additive and non-additive situations are in Table . It should be noted that when the number of QTN increases from 100 to 1000  the absolute value of additive effects at each QTN decreases. Thus  additive effects depend on the number of QTN; however  the absolute value of epistatic effects did not depend on the number of QTN. Hence  by increasing the number of QTN  the total epistatic and phenotypic variance increased  but the additive variance was constant. Hence  the narrow sense heritability decreased but broad sense heritability increased. Four machine-learning algorithms  including two ensemble methods (RF  GB) and two deep learning algorithms (MLP and CNN) were evaluated. The machine-learning algorithms were compared against two standard statistical methods known as GBLUP [] and Bayes B []. : BLUP is one of the most extensively used regression methods for genomic prediction [  ]. The statistical model of GBLUP can be written as: where  is an n-vector of phenotypes   is an n-vector of ones   is the population mean   is a vector of random additive genomic values [] where  () is the additive genomic relationship matrix between genotyped individuals constructed as  where  is the matrix of centered and standardized genotypes for all individuals and  is the number of markers  and  is the additive genomic variance   is the vector of random residual effects [] with  being the residual variance  and  is the identity matrix. GBLUP was implemented using the BGLR package [] in the R language/environment  version 3.6.1 [] as a member of reproducing kernel Hilbert space regression methods []. The Gibbs sampler was run for 100 000 iterations  with a 10 000 burn-in period and a thinning interval of 10 iterations  i.e.  9000 samples were used for inference. : Bayes B is a widely used genomic regression procedure []  and here we used it together with GBLUP as benchmark against the machine-learning techniques considered. The phenotype of the th individual is expressed as a linear regression on markers: where  (individual)   (SNPs)   is the phenotypic value for individual    is the mean of phenotypes   is an element of the incidence matrix () for marker  and individual    is a random effect of marker   and  is a random residual. In matrix form  the model can be written as: . Contrary to Bayesian BLUP and Bayes A []  Bayes B assumes a priori that all markers do not contribute to genetic variation equally. As noted by Gianola []  Bayes B poses that all markers have a two-component mixture prior distribution. In fact  a given marker has either a null effect with known prior probability    or a  prior distribution with probability   with  degrees of freedom and scale parameter . The inferences about model unknown parameters were obtained via Gibbs sampling from the posterior distribution. Bayes B was implemented using the BGLR package [] in the R language/environment  version 3.6.1 []. The Gibbs sampler was run for 100 000 iterations  a 10 000 burn-in period and a thinning interval of 10 iterations. : RF is a modification of bootstrap aggregating that builds a large collection of identically distributed trees  and then averages out the results. It takes  bootstrap samples from training data [] and randomly selects subsets of features as candidate predictors for splitting tree nodes. Each tree minimizes the average loss function in the bootstrapped data and is constructed using the following algorithm: For  bootstrap samples : Draw bootstrap samples of size  from the training dataset. Grow a random-forest tree  with the bootstrapped data  by recursively repeating the following steps for each terminal node of the tree  until the minimum node size is reached. Draw randomly  out of the  SNPs. Pick the best SNP among the  SNPs. Split the node into two child nodes. Output the ensemble of trees . The predicted value of testing set () individual with genotype  is calculated as . For details on the theory of RF  the readers are referred to Breiman [] and Waldmann []. Three hyperparameters  including number of trees ()  number of features sampled in each iteration ()  and number of samples in the final nodes () must be defined by the user. We assessed various combinations of values of <U+2009>=<U+2009>(200  500  1000)  <U+2009>=<U+2009>(500  1000  2000  5000)  with the default <U+2009>=<U+2009>5. The configuration with the minimum out of-bag (OOB) error was <U+2009>=<U+2009>500  <U+2009>=<U+2009>2000 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>5. The random forest package [] in the R language/environment  version 3.6.1 [] was used for implementing RF. : Boosting is a machine-learning ensemble method that converts weak learners into strong learners  either for classification or regression problems in order to reduce both bias and variance []. We implemented XGBoost  which is a popular and efficient form of the gradient boosted trees algorithm. Here  each tree learns from its predecessors and updates the residual errors using the entire dataset. Boosting can also account for interactions between features  automatically select features  and is robust with respect to outliers  missing data and presence of irrelevant features. Gradient boosting adds new predictors to an ensemble machine sequentially. However  instead of changing the weights for every incorrectly predicted phenotype at each iteration  like AdaBoost []  the gradient boosted tree method attempts to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous model. More details on the gradient boosting are in [     ]. Three hyperparameters must be tuned in boosting: (i) depth of tree  (ii) rate at which the gradient boosting learns  and (iii) number of trees or iterations. The depth of tree and learning rate were determined by five-fold cross-validation. The number of iterations (trees) was determined by examining if the mean squared error in the tuning set had not decreased further during 50 subsequent iterations. We bagged 80% of the training data at each boosting iteration  and the remaining 20% were used as out-of-bag samples. The final value for learning rate was 0.10 and tree depth was 3. We implemented the gradient boosted tree algorithm using the XGBoost package []. Deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision  machine translation  and automatic driving  and evaluating its potential for applications in genomics  medicine  and healthcare is an important area of research. There are three common families of supervised DL algorithms: (i) multi-layer perceptron (MLP)  (ii) convolutional neural network (CNN) and (iii) recurrent neural network. For a description on each type of network  its assumptions and input features see Goodfellow et al. [] and Pérez-Enciso and Zingaretti []. In this study  we implemented MLP and CNN learning algorithms and a brief explanation of each method is provided below. MLP is also known as feed-forward neural network or densely connected neural network. In MLP  the information flows from the input layer to the output layer. The MLP is composed of three types of layers: input layer  hidden layers  and output layer. Figure a presents a diagram of a three-layer MLP with five input layer units  six hidden layer units  and one output layer unit. Here  h  h …  h are called hidden layer units because they are not directly observed. A single hidden layer MLP model can be represented in the following form: where  is the vector of predicted observations   and  denote the weight matrices that relate the input genotype matrix  of dimension  to the output layer of  of dimension  through the hidden layer. The dimension of the  matrices is number of units in the  layer times number of units in the  layer  where units are neurons and  is the layer number. Parameter  is the activation function modeling the connection between the two consecutive layers and  is the bias (intercept) matrix associated with  and . In regression problems  the activation function for connecting the last hidden layer to the output layer is typically chosen to be linear or the Gaussian radial basis function.  Representation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. Each unit is connected to the units of previous layers by a weighted linear summation  here represented by weight matrices  and an activation function. Redrawn from: .  Representation of a convolutional neural network (CNN). (i) The input layer consists of the SNP markers. (ii) Convolution layer consists of  filters  which capture the information in input layer by moving filters horizontally with a stride of “s” SNPs. (iii) Pooling layer involves of filters  combining the output of the previous convolution layer at certain locations into a single neuron. (iv) Fully connected layers connect every neuron in previous layer to every neuron in next layer. ‘ReLU’ indicates the rectified linear unit; softReLU indicates smooth rectified linear unit; Dropout indicates the dropout conduct layer For regression problems  the loss function is usually: where  is the Euclidean squared norm. When the number of predictors () is larger than the number of observations ()  the MLP over-fits the data  and hence  it is required to regularize the MLP parameters <U+2009>=<U+2009>{    }. The regularization factors are introduced during optimization. One typical regularization term is the l penalty through weight decay parameters   which need to be learned via some search algorithms or cross-validation. Therefore  the loss function to minimize is: Before the implementation of MLP  some hyperparameters should be defined by the user  including the number of layers  the number of units per layer  the activation function for each layer  weight decay  learning rate  dropout value  batch size  number of iterations or epochs  and the optimization algorithm. For more information see Waldmann [] and Pérez-Enciso and Zingaretti []. We determined the best set of hyperparameter values by a grid search over a range of values using the whole real dataset. We evaluated the optimization algorithm<U+2009>=<U+2009>[‘SGD’  ‘RMSprop’  ‘Adagrad’  ‘Adadelta’  ‘Adam’  ‘Adamax’  ‘Nadam’]  batch size<U+2009>=<U+2009>[32  64  128  256]  epochs<U+2009>=<U+2009>[50  100  200  500  1000]  learning rate<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.001  0.01  0.1  0.2  0.3]  weight decay<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.00001  0.0001  0.001  0.01]  dropout rate<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4]  units<U+2009>=<U+2009>[8  16  32  64  128]  and layers<U+2009>=<U+2009>[1  2  3]. The configuration with the highest prediction accuracy (smaller root mean-squared error) was optimization algorithm<U+2009>=<U+2009>’SGD’  batch size<U+2009>=<U+2009>32  epochs<U+2009>=<U+2009>200  learning rate<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01  weight decay<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00001  dropout rate<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.1  0.1]  units<U+2009>=<U+2009>[64  32] and hidden layers<U+2009>=<U+2009>2. The nonlinear activation function for the first hidden layer was the rectifier linear unit (“ReLU”) and for the second hidden layer it was “softReLU”. The momentum hyperparameter was considered as 0.5. As a rule of thumb  the more data are available  the smaller dropout value is required. In general  the total number of weights in the hidden layers should be at most 1/2 of the training sample size. MLP was fitted with MXNet package [] in the R language/environment  version 3.6.1 []. Basically  a CNN [  ] is a specialized kind of neural network  where some spatially invariant patterns among the inputs are expected  for example linkage disequilibrium between nearby SNPs in the case of genomic data. As opposed to MLP  where hidden layers are only composed of fully connected layers  in CNN the hidden layers consist of convolutional layers  pooling layers  and fully connected layers. During the training process  a CNN algorithm is able to capture hidden information in the inputs through application of “filters” or kernels in convolution layers. A filter is known as a collection of input values where the weights are the same for all input windows (e.g.  SNP windows). A filter is moved across the input matrix  and at each SNP window of the genotype matrix  the CNN computes the local weighted sum and returns an output value. The learned filter moves to the right side of the genotype data with a certain window size until it explains the complete width. Then  the filter moves to the beginning of the next row with the same window size and repeats the process until the entire genotype matrix is traversed. To make the filters slightly invariant to small changes in the input and  also  for dimensionality reduction  a pooling layer is added after each convolutional layer. The pooling layer is usually applied to smooth out the results; it consists of merging the filter outputs of the previous convolutional layer by taking the mean  maximum  or minimum of all values of those filters. Figure b represents a general diagram of CNN in a genomic prediction context. For more details on the application of DL in the genomic context  see Bellot et al. [] and Pérez-Enciso and Zingaretti []. The initial values of hyperparameters in our CNN were set based on the papers by Bellot et al. [] and Ma et al. []. Given that those studies used human and plant datasets  we applied the heuristic search of hyperparameters to find the most appropriate values in the back propagation algorithm []. The CNN was built with one input layer  one convolutional layer (16 filters)  one pooling layer  two fully connected layers (32 and one units  respectively)  two dropout layers and one output layer (one unit). Other hyperparameter values used were 200 for number of epochs  64 for batch size  0.01 for learning rate  0.5 for momentum  and 0.00001 for weight decay. The genotypic matrix was fed to the CNN as input layer. The first convolutional layer extracted the features from the input matrix using 16 filters each with 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>5 window size with a stride size of 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>3  followed by a max-pooling layer with window size of 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 and a stride size of 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>2. A dropout layer with a rate of 0.3 was assigned to the max-pooling layer. The first fully connected layer with 32 units was used after the convolutional layer with a dropout rate of 0.3. The ReLU activation function was applied in the convolutional layer and a softrelu function was used in the first fully connected layers. The output of the first fully connected layer was then fed to the second fully connected layer with one unit by a softrelu activation function. The output of the second fully connected layer is eventually connected to the output layer using a linear activation function  which presents the individual predicted phenotypic value. The CNN method was fitted with DeepGS package [] in the R language/environment  version 3.6.1 []. The predictive ability of the different methods in the real dataset was assessed as the correlation between predicted and observed phenotypes  and the mean squared error of prediction (MSE) using 10 replicates of a five-fold cross validation. In the simulated dataset  predictive ability was evaluated as the correlation between true genotypic values and predicted genomic values  using five replications of a five-fold cross-validation design with 10 iterations. Training and testing sets were the same in both the real data and the simulation datasets. We compared learning machines using two different types of predictor variables: (i) genotypes at causal loci  and (ii) genotypes at SNPs. In the former case  statistical methods were fitted using the genotypes at causal variants as predictors. In the latter case  to mimic the real SNP data  QTN were excluded from the genotypic matrix and genomic prediction was performed using only the genotypes at SNPs. It has been argued that machine-learning methods are data hungry; hence we used a larger dataset consisting of 80 000 animals to compare the six methods. Due to the computational burden  only the most complicated simulation scenario consisting of a complex trait with non-additive gene action and 1000 QTN with a clustered distribution was tested. All analyses were successfully completed on the UF Research Computing HiPerGator supercomputer (). Figure  displays the predictive correlation (left panel) and the mean squared error of prediction (MSE  right panel) of the six prediction methods for the bull (real) dataset. The largest predictive correlation was delivered by GB (0.36) and Bayes B (0.34)  followed by GBLUP (0.33)  RF (0.32)  CNN (0.29) and MLP (0.26). Among the machine-learning approaches  the predictive correlation of CNN was 12% greater than for MLP  but 10% lower than for RF. Although predictive correlation is a simple way of measuring predictive ability  MSE is a preferred metric because it considers both prediction bias and variance. In this sense  Boosting and Bayes B delivered the lowest MSE  followed by GBLUP  RF  CNN and MLP. Figure S1 [see Additional file : Figure S1] shows the trend of MSE in the training and validation sets over iterations for MLP; this graph clearly shows that overfitting was not an issue. Predictive correlation (left panel) and mean squared error of prediction (right panel) of two conventional statistical methods (GBLUP and Bayes B) and four machine-learning methods including random forests (RF)  gradient boosting (Boosting)  multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) . The whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals We investigated the effect of gene action  number of QTN and QTN distribution across the genome  and of sample size  on the predictive ability of the different methods considered. We used two sets of predictors: (i) genotypes at causal loci and (ii) genotypes at marker loci. The predictive ability of different methods using only genotypes at causal loci is shown in Fig. . This section illustrates how prediction machines work in an idealized situation where all true QTN are known. When gene action was purely additive  classical statistical methods outperformed machine-learning methods regardless of the number of QTN controlling the trait. Among the machine-learning algorithms  GB (QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>100) and GB and MLP (QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000) attained the best predictive performance (Fig. a  c). Interestingly  CNN performed quite well when QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 but it was the worst method when QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000. When gene action was non-additive (Fig. b  d)  GB exhibited the highest predictive performance among the six methods evaluated  regardless of the number of QTN controlling the trait. The predictive performance of the other five methods depended on the number of causal loci: when QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>100  the two deep learning algorithms delivered higher predictive correlations and lower MSE values than either GBLUP or Bayes B; however  when the number of QTN was large (QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000)  the two classical statistical methods outperformed both MLP and CNN  and also RF (Fig. b). Notably  when QTN were distributed as clustered  the predictive ability of all methods was greater than when the causal loci were distributed randomly across the genome [see Additional file : Figures S2  S3  and S4]. Predictive ability of two conventional statistical methods (GBLUP and Bayes B) and four machine-learning methods including random forests (RF)  gradient boosting (Boosting)  multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) . Predictive ability was evaluated using predictive correlation    and mean squared error   . Different numbers of causal QTN (100 or 1000) and two scenarios of gene action  namely additive and a combination of additive  dominance and epistasis were investigated. The QTN were distributed as clustered across the entire genome. Overall  under the same gene action  when the number of causal loci affecting the trait increased  the predictive correlation decreased and MSE increased (Fig.  a  b). Clearly  RF did not perform well when there was a large number of causal loci involved  regardless of the gene action. The predictive ability of the six different learning machines using genotypes at marker loci under different genetic architectures is shown in Fig. . Regardless of the number and distribution of QTN  when gene action was purely additive  Bayes B outperformed both GBLUP and the four machine-learning methods (Fig. a  c). Under an additive architecture  GB and MLP were the best machine-learning methods when QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and QTN<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000  respectively. Interestingly  when there were additive  dominance and epistasis effects  the performance of the six methods depended on the number of QTN controlling the trait. When a small number of QTN was simulated  the largest predictive correlation was delivered by GB followed by Bayes B and GBLUP (Fig. b). However  when the number of QTN was large  parametric methods outperformed machine-learning methods (Fig. b  d). Predictive ability of two conventional statistical methods (GBLUP and Bayes B) and four machine-learning methods including random forests (RF)  gradient boosting (Boosting)  multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) . Predictive ability was evaluated using predictive correlation    and mean squared error   . Different numbers of QTN (100 or 1000) and two scenarios of gene action  namely additive and a combination of additive  dominance and epistasis were investigated. The QTN were distributed as clustered across the genome Notably  machine-learning algorithms were less sensitive to changes in gene action than classical parametric methods. For instance  by moving from additive to non-additive genetic architectures  the predictive ability of Bayes B decreased by about 15%  but the predictive ability of CNN decreased by only 3%. Interestingly  GB exhibited a slightly better predictive performance in the non-additive compared to the additive genetic architecture when the number of QTN was large. Predictive ability using 80k individuals and 58k SNPs under different genetic architectures is shown in Fig. . Due to the computational burden  we explored only the most complex gene action (additive<U+2009>+<U+2009>dominance<U+2009>+<U+2009>epistasis) and 1000 QTN distributed as clustered across the genome. In all cases  the predictive performance increased relative to the performance attained with only 12k individuals. Interestingly  when 12k individuals were used  the parametric methods were better than the deep learning methods. However  when the sample size was large (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>80k)  CNN outperformed classical statistical methods in terms of predictive correlation (0.81 vs. 0.79) but not in MSE. The gain in predictive correlation via increasing sample size was more pronounced for deep learning than for parametric methods  e.g.  12% for CNN but only 3% for Bayes B. Similarly  the decrease in MSE by moving from 12k to 80k individuals was 0.68 for CNN and 0.50 for Bayes B. Predictive ability under two sample sizes  12k and 80k individuals  for two conventional statistical methods (GBLUP and Bayes B) and four machine-learning methods including random forests (RF)  gradient boosting (Boosting)  multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN)  Predictive ability was evaluated using predictive correlation  and mean squared error . The 1000 causal QTN were distributed as clustered across the genome and gene action was a combination of additive  dominance and epistasis effects Our main objective in this study was to evaluate the performance of deep learning algorithms for prediction of complex phenotypes. Sire conception rate in cattle is a complex trait and previous studies have reported both additive and non-additive effects on this trait [  ]. Since the genetic architecture underlying SCR is unclear  we also investigated the performance of learning algorithms using simulated traits under simple (purely additive) and more complex conditions (joint effects of additive  dominance and epistatic interactions). These two architectures served as a ‘stress test’  since parametric methods may not always work well with complex genetic architectures. Here  we used a simple additive model in GBLUP and Bayes B for the analysis of traits with non-additive effects. It has been reported that a statistical model combining additive and epistatic effects performs better than a simple additive model for the analysis of quantitative traits with epistatic architecture []. Machine-learning methods can capture non-additive effects without any assumptions about gene action. Furthermore  differences in predictive ability among machine-learning algorithms could be observed because of the intrinsic ways in which marker information is processed by various methods []. Our results confirmed that the performance of prediction machines depends on the genetic architecture of the trait. Under pure additive actions  conventional statistical methods outperformed machine-learning approaches. However  when there was non-additive action  predictive ability depended on the number of loci controlling the trait. When the trait was controlled by a small number of loci with complex gene actions  machine-learning algorithms performed similarly or even better than conventional statistical models. Simulation results showed that GB had some advantages over other methods under complex gene action and with a small number of QTN (<U+2009>=<U+2009>100) involved. It has been argued that  for complex traits controlled by many genes with epistatic interaction effects  machine-learning methods are promising and have potential to outperform parametric statistical methods [    ]. In contrast  we found that machine-learning methods might be suitable for the prediction of traits with a small number of QTN with strong epistatic effects provided that loci are clustered  as observed in Waldmann []. When prediction of additive genetic values is the primary interest  there may not be any benefit from using methods that capture interactions  as they do not contribute much  if at all  to genetic variance. Nevertheless  when phenotypic predictions are desired  such as predicting semen fertility  machine-learning algorithms incorporating interaction effects may perform better than models capturing only additive effects []. It has also been demonstrated that deep learning algorithms may be useful for predicting individual genotypic value for traits that are affected by genotype-by-environment interactions []. In our simulations  when the number of QTN affecting the trait increased from 100 to 1000  the predictive performance of all methods declined. An explanation may be that a larger sample size is needed to capture the tiny effects of a large number of additive  dominance and interaction effects. We had hypothesized that application of DL for predicting complex traits controlled by a large number of loci would require a large sample size. Indeed  larger sample sizes improved the predictive ability of machine-learning methods  especially GB and CNN  under non-additive genetic architectures. However  a larger sample size did not translate into a marked improvement in prediction accuracy of the parametric methods. Given that the cost of genotyping and sequencing has decreased remarkably over the last decade  which allows now to perform studies with larger sample sizes  the identification of the most accurate and applicable prediction machine is important. We simulated scenarios in which QTN were either randomly distributed across the genome or clustered in particular genomic regions. There is growing evidence that supports the idea that QTN may be located in clusters. For example  Wood et al. [] found 697 significant hits for human height distributed in 423 distinct clusters in the human genome. Clustering of QTN in specific genomic regions could be due to selection for particular combinations of favorable alleles or because of sharing common regulatory elements []. Notably  we found that the performance of the different predictive machines was better when QTN were clustered. Similarly  Bellot et al. [] found that significant SNPs in clusters delivered better predictive performance than significant SNPs uniformly distributed over the genome. Whole-genome prediction differs in a very important way from image or speech recognition tasks []. Complex traits are multifactorial  where environmental factors may differ from individual to individual  and epigenetic marks can affect performance  so that the genotype of an individual may not provide sufficient information to predict phenotypes accurately []. However  there are some similarities between genomics and other domains  for instance genotype–phenotype associations can be viewed as a landscape. This landscape may have extremely steep valleys  where small perturbations in genotype give rise to vastly different phenotypes []. It may also have large plateaus  where seemingly unrelated genotypes yield an equivalent phenotype. There are some caveats with the application of machine learning in genomics: (1) machine-learning and statistical methods both can be used in a prediction context  but machine-learning methods  and DL methods in particular  are not useful for inference []; (2) researchers are often more interested in the biological meaning of a predictive model than in its predictive accuracy  and the ‘black box’ nature of machine-learning methods  especially neural networks with a large number of layers and units  can inhibit interpretation; (3) the loss function when studying association of genotypes with phenotypes may present local minima and maxima  so finding a global optimum is probably difficult; (4) as the number of input variables increases  the number of weights to be learned in a neural network increases exponentially  so the chance of overfitting also increases; (5) the design of a proper network requires considerable knowledge; for instance  in CNN finding the appropriate hyper-parameters for each of the convolutional  pooling  and fully connected layers is very challenging  especially in terms of understanding the biological significance []. We trained two conventional statistical models  GBLUP and Bayes B  along with two tree ensemble learning methods  GB and RF  in order to compare model predictive ability against two common deep learning algorithms  MLP and CNN. For a complex phenotype such as sire conception rate  the best predictive performance was obtained using GB. We also investigated the performance of deep learning methods in a wide range of genetic architectures of simulated complex traits with two different sample sizes. When the genetic architecture of a trait was purely additive  classical parametric methods outperformed machine-learning methods. However  when the gene action was non-additive  GB exhibited the best predictive performance. DL algorithms worked well in the non-additive setting provided that a large sample size was available  but their performance was not entirely consistent. Overall  GB is a robust method in genomic prediction of complex traits and DL does not appear to be a panacea for genome-enabled prediction of complex traits.

These results reveal a mixed architecture of large-effect loci and a polygenic component that consists of multiple smaller-effect loci  suggesting a more complex genetic architecture of Atlantic salmon age at maturity than previously thought. This more complex architecture will have implications for selection on this key trait in aquaculture and for management of wild salmon populations. Characterizing genetic architecture is instrumental for understanding how quantitative traits will change in response to evolutionary processes such as selection  genetic drift  and/or gene flow. Reciprocally  knowledge of genetic architecture can help to elucidate how evolutionary processes lead to particular genetic architectures of quantitative traits  i.e. a few major effect loci (oligogenic) [  ]  many small-effect loci (polygenic) [  ]  or genome-wide effects (omnigenic) [  ]. Empirical examples that demonstrate a variety of genetic architectures for quantitative traits are accumulating for species such as humans [] and domesticated animals []; however  there remains a limited number of characterized genetic architectures for complex traits in wild species. One factor that hampers characterization of genetic architectures  particularly in wild species  is limited sample size. As sample size decreases  the minimum effect size that can be detected increases []. This limitation likely led to a bias in the reported distribution of the genetic architecture for quantitative traits in wild species  for which either very large effect loci are reported []  or a highly polygenic architecture is concluded due to a lack of any significant association being detected []. Aquaculture-reared Atlantic salmon offer an opportunity to overcome sample size limitations. Tens of thousands of individuals are routinely reared in a common environment  from fertilization to maturation. As Atlantic salmon are recently domesticated (just 10 to 15 generations ago) []  the genetic basis of many quantitative traits in domesticated Atlantic salmon is likely shared with that of wild populations. Recently  the genetic basis of sexual maturation has been extensively studied in Atlantic salmon due to its importance in both aquaculture and the wild [         ]. In the wild  maturation is a critical point in an individual’s life history  since it affects fitness-related traits such as growth  survival  and reproductive success []. Large variability in age at maturity is observed in Atlantic salmon  with some individuals returning to their natal rivers to spawn after just 1 year at sea and others spending multiple years at sea before returning (e.g. []). Individuals that delay maturation and spend more years feeding at sea can have a much larger body size and  thus  higher potential fecundity []  compared to individuals that spend only 1 year at sea. However  individuals that spend multiple years at sea increase their likelihood of mortality prior to maturation and spawning compared to individuals that spend less time at sea and return to spawn at a smaller size []. Variability in age and size at maturity is thought to have evolved in order to maximize fitness in highly variable river and ocean environments []. This variability also aids in population stability in the face of environmental change and stochasticity via the portfolio effect—a phenomenon where biological diversity within a species reduces population size fluctuations []. Although beneficial in the wild  variation in age at maturation can be problematic in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Early maturation  as soon as 1 year post-smoltification (referred to as )  causes significant losses in revenue [] because flesh quality degrades during the maturation process []  which can also negatively impact fish health []. For this reason  characterizing the genetic basis of maturation in Atlantic salmon has been of particular interest for aquaculture producers. In addition  knowledge of the genetic architecture of maturation in aquaculture strains will provide insights into the genetic basis of maturation in wild Atlantic salmon and potentially other fish species. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have both been used to identify genetic variation associated with age at maturity in Atlantic salmon [         ]. Using 220K SNP genotypes on 1404 individuals from 57 European populations and genome resequencing data on 32 individuals  Barson et al. [] identified a large-effect locus on chromosome 25    which explained 39% of the phenotypic variation in sea age at maturity for wild European Atlantic salmon. The  gene is an adiposity regulator and is also associated with age at maturity in humans [  ]. Another region on chromosome 9 was also strongly associated with maturation  however  it did not remain significant after population stratification correction  suggesting that this region may be associated with a correlated trait (e.g. body size) that is affected by a common environmental factor (e.g. river catchment area) [  ]. This region contains a transcription factor of the hypothalamus-pituitary–gonadal axis ()  which is also associated with height and age at maturity in humans [  ] and involved in regulating puberty in cattle []. In North American Atlantic salmon  late maturation alleles of  are observed in higher proportions in late-maturing females than in early-maturing females  suggesting that  may also be associated with age at maturity in North American salmon []. QTL studies on aquaculture fish did not identify any QTL on chromosome 25  but did find two QTL (chromosomes 10 and 21) for early maturation in males []. However  GWAS on aquaculture salmon that followed found a significant association between the  region and maturation in some [  ] but not all [  ] aquaculture strains. In addition  markers located on almost all other chromosomes have shown an association with maturation timing in some studies but not in others [      ]. These discrepancies among studies could be due to false positives or  alternatively  false negatives in studies that are under-powered to detect smaller effect loci due to low sample sizes  or they may reflect population differences in genetic architecture. Therefore  in spite of substantial improvement in our understanding of the genetic architecture of maturation timing in Atlantic salmon over the last decade  uncertainties remain regarding the details of its genetic architecture. Here  we conducted a large-scale examination of 11 166 males from a single year-class that were genotyped with a 50K SNP array. We imputed up to a higher density using parents that were genotyped using a 930K SNP array  combined with pedigree information. Using a GWAS  we aimed at further resolving the genetic architecture of maturation timing in male Atlantic salmon and identifying potential candidate genes to provide new insight into the mechanisms involved in determining age at maturity in Atlantic salmon. Fish were sampled from the Norwegian AquaGen Atlantic salmon breeding line. This population is the outcome of a breeding program that began in the 1970’s and stems from crosses of founder individuals that originated from 41 wild Norwegian rivers []. Pedigree information was available from the breeding programme. In total  11 379 individuals were collected: 11 166 male offspring from the 2015 year-class and an additional 213 parents from the 2012 parental year-class. Association testing was not conducted on females because the prevalence of early maturation in females in this population is very low. The sample set of male offspring from the 2015 year-class consisted of 578 full-sibling families  with a mean size of 20 (range: 1 to 64)  and 213 half-sibling families with a mean size of 106 (range 1 to 206). Maturation phenotype was scored using visual assessment for presence of maturation characteristics (developed kype and darkened colouration) for all males from the 2015 year-class as a binary trait: either grilse (early-maturing) or non-grilse. Scoring occurred 27 to 30 months post-fertilization  during the winter months (December-March)  when visible differences between mature and immature fish are strong  and prior to any selection of individuals for optimal growth. Early-maturing individuals were preferentially selected for genotyping to increase effective sample size for downstream GWAS analyses. As a result  the prevalence of early maturation in our study sample is higher than in the population as a whole. The 2015 year-class individuals  consisting of 2104 grilse and 9062 non-grilse  were genotyped using a custom 50K SNP Affymetrix array developed for Atlantic salmon. The SNPs on the 50K array are a subset of those included on the 930K XHD  array (dbSNP accession numbers ss1867919552–ss1868858426) that is described in Barson et al. []. The 930K SNP array was used for genotyping 184 parents from the 2012 year-class. The remaining 29 parents were genotyped using the 50K SNP array. The 930 K XHD  array was filtered to 646 528 SNPs based on genotyping quality (categories PolyHighResolution and NoMinorHom)  minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.001  and correct allele segregation in family material of 840 individuals sampled from the AquaGen strain. All SNPs used in downstream analyses were positioned based on the Atlantic salmon reference genome (assembly ICSASG_v2) []. Pre-phasing of the reference panel of 184 parents that were genotyped with the 930K SNP array was performed using Beagle 4 [  ]. Individuals genotyped with the 50K array were imputed to the pre-phased reference panel (646 528 SNPs) using SHAPEIT v2 [] and the duoHMM method  which incorporates pedigree information to improve phasing accuracy []. We used a window size of 5 Mb for defining haplotypes and incorporated pedigree information  which consisted of 889 parent–offspring duos and 10 248 mother-father-offspring trios from 40 families. Prior to imputation and phasing  we removed 773 SNPs from the 50K array that were not on the 930K reference panel. Following phasing and imputation  134 131 SNPs with a MAF lower than 0.01 were removed using PLINK 1.9 []  leaving 512 397 SNPs for downstream analyses. To assess the accuracy of imputation  we masked genotypes in the 184 parents that had been genotyped with the 930 K array. Masked genotypes consisted of 930K array SNPs that were not on the 50K array. In addition to the parents genotyped with the 930K array that served as a reference panel  individuals with masked genotypes were included as extra individuals in the imputation process described above. We then compared the imputed genotypes to the actual genotypes for the 184 parents and calculated the mean proportion of discordance between imputed and actual genotypes at each site using the -- function in  []. We tested for associations of SNP genotypes with age at maturity of males from the 2015 year-class using the linear mixed model method BOLT-LMM []  which accounts for population structure and relatedness based on the following model: where  is the vector of phenotypes (0/1 for non-grilse/grilse);  is the vector of genotype codes (0/1/2) for the SNP being tested  which was modelled as a fixed effect with  as regression coefficient;  is the genetic effect modelled as a random effect  where  is a matrix of genotypes and  is a vector of SNP effects; and  is the vector of residual errors  modelled as random effects. BOLT-LMM implements a non-infinitesimal model that does not assume equal effect sizes and can  therefore  better accommodate SNPs of large effect  while still effectively modelling smaller genome-wide effects. BOLT-LMM uses two prior distributions of effect sizes () to accommodate both large-effect SNPs and small-effect SNPs []. Since it is known that age at maturity of salmon does not have an infinitesimal architecture []  we chose a model with increased power to detect signals when the architecture is non-infinitesimal and consists of loci with differing effect sizes. The genetic effect    accounts for the confounding effects of relatedness and family structure [].  was computed using BOLT-LMM for each SNP tested  using a subset of SNPs that fulfilled the following criteria: from the 50K SNP array and not imputed; showing no evidence of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) to reduce confounding effects of redundant genotypic information; and not located on the same chromosome as the test SNP to avoid proximal contamination []. SNPs in high LD (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8) were identified with PLINK 1.9’s - function [] using a 1-Mb window size and a 10-kb step size. The resulting association statistics were calibrated using the LD score regression intercept  as implemented in BOLT-LMM. We estimated LD scores for all SNPs using LDSC []. The genome-wide significance level of 9.8 × 10 for -values was determined using the strict Bonferroni correction (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05/# of association tests). The linear regression beta coefficients and corresponding standard errors from BOLT-LMM were transformed to odds ratios using LMOR []. Multiple SNPs within a region can show a significant association due to LD around a causal SNP  but they are not all independently associated with the trait. One approach to account for this LD is to select only the top-associated SNP within the region  but this can fail to identify instances where true secondary signals exist within the region. To overcome this challenge  we performed conditional and joint analyses with the - function [] implemented in GCTA v1.91.6 []. The - function converts marginal effect sizes from a single-SNP association test to joint effect sizes by incorporating information of covariance among SNPs based on the LD structure. Joint effect sizes and -values were calculated conditional on other SNPs  using a stepwise procedure  beginning with the top-associated SNP and iterating over all remaining SNPs []. -values and beta values obtained from the BOLT-LMM association test were analyzed with - to identify independently associated SNPs. We considered a SNP to be independently associated with the maturation phenotype if the conditioned  value was less than 9.8 × 10. Linkage disequilibrium was calculated using the genotyping data (512 397 SNPs) of all 11 166 male offspring. Any SNP that was significantly associated with age at maturity in the conditional and joint analyses was assigned a candidate gene. A SNP that was located within a gene region was assigned to that gene  otherwise the nearest gene (within 50 kb upstream or downstream) was assigned. If a SNP was located within two overlapping genes  both genes were considered candidates. We used the function  implemented in BEDTools (v2.26.0) [] to assign candidate genes to SNPs. Genes and gene locations were based on the current Atlantic salmon genome assembly (ICSASG_v2) []. RefSeq annotations for Atlantic salmon genes (available at: ) were used to determine the overlap between candidate genes for age at menarche in humans [  ] and maturation timing in aquaculture Atlantic salmon. Variation in the maturation phenotype explained by the resulting set of significant SNPs was estimated using the Monte Carlo average information restricted maximum likelihood method for variance component analysis implemented in BOLT-REML []. The model was defined as follows []: where  is a vector of phenotypes (0/1 for non-grilse/grilse)   and  are variance components to be estimated  and  is a random residual error effect. We partitioned the SNPs into two sets based on whether they were significant or not. Any SNP in high LD (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8) with a significant SNP was excluded from both sets. We then calculated the variance component for each set of SNPs. The variance in phenotype explained by each variance component was then estimated. Heritability () of male maturation timing was inferred using the restricted maximum likelihood (–) method implemented in GCTA  which uses SNP-based relatedness estimates to calculate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by a set of genotyped SNPs. The model was defined as follows: where  is the additive genetic variance explained by SNPs and  is the error. We estimate  with only the 50K SNP-array dataset because heritability estimates can vary with imputation certainty []. GCTA estimates  on the observed (quantitative) scale  which we then transform to the underlying liability scale assuming varying levels of early maturation population prevalence (0.01  0.025  0.05) []. Due to the overrepresentation of the early maturation phenotype in this study sample  prevalence values below the sample prevalence (0.19) were used for transforming  estimates from the observed scale to the liability scale. Data on 11 166 males from the 2015 year-class imputed to 512 397 SNPs were used for association testing. The mean discordance between masked and actual genotypes for each chromosome ranged from 0.21 to 0.24 (see Additional file : Table S1). The linear mixed model association method showed that significant associations with maturation timing occurred on 28 of the 29 Atlantic salmon chromosomes (Fig. ). In total  13 149 of the 512 397 tested SNPs showed a significant association with maturation timing. A quantile–quantile plot of BOLT-LMM -values indicated genomic inflation that is characteristic of a polygenic architecture of the trait [] (see Additional file : Figure S1).

Zoomed view of SNPs with association statistics below a –log(-value) of 25 (truncated Y-axis). The significance threshold (dashed line) was adjusted to account for multiple-testing using Bonferroni correction. Red dots indicate loci that were significant after conditional and joint analysis Conditional and joint analysis identified 116 SNPs that were independently associated with maturation time and reached genome-wide significance (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Table S2). These 116 SNPs were located on 22 of the 29 Atlantic salmon chromosomes. All of the 116 SNPs were on the 50K SNP array and  thus were not imputed. By selecting the gene in closest proximity to a significant SNP  this set of 116 SNPs tagged 120 candidate genes (see Additional file : Table S2). A SNP 251 183 bp downstream of a previously identified candidate gene   []  was selected via conditional and joint analysis.  was not the closest gene to this SNP and  thus we assigned both the closest gene and  as candidate genes tagged by this SNP.  was the only candidate gene assigned based on prior knowledge. For all other SNPs  the closest gene was assigned. For SNPs with a minor allele effect that increased the odds of early maturation  the odds ratios (OR) ranged from 1.01 to 3.07 (0- to 3-fold). The OR ranged from 0.11 to 0.99 (0- to 9-fold) for SNPs with a minor allele effect that delayed maturation (Fig. ) and (see Additional file : Table S3). Five genes that were previously identified as candidate genes for age at maturity in humans were also candidate genes in this study. The first gene    on chromosome 9  is tagged by an upstream SNP (9:24886574  OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.55) (Fig. a). The second gene    is located on chromosome 15 and its tag SNP (15:6399839  OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.74) is a missense variant. An intron SNP on chromosome 16 (16:27617999  OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.70) tags the third gene   Another intronic SNP on chromosome 22 (22:13016434  OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.31) tags the fourth gene  . The fifth gene    on chromosome 25 is tagged by a downstream SNP (25:28910202  OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.42) (Fig. b) (see Additional file : Table S3).

Black squares indicate the mean phenotype value for each genotype (grilse<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and non-grilse<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) Variance component partitioning was used to determine the proportion of variance explained by the set of 116 independently associated SNPs for maturation timing in male aquaculture salmon. The 116 SNPs explained 78% of the genetic variance  with the remaining 22% of the genetic variance explained by the remaining 512 244 SNPs in the imputed dataset. GCTA estimates of the SNP-based  was 0.61. After transforming to the liability scale   estimates ranged from 0.54 to 0.84  depending on underlying prevalence (0.01–0.05) (see Additional file : Table S4). Given these estimates  we can infer that 42.1  53.8  and 65.5% of the phenotypic variance was explained by the set of 116 SNPs  for population prevalences of 0.01  0.025 and 0.05  respectively. Our sample size was substantially larger than in previous studies on the genetic basis of maturation of Atlantic salmon and focused on a single aquaculture strain  thus improving power and minimizing confounding effects of population stratification. This approach enabled us to look beyond large-effect loci and allowed us to reveal the polygenic component of maturation in Atlantic salmon. We confirmed the importance of a large effect locus in the  region on chromosome 25 that was identified in previous studies [  ]  but also identified several moderate effect loci (1.75- to 2-fold) including the  locus on chromosome 9. The remaining loci identified either had smaller effects or they had large to moderate effects but low MAF (<<U+2009>0.05). Furthermore  the number of additional regions of the genome that were associated with maturation suggests that this trait has a more polygenic architecture than previously indicated. The 120 candidate genes identified here provide a valuable resource for furthering our understanding of maturation in both aquaculture strains and wild populations. This work broadens the scope of empirical examples for the genetic architecture of quantitative traits  which is valuable for developing analytical frameworks to understand the genetic architecture underpinning quantitative traits in nature. We observed a “new” highly significant SNP on chromosome 9  with an OR of 0.55  which remained significantly associated with age at maturity after correction for relatedness. This region was also identified in Barson et al. []  but its association signal was lost after correction for population stratification in that study. Here  the most highly significant SNP in the region occurred<U+2009>~<U+2009>16 000 bp upstream of   which has been increasingly recognized as a candidate gene for maturation in mammals [  ]. Population stratification correction is recommended to avoid spurious associations due to  e.g.  systematic differences in ancestry between groups with different phenotypes []  but there is the danger that it eliminates signals when trait-associated loci have different effects across populations (e.g. loci involved in local adaptation) []. Indeed  the  region has been identified as potentially involved in local adaptation in numerous population genetic studies of Atlantic salmon. For example  the  region is under divergent selection among Atlantic salmon populations in North America [  ] and the Teno/Tana River []. In addition  the  gene has been associated with variation in run timing [  ] and river catchment area []  and there is evidence that it plays a role in local adaptation in other fish species []. The potential role of  in local adaptation may explain why its association signal was lost after population stratification correction in Barson et al. []. This highlights the importance of examining genotype–phenotype associations within single populations  in addition to multi-population studies. Together  these findings suggest that the role of the  gene in determining age at maturity may vary among populations  but it should not be ruled out as a candidate gene for maturation in Atlantic salmon. In this study  we also found that  is important for controlling maturation  which agrees with some previous studies [  ]  but not all [  ]. This may reflect continental differences in genetic architecture  with the locus-effect occurring only in the European lineage  or it may be due to low polymorphism in this region among North American derived aquaculture populations. Although we find a strong association of the  region with maturation  which parallels that found in wild European salmon  we are not sure whether the same dominance pattern at the  gene as observed in Barson et al. [] exists here. Due to a trade-off between size and age at maturity  sexual conflict occurs in the wild  whereby late maturing alleles are favoured in females and early maturing alleles are favoured in males. In the  gene  this conflict is resolved via sex-dependent dominance []. Based on proportions of late-maturing and early-maturing individuals for each genotype observed here  it does not appear that strong dominance of the early allele is at play in this aquaculture population (Fig. b). Genetic dominance is commonly defined as a deviation from a linear relationship between genotype dosage and effect on phenotype. However  here  sexual maturity is a binary trait and therefore does not follow a linear dose–response relationship. Thus  inferring dominance is complicated by this non-linear genotype dosage effect for binary traits. The pattern observed here  however  does suggest that sex-dependent dominance at this locus has been lost in this aquaculture strain. Indeed  factors suggested to cause sexual conflict  such as sex-specific maturation age and size optima  are eliminated in the aquaculture environment  since males and females are strictly selected for the same age at maturation. This suggests that genetic architecture can be rapidly altered in a setting with weak or no sexual conflict  which may be plausible  e.g. via modified expression and/or methylation patterns [  ]. Changes to dominance patterns in response to environmental changes have been previously described in some organisms [  ]. In addition to the  and  genes  we identified 114 other candidate loci with varying effect sizes  demonstrating a mixed genetic architecture that underlies maturation in Atlantic salmon (i.e.  a small number of large-effect genes combined with a polygenic component). These 114 additional candidate loci included nine loci with moderate to large effects (1.75<U+2009><<U+2009>fold) across six chromosomes (4  8  9  10  24 and 29)  and numerous smaller effect loci (1.75<U+2009>><U+2009>fold) distributed across 21 chromosomes (see Additional file : Table S2). These findings provide evidence that maturation in Atlantic salmon is a polygenic trait and reveal many new candidate genes that underlie variation in timing of maturation. In addition  we found some overlap (5 genes) between the candidate genes identified here and candidate genes for age at maturity in humans [  ]. This suggests that some aspects of the genetic control of the timing of maturation may be conserved across evolutionarily distant species. Interestingly  a number of SNPs found to be associated with maturation in this study were low-frequency variants with moderate (1.75- to 2-fold) to large (two- to ninefold) effect sizes (Fig. ). Such low-frequency variants have been a topic of interest in human genetics research [  ]. The “rare allele model” has been proposed as the reason for the missing heritability issue []. It suggests that low-frequency alleles with large effects can contribute to a particular phenotype at the population level  whereby rare alleles at a particular locus explain most of the variation in just a small number of individuals  but when such rare  large effect alleles occur at many loci  the collective contribution of rare alleles can be large at the population level. However  it has also been shown that low MAF can cause an inflated number of false positives in GWAS and biases in effect sizes [  ]. Therefore  further validation of these large-effect low-frequency variants is recommended. Candidate genes were identified via conditional and joint analysis and  therefore  represent independent signals  i.e.  they are not merely the result of being in LD with another associated locus. Although the candidate genes assigned based on proximity to these signals are plausible  we cannot conclude that these are the causal genes for differences in age at maturity. Instead  the causal gene may be further upstream or downstream. Future annotation of non-coding variation in the Atlantic salmon genome will help to validate SNP-to-gene assignment. Furthermore  although some candidate loci had small independent effects  they were still identified as candidates because their association with age at maturity was highly significant when considered in combination with other loci (see Additional file : Table S2). This situation can arise when a genotyped SNP does not account for the total amount of variation explained by a QTL (e.g. [  ])  or when multiple causal variants exist at a single QTL (e.g. [  ]). Based on the selection criteria used here  we consider these loci as strong candidates in spite of their small independent effect size. The maturation-associated QTL identified here provide a valuable contribution to our understanding of how aquaculture strains can respond to selection. Multiple smaller effect QTL indicate that there is an opportunity for fine-tuning of the trait via approaches such as genomic selection—an opportunity that would not exist if the trait was controlled by a single large-effect locus. Furthermore  this work suggests that a polygenic approach to selective breeding aimed at optimizing maturation timing may be beneficial. Focusing on just a few QTL (e.g.  and ) may not be sufficient to prevent early maturation  as there are a number of other QTL that may modify maturation timing. In addition  considerations of this mixed genetic architecture are valuable for designing effective management and conservation strategies of wild Atlantic salmon. Maintenance of variation in age at maturity is of ecological  economic  and cultural importance []. Factors such as fishing [] and ecological changes in the marine environment [] could affect early- and late-maturing individuals differently  which could lead to reduced variation in sea age []. Our improved understanding of the genetic architecture for maturation can help to more accurately predict the effects of such factors. This study also exemplifies how smaller effect genes can be missed until a sufficiently high-powered analysis is used. For this reason  even when large-effect loci are identified  it is important that management and conservation strategies consider remaining genetic variation and continuously aim at maintaining genome-wide variation []. We did not perform association testing for loci involved in female maturation due to the very low occurrence of female grilsing in this strain. From an aquaculture perspective  this low prevalence also implies that determining the genetic basis of maturation in females is of lower importance in farmed strains such as this one. However in the wild  early maturation in females is more commonly observed and  therefore  studies aimed at refining the genetic architecture of this trait in females would benefit future research on wild populations. In addition  because we focused on only one strain  determining the generality of the mixed architecture of maturation identified here requires assessment of additional wild populations and aquaculture strains. We refined our understanding of the genetic architecture of maturation of male Atlantic salmon using a large-scale GWAS. We revealed a polygenic component of age at maturity in Atlantic salmon and identified several moderate- and large-effect loci. The 120 candidate genes identified here can serve as a valuable resource for furthering our understanding of maturation in both aquaculture strains and wild populations. These results also help to elucidate how this trait will respond to factors such as fishing and environmental changes in the wild.

We hypothesized that including indirect genetic effects of culled animals and of animals without phenotypes in the analysis affects estimates of genetic parameters  improves predictive ability  and reduces bias of predicted breeding values. We tested this by applying different editing procedures  i.e. omission of individuals or groups from the data  and genetic models  i.e. a classical and an indirect genetic model (IGM) without or with weighting of indirect genetic effects based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or space allowance. Data consisted of average daily gain for 123 567 pigs in 11 111 groups  from which 3% of individuals in 25% of groups were prematurely removed from the group.ResultsThe estimate of total heritability was higher (0.29 to 0.34) than that of direct heritability (0.23 to 0.25) regardless of the editing procedures and IGM used. Omission of individuals or groups from the data reduced the predictive ability of estimates of indirect genetic effects by 8 to 46%  and the predictive ability of estimates of the combined direct and indirect genetic effects by up to 4%. Omission of full groups introduced bias in predicted breeding values. Weighting of indirect genetic effects reduced the predictive ability of their estimates by at least 19% and of the estimates of the combined direct and indirect genetic effects by 1%.ConclusionsWe identified significant indirect genetic effects for growth in pigs. Culled animals should neither be removed from the data nor accounted for by weighting their indirect genetic effects in the model based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or space allowance  because it will reduce predictive ability and increase bias of predicted breeding values. Information on culled animals is important for prediction of indirect genetic effects and must be accounted for in IGM analyses by including fixed regressions based on relative time spent within the pen or relative space allowance."

We hypothesized that including indirect genetic effects of culled animals and of animals without phenotypes in the analysis affects estimates of genetic parameters  improves predictive ability  and reduces bias of predicted breeding values. We tested this by applying different editing procedures  i.e. omission of individuals or groups from the data  and genetic models  i.e. a classical and an indirect genetic model (IGM) without or with weighting of indirect genetic effects based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or space allowance. Data consisted of average daily gain for 123 567 pigs in 11 111 groups  from which 3% of individuals in 25% of groups were prematurely removed from the group. The estimate of total heritability was higher (0.29 to 0.34) than that of direct heritability (0.23 to 0.25) regardless of the editing procedures and IGM used. Omission of individuals or groups from the data reduced the predictive ability of estimates of indirect genetic effects by 8 to 46%  and the predictive ability of estimates of the combined direct and indirect genetic effects by up to 4%. Omission of full groups introduced bias in predicted breeding values. Weighting of indirect genetic effects reduced the predictive ability of their estimates by at least 19% and of the estimates of the combined direct and indirect genetic effects by 1%. We identified significant indirect genetic effects for growth in pigs. Culled animals should neither be removed from the data nor accounted for by weighting their indirect genetic effects in the model based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or space allowance  because it will reduce predictive ability and increase bias of predicted breeding values. Information on culled animals is important for prediction of indirect genetic effects and must be accounted for in IGM analyses by including fixed regressions based on relative time spent within the pen or relative space allowance. An indirect genetic model (IGM) for estimation of breeding values includes both direct and indirect genetic effects of animals. It has been suggested that estimated breeding values from such a model can be used to select for social behavior without the need for expensive and tedious recording of complex behavioral traits  such as tail biting in pigs. Ellen et al. [] showed that selection on estimates of indirect genetic effects led to improvement in survival of layers housed in groups. Several studies have also identified significant indirect genetic effects for growth for pigs housed in groups [  ]. Previously reported predictive ability of combined direct and indirect genetic effects has not been consistently higher than that of direct genetic effects alone [  ]. A reason for this may be that for many species  e.g. fish  layer chickens  or pigs  groups of animals are typically subject to premature physical removal of one or several animals from the group (from here on collectively referred to as culling). Specifically  in pig breeding  individual pigs can be removed from pens during performance testing due to e.g. death  disease  leg problems  tail biting  or sale. Culling of animals from groups reduces group size and changes group composition across the test period  which may pose a challenge in IGM if it is ignored. There are several reasons why culled animals should not be ignored in IGM. First  the phenotypes of all group members are affected when an individual is culled  because the phenotype of an individual is the result of its direct genetic effect plus the sum of the indirect genetic effects of its group mates []. Second  culling affects the covariance between phenotype and total breeding value  because it is a function of not only direct and indirect genetic (co-)variances  but also of group size and additive genetic relatedness among group mates []. These parameters are unintentionally modified when animals are culled from the group  which may affect predictive ability of estimated genetic effects [  ]. In some previous studies on indirect genetic effects  animals that were culled  or even complete groups that were culled  were omitted from the dataset before analysis [  ]. However  if the culling of animals is non-random  removal of these animals from analysis could bias  in particular  estimates of the genetic (co-)variance between direct and indirect genetic effects from the IGM [  ]. At least part of the culled or removed animals are likely to be non-random with regards to ADG as e.g. animals that are sold would typically be sold based partly on breeding values and partly on body weight. In this case  the missing data process cannot be ignored []. Thus  the culling of animals may need to be accounted for in the IGM to avoid biases and improve predictive ability. Another challenge associated with culling of animals is that differences in time spent in the group and changes in space allowance per animal may also affect the indirect genetic effect of a given animal. Cantet and Cappa [] suggested a method to weigh indirect genetic effects based on the amount of time spent in a group. Bunter et al. [] weighted indirect genetic effects on litter size in sows based on space allowance. However  to our knowledge  the model of Cantet and Cappa [] has never been tested on real data and the model by Bunter et al. [] has never been tested on growth data in pigs. We propose to apply models similar to those suggested by Cantet and Cappa [] and Bunter et al. [] to growth data in pigs to account for culling of animals instead of omitting them from the dataset. Our aim was to investigate the effect of accounting for culling of animals on genetic parameters and on predictive ability and bias of estimated genetic effects  both through the data editing procedure and through weighting of indirect genetic effects in an IGM. The data used were part of routine recording of pigs in performance tests in nucleus herds of the DanBred pig breeding program. Management and welfare procedures were in accordance with Danish national standards and the records obtained in these tests  e.g. weight  require no ethical approval. Data were from performance-tested DanBred Landrace pigs in 18 nucleus breeding herds within the period from January 2014 to May 2017. The age of the pigs at the start of the performance test was on average 82 days [standard deviation (sd)<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.2] and ranged from 42 to 156 days. The average starting weight was 30 kg (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.9)  ranging from 20 to 40 kg  and the average weight at the end of the performance test was 94 kg (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.0)  ranging from 45 to 140 kg. The number of test days per pig was on average 63 days (sd<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.9)  ranging from 34 to 93 days. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated as: where  and  were the weights in kg at the end and start of the performance test  respectively. Groups consisted of either boars or gilts. Group sizes at the start of the performance test ranged from 8 to 15 pigs per pen and the space allowance per pig was between 0.75 and 1.0 m at the start of the performance test. If a pig left the pen because of death  illness  or sale  the date and reason for leaving the pen were recorded. Pigs were neither allowed to re-enter their pen after having been culled  nor to move to any other pen that was part of the performance test. During the test  feeding was ad libitum with dry feed  which at a minimum fulfills the Danish norm requirements given by SEGES []. Descriptive statistics after editing (described below)  including numbers of animals  litters  and groups  as well as group sizes  percentage of missing phenotypes  mean ADG  and average additive genetic relationship for six datasets that represent different scenarios of editing procedures regarding culling of pigs or missing phenotypes are in Table . Groups with the following characteristics were omitted from all datasets:  Group sizes smaller than 8 or greater than 15 at the start of the performance test  because they were considered too rare (68 groups omitted). Groups with one or more pigs having pedigree errors (105 groups omitted). Groups with a smaller group size at the start than the pen size prescribed (to ensure similar space allowance at the beginning of the test) or with any pigs unaccounted for at the end of the performance test  i.e. physically not in the pen  but not recorded as having been culled (285 groups omitted). Group sizes that occurred infrequently  either within a herd (less than 10 groups per herd with a given group size; 37 groups omitted)  or within a sex (less than 10 groups per sex with a given group size; 20 groups omitted). The six datasets consisted of a reference scenario () without any further edits based on culling of pigs from the groups or missing phenotypes and five alternative editing procedures based on culling of pigs from groups or missing phenotypes (        and )  as described below. Culling of pigs was due to e.g. disease  leg problems  tail bites  or sale and missing phenotypes (for pigs that were still in the pen) were due to recording errors (i.e. missing phenotypes). The five datasets for the alternative scenarios were subsets of the dataset for the  reference scenario. In the  scenario  there was no data editing based on culled pigs. Thus  the data for this scenario included all pigs that were in the pens at the start of the performance test  i.e. including pigs that died and that were culled  and pigs that did not have phenotypic records although they were present at the end of the performance test. In total  1.2% of pigs did not receive a phenotype although they were present at the end of the performance test  thereby affecting 7.9% of groups. The dataset for the  scenario consisted of 123 567 pigs in 11 111 groups  with group size ranging from 8 to 15 at the start of the performance test. In total  4.4% of the pigs and 32.7% of the groups had missing phenotypes. The mean ADG was 1017 g/d  and the additive genetic relationship within pens based on six generations was on average 0.17  with the first and third quantiles being 0.14 and 0.18  respectively (Table ). In the  scenario  pigs without phenotypes were omitted from the dataset regardless of when or whether they were in reality physically removed from the group. This means that none of the pigs and none of the groups in this dataset had missing phenotypes. Group size equaled the number of pigs that received a phenotype within that group and ranged from 2 to 15. The mean ADG and the average additive genetic relationship within pens were equivalent to those of the  scenario (Table ). In the  scenario  pigs that were culled from the group during the first 28% of days in the performance test were omitted. We chose this 28% value because it reduced the percentage of groups with culled pigs to less than 10% (compared to ~<U+2009>25% in the  scenario). Group size was defined as the number of pigs in the group when 28% of the performance test days had passed. Group size ranged from 5 to 15  and 3.9% of the pigs and 29.7% of the groups had missing phenotypes. The mean ADG and the average additive genetic relationship within pens were equivalent to those of the  scenario (Table ). In the  scenario  entire groups with culled pigs or with pigs with missing phenotypes were omitted. Group size equaled that at the start of the performance test  as in the scenario . The mean ADG was 1020 g/day and the additive genetic relationship within pens was on average 0.17  with the first and third quantiles being 0.14 and 0.19  respectively (Table ). In the  scenario  an entire group was omitted when the proportion of missing phenotypes in the group was higher than 15%. We chose this 15% value because it reduced the percentage of groups with culled pigs or missing phenotypes to less than 10%. Group size equaled that at the start of the performance test  as in the scenario . In total  3.1% of the pigs and 28.1% of the groups still had missing phenotypes. The mean ADG and the average additive genetic relationship within pens were equivalent to those in the  scenario (Table ). In the  scenario  no pigs or groups were omitted  i.e. the number of pigs and groups equaled those in the  scenario. Instead  predicted direct breeding values    which were based on the classical genetic model (see next section) applied to the  dataset  were assigned to each pig  without a phenotype. Group size equaled that at the start of the performance test as in the  scenario. The mean ADG and the average additive genetic relationship within pens were equivalent to those in the  scenario (Table ). Variance components for ADG in each of the six scenarios were estimated using a classical genetic model (CGM)  a standard indirect genetic model (IGM)  and three IGM with weighting of indirect genetic effects: (1) with weighting  groups based on the relative time spent within that group ()  (2) with weighting among groups based on relative space allowance ()  and  (3) with weighting both within and among groups ()  combining  and . The models and the concepts of relative time spent within the group and relative space allowance among groups are described in the following. where  is the vector of  during the performance test  and vector  includes regression coefficients on covariates and fixed effect estimates. Covariates were weight  age  and age squared of the pigs at the start of the performance test  as well as the average proportion of time that pigs spent with each other within each group  and the relative space allowance per group   (as defined below). Fixed effects included the effect of the sex of the individual (boar or gilt) and the contemporary group  defined as pigs reared in pens within the same farm  barn  and batch based on the final test date. Each contemporary group included a minimum of four pens. Contemporary group was confounded with group size  i.e. group size was nested within contemporary group  except in scenarios  and   for which an additional fixed effect of group size was included. Vectors     and  represent random direct additive genetic effects  random litter effects  and random group effects  respectively  and  is a vector of residuals. Matrices       and  are incidence matrices. Assumptions for the distribution of random effects were: where  is the additive relationship matrix   is direct additive genetic variance   is the variance of the birth litter   is the variance of the group of pigs that were penned together during the performance test   is the residual variance  and     and  are identity matrices of dimensions equal to the numbers of litters  groups  and observations on ADG  respectively. Fitting the group effect    is equivalent to fitting correlated residuals among pen mates  assuming they are positively correlated []. The IGM was defined as: where  is a vector of random indirect additive genetic effects  and the remaining model terms are as described for the CGM. Direct and indirect genetic effects were assumed to be distributed as where and  is the Kronecker product. Direct and indirect additive genetic effects were not correlated with the remaining random effects  which were distributed as: Matrix  is an incidence matrix linking phenotypic values of individuals to the indirect genetic effects of group mates  with the elements    defined as:  and  when  and  are in different groups  whereas for  and  in the same group and :  for the IGM  and  for the     and   respectively.  is the proportion of time that each pig spends with other pigs within that group and . is the relative space allowance among groups: where  is the number of days that a group mate    of pig   spent in the group from the start of the test until it left the group or finished the performance test  and  is the number of days from start to finish of the performance test. When a group mate    stayed in the group throughout the performance test  then   whereas  when a group mate left the group before the end of the performance test. This implies that a group mate that left the group prematurely had a smaller effect on the focal individual  than does a group mate that stayed in the group throughout the performance test.   where  is the square meters in the pen of group    is the group size at the end of the performance test for group    is the space allowance within the group  and  is the average space allowance across all groups within the data. When the space allowance within a group equals the average space allowance within the data  then   whereas while  when the space allowance within a group is smaller than the average value  and  when the space allowance within a group is larger than the average value. This implies that indirect genetic effects increase for groups with a relatively small space allowance and decrease for groups with a relatively large space allowance.  is the combined effect of  and : . Both fixed regressions on  and  are included in each model  because expectations must be zero  and if the means change as a result of covariates  then these covariates must be accounted for to ensure that expectations are zero. Both fixed regression coefficients on  and  were significantly different from zero  but the average effect of  per group was not  and thus was not included in the models. In the     and  indirect genetic effects are modeled as random regressions on either    or a combination of both. The genetic parameters (variance components) as well as estimated breeding values from the IGM models with weighting (random regression) are  therefore  functions of     and . In the results  they are presented at the average value of these covariates. Parameters in the models were estimated using average information residual maximum likelihood (AIREML) and genetic effects were best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP)  which were in both cases implemented in the DMU software []. The phenotypic variance  for the IGM      and  was calculated as proposed by Bergsma et al. [] and modified by Ragab et al. []: where               and  are the direct additive genetic variance  the environmental variances of group and litter  the residual variance  the indirect additive genetic variance  the direct–indirect additive genetic covariance  the average group size (Table )  and the average additive genetic relatedness among group mates (Table )  respectively. The average weighing factor of indirect genetic effects  was equal to 1   (varying from 0.987 in  to 0.992 in )   (varying from 1.011 in  to 1.025 in )  and  (varying from 0.999 in  to 1.017 in ) for the IGM      and   respectively (Table ). For the IGM  the total heritable variance  of the total genetic effect (TGE) was calculated as proposed by Bijma et al. [] and the total heritability  was calculated as proposed by Bergsma et al. [] and modified by Ragab et al. []: It follows that  depends strongly on . In fact  its magnitude can exceed that of   in which case <U+2009>><U+2009>1  and if  then . In this study   was equal to the average group size in each scenario. Standard errors (SE) on estimates of direct heritability ()    and the genetic correlation between the direct and indirect genetic effects    were calculated using equations that were derived by Bijma []:  where    is the between-family variance   is the number of families (litters in the data)   is the family size (calculated as the total number of individuals in the dataset divided by the number of families/litters in the dataset)  and  The predictive ability and bias of predicted breeding values were calculated for the six scenarios by dividing the datasets described in Table  into training and validation datasets  with a cut-off date on January 1  2017. Thus  the validation datasets included all pigs in groups that finished the performance test between January 1 and May 31  2017  but their phenotypes were omitted. A 5-month period not only ensures a relatively large number of groups in the validation dataset  but also a relatively large number of sires with offspring and hence relatively high accuracies for both the training and validation datasets. Summary statistics for the validation datasets are in Table . For the six scenarios  the validation datasets differed with respect to the proportion of pigs without phenotypes (0% for  and  to 3.5% for ). Likewise  the proportion of groups that included pigs without phenotypes ranged from 0 ( and ) to 28.6% (). One hundred and seventeen sires were represented with offspring in the validation data  but only 49 of them had offspring in the training dataset as well. To further validate robustness of the results  we also defined validation datasets with two alternative cut-off points  i.e. on July 1  2016  and January 1  2016. These yielded similar results as the original validation datasets and are  therefore  not reported. Predictive ability was defined as the Pearson correlation between predicted breeding values and corrected phenotypes (see below) in the validation dataset. Three alternative predicted breeding values were calculated: ; the estimated direct breeding value of pig . ; the sum of the estimated indirect breeding values of the group mates of a pig  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  …    where  is the group size  and  is the weighing factor for the group mate. ; the sum of the estimated direct breeding value of the pig and the estimated indirect breeding values of its group mates  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  …  . The corrected phenotypes of each pig () were based on the model with the lowest AIC [] applied to the  scenario. The AIC was used to compare models within a scenario as the fixed parts of the models were equivalent. The IGM   and  had the lowest AIC with a relative likelihood of 19 compared to that of the CGM and of 2 compared to that of . Thus  with IGM being the simplest model of the three with the lowest AIC  the corrected phenotypes were calculated based on the IGM as: the sum of all predicted random effects  including direct and indirect genetic  environmental random effects (litter    and group  )  and residuals   (i.e.  corrected phenotypes were equal to the difference between phenotypes and estimated fixed effects):  The Hotelling–Williams t-test [] was applied to evaluate differences in predictive ability between models within each scenario. Differences were considered significant if the P-value of the test was less than 1%. To evaluate differences in predictive ability between scenarios  a two-tailed test of significant differences between independent correlations was applied  namely a Z-test based on a Fisher r-to-z transformation []. We chose this test because  although the datasets were not entirely independent  the data differed between scenarios. Bias of predicted breeding values was calculated as the regression of breeding values post-phenotyping   (either  or ) for animals in the validation dataset  on the corresponding predicted breeding values (from the same model and scenario) prior to phenotyping ()  also for animals in the validation dataset. Thus    where the extent of the deviation of  from 1 reflects the amount of bias in the predicted breeding values. Table  presents estimates of variance components and of genetic parameters for several combinations of data editing procedures and models. The editing procedure did not have a significant effect on the estimated direct genetic variance  which ranged from 2437 () to 2675 (g/day) () for the CGM. Likewise  the editing procedure did not have a significant effect on the estimated indirect genetic variance  which ranged from 9.9 () to 13.3 (g/day) () for the IGM. The estimate of direct heritability () ranged from 0.23 () to 0.25 ()  regardless of the model. When the IGM was used  the total genetic variance was larger than the direct genetic variance for all scenarios  thus  the estimates of  were between 34 ( and ) and 42% ( and ) higher than the estimates of  for the IGM. The genetic covariance between the direct and indirect genetic effects was negative (unfavorable) regardless of the editing procedure  but it was only significantly different from 0 for  (). The genetic covariance was smallest for  (-<U+2009>2.5) and largest (-<U+2009>26.1 and -<U+2009>29.7) for  ( and ). In the remaining scenarios  including   the genetic covariance had an intermediate estimate (from -<U+2009>9.0 to -<U+2009>15.8). The estimate of the genetic correlation between direct and indirect effects ()  which varied between -<U+2009>0.02 () and -<U+2009>0.19 ()  only differed significantly from 0 (-<U+2009>0.16 and -<U+2009>0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04) for  ( and ). Model choice did not affect the estimate of the direct genetic variance. For example  for the  scenario  the estimate of the direct genetic variance did not differ significantly between either of the IGM models and the CGM. The estimate of the indirect genetic variance tended to be larger for  than for IGM (between 1 and 7%)  and smaller for  (except for the  scenario) and  (between -<U+2009>4 and 20%). The estimate of the total genetic variance available for selection was between 16 and 42% larger than the estimate of the direct genetic variance  with the difference being largest for the IGM applied to  (42%) and  (41%). Thus  the effect of including indirect genetic effects on the estimated total genetic variance was largest when the editing procedure involved omission of either all culled individuals or all groups with culled animals. Within each scenario  the estimate of the total genetic variance tended to be smaller when indirect genetic effects were weighted (up to 9  7 and 14% for the  scenario for     and   respectively) than when they were not (IGM). Within each scenario  estimates of     and  did not differ significantly among models. Estimates of  tended to be more negative for the IGM with weighting of indirect genetic effects (between -<U+2009>0.10 and -<U+2009>0.19) than for the IGM without weighting (-<U+2009>0.06) but only in the  scenario. For the IGM models with weighting (random regression)   is a co-variance function with covariables     or . Therefore   depends on the level of the covariables and in the extreme cases in the  scenario   varied between 0.24 for  at the minimum value of  and 0.37 for  at the maximum value of . The genetic correlation between TGE evaluated at different values for the covariables deviate slightly from 1 and in the most extreme case () the genetic correlation between TGE evaluated at minimum and maximum value for  was 0.83. There were significant group and litter effects and  although the estimate of the group variance was 5 to 10% smaller for the IGM than for the CGM  this difference was not statistically significantly different from zero  regardless of weighting of indirect genetic effects or editing procedure. Estimates of litter and residual variances also did not differ significantly between models. The predictive ability of the predicted direct breeding values of individual pigs    the sum of the predicted indirect breeding values of group mates    and the combination of the two    were reflected in their correlations with corrected phenotypes in the validation data (Table ). The predictive abilities of  were higher for  and  than for the other editing procedure scenarios (between 1 and 3% higher). The predictive ability of  from the IGM was approximately 1% higher than that of  for all scenarios. For all scenarios  except   the differences in predictive abilities were significantly different from zero. The predictive ability of  was lowest for scenario  and highest for  (4% higher than for ). The predictive ability of  was highest  by between 8 and 46%  for the scenario   compared to the other scenarios. Within a scenario  the predictive ability of  was always equal to or higher (up to 1% for ) for the IGM than for the other models. Likewise  the predictive ability of  was always higher for the IGM than for the other models (between 19 and 153% for )  i.e. weighting indirect genetic effects based on relative time spent in the pen or space allowance in the model did not improve predictive ability. Bias of predicted breeding values was reflected by the extent to which the regression coefficient of predicted breeding values post-phenotyping on predicted breeding values prior to phenotyping deviated from 1 (Table ). For the scenarios     and    was not biased regardless of the model  but for    was biased when using the  model. For the scenario  and in particular for    was biased regardless of the model. Likewise  the predicted combined direct and sum of indirect breeding values    from model  was biased  except for the scenario . Lastly  all IGM models resulted in biased  in the scenarios  and   with the largest bias of  observed for scenario  (1.100). For a given scenario  there was generally no significant difference in bias for  between the IGM models with or without weighting of indirect genetic effects. Except for scenario   for which the bias of  was significantly larger for model  than for the other IGM models. We showed that  in general  neither editing procedures related to culled animals and missing phenotypes  nor accounting for culled animals in the IGM  affect estimates of genetic parameters significantly. We also showed that editing procedures that remove culled animals or pigs with missing phenotypes but not their group mates  tend to reduce the predictive ability of estimates of indirect genetic effects (). In contrast  editing procedures  which remove full groups that include culled pigs or pigs with missing phenotypes  improve the predictive ability of estimates of direct genetic effects ()  but increase their bias. Moreover  we found that accounting for culled animals in the model reduced the predictive ability of estimates of indirect genetic effects and sometimes increased bias of the predicted breeding values. Our results showed that genetic parameters were not affected by editing procedures related to culled animals  and this indicates that it is not necessary to omit individual animals or whole groups from data if culled animals are present when estimating genetic parameters (at least for the relatively low frequency of culling in the present dataset). Most other studies that estimated genetic parameters based on IGM did not report frequencies of culled animals or how these were handled e.g. [      ]. Arango et al. [] omitted individual records that were outside a perceived acceptable phenotypic range of ADG  which is somewhat similar to the  scenario. Bunter et al. [] excluded entire groups that included missing individual(s)  which is similar to the  scenario. Based on our results  the editing procedures used in these studies were not necessary when estimating genetic parameters  which is surprising because culling of animals is likely not random and possibly associated with indirect genetic effects. For example  pigs that are culled due to illness likely have a low ADG and pigs that are sold or without phenotypes likely have high ADG and a high parent average breeding value for ADG. Non-random culling of animals can bias estimates of genetic parameters [  ]  whereas random culling of individuals was shown to not affect estimates of genetic parameters  using simulation []. This suggests that culling of animals in our study was close to random or at least not associated with indirect genetic effects. Alternatively  it is possible that different culling reasons have opposite effects on indirect genetic effects  and that their occurrence cancelled each other out in our study. The effect of different culling reasons on indirect genetic effects was not studied here  because the frequencies of culling reasons were assumed to be too low and unevenly distributed for the detection of any impact. The  and  scenarios were also expected to affect estimates of genetic parameters  because culling of animals reduces the group size of affected groups. An IGM with a dilution effect was previously suggested to account for a reduction in indirect genetic effects with increasing group size [  ]. In contrast  genetic parameter estimates from the  and  scenarios indicate that group size did not affect indirect genetic effects. To confirm this finding  we tested different degrees of dilution  ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 (results not shown). And indeed  dilution neither improved model fit (AIC) nor changed genetic parameter estimates significantly  in agreement with previous studies [  ]. Our results also showed that omitting individuals or groups from data based on culled animals reduces the predictive ability of estimated breeding values  whereas omission of entire groups with culled animals ( and ) introduced bias in predicted breeding values. This indicates that  if there is indeed an association between culled animals and indirect genetic effects for growth  then the IGE cannot be disentangled in the analysis based on the data on individuals that remained in the groups. Omission of entire groups may result in bias because of confounding of the fixed contemporary and random group effects  as well as between the random group and litter effects. In conclusion  individuals or groups should not be removed from the data for IGM analyses to account for culled animals or missing phenotypes. We identified significant indirect genetic effects for ADG  with the  of ~<U+2009>0.33 being higher than the  of 0.24. We also found a negative  (-<U+2009>0.07)  but this was non-significantly different from zero  and hence neither indicating competition nor cooperation. The estimates of indirect genetic variances in our study were small [e.g. 10.3 (g/day) for IGM in ] particularly so in comparison to the estimates of direct genetic variances. Such (relatively) low values have in the past been mistakenly interpreted as unimportant []  but their contribution to the total genetic variance is in fact substantial  as indicated by the  because this depends on the group size []. Standard errors of the estimates (±<U+2009>2.4) also indicate that they are in fact present and varying the prior of the indirect genetic variance in the IGM between 10 and 50 by 10 did not affect convergence or results  indicating a global maximum of the likelihood function. Several previous studies have also identified significant indirect genetic effects for ADG in pigs  which fall mostly within the same range as in our study. Chen et al. [] reported a  of 0.20 and an indirect heritability of 0.001  which are similar to our estimates  but they found a positive  of 0.24 resulting in a much higher  of 0.61  which contrasts with our results. However  comparing studies based on  is difficult because  depends on group size. For example  Chen et al. [] had a group size of 15 compared to 11.6 in the  scenario in our study  which would also have contributed to the higher . Bergsma et al. [] found a  of 0.34  which is similar to our results but their study was based on a smaller group size  i.e. 8.5. Duijvesteijn et al. [] and Nielsen et al. [] also reported genetic parameters for ADG in pigs similar to our results but the results of Duijvesteijn et al. [] were based on a smaller group size (9.8). Canario et al. [] found a lower  (0.23)  but this was probably due to both a much lower  (0.13)  as well as a smaller group size (8.5)  and not due to smaller indirect genetic effects. Hence  our results confirm that there are indirect genetic effects for growth in pigs. Our results showed that indirect genetic effects are not significantly affected by weighting of indirect genetic effects based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen. This indicates that indirect interactions between pigs within a pen are not affected by the amount of time that the pigs have spent together when only a relatively small proportion of the pigs are removed (3.2% of the pigs across 24.8% of the groups). This implies that an aggressive pig has the same effect on the ADG of its group mates over the test period  regardless of whether it has been in the pen throughout the entire test period or it was culled before the end of the test. This may seem to disagree with results of ethological studies  which show that persisting aggression can affect ADG at the phenotypic level []. However  in our analyses  we also corrected for the mean change in ADG due to changes in the mean proportion of time spent together in the pen  which may be sufficient to explain the effects observed in ethological studies. The regression coefficient of the mean proportion of time spent together in the pen on ADG was estimated to be -<U+2009>71<U+2009>±<U+2009>31 g/day/%  which implies that each 1%-point increase in the average proportion of time spent together in the pen reduced the ADG by 71 g/day. Alternatively  the culled pigs may have been non-central to the social network within the group [  ]. If “outsider” pigs that barely interact with the other pigs are culled  they will not have much indirect genetic effect on their group mates regardless of being culled or not. In summary  estimates of indirect genetic effects are not enhanced by weighting based on either the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or based on the relative space allowance. Our results also show that estimates of indirect genetic effects are not significantly affected by weighting based on the relative space allowance between pens ()  when only a relatively small proportion of the pigs are removed. This implies that space allowance is not important for indirect genetic effects and that these do not increase with decreasing space allowance. However  findings from ethological studies in pigs imply the opposite  i.e. that lower space allowance increases injuries and aggression [  ]. Similarly  in fish  aggression is known to increase with increasing space allowance or to have an optimum  at least within the range of space allowance typically practiced in commercial fish breeding [  ]. However  these effects observed in ethological studies may be fully explained by the model correction for the mean change in ADG as a result of differences in the relative space allowance. The regression coefficient of the relative space allowance on ADG was estimated to be 0.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>14 g/day per unit increase in relative space allowance  which was not significantly different from zero. The lack of significance of weighting IGE based on the relative space allowance between pens may be explained by the heterogeneity in space allowance being too small to detect statistically significant differences. In addition  the results disagree with the results of Bunter et al. []  who concluded that indirect genetic effects of sows on litter size decreased as space allowance increased irrespectively of maximum group size. Our results were based on an evaluation of the genetic parameters at the mean level of the covariates     and   which in all cases were close to 1. However  in the extreme case of the minimum level of the combined effect of the proportion of time spent in the group and the relative space allowance ()  the total genetic variance available for selection  was reduced to the same level as  (0.24)  and the total genetic correlation between ADG evaluated at the minimum or maximum value of  in  in the  scenario was 0.83. This means that the effect of selection may be lower than expected depending on the value of the covariables. If selection is aimed at an environment with a higher proportion of animals prematurely removed from groups and a higher space allowance per pig then realized selection response might be lower than expected. The predictive ability of  was 1% higher for the IGM than for the CGM (). This means that selection for ADG would be improved by using the IGM rather than the CGM  but it was not improved further by weighting indirect genetic effects. This indicates that it is not necessary to take the timing of the culling of animals or changes in space allowance due to culling of animals into account when evaluating the added value of indirect genetic effects. On the contrary  the predictive ability of the predicted indirect genetic effects () decreased when the indirect genetic effects were weighted. Moreover  editing procedures involving omissions of culled animals or groups with culled animals from the data also reduced the predictive ability of the predicted indirect genetic effects. This suggests that editing procedures or weighting of indirect genetic effects based on culling of animals should not be done  regardless of whether they are based on the relative proportion of time in the pen or the relative space allowance between pens. In this study  we presented several methods to weight indirect genetic effects based on culled animals but these did not improve the results. However  it is possible that weighting of indirect genetic effects based on other factors that describe covariances among all pen mates more accurately will improve results. For example  social network analysis parameters  such as degree centrality or pairwise time spent fighting []  or automatically recorded feeding behavior variables []  such as Euclidian distance []  could be applied as weighting factors. However  such data were not available in our study and are typically not available on a large scale in breeding programs. Weighting of indirect genetic effects based on relatedness may also be relevant [  ]. Alemu et al. [] presented a model that takes differences in indirect genetic effects between relatives and unrelated individuals into account. However  even with a group structure that allows identification of all covariance components in this model  i.e. with variation in relatedness in group composition  the results of such a model may be biased if the differences in indirect genetic effects between related and unrelated animals are also affected by e.g. familiarity. Information on early-life experience may allow these effects to be disentangled []  but such information was not available in our study. The magnitude of the predictive abilities of  from the CGM and  from the IGM in our study were similar to those found for gilts in Nielsen et al. []  although their predictive abilities of predicted indirect genetic effects were much higher (between 0.067 and 0.165) than those found in our study (between -<U+2009>0.074 and 0.038). Nielsen et al. [] calculated predictive abilities only for complete groups  as suggested by Duijvesteijn et al. []  thus we did the same  i.e. only for groups for which all phenotypes were known and no animals were culled. However  our  scenario is different to the situation in Nielsen et al. [] because they did not omit individuals or groups when estimating the genetic variance. Their hypothesis was that the missing phenotypes may reduce accuracy of or bias the estimates of indirect genetic effects of pigs in affected groups [    ]. Indeed  we found that the predictive abilities of indirect genetic effects were higher for complete groups than for all groups. For example  the predictive ability of  based on the IGM in the scenario  increased by 40% from 0.038 to 0.053. Except for the scenario   the predictive abilities of the predicted indirect genetic effects in the other scenarios similarly increased by 38 to 73%. The increase in predictive ability of the sum of direct and indirect genetic effects () of the IGM over that of the CGM was also 1 to 2 or 2.5% greater for full groups. Our results show that it is important to not omit individuals or groups based on culled animals during data editing when estimating indirect genetic effects  as this may compromise their predictive ability  as a reflection of accuracy of selection  and thereby genetic gain in the indirect genetic effects. The results also imply that the frequency of culled animals to the extent observed in this paper (~<U+2009>3% of individuals and ~<U+2009>25% of groups affected) should not be an issue when selecting on estimates of indirect genetic effects. In fact  animals that have been culled are important for the estimation of indirect genetic effects and must be included in analyses. Our results also show that weighting of indirect genetic effects of culled animals reduces the predictive ability of estimated indirect genetic effects. Instead  fixed regressions on the average relative proportion of time spent within the pen and the relative space allowance can account for the association of culled animals with ADG within groups. This stresses that it is important to take fixed effects that may otherwise be captured by the indirect genetic variance when modelling indirect genetic effects into account. Our results confirm that there are indirect genetic effects for growth in pigs  but indirect genetic effects of culled animals should not be removed through data editing  as this will reduce predictive ability and increase bias of estimated breeding values. In fact  animals that have been culled are important when estimating indirect genetic effects and must be included in analyses with IGM. Moreover  indirect genetic effects of culled animals should not be weighted based on proportion of time spent in the pen or relative space allowance as this will also reduce predictive ability. Instead  the effects of culled animals on indirect genetic effects should be accounted for by including fixed regressions of the mean proportion of time spent in the pen or relative space allowance on ADG in the model.

Genomic prediction (GP) is a method whereby DNA polymorphism information is used to predict the breeding value of individuals for complex traits. The availability of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping in a cost-effective manner has led GP to become a standard tool in the analysis and improvement of complex traits []. GP has revolutionized breeding programs in plants and animals and  today  GP methods are also widely used in human genetics or ecology. Nevertheless  GP is more expensive than traditional pedigree-based breeding. GP can be difficult to implement in practical scenarios  due in part to the difficulty of optimizing genotyping strategies and to uncertainty about the genetic basis of complex traits. Thus  it is highly advisable to evaluate its potential advantages and expected performance in advance. GP accuracy depends on a large number of factors. Several of these can be controlled by the practitioner  to some extent  such as the number of SNPs  number of individuals  selection intensity  and the evaluation method. Other factors cannot be modified  such as linkage disequilibrium and are even unknown (genetic architecture). Although several approximations of the accuracy of GP have been developed  e.g. [  ]  it remains difficult to analytically assess the influence of these factors in practical scenarios across generations. For this purpose  stochastic computer simulation is the most reliable option. Although critical factors such as the detailed genetic architecture of complex traits are unknown  the main genetic parameters are reasonably well known for most complex traits  such as heritability and the distribution of genetic effects  which can be approximated by a gamma distribution [  ]. Thus  a simulation study can be performed to evaluate the effect of the number of causal loci quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) and of their location to assess the robustness of predictions. Here  we present a versatile python3 forward simulation tool  SeqBreed  to evaluate GP performance in generic scenarios and with any genetic architecture (i.e.  number of QTN  their effects and location  and the number of traits). The purpose of SeqBreed is to generate phenotype and genotype data of individuals under different (genomic) selection strategies. SeqBreed is inspired by a previous pSBVB fortran software program []  but the code has been rewritten in python3 and many new options have been added. Python can be much slower than compiled languages  but is much easier and friendlier to use  allowing direct interaction with the user to  e.g.  make plots or control selection and breeding decisions. In addition  many libraries in python  such as ‘numpy’ () or ‘pandas’ ()  are wrappers on compiled languages  such that careful programming significantly alleviates the limited speed of native python. Thus  SeqBreed is much more versatile than pSBVB and incorporates many new options  such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and principal component analysis (PCA). Most importantly  it allows automatic implementation of standard genomic selection procedures. Usage details and the main features of SeqBreed are described in the following and in the accompanying GitHub site . Broadly  SeqBreed takes genotype/sequence data from a founder population and simulates phenotypes according to a predetermined genetic architecture. Offspring genomes and phenotypes can be simulated under selection or random drift. By default  selection is simulated across a predetermined number of generations and selection intensities. SeqBreed offers extensive flexibility to the user. For example  accuracy of GP with several SNP arrays can be simultaneously compared using the same data; offspring of specific pairs of parents can be generated; and dihaploid offspring can be simulated. SeqBreed can be run using scripts or interactively  where the user can  say  obtain plots for each generation or generate genotype data of a given set of individuals. Examples of the program’s usage are in the GitHub’s jupyter notebook  and in the python script . SeqBreed is programmed in python3 using an object-oriented paradigm. The generic SeqBreed flowchart is visualized in Fig. . As input  SeqBreed minimally requires a genotype file from the founder base population in vcf [] or plink-like format []. A typical SeqBreed run consists of the following steps: Outline of the SeqBreed pipeline. Inputs are shown in red squares  dashed border rectangles represent optional input  internal data are in blue rounded squares  main operations are indicated in blue  and outputs are in green circles; G and y refer to genotypes and phenotypes  respectively. The program starts with an optional gene dropping step following an input pedigree. No selection is performed at this stage. The bottom loop represents selection  where new offspring are generated based on the genotypes of selected parents. A list of SNPs in the genotyping array must be determined when using GBLUP and BLUP. A new cycle starts when these new offspring are added to the existing population. Plots can be performed at several stages Upload founder sequence genotypes in vcf or plink format. The program automatically determines ploidy and the number of chromosomes and SNPs. Specify genome characteristics. Sex-linked SNPs and/or recombination rates can be specified. Specify desired heritabilities and causal SNPs (QTN) and their effects for every trait. Environmental variances are inferred given founder genomes  QTN effects and heritabilities. Offspring genomes and phenotypes are simulated by gene-dropping along a predetermined pedigree or by implementing selection. PCA plots or GWAS options are also implemented. The main python classes are: Population: This class contains the main attributes for running selection experiments and is a container for Individual objects. It includes methods to add new individuals generated by mating two parents or randomly shuffling founder genomes in order to increase the number of base population animals (see []). It also prints basic population data and summary plots. Individual: It allows generation  manipulation  and printing of the genotypes and phenotypes of individuals. Internally  an individual’s genome is represented by contiguous non recombining blocks rather than by the list of all SNP alleles  which allows dramatic savings in memory and increases in efficiency (see Figure 1 in Pérez-Enciso et al. []). Genome: All genome characteristics are stored and can be accessed by methods in this class. It specifies ploidy  number and class of chromosomes  and recombination rates or SNP positions. GFounder: SeqBreed requires as minimum input the genotypes of the so-called ‘founder population’  which comprises the parents of the rest of the individuals to be generated. This class stores these genotypes and automatically retrieves main genome features such as SNP positions  number of chromosomes  etc. Initial genotypes can be filtered by minimum allele frequency (MAF). QTN: This class determines the genetic architecture for each trait simulated. It has methods to determine the environmental variance given a desired heritability  and to plot variance components for QTN. In its current version  SeqBreed allows for dominance and additive actions  but not epistasis. Chip: This class is basically a container for the list of SNPs that are included in a genotyping array. It allows easy comparison of different genotyping strategies in genomic selection. By default  SeqBreed assumes that all loci are autosomal and a recombination rate of 1 cM<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 Mb throughout the genome. It includes options to specify sex or mitochondrial chromosomes  and local and sex specific recombination maps. A pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) is not accommodated for sex chromosomes  i.e.  the whole Y chromosome is assumed to be non-recombining. A mitochondrial chromosome is a non-recombining chromosome that is transmitted maternally. SeqBreed allows for autopolyploidy of any level  which is automatically detected from vcf files. Accurate modeling of meiosis in polyploids is notoriously difficult [  ] and SeqBreed implements a simplified algorithm: For each chromosome id  homologs are randomly paired. Within each pair of homologs  cross-over events are generated as for diploids  i.e.  no interaction between homologous chromosomes is modeled and the number of cross-over events is simulated following a Poisson distribution with a rate equal to chromosome length in Morgans. Sex chromosomes are modeled with a maximum ploidy of 2. Therefore  our algorithm does not fully model the interaction of preferential pairing of homologous chromosomes and double reduction arising from multivalent formation []. For the purposes of this software (i.e. comparison of GP strategies over a limited number of generations)  it is unlikely that this approximation has a dramatic effect. SeqBreed allows the simulation of any number of phenotypic traits  regardless of ploidy. For each trait  broad-sense heritability must be specified. There are three options to specify the number of QTN and their effects (): (i) a random number of QTN positions are sampled genome-wide and additive effects are sampled from a gamma distribution  (shape<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.2 and scale<U+2009>=<U+2009>5)  as suggested by Caballero et al. []; (ii) the positions of the QTN are specified in a file and additive effects are sampled from a gamma distribution; and (iii) QTN positions and additive and dominant effects for each trait are specified in an external file. By default  QTN are not removed from the sequence data to perform genomic evaluation. To remove QTN from evaluation  a SNP chip can be defined that excludes the QTN. Options (i) and (ii) can only be used with one trait and without dominance. SeqBreed adjusts the environmental variance  to retrieve the desired broad-sense heritabilities () from   where  is the variance of the genotypic values of individuals in the founder population. The genotypic value for individual  is defined as: where  is the number of QTN   is the additive effect of the -th QTN  that is  half the expected difference between homozygous genotypes  with  taking the values -<U+2009>1  0 and 1 for homozygous  heterozygous  and alternative homozygous genotypes  respectively   is the dominance effect of the -th QTN  with  taking the value 1 if the genotype is heterozygous and 0 otherwise. In the case of polyploids: where  is the number of copies of the alternative allele (coded as 1) minus half the ploidy for the -th QTN and the -th individual  and  is therefore the expected change in phenotype per copy of allele ‘1’ at the -th QTN. In polyploids  technically as many dominance coefficients as ploidy levels (h) minus two can be defined  which is not practical. As in pSBVB []  we define  as the minimum number of copies of allele ‘1’ such that the expected phenotype is  (see Figure 1 in Zingaretti et al. []). SeqBreed uses   that is  all heterozygous individuals have the same genotype value as the complete homozygous ‘1’. SeqBreed computes genotypic values for each individual and simulate phenotypes from   where  is a constant and  is a normal deviate . For multiple traits  the user needs to specify additive and dominant QTN effects separately for each trait. This is done via an external text file  where additive and dominant QTN effects are specified for each trait (option 3 in ). There is no specific assumption on genetic correlations between traits. To simulate no pleiotropy  QTN for each trait have zero effects for all other traits. Note that this does not prevent a non-zero genetic correlation arising from linkage disequilibrium. The program does not automatically adjust desired genetic correlations and  thus  different QTN values may need to be tested to fit desired correlations. Environmental correlations are always zero. It is typically difficult to find real sequence data to generate a reasonably sized founder population. To accommodate this  SeqBreed can generate ‘dummy’ founder individuals by randomly combining recombinant haplotypes. This can be done in two ways  either by generating a random pedigree and simulating a new founder individual by gene-dropping along this pedigree  or by directly simulating a number of recombining breakpoints and assigning random founder genotypes to each block between recombination breakpoints (). Seqbreed can be run along a predetermined pedigree or using a combination of options (several examples are provided in the GitHub site). It is also possible to generate new individuals interactively  including dihaploids. To speed up computations and avoid unnecessary memory usage  only recombination breaks and ancestor haplotype ids are stored for each individual (see Figure 1 in []). SeqBreed allows computing estimated breeding values using several GP methods. It also allows several lists of SNPs (SNP chips) to be defined  such that GP performance can be easily compared across chips. From a methodological point of view  most GP implementations are based on penalized linear methods (e.g.  de los Campos et al. []). SeqBreed includes some of the most popular GP options  including pedigree BLUP []  GBLUP []  and single-step GBLUP []. Only single trait GP algorithms are implemented so far. Mass selection is also implemented. For GBLUP and single-step GBLUP  the genomic relationship matrix  is obtained using VanRaden [] as: where  is a  matrix containing genotypes (coded 0 1 2 deviated from the mean) for SNPs on the chip   is the allele frequency of the -th SNP   is the number of individuals  and  is the number of SNPs. To avoid potential singularity problems  diagonal elements of  are multiplied by 1.05. SeqBreed requires that heritabilities to be used in BLUP or GBLUP are provided (i.e.  they are not estimated). The program allows the incorporation of other custom GP methods based on a user python function or by exporting SNP data and phenotypes from SeqBreed  running a genetic evaluation  externally and then importing the resulting estimated breeding values. Selection can be automatically configured and run  as documented in the GitHub examples (). Running a selection scheme requires specifying the number of generations  the numbers of females and males to be selected  and the number of offspring per female. SeqBreed splits the selection process in three steps  which allows a fine control over the breeding program. First  breeding values are predicted using the chosen evaluation method and marker information. By default  the data from all individuals across the current and previous generations are used  but this can be changed by specifying the subset of individuals to be used. Second  a function is used to generate offspring from selected parents. This function requires specifying the candidates for selection (allowing for continuous or discrete generations)  selection intensity  family size  and either assortative or random mating between selected parents. Hierarchical mating between females and males is employed by default (). Assortative and random mating schemes are implemented; more sophisticated mating schemes  such as those based on optimal contributions [  ]  have to be specified manually by modifying the function ‘ReturnNewPed’ in the selection module (). A novel feature of SeqBreed  as compared to our previous software pSBVB  is the capability of graphical outputs. Figure  illustrates some of the plots that can be performed automatically. Figure a shows the results of the QTN.plot() function  which plots the individual QTN variance as a function of MAF  the histogram of QTN variances  and the cumulative variance when QTN are sorted by MAF. This is performed for each phenotype and for both additive and dominance variances  based on allele substitution effects   where  is the minimum allele frequency  and assuming complete equilibrium. In addition  PCA plots using all sequence or custom defined SNP sets (Fig. b) are available  as well as GWAS plots showing p-values or false discovery rate (FDR) values (Fig. c). Genotype and phenotype data can also be exported in text files. Example plots produced by SeqBreed.  Contribution of each QTN to total variance. Top  individual QTN variances as a function of minimum allele frequency (MAF); middle  histogram of QTN variances; bottom  cumulative variance when QTN are sorted by MAF. In blue  additive variances; in red  dominance variances. The figure shows a fully additive phenotype  thus dominance variances are zero.  Principal component analysis plot; individuals of different generations are in different colors.  Genome-wide association study showing false discovery rate values (-<U+2009>log10 scale). SNPs on different chromosomes are represented in alternate colors The basic functioning of SeqBreed is illustrated by the main.py script that is available at . This script  or its equivalent jupyter notebook (SeqBreed_tutorial.ipynb)  shows the basic commands to run SeqBreed and import the required modules. First  SeqBreed modules are imported as: Founder population genotypes are uploaded from the vcf file  using the command: which generates a GFounder object that contains founder genotypes  vcffile is the file containing genotypes and seqfile is generated by the program and contains information about SNP positions  which are used in the next step. Next  the main genome features are specified. The following command creates a Genome object that assumes that the ‘X’ chromosome is the sex X chromosome  while SNPs on the chromosome named ‘MT’ are mitochondrial. Genetic architecture can be specified in different ways. The simplest is to generate nqtn QTN randomly distributed along the genome with effects sampled from a gamma distribution  where h2 is the desired heritability. Selection is implemented in cycles  the number of generations  the numbers of males and females selected  and family size must be specified. The following is an example with GBLUP selection  random mating  and continuous generations. We illustrate the software with sequence data from the Drosophila genome reference panel (DGRP  [])  parsed and filtered as explained in []  and genotype data from tetraploid potato []  parsed as described in []. Data and scripts are in  and in  for the Drosophila and potato examples  respectively. The DGRP scripts illustrate the specific recombination map of Drosophila  where males do not recombine  as shown in the ‘dgrp.map’ file. The example provided in GitHub consists of a small experiment to compare genomic and mass selection. Plots in the jupyter notebook are implemented to track phenotypic changes by generation. The potato scripts illustrate how to generate an F2 cross between extreme lines and to perform a GWAS experiment in polyploids. GWAS results using PCA corrected phenotypes are also shown. Several other programs have been developed for similar purposes as SeqBreed  including our own pSBVB []  AlphaSim [] and its successor AlphaSimR ()  PedigreeSim []  simuPOP []  and QMSim []. However  SeqBreed offers a unique combination of features for simulation of GP of complex traits  including built-in implementation of several GP methods  the possibility of simulating polyploid genomes  and several options to specify QTN and SNP arrays. It also allows new individuals to be generated interactively and provides graphical plots of results. It is easy to use  easy to install  and software options are illustrated with several examples in the GitHub site. Given the interactive nature of python and its graphical features  SeqBreed is especially suited for educational purposes. However  for large-scale simulations SeqBreed will not be as efficient as some Fortran counterparts such as AlphaSim or pSBVB. Note that SeqBreed was designed to evaluate the performance of GP or GWAS over a short time horizon  i.e.  new mutations are not generated. SeqBreed is not designed to investigate the long-term effects of demography or selection on DNA variability because new mutations are not generated. For these purposes  Slim [] or similar tools are more appropriate. To investigate realistic scenarios  the recommended input for SeqBreed is real sequence data. Plans for further development of SeqBreed include additional features to generalize available genetic architectures (e.g.  imprinting  epistasis)  integration with machine-learning tools (scikit  keras) for genetic evaluation  development of an educational tool with an html-based interface  and improving output and plotting features.

Our results contradict the initial and still broadly accepted model for the inheritance of horns and scurs. We hypothesise an oligogenetic model to explain the development of scurs and polledness. Horns are a characteristic and variable trait in cattle and their main role is self-defence in wild life. In the past  horns of domesticated cattle were used for tethering and attachment to harnesses []. However  in modern cattle industry  hornless cattle are desired for practical and economic reasons  such as reduced risk of injuries for humans and conspecifics and easier handling of the animals. To date  80% of dairy  46% of beef  and 67% of suckler calves in Europe are dehorned or disbudded []. Public animal welfare stakeholders have criticized this routinely performed dehorning of calves and raised awareness of the agricultural industry. Breeding genetically hornless  i.e. polled cattle  provides a long-term solution to these issues. Since the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws of heredity [  ]  many studies on the inheritance of horns have been conducted  and rapidly  polledness was described as an autosomal dominant trait. These studies also reported the unexpected occurrence of scurs in polled cattle. Scurs are described as hornlike formations that grow in the same area as horns and are only loosely attached to the skull [  ]. It is not clear at what age scurs develop  but they are assumed to occur later in life than horns []. The occurrence of scurs hampers the advantages that could be achieved by breeding for polledness as they bear an injury risk and thus make dehorning necessary again. In addition  they could be perceived as an anomaly leading to an uncertain inheritance of polledness and  in practice  decrease the acceptance of diffident farmers. The development of horns results from the interaction between tissues that originate from the ectoderm and mesoderm and from their transformation  and seems to be programmed during embryogenesis []  most likely at 60 days of gestation []. It is generally acknowledged  that the bony core of the horn develops from a separate ossification centre and fuses with the skull afterwards [  ]. However  the whole mechanism of the development of horns is not yet completely understood. The characterization of the genetic basis of polledness and scurs can contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence the development of horns. Moreover  it can provide valuable knowledge about how different tissues and cell differentiation work together during organogenesis [  ]. The  locus was mapped to the proximal end of bovine chromosome 1 (BTA1) [  ] and four variants were identified (OMIA 000483-9913); among these  two i.e. the Friesian () and Celtic () variants  are common in European cattle breeds [    ] and enable direct selection for polledness and the set-up of appropriate breeding strategies. With respect to scurs  the most commonly accepted model of inheritance was initially proposed by White and Ibsen [] and revised by later studies [    ]. The model assumes that four biallelic loci interact to control the development of horns: the “symbolic”  locus (  which is suggested to be always present and homozygous)  the  locus (with alleles  for polled and  for horns)  the  locus ( for scurs and  for no scurs) and the  locus ( for African horns and  for no African horns) [  ]. Scurs are expected to be masked in otherwise horned animals (/)  but there is discussion about an epistatic interaction between the  and  loci. However  in the literature contradictory results are reported on the mapping and expression of scurs  and some studies discuss whether the development of scurs depends on sex  the genotype at the  locus  and heterogeneity at the  locus [        ]. Interestingly  Capitan et al. [] identified a phenotype similar to scurs  called type 2 scurs  which is caused by a mutation within the  gene that occurred independently from the polled genotype and is limited to a single Charolais family. In this study  we present a unique dataset of 885 Holstein–Friesian cattle with a precisely examined horn phenotype. For the first time  we describe the diversity of the scurs phenotype in Holstein–Friesian cattle in detail. We present new insights into the inheritance pattern and expression of scurs and an exhaustive mapping study of a putative  locus using two mapping approaches. In this study  our aim was to investigate the scurs phenotype  its genetic architecture and inheritance pattern  and a putative  locus in Holstein–Friesian cattle. We surveyed 885 Holstein–Friesian cattle housed on German dairy cattle farms that are actively breeding for polledness and do not routinely dehorn calves. To obtain an adequate number of male phenotypes  we surveyed the bulls of three German breeding companies. Only individuals that descended from at least one polled parent were investigated. In total  we phenotyped 885 (813 females and 72 males) Holstein–Friesian cattle that were between 1 to 133 months old and housed on 20 farms. All individuals were examined by the same person  who inspected and palpated the left and right horn area. If necessary  the horn area was shaved to screen for small scabs or scars. Observed phenotypes were classified into five categories: (i) “smoothly polled”: absence of horns or any corneous growth in the horn area; (ii) “small frontal bumps”: small bulges in the horn area that are probably due to ossification; (iii) “frontal bumps”: pronounced bulges in the horn area (osseous base with a rather thick tissue layer) and no keratinization of the skin; (iv) “scurs”: hornlike formations in the horn area that are loosely attached to the skull by soft tissue and that vary from frontal bumps with a keratinization of the covering skin to long hornlike formations (up to 15 cm); and (v) “horns”: regular horns that are firmly attached to the skull (see Fig. ). Individuals with an intermediate (i.e. laterally diverging) phenotype were classified as “others”  e.g. a smoothly polled left horn area and a right horn area with a small scur. Observed horn phenotypes.  Smoothly polled.  Small frontal bumps.  Frontal bumps.  Small to long scurs.  Horns In order to test the characteristics of the phenotype in the mapping approaches  horn phenotypes were converted into codings (Table ). We applied two continuous (CC and CCL) and two binary (BC1 and BC2) coding models of phenotypes. In model CC  horn status was coded as a linear type trait with five classes and in model CCL  it was transformed on a liability scale with N(0 1) according to the frequency of occurrence (see Additional file : Figure S1). In models BC1 and BC2  horn status was converted into a binary trait with bumps counted as controls or cases. These codings of the horn phenotype are listed in Table . DNA was extracted from whole blood or hair samples by applying a modified protocol according to Miller et al. []. To determine the polled genotype  a direct gene test was performed on all 885 animals [  ]  which allows differentiation between the Friesian () and the Celtic  () variants. For single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping  we selected a subset of animals based on the following criteria: (i) horn phenotype categories “smoothly polled”  “frontal bumps” and “scurs”; (ii) minimum age of 700 days for animals of the categories “smoothly polled” and “frontal bumps”; (iii) female animals; and (iv) heterozygous polled animals that carry the  variant. The selected subset consisted of 240 cows  which were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina  Chicago) that contains 777 962 SNPs. SNPs were remapped to the bovine reference genome assembly ARS-UCD1.2 []. During quality control  SNPs with an unknown position  a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01 and a call rate per marker lower than 0.9 were excluded. Moreover  all genotyped X chromosome SNPs were divided into pseudo-autosomal XY SNPs and X chromosome-specific SNPs. After quality control  762 966 SNPs and 232 individuals with a genotype call rate higher than 0.95 remained for analysis. We imputed missing genotypes and reconstructed haplotypes using the software BEAGLE 5 [  ]  which exploits haplotype Hidden Markov models. BEAGLE 5 considers the relationships between genotyped individuals nested in a linkage-format pedigree. For a better accuracy  genotype and pedigree information of 1434 additional animals  which were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip (call rate<U+2009>><U+2009>0.95) and otherwise not included in the following mapping  were added for haplotyping and imputation. We estimated the phenotypic variance explained by all SNPs by using the GCTA software version 1.92.3 and applying a genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum-likelihood (GREML) approach []. The age at phenotyping was corrected by including it as a covariate in the model. The analysis was performed for all phenotype codings. As validation of the results  for each phenotype coding  100 permutations of each phenotype were conducted and the heritability was estimated. To map a putative  locus  we conducted mixed linear model based association analyses (MLMA) with a leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) approach as implemented in the GCTA software version 1.92.3 []. The following model was applied:  where  is the vector of horn phenotypes   is the vector of fixed effects including the overall mean and age at phenotyping   is the vector of the additive effect (fixed) of the SNP tested for association   is the vector of the accumulated effects (random) of all SNPs excluding those on the chromosome that carries a candidate SNP   is the vector of residuals.    and  are the incidence matrices for    and   respectively. Based on the Bonferroni method  significance thresholds were set to a genome-wide significance at P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05/N and a suggestive significance at P<U+2009><<U+2009>1/N  where N is the number of SNPs used in the analysis []. The genome-wide significance threshold in this study was equal to 6.55<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (0.05/762966) and the suggestive significance threshold to 1.31<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (1/762966). Another approach to map a putative  locus used a combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis (cLDLA)  which is the method proposed by Meuwissen et al. []. To correct for population stratification and family relationships  a unified additive relationship matrix () between all animals and its inverse () were estimated []. We also implemented the LOCO approach. A chromosome with n SNPs has n–1 SNP intervals and their corresponding midpoints. Each SNP interval midpoint was considered as a putative locus with a causal effect on the investigated phenotype. We used the surrounding SNP haplotypes (reconstructed as described above) and a sliding window (sw) approach to estimate the identity-by-descent (IBD) between alleles at each SNP interval midpoint along the chromosomes. Thus  the SNP window shifts SNP by SNP along the chromosome  e.g. a sliding window with 40 SNPs (sw40) overlaps by 39 sequential SNPs. Different window sizes of 20  40  80 and 160 sequential SNPs were tested. For each window midpoint  e.g. for sw40 between SNPs 20 and 21  a locus IBD matrix was estimated as described by Meuwissen and Goddard []. Then  the locus IBD matrix was converted into a diplotype relationship matrix (D) as suggested by Lee and van der Werf []. The genome-wide QTL mapping was performed using a cLDLA approach as described in Medugorac et al. []. In the mixed linear model  linkage disequilibrium was considered in the D  whereas linkage was accounted for in the reconstruction of haplotypes. Variance component analysis for each window midpoint was carried out with ASReml []. ASReml estimates the maximum likelihood  variance components  and fixed and random effects simultaneously by taking the genome-wide additive relationships () as well as the IBD probabilities of the putative causal locus (i.e. QTL) into account. The following mixed linear model was applied:  where  is the vector of the alternative horn phenotype codings converted into a binary or quantitative trait;  is the vector of fixed effects including the overall mean () and age at phenotyping;  is the vector of n random polygenic effects for each animal with ;  is the vector of random additive genetic effects of the putative QTL with    where  is the D matrix at the  marker interval midpoint along the chromosome. Random residual effects were included in the vector  with    where  is an identity matrix. Random effects (    ) are assumed to be uncorrelated and normally distributed. Their respective variances (    and ) were estimated simultaneously using ASReml. The matrices    and  are the incidence matrices for the fixed and random effects. Finally  a likelihood ratio test (LRT) for the goodness-of-fit between the null hypothesis (: model without a QTL effect) and the alternative hypothesis (: model including a QTL effect) at each SNP interval midpoint was calculated. The logarithms of likelihood estimated by ASReml were compared as follows:  To empirically estimate the genome-wide significance thresholds  we conducted a cLDLA permutation in the investigated mapping population. For each chromosome  100 datasets with randomized phenotypes were tested at 100 random SNP interval midpoints each. This resulted in 10 000 LRT values per chromosome (29 autosomes  X and pseudoautosomal XY)  i.e. 310 000 randomized LRT values genome-wide. The 15 highest randomized LRT values defined the genome-wide threshold of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis at a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0005 (15/310 000) for a particular design  i.e. phenotype coding and window size. Due to computation time limits  the permutation test was conducted for the CC coding for all window sizes  and for all other codings for sw40 only. To estimate the power of the design  a simplified simulation study was conducted. Briefly  liabilities for 232 independent animals were generated on the scale N(0 1). Individual liabilities were the sum of the QTL effect and of independent residuals on the underlying scale  where the QTL explained 10  20 and 30% of the genetic variation assuming a heritability of 0.6  respectively. Liabilities were then converted into the respective codings as defined in Table  (CC  CCL  BC1) according to appropriate thresholds  which ensure the real distribution of phenotypes. Finally  a single marker regression of r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8 for a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL was conducted and the  value of the regression coefficient was compared to the suggestive and genome-wide significance thresholds defined above. Each scenario (QTL-variance*coding) was repeated 10 000 times and the proportion of replicates with P-values exceeding the significance thresholds represents its power. Annotation of gene content was performed as described by Medugorac et al. []. Briefly  the genes in 200-kb intervals surrounding the significant regions that were detected with the CC and CCL phenotype coding were extracted from the UCSC Genome Browser (ARS-UCD1.2) []. For intervals without genes  we considered the gene that reads in the 5' to 3' sense and was closest to the detected region within a 1-Mbp surrounding interval. We used the “RefSeq Genes” track  as well as the “Non-cow RefSeq genes”  “Cow mRNAs from GenBank” and “Cow ESTs that have been spliced” tracks to consider genes that might have been missed in the annotation of the bovine genome assembly ARS-UCD1.2. Only the genes that have been annotated in the human or mouse genome were considered. Gene set enrichment analysis for MGI Mammalian Phenotype Level 4 2019 (MMP4) was performed with Enrichr [  ]. Among the 885 surveyed Holstein–Friesian cattle  we observed 265 smoothly-polled animals  115 individuals with small frontal bumps and 259 with frontal bumps  109 animals showed scurs  and 127 animals were horned. For the remaining 10 individuals  we were not able to unambiguously state the horn phenotype and these were classified as others (see Fig. a). It should be mentioned that since we focused on animals that descended from at least one polled parent  the number of horned animals was small. In the following analysis  we excluded animals that were classified in the ‘horn’ and ‘others’ categories  i.e. 137 animals  since they were not expected to contribute any additional relevant information to our study. Distributions of horn phenotypes.  Total number of animals in the horn phenotype categories: smoothly polled  small frontal bumps  frontal bumps and scurs.  Proportion of male and female cattle in the horn phenotype categories: smoothly polled  small frontal bumps  frontal bumps and scurs  with number of males<U+2009>=<U+2009>66 and number of females<U+2009>=<U+2009>683.  Proportion of heterozygous polled animals carrying the Friesian (/  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>615) or the Celtic (/  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>53) polled variant and homozygous polled animals carrying the Friesian polled variant in homozygous state (/  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>43) and carrying one Friesian and one Celtic polled variant (/  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10) in the different horn phenotype categories (smoothly polled  small frontal bumps  frontal bumps and scurs) To investigate whether the expression of scurs is independent from sex  we compared the proportion of male and female individuals in the different horn phenotype categories. Strikingly  relatively more male (60%) than female individuals (10%) showed scurs  whereas more females (37% vs. 17%) were smoothly-polled or had small frontal bumps (17% vs. 5%) and frontal bumps (36% vs. 18%) (Fig. b). A Pearson’s Chi squared test confirmed that the horn phenotype is not independent from sex (p<U+2009><<U+2009>2.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Furthermore  we investigated  whether the expression of scurs is independent from the polled genotype. A direct gene test for polledness allowed us to distinguish between the  and  variants. None of the homozygous polled ( or ) animals had scabs or scurs  but most of them were smoothly-polled (Fig. c); only 15 of the 53 homozygous polled animals showed small frontal bumps (  n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5) or frontal bumps (both   n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and   n<U+2009>=<U+2009>9; Fig. c). It is also striking that heterozygous animals that carry the  allele expressed a significantly higher proportion of scurs than the heterozygous animals that carry the  allele; this was confirmed by a Fisher’s exact test (P<U+2009><<U+2009>3.275<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). To map the putative  locus  we genotyped a subset of selected female animals on the BovineHD BeadChip from Illumina. The phenotypic variance explained by all SNPs was estimated using the GREML approach. For all phenotype codings  SNP heritability was estimated for the observed phenotype and for 100 permutations of this phenotype. The estimated phenotypic variance explained by all SNPs was 0.65 (±<U+2009>0.19) for the CC coding  0.63 (±<U+2009>0.20) for CCL  0.60 (±<U+2009>0.25) for BC1  and 0.41 (±<U+2009>0.18) for BC2. All estimates of the SNP-based heritability of the phenotype differed significantly from those of the permuted phenotype. The detailed results on the estimates for the different codings and respective permutations are in Additional file : Table S1. The estimated SNP heritability was much lower for the BC2 coding than for all the other codings and thus  was not analysed further. Different window sizes  i.e. sw20  sw40  sw80  and sw160  for cLDLA were tested. The LRT curves became smoother and less peaked with increased window size but the mapping results remained similar. Figure  is a good example of the influence of window size on the shape of the LRT curve in the QTL region on BTA12. As window size increased  the computation time necessary to calculate the IBD matrices increased significantly. For the mapping population investigated here  the best compromise between LRT curve resilience and acceptable computation time was obtained with sw40. To estimate the empirical genome-wide significance threshold for the cLDLA with different phenotype codings (Table )  a permutation test for each phenotype coding and for different window sizes was conducted. We detected very similar genome-wide significance thresholds (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00005; false positive rate of 15/310 000) for sw40 and different codings  i.e. 14.74 for CC  15.28 for CCL and 14.98 for BC1. A detailed list of the detected thresholds for all codings is in Additional file : Table S2. Comparison of LRT values from the cLDLA analysis with different window sizes. LRT results of sliding windows (sw) of 20  40  80 and 160 subsequent SNPs for a detected region on BTA12 The results of the cLDLA (sw40) are shown in the Manhattan plots of Fig.  for the two continuous phenotype codings and in Additional file : Figure S2 for BC1. With the CC and CCL codings  four genome-wide significant associations were detected. On BTA5  LRT values in the region between 44 657 092 and 44 691 633 bp (i.e. 18 overlapping windows) with the CC coding and between 44 653 747 and 44 695 065 bp (i.e. 20 overlapping windows) with the CCL coding exceeded the significance threshold of 14.74 and 15.28  respectively. On BTA12  three genome-wide significant peaks were found with a continuous coded trait: one peak between 7774 577 and 7844 252 bp (CC) and 7780 281 and 7808 705 bp (CCL); a second peak between 18 556 088 and 18 561 582 bp (CC) and 18 561 582 and 18 609 141 bp (CCL); and a third peak that spanned a larger region between 20 468 696 and 21 192 686 bp (CC) and 20 454 904 and 20 857 664 bp (CCL). These four QTL mapped at genome-wide significance irrespective of the window size (20–160 SNPs) used and of the continuous coding of horn status. Moreover  with different window sizes  the peaks on BTA16  18 and 23 were close to or just reached the genome-wide significance thresholds. Positions with significant LRT values obtained with the CC and CCL codings and their overlaps are listed in Additional file : Table S5. The results obtained with the BC1 coding differed completely from those with both CC and CCL codings (see Additional file : Figure S2). The binary coded trait was characterised by a large number of high LRT values that were mostly associated with single SNP windows. Results of the cLDLA for scurs with different phenotype codings with sw40. LRT- values are shown on the y-axis  bovine chromosomes on the x-axis. The red horizontal line marks the genome-wide significance threshold (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00005) derived from permutation testing.  CC phenotype coding and  CCL phenotype coding To check the congruence of the cLDLA and GWAS mapping results  we performed a mixed linear model-based association analysis (MLMA) with the procedure implemented in the software GCTA-LOCO []. MLMA mapping was performed for CC and CCL coding but for BC1 the analysis was difficult due to convergence problems. To facilitate the visual comparability of the cLDLA and MLMA mapping results  we transformed the P-values from both methods to -<U+2009>log10(P). Thus  we consider that the LRT values follow a <U+03C7> distribution with one degree of freedom []. It should be kept in mind that MLMA estimates the P-value directly at a specific SNP  whereas cLDLA estimates it at the midpoint between two adjacent SNPs. To interpolate the midpoint values and smooth the curve  we calculated the average of 10 adjacent MLMA -<U+2009>log10(P)-values  which are shown in parallel to the cLDLA values. Figure  illustrates the congruence between both mapping methods for significant and indicative QTL on BTA5  12  16 and 18 according to CC phenotype coding and sw40. Congruence of cLDLA (sw40) and MLMA results for CC phenotype coding. P-values of both methods were transformed to -<U+2009>log10(P);  detected region on BTA5 (41–45 Mb);  detected region on BTA12 (5–10 Mb);  detected region on BTA16 (38–42 Mb); and  detected region on BTA18 (44–48 Mb) Close inspection and palpation of 885 Holstein–Friesian skulls revealed a great variety of horn phenotypes  which ranged from smoothly polled animals  through to frontal bumps  scabs  up to 10 cm long scurs  and finally to normal horns. A large proportion (42%) of the animals in our dataset had small frontal bumps or frontal bumps and  according to reports from experienced staff of German breeding associations  the majority of scabs and scurs arise on previously developed frontal bumps. Therefore  we assumed that a frontal bump is a precursor of a scur. However  due to premature culling or unknown environmental factors  some frontal bumps will never develop into scurs. Since the first study that reported the development of scurs []  several authors have described scurs and horn phenotypes in various cattle breeds and have sorted them into partly ambiguous categories. For example  in 1952  Williams and Williams [] divided the observed phenotypes into six categories  although they mention that “the involved phenotypes form an almost continuous series”. In addition to the phenotypes that we have described here  two other phenotypes have been mentioned in the literature: (i) scurs that are partially fused with the frontal bone and therefore rather firmly attached to the skull have been reported in the Charolais and Angus breeds [  ]  and (ii) mutilated horns that are described as crumpled horns occurring only in females have been found in polled Hereford cattle []. Since our data concern Holstein–Friesian cattle  these two phenotypes were not observed in our study. The currently accepted model for the inheritance of horns and scurs  which is described in the introduction and summarised in the OMIA database (OMIA 000483-9913)  was proposed before DNA was even identified as the carrier of genetic information i.e. before it was possible to accurately determine the underlying polled genotypes. This explains that  to date  several inconsistencies with this model have been reported [    ]. In addition  by using a larger dataset  we confirm the findings of recent studies  which suggest that homozygous polled animals may never have fully developed scurs [  ]. However  we did observe small frontal bumps or frontal bumps  which we assume to be precursors of scurs  in 28% of the homozygous polled animals. Moreover  the phenotypic distribution of our data supports the hypothesis that scurs is a sex-dependent trait  since scurs are significantly more prevalent in  males than in  females (61% vs. 10%) and the scurs are on average larger in males than in females. Scurs seem to develop later in life than horns [] and it is not clear if they occur later in females than in males. However  in our data  the youngest individuals with scurs were six months old and belonged to both sexes. The segregation of the  and  alleles in 885 Holstein–Friesian cattle provide further insight into the possible interaction between the polled allele and the development of scurs. According to our dataset  the  allele supresses the development of scurs more efficiently (P<U+2009><<U+2009>3.27×10 ) than the  allele. Phenotypes that are routinely recorded by breeding associations are easily available but  during the pilot project  we noted that some of the animals recorded as smoothly polled at breeding approval developed regular scurs with advancing age. Moreover  such routine phenotyping by several investigators may suffer from lack of standardisation. This emphasises the need for standardised phenotyping and recording of age at phenotyping. The age-dependent penetrance is a well-known problem in mapping studies for genetic traits that are not expressed at birth but develop only later in life [  ]. Moreover  frontal bumps can go unnoticed and such misclassification during phenotyping may be another reason why there are few studies on the genetic architecture of scurs and horns []. Finally  the direct gene test for polledness has become available only recently and  contrary to our study  precise polled genotypes were not available in most previous ones. To prove the consistency of the cLDLA results with different window sizes  we performed genome-wide mapping with windows consisting of 20  40  80 and 160 SNPs  which allowed us to recommend the best window size as a compromise between LRT curve resilience and reasonable computation time for the estimation of the locus IBD matrices and for variance analyses including  of constant size and  of variable size for position () along the genome. For genome-wide mapping with a window size of 40 SNPs  we estimated 653 668  matrices  inverted them  and performed the same number of variance analyses by ASReml []. As window size increased  the number of matrices and variance analyses remained the same  but the size of the matrices increased. The computing expense is an exponential function of the matrix size  which depends on the length of the haplotype considered (window size) and on the haplotype diversity in the mapping population. Our results suggest that a genome-wide QTL scan with a shorter window (e.g. 20 SNPs) and subsequent confirmation of significant and indicative QTL with a longer window could be a good compromise  especially for larger mapping populations. According to the collected data and previously published results [      ]  the genetic basis of the scurs phenotype is complex and affected by the polled genotype including allelic heterogeneity (        ) as well as sex and age of the individuals at phenotyping. However  by considering the initial hypothesis that scurs is a monogenic qualitative trait  we performed binary coding of the horn status (BC1). To exclude any source of noise as much as possible  we analysed only the heterozygous  females. As discussed above  we consider frontal bumps as precursors of scurs  and thus  the first binary coding (BC1) puts frontal bumps  scabs and scurs into the same class. However  there is no keratin layer on the bulges in the horn area in the case of animals classified as “small frontal bumps” or “frontal bumps”. Thus  the second binary coding (BC2) puts “smoothly polled”  “small frontal bumps” and “frontal bumps” in the first class  and animals with keratinization of the skin in the horn area (from “scabs” to large “scurs”) into the second class. These two binary traits (BC1 and BC2) and two continuous coded traits (CC and CCL) were analysed. Estimates of the SNP heritability were rather high for all phenotype codings (see Additional file : Table S1). Estimation of the phenotypic variance explained by all SNPs depends on the underlying dataset. Animals in the dataset of this study were directly selected according to their horn phenotype. Therefore  the estimated heritabilities do not represent an estimate for the entire population. Compared to CC and CCL  the BC2 and BC1 binary coding had the lowest and second lowest SNP heritability  respectively. The results of the power analysis (see Additional file : Table S3) are in agreement with this finding and demonstrate that the two designs with continuous coded phenotypes are the most appropriate for the detection of the putative QTL involved in the occurrence of scurs. Taking these results and field observations together  it is not correct to consider frontal bumps as smoothly polled as was done in the BC2 coding. Therefore  this coding was not used further in the mapping analysis  and we recommend precise recording of frontal bumps and age of phenotyping for future mapping studies of scurs. The cLDLA of both continuous coded traits CC and CCL gave similar results  with genome-wide significant (BTA5 and BTA12) and suggestive (BTA16  BTA18 and BTA23) signals mapped to the same regions. In contrast  the mapping results of BC1 did not coincide with those of CC and CCL. Both MLMA and cLDLA considered the LOCO approach and variance component estimation and both showed serious convergence problems with BC1 but not with CC and CCL phenotype coding. These convergence problems are most probably the cause for the complete failure of MLMA and the noisy LRT signals of cLDLA for the binary coded scurs trait. In general  this is not the case with binary traits  i.e. MLMA and cLDLA have been successfully applied to fine map and subsequently identify causal mutations for recessive [] and dominant [] traits. Moreover  both approaches were also successfully used for highly significant mapping of polygenic traits such as calving ease [] that resembles CC in coding (five categories) and quantitative nature. Taken together  our results suggest that binary coding  both BC1 and BC2  is an unsuitable oversimplification of a quantitative trait with age-dependent penetrance. Our well-structured design (one breed  one sex  one polled genotype  one polled allele and recorded age-of-phenotyping) resulted in the mapping of four genome-wide significant loci that affect the development of scurs. The annotation of gene content and subsequent gene set enrichment analysis of the detected regions (see Additional file : Table S4) showed that no MGI Mammalian Phenotype level 4 (MMP4) ontology was significantly enriched after correction for multiple testing (adjusted P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  probably because of the small size of the dataset. Nevertheless  we considered 53 MMP4 with a raw P-value lower than 0.05 to identify putative candidate genes. Among these  we observed 13 ontologies related to bone development  14 to the blood system  and 7 to the nervous system. Two genes are particularly relevant:  and   which account for most of the ontologies associated with bone development and the nervous system  respectively.  encodes the SUN domain containing ossification factor (BTA16)  which is an essential protein for normal osteoblast function []. In mouse  a mutation in this gene causes wide cranial sutures  thin neurocranium  and severe skeletal defects.  (BTA18) encodes the neurite outgrowth multiadaptor RhoGAP protein  which is involved in the regulation of dendritic branching during cerebral cortex development []. Interestingly  Wang et al. [] have only very recently highlighted the important role of genes that are involved in nervous system development and in the neural crest cell migration and differentiation  in the differentiation of horn buds. Taken together  these findings suggest that the scurs phenotype and its genetic background are more complex than previously proposed  and we have severe doubts with a monogenetic inheritance mode. The oversimplified hypothesis about a biallelic  and  locus is far from the current knowledge about the coordinated action of gene networks during embryogenesis and differentiation of tissues that create organs (e.g. [])  but this hypothesis still partly guides our mapping designs. One possible explanation would be that the phenotype is caused by a limited number of epistatic effects between the  locus and several  so far unmapped loci that are responsible for scurs  which are part of the accessory genome. Pan-genome analysis would be an option (see []) to investigate this hypothesis  but the material and methodology available for our study are not sufficient for such an analysis. In view of our results  we hypothesise that the intensity and course of development of horns and scurs are influenced by several  genes and environmental factors. It is possible that different variants at the  locus could amplify the transcription of transregulatory RNAs which target genes that are involved in horn development. Thus  these genes would be downregulated or even completely knocked-out. Depending on the degree of downregulation  affected animals may develop scurs  scabs  or bumps or be smoothly polled. The presence of two polled alleles supresses the development of horns and scurs completely. However  if only one polled allele is present  the intensity of this suppression depends on factors such as sex  age  the polled allele and the genetic variance at multiple  genes  which may be down and upregulated to different degrees depending on some alleles placed at different loci in in the network. Our investigations demonstrate the complexity of the inheritance of horns. Our results suggest a rather complex network of several interacting genes instead of the previously accepted four loci model. Investigations of the genetic background of peculiar horn phenotypes may provide further insights into the genes that are involved in the development of horns (e.g. [  ]). Moreover  the next step to explore the genetic architecture of horn development could be to develop a mapping design in horned animals  e.g. for which the horn length and diameter of not dehorned  animals  which would ideally be already genotyped with an SNP chip used for routine purpose (genomic selection)  are measured at comparable ages (e.g. calf markets). In this study  we investigated the scurs phenotype in polled Holstein–Friesian cattle and performed a genetic analysis of putative  loci. We observed a range of horn phenotypes in genetically polled cattle  which almost form a continuous distribution. Our well-structured mapping population led to the identification of four genome-wide significant loci that affect the development of scurs. These results explicitly disagree with the monogenetic inheritance mode that was initially proposed by White and Ibsen []. We propose a model in which the complexity of horns  including different horn modifications such as polledness and scurs  and the intensity of horn development are influenced by several genetic factors and non-genetic effects. We assume an oligogenetic architecture and a phenotypically quantitative basis of the trait with age-dependent penetrance.

Next  we evaluated the weights to assign to growth and FCR in a two-trait breeding goal to maximize sustainability of fish production.

The genetic correlation between TGC and FCR affects the magnitude of economic losses due to omitting FCR in the breeding program. In addition  the genetic correlation affects the importance of choosing EV or ENV to reduce eutrophication and increase profit. Most fish breeding companies consider growth rate as the major trait to be improved in their breeding program []. When a farm is operating under a quota on biomass  which is for example the case for salmon farms in Norway  improving growth rate is expected to increase farm profit through a reduction in production time  thus increasing annual production and returns. However  livestock and fish production has an impact on the environment [  ]  which raises the need for breeding programs that reduce these impacts. Several studies have already investigated the environmental impact of genetic improvement of traits in livestock [   ] and fish production [  ]. Our studies on fish showed that improving feed conversion ratio (FCR; the ratio of feed intake over body weight gain) can increase profit and decrease environmental impacts at the same time  which makes  an essential trait to include in breeding programs. However  unlike terrestrial livestock  feed efficiency is typically not included in fish breeding programs because individual feed intake cannot be measured accurately in group-reared fish (see review in [])  and because feed efficiency is assumed to have a favourable (negative) correlation with growth rate  although the exact value of this correlation is uncertain. Several studies in terrestrial animals and in fish have reported a negative genetic correlation between growth and  [  ]  whereas other studies on fish showed a zero correlation (e.g. in brown trout [  ]). The genetic response of a breeding program depends on the phenotypic and genetic correlations between the traits in the breeding goal and in the corresponding selection index. In the case of a single-trait breeding goal where the trait of interest is e.g. growth rate  the response depends only on the heritability and phenotypic variance of growth rate  and on the intensity of selection. A correlated response in FCR will depend on the genetic standard deviation of  and on the genetic correlation between  and growth rate. In a breeding goal with growth rate and FCR  the response depends not only on the phenotypic and genetic correlations between the traits in the selection index and in the breeding goal but also on the weights applied to the traits in the breeding goal (Eq.   see below). When the main objective of selection is to maximise farm profit  the weights used in the breeding goal are economic values (EV). Using these values in a breeding goal and the optimal index corresponding to that breeding goal optimizes the direction and magnitude of the genetic responses in growth rate and FCR to maximize the economic return of genetic improvement. However  EV might not be the best weights to enhance the environmental sustainability of fish production. In a previous study []  we calculated environmental values (ENV) of fish traits by combining bio-economic modelling and life cycle assessment (LCA) []  as in van Middelaar et al. []. Similar to EV  ENV express the change in different categories of environmental impact (e.g. climate change or eutrophication) when changing one trait and keeping the other traits in the breeding goal constant. These ENV can be used as weights in the breeding goal to derive a selection index that maximizes the reduction of the environmental impacts of fish production. In this study  we calculated EV based on the impact of genetic change on profit per farm per year and ENV based on differences in kg of pollutants emitted per farm per year (Eqs. () and ()  see below). We chose these units because most pricing mechanisms  constraints on inputs and outputs  and management variables act at the farm level []. At the farm level  the ENV consider the absolute change in environmental impacts to reflect the environmental impact of a farming site (i.e. benthos degradation  dissolved nutrient emissions  ecosystem changes). In this paper  we explored different strategies to enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of fish production. First  we explored the potential gain in economic return of upgrading a simple breeding program for growth rate only by including FCR in the breeding goals and percentage of fat in the dorsal muscle as an indirect criterion of FCR in the index. We explored this potential gain as a function of the genetic and phenotypic correlation between growth and . Then  we compared the response to selection in terms of economic gains and change in eutrophication for the two-trait (growth and ) breeding goal using economic (EV) or environmental weights (ENV). In a previous study []  we calculated EV and ENV for thermal growth coefficient  and  using a bio-economic model and an LCA for sea bass reared in sea cages. The approach and models used are briefly described below. The bio-economic model estimated the production of sea bass () in a hypothetical sea cage farm producing 1000 tons of sea bass per year  where the instant biomass present on site was constrained to 435 tons (“standing stock” or “biomass” quota). The farm was composed of 34 circular cages of 600 m for pre-growing and 34 circular cages of 1800 m for on-growing. Fish were stocked at 10 g and sold at a fixed harvest weight of 400 g. Stocking occurred all year round. The bio-economic model was divided into four model parts. The fish model estimates individual fish growth using  corrected for the concave relationship between growth rate and temperature [].  was modelled by combining a third order polynomial model from Person-Le Ruyet et al. [] that models FCR as a function of temperature at a fixed body weight with an exponential model from Lanari et al. [] that models the variation of FCR with fish body weight. The fish model also estimates the individual emission of nutrient-based pollutants using mass-balance [  ]. The batch model estimates the average stocking density of a batch depending on individual fish performances (from the fish model) and mortality. A batch is defined as the group of fish stocked at the same time in the same pre-growing cage. The farm model estimates the number of batches produced to calculate annual fish production  emission of pollutants  and annual feed consumption  while complying with the quota on biomass. Finally  in the economic model  annual profit is calculated by combining results of the farm model with economic parameters. Further details about the bio-economic model are in Additional files     : Tables S1  S2 and S3. LCA is a standardized method to calculate the environmental impact of a production chain  from raw material extraction up to the product’s end of life []. The production chain studied here included five distinct sub-systems: (1) production of purchased feed  including production of ingredients  processing  and transportation; (2) production of energy expended at the farm level (electricity  gas and petrol); (3) production of farming facilities and equipment; (4) chemicals used  including the production and use of anti-fouling for nets; (5) farming operations  including emission of nutrient based pollutants from biological transformation of feed. Each flow of resources and pollutants observed in the system was assigned to eutrophication potential. We chose to investigate only eutrophication because quotas are essentially designed to limit the eutrophication caused by fish farming. The characterization factors in the CML2 Baseline 2000 version 2.04 method were used to compute eutrophication. The categories of impact were calculated using the Simapro 7.0 software. Eutrophication was expressed per farm on the basis of 1 year of routine production (impact_farm). The impact_farm values were subsequently used to calculate ENV. The EV and ENV of a trait were calculated for a one genetic standard deviation change in the mean of the trait while the means of the other traits remained constant. When calculating EV and ENV  increasing  while keeping  constant was achieved by increasing feed intake. Conversely  improving  while keeping  constant was generated by reducing feed intake. Unlike previous studies [  ]  we displayed EV as monetary gain per one unit of trait change (and not per genetic standard deviation)  i.e. from 2.25 to 3.25  for  and from 2.03 to 1.03 for   to comply with the requirements of the software (SelAction) used to compute response to selection. The EV of a trait was calculated as the difference between profit before () and after () changing the trait by one unit  divided by the production of fish before genetic change (). We used the eutrophication per year per farm () to calculate environmental values for eutrophication at the farm level for  and . The ENV of a trait was calculated as the difference between  before ( and after genetic change () changing the trait by one trait unit  divided by the production of fish before genetic change. Thus  the ENV refers to the local environmental impacts caused by a farm. The resulting EV and ENV are in Table . Here  we consider that a positive EV or ENV means that an increase in trait value increases economic return and decreases environmental impacts of a farm. The mechanisms by which a change in TGC determined its EV and ENV were as follows. An increase in TGC reduces the production cycle and therefore  increases the number of times per year when the farm is running at the maximum biomass []. Therefore  improving TGC increases production and increases the number of juveniles purchased. Furthermore  at a constant FCR  an increase in TGC does not affect total feed intake over the life of a fish but annual feed consumption per year per farm increases due to higher production. Consequently  the EV of TGC is positive because extra profit from higher production overtakes extra costs of feed and juveniles. However  the ENV of TGC is negative because an increase in TGC increases eutrophication due to greater use of feed and greater emissions of pollutants per farm per year []. The mechanism by which changes in FCR determined its EV and ENV was that a reduction of FCR while keeping TGC constant reduces the total amount of feed required to reach harvest weight. Therefore  reducing FCR reduces the annual use of feed per farm []. Consequently  the EV and ENV of FCR are both negative  meaning that an increase in FCR decreases profit and eutrophication. We simulated a simple breeding program for sea bass using SelAction []  in which 100 females were mated to 100 males to create 100 full-sib families. Forty fish (20 females and 20 males) were kept per family (4000 fish in total) as selection candidates. From these candidates  200 (5%  100 males and 100 females) were selected as parents for the next generation  corresponding to a selection intensity of 2.06. The breeding goal included two traits   and : where   is the EV or ENV and  is the additive genetic value. Selection was on a pseudo-BLUP selection index based on own performance and information from 39 full sibs for  and the percentage of fat in dorsal muscle (%fat). We assumed a non-lethal measurement of  %fat using ultrasounds as an indirect criterion of  as in Kause et al. []. Genetic gain per generation obtained from SelAction was converted to genetic standard deviations (s) per year considering an average generation interval of 2.5 years (3 years for females and 2 years for males). We expressed genetic gain in s to compare the genetic gain achieved for the three traits on a standardized basis. We used the single trait breeding goal  as the baseline where selection was on  using a pseudo-BLUP index based on own performance and information from 39 full sibs for  only  resulting in correlated responses in %fat and . Genetic parameters of the three traits are in Tables  and . For FCR  genetic parameters were from rainbow trout ()  whereas correlations between  and % fat were from European sea bass. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between  and  are uncertain in sea bass. Thus  we tested values ranging from 0 to -<U+2009>0.8 in steps of 0.01 for both genetic and phenotypic correlations between  and . The genetic and phenotypic correlations between TGC and FCR were assumed equal to each other. In the single-trait breeding goal  the response to selection for  was always the same regardless of the correlation with  because only the response for  was maximized (Fig.   left panel). The correlated response for %fat was also constant since the genetic correlation between TGC and %fat was fixed (Fig.   right panel). Conversely  as expected  the correlated response in FCR from selection on  was higher when the genetic correlation between TGC and FCR was stronger (Fig.   central panel). Response to selection for thermal growth coefficient () (left panel)  feed conversion ratio ( (middle panel) and %fat (right panel) as a function of the genetic correlation (r) between  and   for a single-trait breeding goal with  (“single trait”) and for breeding goals with  and  weighted by EV and ENV  respectively. Values are expressed in genetic standard deviations (s) per year In a two-trait breeding goal  the response to selection achieved is the result of a complex interaction between weights assigned to each trait and the additive genetic variances for those traits  and their correlations. The response to selection for  was favourable (FCR decreased) and similar when using either EV or ENV (Fig.   central panel). When the correlation between  and  was strongly negative (<<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.17 for EV and<U+2009><<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.22 for ENV)  response to selection for  increased because FCR could be improved by simply improving TGC. When the correlation between  and  reached -<U+2009>0.8  almost all the selection response for  was due to the improvement in  and there was little benefit from including %fat. However  the improvement in  reached a minimum value when the correlation between  and  was -<U+2009>0.17 (when using EV) or -<U+2009>0.22 (when using ENV). Interestingly  using EV or ENV caused different responses for  (Fig.   left panel). For correlations of  with  between -<U+2009>0.21 and 0  TGC decreased when using ENV basically because  was quite heritable (h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.43) and because the ENV of  was negative. When the correlations became stronger (<<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.21)  improving   which was the trait with the largest ENV could only be achieved by increasing TGC. On the contrary  the response to selection for  was always positive (TGC increased) when using EV because the EV of  was positive and selection on  generated a favourable correlated response for  (except when the correlation was exactly 0). As expected  response for %fat was positive when using EV due to the positive correlation of  with %fat (Fig.   right panel). The increase in %fat was even larger when the correlations between  and  approached 0  due to the increased importance of %fat to improve . When using ENV  the increase in response for %fat was largest for correlations between  and  of -<U+2009>0.4. For correlations greater than -<U+2009>0.4  the response in  %fat decreased in order to generate a decrease in   which had a negative ENV. For correlations lower than -<U+2009>0.4  the response for %fat decreased because the correlations between  and  were sufficiently high to generate a favourable correlated response for  without having to increase %fat too much. With the single-trait breeding goal  economic returns increased linearly (Fig.   left panel) while eutrophication decreased linearly (Fig.   right panel) with a decrease in the correlation between  and . Nevertheless  implementing a single-trait breeding goal caused an increase in eutrophication per farm per year when the correlation between  and  was weak  between -<U+2009>0.27 and 0 (Fig.   right panel). Economic (left panel) and environmental (right panel) response to selection as a function of genetic correlation (r) between thermal growth coefficient ()  feed conversion ratio (). The economic and environmental responses were calculated for a single-trait breeding goal with  (“single trait”) and for breeding goals with  and  weighted by EV or ENV. Values are expressed as economic return (euros per kg of fish produced per year) or reduction in eutrophication (kg PO-eq per ton of fish produced per year) In contrast  for the two-trait breeding goal  using either EV or ENV increased economic return and decreased eutrophication. As expected  using EV in the breeding goal gave the greatest economic return (Fig.   left panel). Economic returns were similar between EV and ENV when the correlation between  and  was lower than -<U+2009>0.5. However  when the correlation was between -<U+2009>0.5 and 0  the economic return achieved when using ENV was lower than when using EV. The difference in economic return between EV and ENV reached a maximum when the correlation between  and  was -<U+2009>0.19 (0.038 €/kg produced/year). Note that  when the correlation was between -<U+2009>0.41 and -<U+2009>0.05  using ENV resulted in lower economic returns than the single-trait breeding goal. Using ENV in the breeding goal generated a reduction of eutrophication of at least 1.55 kg PO-eq per ton of fish produced per year (Fig.   right panel  correlation -<U+2009>0.4). This is a reduction of 0.92% per year  considering an eutrophication of 168.51 kg PO-eq per kg produced per year before genetic improvement []. With correlations closer to zero  the reduction of eutrophication rapidly reached 4.5 kg PO-eq per ton of fish produced per year  which is more than what was obtained by using EV (2.5 kg PO-eq with a correlation of 0). The reduction in eutrophication per year did not differ between EV and ENV when the correlation between  and  was lower than -<U+2009>0.45. To our knowledge  this is the first study that explores the influence of the correlation between growth rate (expressed as ) and  on the design of a fish breeding program for economic or environmental sustainability. Although selection on a component trait such as  is generally assumed to be less efficient than selection on an index weighing the components  selection on  directly could be more efficient if the heritabilities of both traits (body weight gain and feed intake) were similar []. In fish  data on the genetic parameters of feed intake are still lacking and the best strategy to maximize improvement of feed efficiency is yet to be determined. Measuring  directly on individual fish is indeed difficult and improving  depends on its correlation with other traits included in the breeding goal and in the index. In fish  the genetic correlation of FCR with   the trait considered as most important by farmers  is uncertain. Thus  we explored the effect of the correlation between  and  on the response to selection and on the economic return of two breeding programs: (1) single-trait breeding goal  the trait in the breeding goal and in the index was TGC; and (2) a two-trait breeding goal  where TGC and FCR were in the breeding goal while TGC and percentage of fat in the dorsal muscle (%fat) were in the index. In this index  %fat was used as an indirect criterion of FCR. Then  for the two-trait breeding goal  we explored the effect of this correlation between TGC and FCR on the economic return and on the eutrophication change when using economic values or environmental values as weights in the breeding goal. According to Brascamp et al. []  the economic values of traits should be calculated while considering that the farm is running under an optimized state and that  in the long term  extra profit from increasing production tends to be absorbed by the different stakeholders of an industry. Smith et al. [] added that  in such industries where an equilibrium is reached  only decreases in cost should be included in the calculation of economic values. In the present study  harvest weight was fixed at 400 g  and the technical (number of cages) and zootechnical parameters (stocking density) were optimized to produce 1000 tons while keeping the constraint on the biomass. However  we decided to include the extra profit due to higher production in the calculation of economic values because fish farming is a recent industry and is not at equilibrium due to constant innovations. For a growing industry such as fish farming  any improvement of production volume within the production system and its quotas should be considered  as it reflects better production efficiency. This extra profit generated by increasing production could then be reinvested to fuel these innovations. This is supported by Amer et al. [] who suggested that economic values depend on the economic and technical context of the industry. Our results show that there are only minor differences in economic and environmental responses between the single-trait breeding goal and the two-trait breeding goal based on EV or ENV when the genetic correlation between FCR and TGC is strongly negative (<<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.5). This suggests that  in such cases  an easy and affordable single-trait breeding program for  only should be sufficient to generate economic profit and simultaneously reduce environmental impacts  although it does not maximize the economic or environmental responses. The reason for this small difference between single and two-trait breeding goals is that improving  is easy (due to its high heritability)  and indirectly generates a favourable correlated response for . However  when the correlation between  and  is weaker (0 to -<U+2009>0.5)  there are large differences in economic return and in reduction of environmental impacts between single and two-trait breeding goals. A breeding program with only  in the index performs less well in terms of economic return than a breeding program with TGC and %fat in the index using EV as weights in the breeding goal. This difference is a direct result of the introduction of %fat in the index that allowed to improve the response to selection in FCR in the two-trait breeding goal. For instance  if the correlation is around -<U+2009>0.2  the economic return is 0.066 €/kg produced/year with the two-trait breeding goal and 0.049 €/kg with the single-trait breeding goal. Thus  this represents a reduction of about 26.6% of the economic return. This reduction is even larger when the correlation is null. This difference between single and two-trait breeding goals is also observed for the reduction of eutrophication. With a correlation of -<U+2009>0.4  using a single-trait breeding goal constrained the reduction of eutrophication by 39.7% compared with a two-trait breeding goal weighted by ENV. Using a single-trait breeding goal could even increase eutrophication compared to the two-trait breeding goal weighted by ENV if the genetic correlation is higher than -<U+2009>0.28. Although %fat is acknowledged to be an important driver of the results obtained  we did not investigate the effect of a potential change of the correlation between %fat and TGC and FCR on selection response when the correlation between TGC and FCR changed. Mainly because we do not know precisely how the genetic correlations between three traits would behave when the genetic correlation between two of these traits would change. Nevertheless  if we consider that the genetic correlation between TGC and %fat is close to the 0.75 value tested here  the correlation between FCR and %fat would have a strong effect on the response to selection when the genetic correlation between TGC and FCR is weak. In that case  the response to selection for FCR would probably be higher if the genetic correlation between FCR and %fat is stronger. So far  in fish  there are strong indications that the correlation between  and  is weak (between 0 and -<U+2009>0.4  e.g. []). Hence  both traits ( and ) should be included in the breeding goal and in the index to maximize the economic or environmental responses. However  the success of a breeding program in improving  largely depends on the availability of phenotypes that can be used as indirect criteria for . To date there is no method to record  efficiently at a low cost that have been implemented in a fish breeding program although several methods have been proposed [  ]. Therefore  finding an efficient method to phenotype fish for  is an important challenge for fish breeders. In this regard  muscle fat content may be a trait of premium interest as it can be measured on selection candidates with non-invasive ultrasound measurements []. In the pig industry  Knap and Wang [] reported positive genetic correlations between backfat depth and   which means that selection for leaner pigs led to an improvement of  because fat deposition is less efficient in terms of energy used per unit of wet weight gain than protein deposition. In fish  fat is mostly deposited as visceral and intramuscular/subcutaneous fat and it has been reported that fat content related traits and  are genetically correlated [  ]. In 2007  Quillet et al. [] showed that a trout line selected for low muscle lipid content was more efficient than a line selected for high muscle lipid content. In our study  we used muscle fat as an indirect criterion in the index based on results from Besson et al. []. Surprisingly  even an indirect criterion with a relatively weak genetic correlation with  (-<U+2009>0.39) resulted in a reduction in eutrophication. Thus  assuming that  or another growth trait is always the main trait in the breeding goal  the inclusion in the index of any other indirect criterion with a strong correlation with  would improve FCR and thus increase economic return and reduce eutrophication. However  other methods should be investigated such as weight loss after fasting [] or individual FCR in aquarium under restricted feeding  which was shown to be phenotypically linked to  []. We also explored what would be the best type of weighting factor for a two-trait breeding goal (with  and  in the breeding goal) to enhance the sustainability of fish production. We found that  when the correlation between  and  is strongly negative  the environmental response is not sensitive to the use of EV or ENV in the breeding goal. This is because the strong favourable genetic correlation between  and  brings information on the EBV of  (the trait with the greatest relative EV and ENV)  which enhances the favourable response of . However  the response in economic return and in reduction of environmental impacts is sensitive to the use of EV versus ENV when the genetic correlation between  and  is weakly negative. First  although the reduction of eutrophication at the farm level is lower with EV than with ENV  it remains favourable because EV puts more emphasis on improving  and results in a reduction of the amount of feed required per unit of fish produced. Thus  using EV maximizes the economic return but is also promising for reducing eutrophication. However  using ENV when the genetic correlation between TGC and FCR is weak decreases the economic return  i.e. by 56.4% compared to a breeding goal using EV when the correlation is -<U+2009>0.2. The reason is that the ENV of  and  are both negative whereas the EV of  is positive and the EV of  is negative; this change causes a large shift in trait responses. With ENV  the main opportunity to reduce eutrophication is not to select for better  but to reduce . However  this makes no sense in economic terms because  has a positive EV  and then the economic return of the breeding program decreases drastically. In this case  the financial incentive for farmers to decrease eutrophication by using ENV in the breeding goal is low and using ENV may not be the solution to enhance the sustainability of fish production. Thus  using ENV instead of EV depends on the willingness of farmers to accept a slightly lower increase in economic return in exchange of an improvement in environmental impacts. However  farmers could benefit from such an environmental-based breeding program indirectly  since it has been shown that consumers are willing to pay a price premium for salmon produced with more environmental considerations []. Thus  the potential increase in sale price could offset some of the lost economic return  as a result of using ENV. In practice  the local environmental impact of fish farming is also determined by spatial planning and can be managed by adapting the quota system. If there is an antagonism between EV and ENV  it could be interesting to combine them in the aggregate genotype. However  this requires that they are expressed in the same units  i.e. that ENV is converted to a monetary unit. This is possible when ENV is calculated for climate change because a shadow price of carbon exists  which is defined as the cost of the damage caused by emitting an additional ton of CO. Combining EV and ENV in the breeding goal would balance out the genetic gain between economic return and environmental impact [  ]. However  to our knowledge  other categories of impacts such as eutrophication have not yet been monetarized. Our study shows that  although a quota is implemented to constrain the environmental impacts  environmental impacts per farm per year could increase as a result of genetic improvement  especially when only growth is improved. In that case  and assuming a weak correlation with   improving  would increase environmental impacts per farm per year  although the quota on biomass is respected. The aim of the quota on biomass is to ensure that the surrounding environment has the capacity to assimilate the nutrients produced by the farm  which is termed the carrying capacity of the environment []. Thus  although the emission of waste per day does not exceed the carrying capacity  it would be essential to verify that the local environment is not affected by the increase of the annual emission of wastes. In such a case  breeding would become a problem and not a solution to reduce environmental impacts of fish farming. To change this  the breeding program should be modified to respect the annual carrying capacity by including other traits in the breeding goal and in the index. For instance  in our situation  adding  in the breeding goal and %fat in the index would reduce the amount of nutrients emitted per year per farm regardless of the weights used in the breeding goal. Another solution would be to change the overall quota regulation by imposing an annual quota on feed used. In such a case  it is likely that the EV and ENV of the traits would differ but  would remain the key trait to be improved and this quota definition would motivate breeders to include it in their index. The importance of feed efficiency in breeding programs to reduce environmental impacts has also been demonstrated by Ali et al. [  ] in livestock. They showed that using EV that integrate environmental costs in a pig breeding program for growth and  results in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and excretions of nitrogen and phosphorus. This is the first study that explores the influence of the genetic correlation between growth rate and feed conversion ratio on the optimal breeding program for economic or environmental sustainability. We showed that a favourable response in  is key to improving profit and to reducing eutrophication at the farm level because it reduces the amount of feed used to produce one kg of fish. Feed is the largest economic cost for farmers and also the largest environmental cost due to its manufacturing and its biological transformation into nitrogen-based waste by the fish []. We showed that the two-trait breeding goal using with %fat in the index as indirect criterion of FCR was best to reach the favourable response in FCR. Using EV in this two-trait breeding goal increased economic return by 5 to 127% compared to a single-trait breeding goal for . Furthermore  this two-trait breeding goal was able to reduce eutrophication by 1.34% (using ENV) and 0.63% (using EV) per kg of fish produced per year when the correlation between  and  is -<U+2009>0.25. Based on these results  we strongly recommend to include  in breeding goals with an indirect criterion in the index of a fish breeding program  especially if the correlation between  and  is weak.

We created scores for all possible SNVs  coding and non-coding  for all autosomes and the X chromosome of the pig reference sequence Sscrofa11.1  proposing a toolbox to prioritize variants and evaluate sequences to highlight new sites of interest to explain biological functions that are relevant to animal breeding. Since humans started breeding animals  a key challenge has been to control the inheritance of traits. In farm animals  genetic gain has been achieved using pedigree information and statistical models. Since the introduction of genomic selection (GS) []  breeding is transitioning from selecting animals based on visual inspection and pedigree data to approaches that exploit genetic information. However  given the complexity of genomes and the generally low level of knowledge about the relation between genotype and phenotype  undesirable alleles may accumulate  through genetic hitchhiking or genetic drift [  ] because of the small effective population size in livestock breeds under artificial selection. Recent approaches incorporate whole-genome sequence data to improve genetic predictions. Because the number of tested single nucleotide variants (SNVs) is larger in whole-genome sequence data compared to array-based assays  truly causal genetic variants are more likely to be identified. While the use of whole-genome sequence data has improved genetic prediction  the improvements fall short of expectation and yield only moderate performance increases [  ]  partly due to the inclusion of noise. Therefore  current strategies involve pre-weighting of potential candidate SNVs that have a higher probability of being causal. Several methods have been developed to score variants according to their putative deleteriousness and identify those that may have a detrimental effect on the fitness of individuals. Well-known variant prioritization tools include SIFT []  PolyPhen2 []  SNAP2 [] and Provean []. However  these are limited to scoring (non-synonymous) variants in coding regions. In contrast  the combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) [] model that was developed to investigate SNVs in human populations  can score variants at any location in the genome. CADD is comparable to methods such as fitCons [] and Linsight []: it captures signals of evolutionary selection across many generations and combines this with annotations—genomic features  epigenetic data  other predictors etc.—to estimate a deleteriousness score for a given variant. While CADD and similar models are well established and used to predict the effects of variants in the human genome [     ]  to date  they have not been applied to non-human species. In recent work []  we applied CADD to mouse  and studied the effect of having a limited number of annotations  which is expected for non-model species  compared to the human case. The results demonstrated that applying the CADD methodology to non-human species is valid and powerful. Here  we introduce pCADD (p for pig)  a model based on the CADD methodology to create scores for the prioritisation of SNVs with respect to their putative deleteriousness in the genomes of wild and domesticated pigs (). The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of pCADD to prioritize individual SNVs and genomic regions relative to their biological function. The ability of pCADD to score any SNV in the entire pig genome with respect to its predicted deleteriousness helps researchers and breeders to evaluate (newly) observed SNVs and rank potentially harmful SNVs that are propagated by breeding. Briefly  the CADD model  which is a logistic regressor  assigns a deleteriousness score to a SNV based on a set of 867 genomic annotations such as DNA secondary structure  conservation scores  protein function scores and many more (see Additional file  and Additional file : Table S1). Model parameters are fitted based on a large training set  containing two classes of SNVs: derived (proxy benign/neutral) and simulated (proxy deleterious) SNVs. The set of derived SNVs is generated by identifying (nearly) fixed alleles in the species of interest that differ from those of a reconstructed ancestral genome (Fig. a). Proxy deleterious SNVs are simulated de novo mutations  which have not experienced any selection  thus deleterious variants are not depleted in this set (Fig. b  c).  Fixed alleles that differ between the investigated pig population and an inferred ancestor sequence are used as proxy benign/neutral SNVs.  First step of the simulation: differences between evolutionary differently distant ancestor sequences are identified and substitution rates are derived.  Simulation  second step: the derived substitution rates are used to simulate de novo variants that have not experienced any selection and thus are not depleted in deleterious variants With the pCADD model  every position in the pig genome can be scored with respect to its predicted deleteriousness. To differentiate more easily those SNVs that are potentially of interest  we created a PHRED-like score  which is similar to that in the original CADD approach []. To this end  the outcomes of the logistic regressor for all variants are ordered and transformed. The pCADD score is a log-rank score that ranges from ~<U+2009>95 to 0  with higher scores indicating more deleterious variants. The top 1% and 0.1% highest scored SNVs have a pCADD score higher than 20 and 30  respectively  thus the most deleterious variants are differentiated from the likely neutral ones. In the following  we describe the data used to train the pCADD model and demonstrate its use by performing several analyses. To create the set of derived variants  which consists of putatively benign/neutral variants  we identified (nearly) fixed alleles in a pig population that differ from those of the reconstructed ancestral genome of pig  cow and sheep (Fig. a   []   []   []). These alleles have become fixed in the pig population due to genetic drift or positive selection  thus they are depleted in deleterious variants and can be assumed to have a benign or neutral effect. The ancestral sequence was obtained from the 25-eutherian-mammals EPO (Enredo  Pecan  Ortheus) [  ] multiple alignment files (MAF)  downloaded from the Ensembl v.91 database. To avoid errors due to misaligned InDels  only SNVs that are not adjacent to another variant site  between the pig population and the inferred ancestor  were retained. The pig population used in our study included 384 individuals  representing 36 breeds  e.g. Asian and European  wild  commercial and local breeds (see Additional file : Table S2). For each site in the inferred ancestor  we selected an allele when its frequency was higher than 0.9 in the pig population and when it differed from the ancestral allele. Because the population includes pigs from many breeds  the number of functional variants that may have reached fixation due to founder effects in individual populations is limited. In addition  we removed sites that carry an allele at a frequency higher than 0.05 in the population and for which the alternate allele is equal to the ancestral allele. To simulate variants for the proxy deleterious set  substitution rates were derived from observed differences between more distant ancestors of pig (Fig. b  c). In particular  rates for nucleotide substitutions and CpG sites in window sizes of 100 kb were computed based on the inferred substitutions between the ancestral sequences of pig-cow  pig-horse and pig-dog. Only SNVs that were located at a site with a known ancestral allele of the pig-cow-sheep ancestor were simulated. These SNVs are de novo mutations that have a larger than uniform chance  with respect to other de novo mutations  to occur in the populations. Although these variations may have never occurred by chance along the evolutionary branch of pig  they may have also been actively selected against. In other words  these random mutations have a greater chance of being deleterious than benign []  therefore the set of simulated variants is expected to be enriched in deleterious variants in comparison to the derived proxy benign/neutral set. In total  61 587 075 proxy benign/neutral SNVs were derived and a similar number of SNVs was simulated. To form the training and test sets  the dataset was randomly split into two sets with an equal number of samples from both classes. The training dataset contained 111 976 500 SNVs whereas the test set consisted of 11 197 650 SNVs. To assess the dependency on the genomic location of the variants  the test set was split into six overlapping subsets: (i) intergenic (non-cDNA) variants; (ii) all transcribed sites (cDNA); (iii) transcribed but not translated sites (5'UTR5  3'UTR3 and introns); (iv) coding regions; (v) synonymous SNVs in coding regions and (vi) non-synonymous SNVs in coding regions. Genomic annotations were obtained from the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP v91.3) database [] and supplemented by PhyloP []  PhastCons [] and GERP [] conservation scores as well as Grantham [] amino-acid substitution scores and predictions of secondary DNA structure (DNAshape) []. VEP-predicted consequences of SNVs were summarised in 14 categories. They were either used directly or combined with other data to create composite annotations (see Additional file  and Additional file : Table S3). Annotations that rely on a gene build  such as the SIFT protein score  reference and alternative amino-acid  variant position within a transcript and coding region were also used. PhyloP and PhastCons scores are based on three differently sized multiple species alignments: a 6-taxa laurasiatheria  a 25-taxa eutherian-mammals and a 100-taxa vertebrate alignment. The laurasiatheria and eutherian-mammals alignments were downloaded from Ensembl [] v91 whereas the 100-taxa vertebrate alignment was downloaded from UCSC [  ] (December 29  2017). Next  PhyloFit [] phylogenetic models were created for the laurasiatheria and eutherian-mammals alignments to compute PhastCons and PhyloP scores for pig. PhyloFit models for the 100-taxa vertebrate alignment were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser and used to compute PhastCons and PhyloP scores. PhastCons and PhyloP scores based on the 6- and 25-taxa alignments were directly computed for pig  while the scores for the 100-taxa alignment had to be first computed for the human reference GRCh38 and then mapped to Sscrofa11.1 using CrossMap []. To avoid a positive bias in predictive power in favour of PhastCons and PhyloP scores  the pig sequence was excluded from the generation of both sets of scores. Genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) neutral evolution  GERP conservation  GERP constrained element and GERP constrained element p-values were retrieved from Ensembl91 using a custom Perl script. Predicted differences in the secondary DNA structure between reference and alternative alleles were added as annotations to the dataset  as computed by DNAshape []: minor gap width (MGW)  Roll  propeller twist (ProT) and helix twist (HelT). After computing all annotation combinations  imputing missing values and recoding all categorical values to binary variables (see Additional file )  the final number of features was equal to 867. Each feature was scaled by its standard deviation obtained from the variants in the training set. We assigned class label 0 to the proxy benign/neutral variants and 1 to the proxy deleterious variants. Then  we trained a logistic regression classifier to predict the posterior probability of a variant being proxy deleterious. We used the logistic regression module provided by Graphlab v2.1 []. Based on previous experience and given the lack of a sufficiently large validation set  we applied the set of hyper parameters that were found to be optimal for mouse CADD19  i.e. L2-penalization was set to 0.1 and the number of iterations to 100. Feature rescaling  performed by the logistic regression function by default  was deactivated. The pCADD scores were computed for all potential SNVs (3 per position) on the 18 autosomes and the X allosome. Each SNV was annotated with 867 genomic annotations and scored by the trained logistic regression model. Subsequently  these scores were sorted in descending order and assigned a pCADD score defined as   with  being the rank of a particular SNV and  the total number of substitutions (<U+2009>=<U+2009>7 158 434 598). From the Ensembl v.93 pig gene build  we retrieved 10 942 genes with only one annotated transcript to avoid complications due to overlapping transcripts. We created three sets  consisting of the minimum pCADD score found at a site  per transcript  one for each of the three positions of a codon. We computed one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests between each of the three sets. The resulting p-values were Bonferroni corrected. All calculations were performed in Python version 3 using SciPy v.1.1.0 [] and Statsmodels v.0.9.0 []. We obtained all annotated (pre-)miRNA sequences from the Ensembl v93 database  i.e. 484 sequences  and  after removal of sequences that overlapped with any of the training SNVs  294 sequences remained. As a second set  equally long sequences up- and downstream of the miRNA sequence were selected. For each position in both sets  the miRNA sequences and surrounding sequences were annotated with the maximum pCADD score. To test whether miRNA sequences had a significantly higher pCADD score than their neighbouring sequences  we applied a one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test using SciPy v.1.1.0 in Python 3. We used the REST API of Ensembl v93 to download the intron coordinates of all 40 092 transcripts. We annotated all the sites in all the introns with the maximum pCADD score found at these sites. For each intron  we performed one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests to check if the investigated intron had a significantly higher pCADD score than all the other introns in the same transcript. p-values were Bonferroni corrected over all transcripts  per intron. To display the results  we normalized the number of rejected null-hypotheses by the number of conducted tests  which decreases as the number of introns increases. We downloaded porcine Affymetrix expression data of several tissues published by Freeman et al. []. We selected the genes that were clustered and associated with a particular tissue in [] and had a robust multi-array average (RMA) [] expression level of at least 100 or more to filter out genes with no activity. Of these genes  we considered all the coding DNA sequences (CDS); if a particular CDS was present in more than one transcript  it was selected only once. In addition to the housekeeping genes  genes specific for 16 tissues were selected (cartilage-tendon  blood  cerebellum  dermal  epithelium  eye  kidney  liver  lung  muscle  neurone  pancreas  placenta  salivary gland  testis  and vasculature). All CDS were annotated with the maximum pCADD score found at each site of the CDS and merged into one set per tissue. Tissue sets were tested for higher scores than those of the housekeeping set with one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests; p-values were Bonferroni corrected. All calculations were done in Python 3 using the SciPy v.1.1.0 and Statsmodels v.0.9.0. modules. In this study  we trained a CADD-like model for SNV prioritisation in the pig genome  which is referred to as pCADD. It is a linear regressor that is trained to differentiate between two classes of variants  a set of simulated variants  which is relatively more enriched in potentially deleterious variants than a set of derived variants  which is depleted in deleterious variants. The pCADD generated a score for every possible SNV of the Sscrofa11.1 reference genome on all autosomes and the X allosome. Then  these scores were tested on a held-out test set  they were used to evaluate seven SNVs with known functional effect and we examined whether they could discriminate between functional and non-functional sequences. The class distribution in the training and test sets were balanced  but subsets of SNVs found in different genomic regions displayed varying proportions of simulated and derived SNVs (Table ). These imbalances were similar to those found for the human (hCADD) and mouse (mCADD) datasets in our previous study []. The largest difference among the three models is the total number of SNVs used for model training: ~<U+2009>31 million for hCADD  ~<U+2009>67 million for mCADD and ~<U+2009>112 million for pCADD. This results from the use of a more distant ancestor of the pig than the ancestors used for mouse in mCADD (mouse and rat) and for humans in hCADD (human and chimpanzee). A more distant ancestor yields more differences between the inferred ancestor and the species of interest  resulting in a larger derived class and  thus  in a larger total number of SNVs to create a balanced dataset. The performance of pCADD is evaluated by computing the receiver-operator-area under the curve characteristic (ROC-AUC) on a test set  which consisted of simulated and derived SNVs  none of which were used for training. The overall ROC-AUC on the entire test set is ~<U+2009>0.683  but differs considerably for six subsets of SNVs (Fig. a). The test sets are subsets of each other  with decreasing numbers of SNVs beginning with the whole test set and ending with the missense mutations. In transcribed regions of the genome  the scores are more discriminative than in non-transcribed regions  while in coding regions they are more discriminative than in non-coding regions such as the 5'UTR  3'UTR and introns. The scores are most discriminative for missense mutations  which have the largest number of genomic annotations  resulting in high discriminative performance of the pCADD model. Prediction performances of different prioritization tools on test sets  representing various regions of the genome for which the number of features varies. I: whole test set; II: intergenic SNVs; III: transcribed SNVs; IV: SNVs in intron  5' and 3' UTR; V: coding SNVs; VI: SNVs causing synonymous mutations; VII: SNVs causing missense mutations.  pCADD performance measured in ROC-AUC on the different subsets of the pig held-out test set.  mCADD test performance measured in ROC-AUC on the same genomic subsets in the mouse genome.  Performance of 6-taxa laurasiatheria PhastCons conservation score in the pig test set.  SIFT performance on missense causal SNVs in the pig test set These observations are in strong accordance with the earlier reported observations for the mCADD model for mouse (reproduced in Fig. b) []  which was proven useful to identify truly deleterious mutations found in the Mutagenetix [] data base  lifted from ClinVar [] and others []. For all investigated SNV subsets  PhastCons [] conservation scores based on the Ensembl 6-taxa laurasiatheria [] displayed the same pattern across all subsets  but performed worse than pCADD (Fig. c). We used 6-taxa laurasiatheria PhastCons scores because  overall  they performed best on different subsets of the held-out test set (see Additional file : Figure S1). A similar difference in performance was observed when the performance of pCADD on missense mutations was compared to that of SIFT (Fig. d)  which indicates the added value of pCADD over conventional approaches of identifying potential candidates. When we assessed examples of known causal SNVs (Table )  they were enriched in the upper percentile of pCADD scores and were likely to be picked up as potential. The exception is 3:43952776T>G  one of two variants located in close proximity to a splice-site. In particular  it is located in an intron sequence  4 bp upstream of an annotated splice site. Variants  which are located 1- and 2-bp upstream of the splice site have pCADD scores that range from 20.90 to 21.93  whereas the remaining variants in the same intron sequence have on average a pCADD score of ~<U+2009>2.96. Only 13 (out of 3450) other potential SNVs in that intron have a higher pCADD score. This puts the 3:43952776T>G SNV into the 99.6th percentile of the intron sequence in which it is located. None of the 13 potentially higher scored variants were observed in our population of 384 pigs  which makes 3:43952776T>G the highest scored SNV in that region. To assess further if the model assigns different scores to sites with differing biological importance genome-wide  we tested whether the three positions in a codon are scored differently. Based on the fraction of non-synonymous mutations for each codon position  the second position should receive the highest score  followed by the first and third positions (see Additional file : Figure S2). To test this  we examined codons of genes that have only one known transcript  to avoid interference  which is expected by overlapping transcripts. The table displays the counts of significant p-values between the three different positions in a codon. The columns indicate the positions that are tested to have higher pCADD scores than the positions in the rows. The numbers indicate how often the null hypothesis was rejected in 10 942 conducted tests. Table  shows the number of significant tests when comparing the pCADD scores between two codon positions  across a gene  with each other (Bonferroni corrected  one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests). Among the 10 942 genes that were selected for this test  we found that the second codon position has a significantly higher pCADD score than the third for 8901 genes  and that the first codon position has a significantly higher pCADD score than the third for 8830 genes. Only for 3066 genes  did the second codon position score significantly higher than the first  while for 766 genes it was the opposite. Taken together  these results agree with our expectation  and indicate that pCADD scores do reflect deleteriousness. This was further confirmed by comparing the effect sizes  measured as ROC-AUC of the pairwise comparisons of codon positions (see Additional file : Figure S3). We investigated whether pCADD scores are higher for functional non-coding sequences than for non-functional sequences up- and downstream. Variants in annotated (pre-)miRNA regions have significantly higher pCADD scores (p-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0  one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test; ROC-AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.613) than sites in up- and downstream regions (average pCADD scores of ~<U+2009>10 vs. ~<U+2009>7.2) (Fig. ). This difference is largely due to an abundance of (pre-)miRNAs with pCADD scores around ~<U+2009>21 and a relatively smaller number of variants with a low score. For 164 miRNAs (~<U+2009>56%)  the pCADD scores were significantly higher than those of the neighbouring regions (Bonferroni corrected  one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test). Histogram of the distribution of pCADD score for (pre-)miRNA transcripts and their surrounding up- and downstream regions. Vertical lines indicate the mean values of each distribution with a mean of 9.987 for miRNA and 7.205 for Up&Down. The one-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test between both distributions provided a p-value of 0.0 and a ROC-AUC of 0.613 in favour of miRNA over the Up&Down stream regions Chorev et al. [] showed that regulatory elements are enriched in the first few introns of a transcript and that their number decreases with increasing intron position. Consequently  we expected to see decreasing pCADD scores with increasing intron position. To test this  we annotated every position in the intron region with the highest pCADD score for that position and calculated how often the scores in a particular intron are significantly higher than those across all other introns in the same transcript (Bonferroni corrected one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test). The results clearly show that introns closer to the transcription start site of a gene have higher pCADD scores (Fig. )  which provide evidence for their biological relevance. pCADD scores per intron compared to all other introns  for the first 20 introns. The blue bar indicates the number of introns tested against the intron of interest  the red bar shows how many of these tests resulted in an adjusted p-value <<U+2009>0.05 (scale on the left axis). As the intron position increases  the number of tests that can be conducted decreases (with the number of transcripts that have at least that many introns). The black line represents the normalised number of significantly enriched introns  normalized by the number of conducted tests per intron position (scale on the right axis) Next  we investigated whether genes considered to be housekeeping genes have different (higher) pCADD scores than genes specifically expressed in certain tissues. The underlying assumption is that a mutation in a gene expressed in all tissue types has a much broader potential deleterious effect. We compared pCADD and PhyloP scores of genes specific for 16 tissues and also compared them (Bonferroni corrected one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test; ROC-AUC) to scores of a set of genes considered as housekeeping genes  i.e. expressed approximately equally in all tissues []. Based on pCADD scores  housekeeping genes had significantly higher scores for 12 of the 16 tissues examined (Table ). Genes in three brain-derived tissues—cerebellum  eye  neuronal tissue—and in muscle tissue (smooth and skeletal) have on average a higher pCADD score than housekeeping genes. A ROC-AUC of 0.5 is the expected performance if the pCADD scores are randomly assigned to the genes of each set. This means that the larger the absolute difference is from 0.5  the clearer is the signal supporting that one set is larger than the other. We compared all tissue gene sets to housekeeping genes  this means that when the ROC-AUC is smaller than 0.5  the pCADD scores of the tissue associated gene set are generally larger than those of the housekeeping one and vice versa. In all the comparisons  the total effect size was small and did not differ from 0.5 by more than 0.122 (dermal tissue). The four tissues that displayed higher pCADD scores than housekeeping genes have in common that their cells do not divide anymore once they are fully differentiated. Mutations in these tissues may have a larger effect than in tissues with a high rate of cell division due to the inability of the tissue to replace cells  which leads to scarring and eventually tissue failure. Thus  genes specific to these four tissues are more likely conserved than those specific to other tissues  resulting in overall higher pCADD scores. This is supported by the analysis with conservation scores (Table )  which showed that these genes were more conserved than the housekeeping genes. Tissues such as dermal and salivary gland show the lowest pCADD scores and high rates of cell division. These tissues are likely more tolerant to germline mutations since they must adapt to changes in diet and climate  thus their tissue-specific genes have a higher variability  resulting in lower pCADD scores. Conservation scores are often used to evaluate the potential importance of sequences and to evaluate if a particular candidate SNV may have a deleterious effect. They are also useful to put our own results into perspective and assess conventional sequence prioritisation methods. Similar to the section “miRNA regions are scored differently from those of neighbouring regions”  we annotated the pre-miRNAs and their associated up- and downstream regions with PhyloP conservation scores (based on 25-taxa mammalian alignment) and performed the same analysis by computing significance tests to check if miRNA sequences have higher pCADD scores than those in their neighbouring regions. We chose 25-taxa PhyloP scores because these have the largest coverage of the pig genome among all conservation scores used in this study (see Additional file : Table S4). The results are in Additional file : Figure S4 and are very similar to those from the analysis using pCADD scores  with an almost identical p-value close to 0 (1e-225) and a ROC-AUC value of 0.595  which indicates a slightly worse separation between both classes of sequences than when using pCADD. Likewise  we evaluated the intron positions relative to each other using the same PhyloP conservation scores to annotate intron sequences. The results in Additional file : Figure S5 show a similar pattern of decreasing importance with increasing intron position as observed when the introns are annotated with pCADD scores. Major differences between the analysis using pCADD and conservation scores is that the total number of introns  which can be annotated with conservation scores is smaller  resulting in 81 743 fewer tests compared with pCADD. Furthermore  the ratio between the total number of tests and the number of tests with an adjusted significant p-value is smaller when conservation scores are used  which indicates that conservation scores are less discriminative between different intron positions. We annotated tissue-specific and housekeeping genes with PhyloP conservation scores to investigate whether the differentiation between both sets of genic regions followed the same pattern. Twelve tissue-specific gene sets displayed significantly lower pCADD scores than housekeeping genes  whereas only four tissues had a significantly lower conservation score. The larger total differences in ROC-AUC scores obtained by using PhyloP scores compared to pCADD scores indicate that the variations between tissue gene sets are larger when using PhyloP. The worse performance of PhyloP scores to distinguish between pre-miRNA and surrounding regions is supported by the lower ratio of significant tests in the intron analysis  which indicates that PhyloP scores have less specificity for functional elements than pCADD scores. To examine the utility of pCADD scores for the prioritization of SNVs  we investigated whether they can help in the identification of intergenic candidate SNVs that segregate between two closely related Large White pig breeding populations. We scored intergenic SNVs that were unique for either of these pig populations by multiplying their pCADD score with the allele frequency and selected the top 20 highest scored SNVs for each population. Since the pCADD model is based on the Ensembl pig annotations [] (Ensembl gene annotation update e!90 Sscrofa11.1)  we matched the selected 40 SNVs with NCBI’s pig gene build [] to determine whether the model captures non-annotated genomic features. We found that 16 of the 40 SNVs are located within a (NCBI) coding region (one example shown in Fig. ) and six SNVs overlap with a (NCBI) long non-coding RNA (Table ). Visualization of the three potential nucleotide substitutions at each position in the genome  each with their own predicted pCADD score. To visualize pCADD scores in JBrowser  we created tracks for the maximum  median and minimum scores at each position. The fourth track displays the standard deviation among the three scores to identify more easily sites of variable deleteriousness. The yellow vertical bar is located at position 5:14463457  indicating the site of the top scoring SNV in Table . This SNV is considered intergenic according to the Ensembl gene build but located within a lncRNA according to the NCBI genebuild.  NCBI gene build track  showing the genomic region belonging to lncRNA LOC102160723. – the maximum  median and minimum pCADD scores for each position in the displayed region.  The standard deviation of pCADD scores at each position In addition  we mapped the genomic locations of the candidate SNVs to the human assembly GRCh38.p12 and Ensembl gene builds  which revealed nine additional genic regions that consisted of six lncRNAs  one region considered as a miscRNA and two genes. For all 40 SNVs  synteny of the surrounding genes was conserved except for 18:4227731C>A. The relatively large number of prioritized SNVs that overlap with lncRNAs can be explained in two ways. First  there might be a considerable number of missing annotations in the gene builds that we used because the RNA-seq databases are incomplete and are the basis for lncRNA annotations. Second  although the lncRNA functions are conserved due to islands of strong conserved regions []  the architecture of their sequences experience constant restructuring and weak sequence conservation across species [  ]. The highest scored SNVs (in terms of pCADD score multiplied by alternative allele frequency) for which no genic annotation was found (6:149549021T>C) (Table )  is located in an island with high pCADD scores within a region that contains several of such small islands (see Additional file : Figure S6). This region starts with a highly H3K27Ac acetylated region  which indicates an enhancer site. Such a pattern is uncommon for intergenic regions and could indicate a missing annotation in the gene builds used in our study. We used a method that provides scores for the prioritization of SNVs with respect to their putative deleteriousness  from which we derived functional relevance for the genomes of pig. The method is based on the creation of a set of derived variants from an inferred common ancestor sequence that can be assumed to be depleted in deleterious variants and a set of simulated variants that are likely to be enriched in variants with a deleterious effect. It is important to note that while it is reasonable to assume that the proxy benign/neutral are truly benign/neutral variants  the simulated putative deleterious variants may also encompass a relatively large proportion of actually neutral variants. Founder effects in pig populations may lead to the accumulation of functional variants  with both benign and deleterious variants receiving a relatively high pCADD score. This means that pCADD scores are useful to prioritize SNVs of interest  but that assessing deleteriousness may need additional information or experiments. For example  the missense variant 1:265347265A>G (pCADD:21.848)  which is responsible for an increased number of vertebrae and can be considered benign given current breeding goals  and the deleterious lethal recessive splice variant 12:38922102G>A  have similar pCADD scores (pCADD: 17.198) (Table ). We evaluated the generated pCADD scores on a held-out test set and reported performances on different genomic subsets  which we compared to results of our previous study on mouse. Due to the nature of the procedure  the test performance can only indicate if the training algorithm has picked up patterns of features that are predictive for the simulated variants and if the performance varies with the genomic region. It has to be emphasized that only performance trends can be meaningfully compared between the different mCADD/pCADD models due to the different datasets used for computation. In spite of the large number of neutral variants  which is expected in both sets of variants  the performance seems to indicate that patterns to differentiate between the derived and simulated datasets have been picked up and can be used to evaluate variants and regions based on their potential interest. The performance of pCADD scores to discriminate between simulated and derived variants in the test set increased as the number of features increased  depending on the genomic regions in which they are embedded. The consequence is that missense mutations are the best classified  although the most interesting application of pCADD is to annotate non-coding and intergenic variants  for which a plethora of functional candidates exist but there are only a few methods for further prioritization. As shown for the splice-region variant 3:43952776T>G  the ranking of a variant relative to its neighbouring sequence in the same sequence category (introns  exons  intergenic  etc.) can provide information that helps to prioritize such variants. Furthermore  we used PHRED-like scores to rate different sequences with known biological function. We compared the scores for the three positions in a codon and found that less redundant positions achieve higher pCADD scores. Moreover  regulatory sequences could be clearly distinguished from their neighbouring regions (i.e. high scores in miRNAs). In addition  our model supports the higher frequency of regulatory elements in the first few introns of a transcript  and thus has the potential of scoring not only individual SNVs but also of using a summary score per site to annotate entire regions to identify potential sub-regions of interest. This is a clear advantage compared to alternative methods to evaluate non-coding sequences  such as conservation scores  which may not be available for the entirety of the genome. This was the case in the analysis of intron sequences  for which more than 80 000 fewer tests could be conducted due to missing conservation scores. Using pCADD  candidate regions in which annotations are potentially missing can be identified. For example  no annotation was found for the 6:149549021T>C SNV  even though pCADD scores were within a range typical for exons and displayed patterns of islands of high importance (see Additional file : Figure S6)  which is more compatible with coding regions than with intergenic regions. Ensembl gene annotations rely strongly on transcript data from public databases  which implies that incomplete databases may lead to missing gene annotations. This is especially the case for species that are less well studied than model organisms or humans. In addition  if the genes in question are not ubiquitously expressed  they can be absent from the data of the sequenced tissue. The same is true for genes  the expression of which depends on developmental-  disease- or physiological state  as is the case for many lncRNAs []. We compared genes specific for 16 different tissues against (presumed) housekeeping genes []. Our assumption was that the ubiquitously and generally more highly expressed housekeeping genes [] should have globally higher scores than tissue-specific genes. Although the absolute effect size was small  significantly higher scores were attributed to genes specific to cerebellum  eye  neuronal and muscle tissue. Brain-derived tissues (cerebellum  eye  neuronal tissue)  in particular  displayed the largest effect sizes. On the one hand  brain tissue has experienced major development changes during the time period between 535 and 310 Mya ago  i.e. increased expression and gain of functions of paralogs of brain-specific genes [  ]. Since then and during the entire mammalian development  the expression of paralogs of brain-specific genes is lower than that observed in other tissues []  which indicates the fine balancing that acts to keep the brain functional. This emphasizes the extreme importance of brain-specific genes for survival and probably their low tolerance to mutations  compared to housekeeping genes. On the other hand  dermal tissue (epithelium) is one of the most ancient tissues in the evolution of metazoans and has highly conserved developmental pathways  which include genes that are involved in the adaptation to specific environmental changes and have overall lower pCADD scores than housekeeping genes. Among the most important features for the pCADD model are conservation scores. They are annotated for large fractions of the genome (see Additional file : Table S4)  and thus they heavily influence training. This is supported by our investigation of various tissues  which showed that particularly high scores were assigned to expected strongly conserved regions. Deleterious effects that are not captured by sequence conservation  such as changes in the epigenome or in relatively variable regions  are expected to have lower scores. This becomes problematic when the species of interest has experienced recent genetic bottlenecks and has been subjected to very strong selection  which change the species’ genotype  as is the case for domesticated species. In this case  the patterns observed from evolutionary changes may not be accurate to evaluate recent changes. However  not all the regions in the genome are subject to substitution  neither in natural nor in domesticated environments. There are exceptions to this rule  such as the reported missense mutations in Table   which are causal for a change in the number of vertebrae  ear size  meat quality and fat content  and have high scores  which support the use of pCADD for variant prioritization. The CADD approach is widely used in humans [     ] and  based on our findings  it seems to be a suitable approach for pig (and other non-human species). Variants that distinguish populations can be ranked with respect to their pCADD score and allele frequency to find potential candidates for phenotypes expressed in the studied populations. pCADD could become a valuable tool in pig breeding and conservation. It can be used to score variants with a potential negative effect in small-sized endangered local pig breeds  but also help prioritize high-impact variants in genomic prediction to further enhance genomic selection. pCADD scores  partitioned per chromosome  compressed via bgzip and tabix indexed for fast access  can be downloaded following this link (~<U+2009>5–1 GB):  To create tracks for genome browsers we provide the maximum  median  minimum  and standard deviation summaries of each site  partitioned per chromosome.

Genetic improvement of resistance to microparasitic diseases in breeding programs is desirable and should aim at reducing the basic reproduction ratio . Recently  we developed a method to derive the economic value of  for macroparasitic diseases. In epidemiological models for microparasitic diseases  an animal’s disease status is treated as infected or not infected  resulting in a definition of  that differs from that for macroparasitic diseases. Here  we extend the method for the derivation of the economic value of  to microparasitic diseases.MethodsWhen   the economic value of  is zero because the disease is very rare. When . is higher than 1  genetic improvement of  can reduce expenditures on vaccination if vaccination induces herd immunity  or it can reduce production losses due to disease. When vaccination is used to achieve herd immunity  expenditures are proportional to the critical vaccination coverage  which decreases with . The effect of  on losses is considered separately for epidemic and endemic disease. Losses for epidemic diseases are proportional to the probability and size of major epidemics. Losses for endemic diseases are proportional to the infected fraction of the population at the endemic equilibrium.ResultsWhen genetic improvement reduces expenditures on vaccination  expenditures decrease with  at an increasing rate. When genetic improvement reduces losses in epidemic or endemic diseases  losses decrease with  at an increasing rate. Hence  in all cases  the economic value of  increases as  decreases towards 1.Discussion and its economic value are more informative for potential benefits of genetic improvement than heritability estimates for survival after a disease challenge. In livestock  the potential for genetic improvement is small for epidemic microparasitic diseases  where disease control measures limit possibilities for phenotyping. This is not an issue in aquaculture  where controlled challenge tests are performed in dedicated facilities.

Genetic improvement of resistance to microparasitic diseases in breeding programs is desirable and should aim at reducing the basic reproduction ratio . Recently  we developed a method to derive the economic value of  for macroparasitic diseases. In epidemiological models for microparasitic diseases  an animal’s disease status is treated as infected or not infected  resulting in a definition of  that differs from that for macroparasitic diseases. Here  we extend the method for the derivation of the economic value of  to microparasitic diseases. When   the economic value of  is zero because the disease is very rare. When . is higher than 1  genetic improvement of  can reduce expenditures on vaccination if vaccination induces herd immunity  or it can reduce production losses due to disease. When vaccination is used to achieve herd immunity  expenditures are proportional to the critical vaccination coverage  which decreases with . The effect of  on losses is considered separately for epidemic and endemic disease. Losses for epidemic diseases are proportional to the probability and size of major epidemics. Losses for endemic diseases are proportional to the infected fraction of the population at the endemic equilibrium. When genetic improvement reduces expenditures on vaccination  expenditures decrease with  at an increasing rate. When genetic improvement reduces losses in epidemic or endemic diseases  losses decrease with  at an increasing rate. Hence  in all cases  the economic value of  increases as  decreases towards 1.  and its economic value are more informative for potential benefits of genetic improvement than heritability estimates for survival after a disease challenge. In livestock  the potential for genetic improvement is small for epidemic microparasitic diseases  where disease control measures limit possibilities for phenotyping. This is not an issue in aquaculture  where controlled challenge tests are performed in dedicated facilities. If genetic evaluations include infectivity  genetic gain in  can be accelerated but this would require different testing designs. When   its economic value is zero. The economic value of  is highest at low values of  and approaches zero at high values of . Microparasitic diseases are diseases that are caused by bacteria and viruses. Genetic improvement of resistance to microparasitic diseases in breeding programs for livestock and aquaculture species is of interest for the same reasons as for macroparasitic diseases  as recently discussed in Janssen et al. []. Genetic improvement should aim at reducing the risk and severity of disease outbreaks  which are both determined by the basic reproduction ratio   [  ]. However  the definition of  is different for microparasitic diseases than for macroparasitic diseases  because the disease status of animals is treated differently. For most macroparasitic diseases  the number of parasites per host can be counted and the severity of the clinical symptoms increases as the number of parasites increases []. Thus  in epidemiological models for macroparasitic diseases  an animal’s disease status is measured by the number of macroparasites that it carries  e.g. []. For most microparasitic diseases  the number of parasites per host cannot be recorded. In epidemiological models for microparasitic diseases  an animal’s disease status is treated as infected or not infected  without any differentiation in the degree of infection. Thus   is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual in a completely susceptible population  during its entire period of infectiousness [].  has a threshold value of 1  below which a disease is very rare. We distinguish two types of microparasitic diseases: epidemic and endemic diseases. In epidemic diseases  animals become immune after infection  so that an outbreak can occur only once per production cycle. In endemic diseases  animals do not become immune after infection and can thus be infected multiple times during a production cycle. Therefore  we classify epidemic diseases as those that lead to incidental outbreaks and endemic diseases as those that are virtually always present and for which the infected fraction of the population varies around its endemic equilibrium []. For epidemic diseases  the risk and size of major epidemics are determined by . For endemic diseases  the level of the endemic equilibrium is determined by . When  drops below 1  major epidemics cannot occur and a disease cannot become endemic. Thus  breeding programs should aim at reducing  ultimately to become below 1  at which point the population is no longer affected. Therefore  as for macroparasitic diseases   is the appropriate breeding goal trait for both epidemic and endemic microparasitic diseases []. The economic value of  needs to be derived to optimize its relative emphasis in the breeding goal. Recently  Janssen et al. [] presented a method to derive the economic value of  for macroparasitic diseases. Here  we extend their method to microparasitic diseases. To derive the economic value of   the relationship between costs and  must be known. Costs of a disease are the sum of expenditures () on disease control and production losses () []. Depending on the disease management strategy in the population  the economic value of  can be derived as the partial derivative of  with respect to   while  is held constant []: or as the partial derivative of . with respect to  while  is held constant: Because a reduction in  increases farm profit  its economic value is negative. However  for presentation purposes  we ignore the minus sign in the economic value throughout the remainder of the text. When vaccination is possible  genetic improvement of  can reduce expenditures on vaccination  while losses remain constant. However  when vaccination is not possible  genetic improvement of  will mainly reduce losses  while expenditures are largely unaffected. Thus  vaccination is the only expenditure considered in the Methods section of this study. In the Discussion  we elaborate on this assumption. Vaccination is the economic optimum strategy when the reduction in losses from vaccination exceeds expenditures on vaccination. Vaccination reduces the fraction of susceptible individuals in a population and  thus  reduces the number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual  without changing . Here  the reproduction ratio after vaccination is denoted by . The fraction of susceptible individuals decreases as vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness increase. Hence   decreases as vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness increase. Vaccination coverage () is the proportion of the population that is vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness () can be defined either as the relative reduction in susceptibility of vaccinated animals compared to unvaccinated animals  or as the proportion of vaccinated animals that remains fully susceptible  while the other part is fully resistant. Both definitions of  have the same implications for . Both  and  take values between 0 and 1.  is a function of    and  []: When   herd immunity is achieved and no major outbreak can occur. When herd immunity can be achieved  the critical vaccination coverage is the minimum proportion of the population that must be vaccinated in order to induce herd immunity. In the Discussion  we address the effect of uncertainty in the estimate of  on the critical vaccination coverage. The critical vaccination coverage is the economic optimum vaccination coverage  with lower and higher levels increasing the costs of the disease (results not shown). Because economic values should be derived under optimized management []  the economic value of  is derived from the reduction in expenditures on vaccination at the critical vaccination coverage. We assume that expenditures are proportionate to the critical vaccination coverage  i.e. that expenditures per vaccinated animal are constant. The critical vaccination coverage decreases as  decreases  so expenditures decrease as  decreases. At the same time  herd immunity sets the losses to zero  so there is no need to differentiate between epidemic and endemic diseases. Thus  the economic value of  can be derived from a reduction in expenditures on vaccination while losses are kept constant  i.e. when losses are zero. The algebra to define expenditures as a function of  and for the derivation of the economic value of  is provided in the following.  is a function of the critical vaccination coverage  population size  and expenditures per vaccinated animal. The critical vaccination coverage () is reached when . According to []  rewriting Eq. () for  gives:  increases with . to an asymptote of   and decreases to  as  approaches 1. Any vaccination coverage that is equal to or higher than  induces herd immunity. Let  be the population size and let  be expenditures per vaccinated animal. Under these assumptions   is a function of  as: From Eqs. () and ()  it follows that: which gives the economic value when a decrease in  reduces expenditures on vaccination. When the critical vaccination coverage exceeds its theoretical maximum value of 1 (Eq. ())  herd immunity ( cannot be achieved. Thus  when  is high and a vaccine’s effectiveness is low  herd immunity cannot be achieved regardless of the vaccination coverage. In such cases  genetic improvement of  reduces losses while expenditures are held constant  which is dealt with in the sections below  where  can be substituted by  to account for the effect of vaccination. The simplest model for epidemic diseases is a SIR-model  where animals are classified according to three mutually exclusive states: susceptible  infected  and recovered [  ]. In this model  all animals are susceptible before a first epidemic. An epidemic can only occur after infection from an external source. After infection from an external source  susceptible animals can become infected and infected animals can recover. Neither infected nor recovered animals can become susceptible again. Hence  recovered animals have acquired full immunity. The term ‘removed’ is sometimes used instead of ‘recovered’ to indicate that these animals no longer affect the epidemic. We assume that losses are proportional to the average proportion of the population that gets infected during a production cycle. In other words  we ignore variation in disease tolerance and assume constant losses per infected animal. The average proportion of the population that gets infected during a production cycle is equal to the product of the probability of an epidemic in a production cycle and the expected fraction of the population that gets infected in case of an epidemic. The probability of an epidemic in a production cycle increases with the frequency of infections from an external source. Following infection from an external source  it leads to either a minor or a major epidemic. During a minor epidemic  a negligible fraction of the population gets infected and the epidemic dies out quickly. During a major epidemic  a significant fraction of the population gets infected. Provided that   the probability for a minor epidemic following infection from an external source is equal to  []. Thus  minor epidemics occur even when . After a minor epidemic  the probability of a (next) epidemic remains virtually unchanged because the susceptible fraction of the population remains largely unaltered. Since relatively few animals get infected during minor epidemics  we ignore the effect of minor epidemics on losses. Infection from an external source results in a major epidemic with probability   i.e. the probability of not resulting in a minor epidemic []. The final fraction of the population that has been infected by the end of a major epidemic increases with   to an asymptote of 1 []. The final fraction of the population that is still susceptible after a major epidemic is too small for a second major epidemic to occur. Based on the above  losses can be defined as a function of   from which the economic value of  can be derived  as shown below.  is a function of the probability of a major epidemic in a production cycle  the final fraction of the population that has been infected by the end of a major epidemic  population size  and production losses per infected individual. Let  be the frequency of infections from an external source per production cycle. The probability that a single infection from an external source results in a minor epidemic is ; hence the probability that all  infections from an external source result in a minor epidemic is . Thus  the probability () of a major epidemic during a production cycle is equal to []: This probability increases with  and with   to an asymptote of 1 (Fig. a). The final fraction of the population that has been infected by the end of a major epidemic is denoted by   where  is the fraction of the population that remains susceptible after the epidemic has ended  i.e. the fraction that escapes infection. Following Britton []:  Relationship between  and the probability () of a major epidemic during a production cycle for different frequencies of infection from an external source ().

Relationship between  and the final fraction of the population that has been infected by the end of a major epidemic () in epidemic microparasitic diseases. The dashed black line indicates the asymptote This fraction increases with  to an asymptote of 1 (Fig. b). Equation () has no algebraic solution  but can be solved numerically. Let  be the population size and  the losses per infected animal. In a SIR-model  animals can get infected only once  so that losses can be incurred only once per animal. Under these assumptions   is a function of  as: From Eqs. () and ()  it follows that:  where and since   based on Eq. ()  Equation () gives the economic value of . for epidemic diseases when a decrease in  reduces losses  where the derivative expressions are given in Eqs. () and ()   in Eq. ()  and  in Eq. (). Equation () cannot be simplified further. The simplest model for endemic diseases is a SIS-model  where recovered animals immediately become susceptible again. This model assumes that animals do not acquire immunity  such that the population consists of susceptible and infected animals only. Provided that  and the disease is present  the fractions of susceptible and infected animals in the population tend towards a dynamic endemic equilibrium. The fraction of infected animals at the endemic equilibrium increases with   to an asymptote of 1. We assume that losses are proportional to the average fraction of the population that is infected at the endemic equilibrium. The algebra to define losses as a function of  and to derive the economic value of  is provided below.  is proportional to the fraction of infected animals at the endemic equilibrium  population size  and production losses per infected animal. Let  be the susceptible fraction of the population at the endemic equilibrium  such that  is the infected fraction at the endemic equilibrium. The endemic equilibrium is reached when each infected animal infects on average one other animal before it becomes susceptible again. Hence    from which it follows that: which increases with   to an asymptote of 1 (Fig. ) []. Let  be again the population size and  the production losses for an individual if it was infected during the entire length of a production cycle. Production losses per day are assumed equal for all infected individuals. Then   is determined by the average fraction of the population that is infected during the length of a production cycle  regardless of which individuals are infected. Under these assumptions   is a function of   as follows: Relationship between  and the infected fraction of the population () in endemic microparasitic diseases. The dashed black line indicates the asymptote From Eqs. () and ()  it follows that: which gives the economic value of  for endemic diseases when a decrease in  reduces losses. The relationship between  and expenditures on vaccination and between  and its economic value are shown in Fig. a  b  respectively. Expenditures plateau when the entire population is vaccinated. For values of  for which expenditures are maximum  herd immunity cannot be attained and the economic value results from a reduction in losses instead. For values of  below the maximum level of expenditures  herd immunity can be attained and expenditures decrease at an increasing rate when  decreases. Hence the economic value is relatively high for low values of .

Losses decrease when  decreases. At low values of   losses decrease rapidly with   resulting in a relatively high economic value. When  is high and there are frequent infections from an external source  a major epidemic occurs during most production cycles (Fig. a)  during which virtually the entire population gets infected (Fig. b). In such cases  losses are rather insensitive to   resulting in the economic value being relatively small. Thus  when  increases to large values  its economic value approaches zero.

Note that the minus sign in the economic value is ignored for presentation purposes This study presents a method to derive the economic value of  for microparasitic diseases. When   its economic value is zero  because the disease is very rare. Otherwise  genetic improvement of  can reduce expenditures on vaccination if vaccination induces herd immunity  or it can reduce production losses. The critical vaccination coverage decreases with  (Eq. ()) and expenditures decrease proportionally (Fig. a). The resulting economic value increases as  decreases towards 1 (Fig. b). Both in epidemic and endemic microparasitic diseases  the average fraction of the population that gets infected during a production cycle decreases at an increasing rate when  decreases towards 1. Resulting losses decrease proportionately (Figs. a and a). Hence  the economic value of  is relatively high when  is low (Figs. b and b). When  is high  production losses are relatively insensitive to   resulting in a relatively low economic value. We have shown that genetic improvement of  can reduce the critical vaccination coverage. However  a prerequisite to reduce critical vaccination coverage is to have reliable estimates of  and vaccine effectiveness. Methods to estimate  are in Dietz []. Since estimates of  are sensitive to underlying assumptions  they may be imprecise []. Vaccine effectiveness can be evaluated directly from the odds ratio for infection in case–control studies in the population at large  or it may be approximated by the evaluation of vaccine efficacy in controlled conditions [  ]. However  vaccine effectiveness is not routinely reported by manufacturers of veterinary vaccines []. If the actual value of  and a vaccine’s effectiveness are uncertain  the critical vaccination coverage and its potential reduction after genetic improvement of  will also be uncertain. Although Britton [] provides a method to estimate the standard error of the critical vaccination coverage  this method does not account for uncertainty in vaccine effectiveness. When extra expenditures from vaccinating too many animals compared to the critical vaccination coverage are small relative to potential losses of vaccinating too few animals  a reduction in vaccination coverage after genetic improvement of  may not be worth the risk. In that case  the economic value of  will be lower than the theoretical value derived with Eq. ()  or it may even be 0. Janssen et al. [] argued that genetic improvement of  may reduce losses  or expenditures  or both. Here  only losses and expenditures on vaccination were considered  while other expenditures were assumed to be constant. Expenditures on preventive measures  such as fallowing an aquaculture site after each production cycle  are generally attractive control measures because they act against multiple pathogens simultaneously []. Therefore  we expect a potential reduction in these expenditures to be lower than the corresponding reduction in production losses  i.e.   such that these expenditures are unlikely to be reduced following genetic improvement. Disease specific preventive measures  including prophylactic treatment  reduce the value of   while genetic improvement of  could reduce these expenditures. The outcome of this complex interaction is difficult to predict  but in general we expect little effect of genetic improvement on expenditures for preventive measures []. On the other hand  expenditures on curative treatment  e.g.  drugs  may be reduced following genetic improvement of . However  how treatment is applied likely differs between livestock and aquaculture. In livestock  treatment can generally be applied at the level of the individual when infection is detected  e.g.  based on clinical signs. Thus  expenditures on treatment of infected animals are proportionate to the average number of infected animals and they can be included in production losses as part of  (Eqs. () and ()). In aquaculture  treatment can only be applied at a group level (cage  tank  pond  etc.). For epidemic diseases  expenditures on treatment are expected to be largely proportional to the probability of major epidemics and can  therefore  decrease as  decreases (Fig. a). For endemic diseases  treatment can temporarily reduce the infected fraction of the population. After treatment  the infected fraction will return to the endemic equilibrium until treatment is applied again. Losses could be assumed proportional to the mean infected fraction over time  while expenditures are proportional to the frequency of treatment. If the frequency of treatment is constant after genetic improvement  losses decrease proportional to the mean infected fraction  while expenditures are constant. If the frequency of treatment decreases after genetic improvement  expenditures decrease and losses remain constant. Such scenarios were evaluated for endemic macroparasitic diseases in Janssen et al. []. However  for endemic microparasitic diseases  treatments are not expected to be frequent  because antibiotic usage is strongly restricted by legislation to avoid development of drug-resistant parasites []. The results of this study indicate that  is a useful indicator of the potential economic impact of genetic improvement. Without consideration of the dynamics of disease transmission  one cannot predict the result of selection. For example  Cock et al. [] reported on ‘success and failure’ of breeding for disease resistance in shrimp. They describe the results of selection for improved resistance against the Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Before selection  survival after a major outbreak was about 50% for TSV and 2% for WSSV. Assuming that infection leads to death  these survival rates suggest values for  of about 1.4 for TSV and 4 for WSSV (Eq. ()). A few generations of selection for resistance to TSV returned survival to levels similar to those before the disease was introduced  while selection for resistance to WSSV had disappointing results. Selection procedures for both diseases were similar and the authors of this study had difficulties to explain these apparently contrasting results. However  given the above estimates of   such results are not surprising. The low value of  for TSV suggests that survival after a major epidemic can be improved rapidly  while the higher value of  for WSSV suggests that improvement is expected to occur at a much slower pace (Fig. b). For the above estimates of   a 30% improvement would be sufficient to eradicate TSV  while the same improvement would increase survival after a major epidemic of WSSV to only 7.5%. This example illustrates that an estimate of heritability is not sufficient to evaluate the potential for economic gain of selection for resistance to a specific disease  because it ignores that resistant animals no longer infect other animals []. An estimate of   ideally combined with its economic value  is at least as important. Although there are numerous estimates of heritability for resistance to specific diseases in aquaculture [  ]   and its economic value are rarely considered. When  is low  its economic value is likely high  whereas when  is high  its economic value is likely low (Figs. b  b and b). Thus  even in the absence of genetic parameters   and its economic value can be used as the first criteria to judge the potential benefits of selection for resistance to a specific disease. However  in the literature  estimates of  vary considerably. For example  estimates of  for WSSV vary from 1.51 [] to 93 []  which makes direct interpretation impossible. Thus  consensus and standardization on estimation of  in epidemiology are required. Previous studies on livestock have demonstrated the need to account for the dynamics of disease transmission to predict the response to selection. For example  for an epidemic microparasitic disease in pigs  MacKenzie and Bishop [] predicted that the final fraction of the population that will be infected by the end of a major epidemic decreases at an increasing rate with decreasing values of   just as in Fig. b. Similarly  Nieuwhof et al. [] predicted a substantially higher response in prevalence for an endemic microparasitic disease in sheep when using epidemiological models than when using prevalence as a predictor in a threshold model. These studies demonstrate the need to account for the dynamics of disease transmission in the derivation of the economic value of disease resistance  as also discussed in Janssen et al. []. The models used in this study describe within-farm dynamics of disease transmission. However  genetic improvement of  may also affect the dynamics of disease transmission between farms. In Eq. ()  the probability of a major epidemic during a production cycle is a function of  and the frequency of infection from an external source  which was assumed to be constant. The source of these infections can be the natural environment or neighbouring farms. Thus  when  in neighbouring farms improves  disease prevalence on these farms may decrease  reducing the frequency of infection from an external source. Consequently  the probability of a major epidemic would decrease more rapidly after genetic improvement of   which would increase its economic value. To adequately account for the effect of  on the frequency of infection from an external source  a combined within- and between-farm epidemiological model would be required  e.g.  as in Aldrin et al. []. For aquatic environments  it has been questioned to what extent traditional epidemiological models are valid  including the SIR and SIS-models used here. These models have been largely developed for terrestrial populations  where disease transmission occurs on a relatively small spatial scale. In an aquatic environment  disease transmission can occur without direct contact between animals since pathogens can spread over relatively large distances in the water column [  ]. Disease dynamics on large spatial scales such as those between farms  may  therefore  be fundamentally different in aquaculture than in livestock. However  for within-farm disease dynamics  indirect transmission via the water column can be accounted for in the transmission rate parameter [] of the SIR and SIS models. In livestock  drastic control measures are taken at a regional level as soon as some epidemic microparasitic diseases  such as classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease  are detected []. Since such control strategies limit routine phenotyping options in breeding programs []  genetic improvement of  is not feasible for many epidemic microparasitic diseases in livestock. For endemic diseases  longitudinal data on the disease status of individual animals in farms can sometimes be used. For example  Biemans  et al. [] estimated breeding values for  for digital dermatitis from longitudinal data on cows in 12 dairy farms. In aquaculture  phenotyping for microparasitic diseases is not an issue when controlled challenge tests can be performed in dedicated facilities. In a challenge test  naive fish are exposed to the pathogen via submersion  injection or cohabitation with infected ‘donor’ fish. After some incubation time  phenotypes are recorded as dead or alive. Dead fish are considered susceptible and surviving fish resistant []. To maximize phenotypic variation  the endpoint of the challenge test is sometimes chosen such that the survival rate is 50% []. There are  however  two main issues with this dead-or-alive phenotype. First  incomplete exposure obscures the phenotypic expression of susceptibility []. In any epidemic  some animals may not get infected because they escaped infection due to chance  rather than because they were less susceptible. When the endpoint of the challenge test is set retrospectively to the point at which the survival rate was 50%  the number of obscured phenotypes increases. Second  with a dead-or-alive phenotype  susceptibility and tolerance are confounded  while only susceptibility is of interest when the objective is to improve . Thus  analyses of binomial survival in threshold models can provide inadequate proxies of susceptibility []. Current challenge tests in aquaculture  as described above  capture genetic variation in susceptibility at best  leaving genetic variation in infectivity unexploited. Since susceptibility and infectivity have multiplicative effects on   genetic gain in  can be accelerated when both susceptibility and infectivity are included in genetic evaluations [    ]. Anche et al. [] have described how estimated breeding values (EBV) for susceptibility and infectivity can be combined into a single EBV for . Furthermore  the accuracy of EBV for susceptibility improves when infectivity is included in the model for genetic evaluation [  ]. The inclusion of infectivity in genetic evaluation requires testing designs that differ from the currently used challenge tests  as discussed in the following. The same testing design can be used for epidemic and endemic diseases  because the objective is genetic evaluation of  rather than a characterisation of the disease. To capture genetic variation in infectivity  some individuals should be infected (and  therefore  become infectious) while others are susceptible. Thus  at the start of a challenge test  only some animals should be artificially infected  after which the disease is allowed to spread naturally []. Then  the disease status of each animal  infected or not  must be recorded over the course of the epidemic. Although longitudinal data are required  the sampling frequency does not need to be high  because infection times can be predicted from relatively few sample points []. For a fixed total number of samplings  Biemans et al. [] found that the optimum interval between samplings lies between 25 and 50% of the duration of the infectious period. Multiple epidemic groups are required  with related individuals distributed between groups []  although the optimal group structure has not yet been studied []. For a given testing capacity  having fewer larger groups favours the estimation of susceptibility  whereas having many smaller groups tends to produce better estimates of infectivity []. For a SIS model  prediction accuracies for additive genetic effects and heritability estimates improve as disease prevalence increases []  but this has not been studied for a SIR model. Recently  an experimental design that followed the above considerations was used for the genetic evaluation of susceptibility and infectivity for a macroparasitic disease []. This study successfully demonstrated presence of genetic variation in infectivity but did not obtain estimates of genetic parameters and breeding values. This study presents a method to derive the economic value of  for microparasitic diseases. When   the economic value is zero  because the disease is very rare. When genetic improvement of  reduces expenditures on vaccination  the economic value increases as  decreases towards 1. The effect of  on production losses differs between epidemic and endemic microparasitic diseases. Nevertheless  when genetic improvement of  reduces losses  the economic value is highest at low values of  for both epidemic and endemic microparasitic diseases  while it approaches 0 at high values of .

Such variability may contribute to differences in the overall value of the carcass since primal cuts vary greatly in price; such variability may also hinder successful genome-based association studies. Therefore  the objective of our study was to identify genomic regions that are associated with five muscularity linear type traits and to determine if these significant regions are common across five different breeds. Analyses were carried out using linear mixed models on imputed whole-genome sequence data in each of the five breeds  separately. Then  the results of the within-breed analyses were used to conduct an across-breed meta-analysis per trait.ResultsWe identified many quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are located across the whole genome and associated with each trait in each breed. The only commonality among the breeds and traits was a large-effect pleiotropic QTL on BTA2 that contained the  gene  which was associated with all traits in the Charolais and Limousin breeds. Other plausible candidate genes were identified for muscularity traits including    and multiple collagen and  genes. In addition  associated (gene ontology) GO terms and KEGG pathways tended to differ between breeds and between traits especially in the numerically smaller populations of Angus  Hereford  and Simmental breeds. Most of the SNPs that were associated with any of the traits were intergenic or intronic SNPs located within regulatory regions of the genome.ConclusionsThe commonality between the Charolais and Limousin breeds indicates that the genetic architecture of the muscularity traits may be similar in these breeds due to their similar origins. Conversely  there were vast differences in the QTL associated with muscularity in Angus  Hereford  and Simmental. Knowledge of these differences in genetic architecture between breeds is useful to develop accurate genomic prediction equations that can operate effectively across breeds. Overall  the associated QTL differed according to trait  which suggests that breeding for a morphologically different (e.g. longer and wider versus shorter and smaller) more efficient animal may become possible in the future."

Overall  the associated QTL differed according to trait  which suggests that breeding for a morphologically different (e.g. longer and wider versus shorter and smaller) more efficient animal may become possible in the future. Linear type traits have been used extensively to characterize conformation in both dairy [  ] and beef cattle [  ]. Muscularity linear type traits have previously been documented as moderate to highly heritable traits in beef cattle [  ] and are known to be genetically associated with carcass merit [  ] and with both animal live weight and price []. Therefore  the genetic merit of a young animal for these traits may be a good representation of its merit for carcass traits. While both carcass value and conformation have been reported to be correlated with linear type traits []  the correlation with any one type trait is not equal to 1 which implies that the same carcass value can be achieved with morphologically different animals; by extension then  this implies that  for example  an animal with a better developed loin and a shallow chest may have the same yield as an animal with a lesser developed loin and a deep chest. Such morphological differences could contribute  in turn  to differences in individual carcass retail cut weights  and thus overall carcass value. Many previous genomic studies in cattle have focused on live weight and carcass traits as the phenotypes of interest [  ]  but only a few have been published on the underlying features that contribute to differences in linear type traits in either beef cattle [] or dairy cattle []. While previous studies have attempted to compare and contrast putative mutations  genes  and associated biological pathways across multiple breeds of beef cattle for carcass traits []  no study has attempted to do this using linear type traits. Knowledge of any kind of similarities or differences between breeds could enable the introduction of more accurate multi-breed genomic evaluations for both pure and crossbred animals. Therefore  the objective of the present study was to identify genomic regions associated with five muscularity linear type traits and to determine if these associated regions are common across multiple beef cattle breeds. As part of the Irish national beef breeding program  routine scoring of linear type traits is carried out on both registered and commercial beef herds by trained classifiers who are employed by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation [  ]  with each classifier scoring animals from a range of different breeds. The muscularity type traits used in the present study describe the development of the hind quarter (DHQ)  inner thigh (DIT)  and loin (DL)  and the width of the thigh (TW) and withers (WOW). Each trait was scored on a scale from 1 to 15 where 1<U+2009>=<U+2009>low and 15<U+2009>=<U+2009>high for DHQ  DIT and DL  and 1<U+2009>=<U+2009>narrow and 15<U+2009>=<U+2009>wide for TW and WOW (see Additional file : Table S1). Data on these five linear type traits were available for 147 704 purebred Angus (AA)  Charolais (CH)  Hereford (HE)  Limousin (LM)  or Simmental (SI) beef cattle scored between the age of 6 and 16 months from 2000 to 2016 []. Animals were discarded from the dataset if the sire  dam  herd  or classifier was unknown  or if the parity of the dam was not recorded. Parity of the dam was recoded as 1  2  3  4  and<U+2009>=<U+2009>5. Contemporary group was defined as herd-by-scoring date generated separately per breed. Each contemporary group had to have at least five records. Following these edits  data were available on 81 200 animals: 3356 AA  31 049 CH  3004 HE  35 159 LM and 8632 SI. Prior to inclusion in the analysis  all phenotypes were first adjusted within-breed in ASREML [] using the model: where  is the linear type trait   is the fixed effect of herd by scoring date (11 130 levels)   is the fixed effect of the sex of the animal (male or female)   is the fixed effect of the age in months of the animal (11 classes from 6 to 16 months)   is the fixed effect of the parity of the dam (1  2  3  4 and<U+2009>=<U+2009>5)   is the random additive effect of the animal  and  is the random residual effect. The adjusted phenotype was the raw phenotype minus the fixed effect solutions of    and . Of the 81 200 animals with linear type trait information  19 449 animals from five beef breeds (1444 AA  6433 CH  1129 HE  8745 LM  and 1698 SI) were imputed to whole-genome sequence as part of a larger dataset of 638 662 multi-breed genotyped animals. All 638 662 animals were genotyped using the Bovine Illumina SNP50 panel [n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5808; 54 001single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]  the Illumina High Density (HD) panel (HD; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5504; 777 972 SNPs)  the Illumina 3k panel (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2256; 2900 SNPs)  the Illumina low-density (LD) genotyping panel (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15 107; 6909 SNPs) or a bespoke genotype panel (IDB) developed in Ireland [] with three versions  i.e. version 1 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>28 288; 17 137 SNPs)  version 2 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>147 235; 18 004 SNPs) and version 3 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>434 464; 53 450 SNPs). Each animal had a call rate higher than 90% and only autosomal SNPs  SNPs with a known chromosome and position on UMD 3.1  and SNPs with a call rate higher than 90% within a panel were retained for imputation. All genotyped animals were imputed to HD using a two-step approach in FImpute2 with pedigree information []; this involved imputing the 3 k  LD and IDB genotyped animals to the Bovine SNP50 density  and consequently imputing all resulting genotypes (including the Bovine SNP50 genotypes) to HD using a multi-breed reference population of 5504 influential sires genotyped on the HD panel. Imputation to whole-genome sequence (WGS) was then undertaken using a reference population of 2333  animals from multiple breeds from Run6.0 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project []. All variants in the sequence reference population were called using SAMtools and genotype calls were improved using the Beagle software to provide a consensus SNP density across all animals. Details of the alignment to UMD 3.1 bovine reference genome  variant calling and quality controls completed within the multi-breed reference population are described in Daetwyler et al. []. In total  41.39 million SNPs were identified across the genome and the average coverage was 12.85X. Imputation of the HD genotypes to WGS was completed by first phasing all 638 662 imputed HD genotypes using Eagle (version 2.3.2) []  and subsequently imputing to WGS using minimac3 []. The average genotype concordance of imputation to WGS  defined as the proportion of correctly called SNPs versus all SNPs using a validation set of 175 Irish animals  was estimated to be 0.98 []. Quality control edits were imposed on the imputed sequence genotypes within each breed  separately. Regions of poor WGS imputation accuracy  which could be due to local mis-assemblies or mis-orientated contigs  were removed. These regions were identified using an additional dataset of 147 309 verified parent progeny relations as described by []  which removed 687 352 SNPs from each breed. Then  all SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.002 were removed. Following all SNP edits  16 342 970  17 733 147  16 638 022  17 803 135 and 17 762 681 autosomal SNPs remained for the analysis of the AA  CH  HE  LM  and SI populations  respectively. The association analyses were performed within each breed separately using a linear mixed model in the GCTA software []. Autosomal SNPs from the original HD panel (i.e.  734 159 SNPs) were used to construct the genomic relationship matrix (GRM). The model used for the within-breed analysis was the following: where  is a vector of preadjusted phenotypes   is the overall mean   is the vector of imputed genotypes   is the vector of additive fixed effects of the candidate SNP to be tested for association   is the vector of additive genetic effects  where  is the genomic relationship matrix calculated from the HD SNP genotypes and  is the additive genetic variance  and  is the vector of random residual effects and  is the residual variance. Manhattan plots were created for each trait within each breed separately by using the QQman package [] in R. A genome-wide SNP significance threshold of p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and a suggestive threshold of p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 were applied to each trait. SNPs in close proximity to each other (<<U+2009>500 kb) were classified as being located within the same QTL. Genes within 500 kb of the most significant SNP in a peak above the genome-wide threshold were identified using Ensembl 94 [] on the UMD 3.1 bovine genome assembly. Moreover  the functional consequence of all significantly associated SNPs was predicted using the Variant Effect Predictor tool [] from Ensembl. The Cattle QTLdb () was used to identify QTL that were known to be associated with other traits in cattle. To identify QTL regions that were suggestive in more than one breed  each chromosome was split into 1-kb genomic windows  and windows containing suggestive SNPs (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) were compared across the breeds. The proportion of genetic variance of a trait explained by a SNP was calculated as: where  is the frequency of the minor allele   is the allele substitution effect and  is the genetic variance of the trait in question. Following the within-breed association analyses  meta-analyses were conducted for all traits across all five beef breeds using the weighted -score method in METAL []; only SNPs that were included in the analyses of all of the individual breeds were considered here. METAL combines the p-values and the direction of SNP effects from individual analyses  and weights the individual studies based on the sample size to compute an overall -score: where  is the square root of the sample size of breed   and  is the -score for breed  calculated as   where  is the cumulative distribution function  and  and <U+0394> are the p-value and direction of effect for breed   respectively. The summary statistics from the individual analyses for the CH population were further used to conduct conditional analyses on BTA2 based on the Q204X mutation  which was previously reported to be associated with muscularity traits in cattle []. These analyses were undertaken for each trait in the CH population using the conditional and joint association analysis (COJO) method in GCTA []. The Q204X mutation was included as a fixed effect in the association analysis model and the allele substitution effect of all remaining SNPs were re-estimated. Pathway analysis was conducted on all plausible candidate genes within a 500-kb region up- and downstream of SNPs that were discovered to be suggestively or significantly associated with each trait in each breed. For each gene list  DAVID 6.8 [] was used to identify gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways which were significantly overrepresented (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) by the set of genes. Enrichment analyses among the suggestive and significant SNPs were performed to estimate if the number of SNPs in each annotation class was greater than that expected by chance for each trait per breed []; this was done separately per trait and per breed and was calculated as: where  is the number of suggestive and/or significant SNPs in the annotation class of interest   is the total number of suggestive and/or significant SNPs that were associated with the trait of interest   is the total number of SNPs in the annotation class in the association analysis  and  is the overall number of SNPs included in the association analysis. Summary statistics of the five linear type traits for each breed are in Additional file : Table S1. Significant (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and/or suggestive (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) SNPs were detected in all traits for the five breeds but the exact locations of these SNPs and the direction of the effects of these SNPs differed by breed. Manhattan plots for all the analyses are available in Additional file : Figures S1–S5. Whereas no significant SNPs were detected for any of the muscularity linear type traits in the AA population  suggestive SNPs (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) were identified for all five traits. No genomic region was common to all five type traits (see Additional file : Figure S6). However  there was some overlap in suggestive 1-kb windows between the traits DIT and TW; 11 windows contained SNPs of suggestive significance and the gene  on BTA24 was identified within those windows for both traits. Nine genomic windows were associated with both the DL and WOW traits  i.e. on BTA6 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2)  BTA15 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6)  and BTA22 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1). The windows on BTA15 contained suggestive SNPs that were located within the  and  genes. Eighty-four SNPs within nine QTL were suggestively associated with the DHQ trait. Among these  the most strongly associated (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.34<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) SNP was rs433492843 on BTA23 located in an intron of the  gene (Table ); it accounted for 0.002% of the genetic variance in this trait. A QTL on BTA1 was also strongly associated with DL with the most strongly associated SNP being rs465472414 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.06<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  which accounted for 0.08% of the genetic variance in this trait (Table ). Other SNPs suggestively associated with DL were also identified within the  gene on BTA11 and within the  and  genes on BTA15. An intergenic SNP located on BTA29  rs109229230  was the most strongly associated (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.82<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) with DIT (Table ). Ninety-eight SNPs were suggestively associated with TW. The strongest QTL association with TW was on BTA13  on which 10 SNPs of suggestive significance were identified in a 1-Mb region (Table ); rs137458299 displayed the strongest association (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.99<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and explained 0.9% of the genetic variation in TW. One hundred and seventy-three SNPs were associated with WOW in the AA population; among these 29.4% were located on BTA14 (Table ) and the most strongly associated SNP  rs468048676  (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.34<U+2009>×<U+2009>0)  was an intergenic variant on BTA6. No significant SNPs were detected for any of the muscularity linear type traits in the HE population  although suggestive SNPs were identified for all five traits. However  no genomic window was common to all five type traits (see Additional file : Figure S6); six 1-kb windows i.e. on BTA5 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)  BTA7 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4)  and BTA25 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) were shared between DHQ and DIT with three 1-kb regions on BTA20 shared between DIT and TW. Three hundred and eleven SNPs were suggestively associated with DHQ. The strongest association with DHQ was located within a 1-Mb QTL on BTA7 where 26 SNPs of suggestive significance were identified (Table ). The intergenic SNP  rs446625612 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.16<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) was the most strongly associated with DL and located within a QTL on BTA4 encompassing the  gene. Most interestingly  the strongest association within the QTL on BTA2 with DL was an intronic variant  which explained 0.7% of the genetic variance and was located within the muscle related gene . In total  155 SNPs were suggestively or significantly associated with DIT  and 43% of these were located within a 1-Mb QTL on BTA7 (Table ) where a number of significant SNPs were located within the  gene. For TW  four putative candidate genes were identified (Table ):  on BTA7   on BTA10  and both  and  on BTA20. The SNP  rs380761563  which displayed the strongest association with WOW  explained 1% of the genetic variance and was located in an intron of the gene  on BTA7 (Table ). There were 483 1-kb suggestive genomic windows common to all five type traits in the CH population (see Additional file : Figure S6)  among which the vast majority (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>482) were located on BTA2 in a region encompassing the  gene. The final region that was shared between all five traits was on BTA11. More overlaps were found for DHQ and DIT with 904 windows being common to just these two traits  146 windows common to DHQ  DIT  and DL  304 windows common to DHQ  DIT  DL  and TW  and 178 windows common to DHQ  DIT  and TW. The majority of all these windows were also located on BTA2. For each of the muscularity linear traits  we identified a QTL on BTA2 in the CH population. DHQ had the largest number of associated SNPs  i.e. 3707 suggestive and 1851 significant SNPs (Table )  all of which were located on BTA2 within a single QTL between positions 0.35 and 9.79 Mb. In total  41 genes including     and  were located in this QTL. For DIT  a 10-Mb QTL on BTA2 was identified that contained 5075 SNPs  of which 1796 had a p-value that met the significance threshold (Table )  whereas 178 SNPs on BTA2 in the region between 54.1 and 86.1 Mb were significantly associated with TW (Table ). The same SNP  an intergenic variant rs799943285  showed the strongest association with all traits. The well-known Q204X mutation within the  gene was significantly associated with DHQ  DIT and TW  and this SNP explained 4.9  0.05  and 0.01% of the genetic variation of each trait  respectively. In the conditional analyses within the CH population  where the Q204X mutation was included as a fixed effect in the model  the most significant SNPs from the original analyses of each trait generally decreased in significance. The most significant SNP for all traits in the original analyses was rs799943285 (p-value ranging from 9.07<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for DIT and DHQ to 2.02<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for WOW). In the conditional analyses  this SNP was non-significant for DL  TW  and WOW but remained suggestive for both DIT (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.02<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and DHQ (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.62<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). The most significant SNP in the conditional analyses of DHQ  DL  DIT  and TW was rs41638272  which is an intergenic SNP located 10 kb from the  gene; this SNP was significant in the original analyses but its significance actually increased when the Q204X mutation was included as a fixed effect. The most significant SNP in the conditional analysis of WOW was an intergenic variant  rs457456302 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.78<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) that was located 0.1 Mb from the  gene. There were 164 1-kb suggestive genomic regions that were common across all muscularity traits in the LM population (see Additional file : Figure S6); another 232 regions were common to the three traits DHQ  DIT  and TW  while 326 were common to just DHQ and DIT. All five traits had significant QTL located on BTA2  with four genes common to all traits located within these QTL  namely       and . For DHQ  there were 2983 SNPs above the suggestive threshold and most of these (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2610) were located in a single QTL on BTA2. The most significant SNP  rs211140207 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.22<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was located within an 8-Mb QTL on BTA2 that contains 20 genes (Table ). The Q204X stop-gain mutation (rs110344317) located within this QTL was significantly associated with DHQ and accounted for 2.4% of the genetic variation in this trait  although the allele frequency of the favourable mutation was only 0.02% in the LM population. The well-known  mutation in the Limousin breed  F94L (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.3798)  did not meet the suggestive threshold for association with any of the traits. Similar to DHQ  a QTL located between 4.9 and 11 Mb on BTA2 was associated with both DIT (Table ) and TW (Table ). In total  2441 and 1526 SNPs were above the suggestive threshold within this QTL on BTA2  and the variant rs110344317  which was significantly associated with DHQ  was also significantly associated with both DIT and TW. For the DL trait  748 SNPs were suggestively associated and located between 55.4 and 82.8 Mb on BTA2. The most significant SNP associated with DL (rs379791493; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.69<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) was also the most significantly associated SNP with DIT (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.20<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). The most significant SNP associated with WOW  rs211140207  (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.77<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was an intergenic SNP that accounted for 0.4% of the genetic variance in this trait and was located in a QTL (between 5.9 and 8.4 Mb) that included 724 other significantly-associated SNPs (Table ). Suggestive QTL were also detected on autosomes other than BTA2 for all traits in the LM population except for DIT. A small QTL on BTA11 containing seven suggestive SNPs was associated with DHQ. The SNP with the strongest association  rs43666945 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.56<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was an intergenic SNP located 2.2 Mb from the  gene. Both DHQ and DL had suggestively associated QTL on BTA5. The most strongly associated SNP for DHQ (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.58<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) was an intergenic SNP  rs718375830  located within a QTL between positions 59.6 and 60.6 Mb  whereas the most strongly associated SNP with DL (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.70<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) was also an intergenic SNP  rs109909829  but was located within a QTL between 71.7 and 72.8 Mb. For the SI breed  only a few suggestive 1-kb genomic regions overlapped for more than two traits. Sixteen 1-kb windows were suggestively associated with both DHQ and DL  eight of which were located on BTA6  seven on BTA22  and one on BTA18 (see Additional file : Figure S6). Five 1-kb windows on BTA23 and one on BTA4 were common to both DHQ and DIT  while another 15 suggestive windows were associated with DHQ and WOW  12 of which were located on BTA22. The intergenic SNP  rs437686690 on BTA25  was the most strongly associated (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.00<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) with DHQ in the SI population and accounted for 0.6% of the genetic variance in DHQ (Table ). In total  199 SNPs were associated with DL in the SI population  among which four met the significance threshold. The most significant SNP  rs482545354 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.77<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was located in an intronic region of the  gene (Table ) on BTA22. Although 194 SNPs were suggestively associated with DIT  only one  i.e.  rs798946118 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.30<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  achieved the significance threshold which was located on BTA21 within a 1-Mb block containing 17 other suggestive SNPs (Table ) and accounted for 0.6% of the genetic variance of DIT. The largest 1-Mb QTL associated with TW was located on BTA29 and contained 30 suggestive SNPs (Table ). QTL putatively associated with WOW were located on BTA1  4  9  12  and 20 (Table ) where the most significant SNP  rs801295753 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.67<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was an intronic SNP on BTA9 located within both the  and  genes. Within each of the five meta-analyses (see Additional file )  a strong association peak on BTA2 around the  gene was detected  which is consistent with the individual association results identified in the CH and LM populations. For DIT  TW  and WOW  the most significantly associated SNP was the intergenic SNP  rs799943285 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.51<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  which was previously identified as the most strongly associated SNP in the CH population for each of these traits. This variant  rs799943285  was also the most significantly associated with DL in the meta-analysis  whereas the most significantly associated SNP with DHQ  rs482419628 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.06<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was located further downstream on BTA2 within 5 kb of the  gene. Although the QTL on BTA2 was the most strongly associated with each of the traits analysed  we also identified several other QTL associated with muscularity. In the meta-analysis of DHQ  the most strongly associated SNP on BTA11  rs43666945 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.93<U+2009>×<U+2009>10)  was previously identified as being associated with DHQ in the LM population  but the level of significance increased in the meta-analysis and the QTL contained three times the number of suggestive SNPs compared to that found for the LM breed only. A 1-Mb QTL on BTA7 containing the  and  genes was associated with both DL and WOW in the meta-analysis; the most significant SNPs in this QTL  however  differed according to trait (see Additional file ). With the exception of WOW in the AA population  intergenic SNPs were the most common annotation class of SNPs that were significantly associated with all traits in all breeds. The 3' UTR class was enriched for all traits in the CH and LM populations  whereas there were more downstream gene variants significantly associated with DHQ and DL in the AA  CH and HE populations  and with TW in the CH  HE  and SI populations than expected by chance (Table ). The intronic class of SNPs was enriched for all five traits in HE  for four traits (DHQ  DL  TW  and DIT) in SI  three traits in both AA (DHQ  DL  and WOW) and CH (DL  TW  and WOW) and two traits in LM (DHQ and DIT). Several GO terms and KEGG pathways were over-represented by the genes identified in each analysis  although this tended to differ per breed and per trait especially in the smaller AA  HE  and SI populations. In CH and LM  five GO terms were associated with each trait: skin development (GO:0043588)  collagen fibril organisation (GO:0030199)  extracellular matrix structural constituent (GO:0005201)  cellular response to amino acid stimulus (GO:0071230)  transforming growth factor beta receptor signalling pathway (GO:0007179). One KEGG pathway  i.e. protein digestion and absorption (KEGG:map04974)  was also significantly associated with all traits in CH and LM. Apart from this overlap  only a limited number of terms and pathways were over-represented across breeds. The GO term mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743) was significantly over-represented for the DL trait in AA and the WOW trait in HE  although none of the same genes were significantly associated with both traits. Another GO term collagen trimer (GO:0005581) was over-represented for DIT in AA and DL in LM. Whereas a number of across-breed and breed-specific pleiotropic QTL have been documented for carcass traits  birth weight  weaning weight  and mature weight in beef cattle []  as well as for dry matter intake and growth and feed efficiency []  no study has attempted to detect across-breed or breed-specific pleiotropic QTL for muscularity linear type traits. Previous studies have been conducted on the genetic correlations between the linear type traits themselves [] and between both meat yield and carcass cuts with the muscularity linear type traits []. While these genetic correlations are moderate to strong  none is equal to 1  which implies that two animals that yield a carcass of similar merit could be morphologically different. In fact  a shorter and more muscular animal or a taller and less muscular animal could have the same total carcass weight. In turn  these animals could yield very different carcass values owing to their distribution of primal cuts. For example  the loin of an animal harbours generally the most valuable cuts [  ]. Therefore  selection for a better-developed loin could lead to a more valuable carcass in comparison to a carcass with a lesser-developed loin if that carcass was still within the factory specification for weight and conformation. Here  we have detected several genomic regions that are strongly associated with each of the muscularity traits analysed. However  most of these regions were unique to each trait or each breed  which indicates the existence of trait-specific and breed-specific QTL for muscularity traits. Thus  it is plausible to hypothesise that through more precise (i.e.  targeting individual QTL) genome-based evaluations and selection  the morphology of an animal could be targeted to increase the output of high-quality carcass cuts and consequently improve the profitability of the farm system and the value to the meat processor []. While a similar conclusion could be achieved through traditional breeding means  exploiting the breed- and trait-specific QTL could be more efficient. This is the first published genome study on muscularity linear type traits in beef cattle using sequence data and is one of the few genome-based studies that compare multiple breeds of beef cattle. The number of animals used in our study is comparable to the number of animals used in a previous across-breed comparison that focused on carcass and birth traits in 10 cattle breeds [] and was thought to be the largest genome based-study ever performed in beef cattle at that time. This previous across-breed study was undertaken on 12 traits including birth weight  calving ease  carcass weight  and mature weight across 10 breeds and the results were similar to what we observed here for the muscularity traits. Saatchi et al. [] identified 159 unique QTL associated with 12 traits  but only four QTL had pleiotropic effects and segregated in more than one breed. Similar results were observed in an across-breed study on dry matter intake  growth and feed efficiency in four beef cattle breeds []. The QTL identified for these traits were also breed-specific with little overlap among the breeds. This is comparable to our findings that show that the majority of the QTL were also trait-specific and breed-specific. In total  approximately 83% of all QTL that are suggestively or significantly associated with a trait in our study overlapped with previously reported QTL associated with other production traits in dairy or beef cattle in the Cattle QTLdb (accessed 08 January 2019). Approximately 36% of all QTL overlapped with other traits that were specifically related to muscle in beef cattle such as body weight  carcass weight and marbling score []  calving traits []  Warner–Bratzler shear force []  and longissimus muscle area []. One QTL on BTA17 that was associated with DIT in the SI breed was previously associated with ribeye area in a composite beef cattle breed composed of 50% Red Angus  25% Charolais  and 25% Tarentaise []. Our study is further validated by the presence of significantly associated QTL regions on BTA2  which harbours the  gene  with the five muscularity traits in the CH and LM breeds  and within the meta-analysis. In a previous study on five muscularity type traits  which were combined into one singular muscular development trait in CH  a QTL on BTA2  which contained   was the only region significantly associated with these traits []. In general  the suggestive and significant QTL  and thus genes  associated with each trait and each breed were both trait-specific and breed-specific. The low commonality of QTL among the breeds may be due to different genetic architectures underlying the traits in these breeds  or to gene-by-environment or epistatic interactions []  or to differences in the power to detect QTL due to the large differences in population sizes between the breeds. In many cases  the significant alleles were simply not segregating in all five breeds. The differences between breeds may also be due to limitations in the imputation process with the imputation accuracy being too low to determine strong associations between a SNP and a trait; consequently  the minor suggestive associations were interpreted with caution because of the possibility of poor imputation. Overall  the largest number of overlaps among significant genes were found between the CH and LM breeds for all traits  which is not surprising considering the relative similarities in the origins of these breeds [] and of the selection pressures they have experienced [].  was first observed as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass in mice [] and since then has been identified as responsible for muscular hypertrophy in cattle [  ] and is widely known as the causal variant for many muscularity and carcass traits in cattle [  ]. The stop-gain mutation Q204X in  was significantly associated with the muscularity traits in both the CH and LM populations in the present study. Previously published research showed that CH and LM calves carrying one copy of this mutated allele scored better for carcass traits than non-carrier animals and that young CH bulls carrying this mutation presented a carcass with less fat and more tender meat than non-carriers []. In the present study  the CH and LM animals carrying one copy of the minor allele scored significantly (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) higher for muscularity type traits. The Q204X mutation was not significant in the AA population and it was removed during the data-editing step in both HE and SI as it was non-segregating. When Q204X was included as a fixed effect in the model for the CH animals  no SNPs located within the  gene itself remained significant. This indicates that the significant SNPs within this gene were in tight linkage disequilibrium with Q204X  which provides evidence that this mutation may be causative for the muscularity linear type traits in the CH breed. Other genes on BTA2 that were significantly associated with some or all of the traits in CH and LM were       and   all of which are in strong linkage disequilibrium with  in mammals []. While the major peaks on BTA2 in the analyses on CH and LM  and all the meta-analyses contain   a known contributor to muscle development  it is also plausible that other candidate genes within the QTL on BTA2 could also contribute to muscle development. Two such genes are  and . Intronic variants in  and upstream and downstream gene variants in  were significantly associated with DHQ in both CH and LM; however  no SNPs within coding or non-coding regions of this gene were associated with any traits in AA  HE  or SI although the SNPs were indeed segregating. Collagen is abundant in muscle and the quantity and stability of these intramuscular fibres have previously been linked to eating palatability of beef []. The quantity and stability of muscle collagen are known to differ by breed []  sex []  and age [] of cattle. Other collagen genes      and   on BTA1 were also identified as candidate genes for DIT in the AA breed. Both type VI collagen genes have previously been linked to various muscle disorders in humans since they are known to affect muscular regeneration []. Type XVIII collagen has previously been proposed as a useful marker for beef marbling because it is involved in fat deposition in ruminants []. Another QTL on BTA2 located in the region between 13.9 and 14.9 Mb and significantly associated with four of the traits (DHQ  DIT  TW  and WOW) in the LM breed contained the  and  genes. The most significant SNP in this region was an intronic SNP within . The  gene is involved in a pathway related to myofibroblast formation in smooth muscle in humans [] while previous genome-wide studies in mice have identified the  gene as a possible candidate gene for muscle mass []. Overall  the allele frequencies of the favorable alleles in this 1-Mb region were similar in all five breeds  which support a breed-specific association with DHQ  DIT  TW  and WOW in LM rather than an imputation error. An additional breed-specific QTL on BTA2 that contains numerous  genes was associated with WOW in the LM population. The  genes are documented as having a role in limb [] and digit [] formation  thus they probably also play a role in skeletal muscle development. The most significantly associated SNPs with WOW in this region were only segregating in the LM breed and had a very high favorable allele frequency (0.998) in this breed. These SNPs were fixed or very close to fixation in the four other breeds. In the meta-analyses of DHQ  associated variants in all the breeds analysed were identified  which may be beneficial for across-breed genomic prediction []. Although the associations detected in the meta-analysis corresponded to associations identified in the CH and LM breeds  three of these QTL on BTA5  11  and 12 increased in significance when compared to the within-breed analysis. The QTL on BTA5 which contained the  gene  was located close to a QTL previously associated with carcass composition []  whereas the QTL on BTA11 contains   a gene known to be linked with muscular dystrophy in humans []. The QTL on BTA14 contained the  gene which was previously linked to carcass weight in Hanwoo cattle []. Interestingly  in the meta-analyses of DL and WOW  a 1-Mb QTL on BTA7 containing the  and  genes became suggestively associated  although it was not associated in any breed individually. The  gene was reported to be associated with feed intake in cattle []  whereas   a member of the fibroblast growth factor family  is thought to be involved in embryonic muscle formation []. Similarly  in the meta-analysis of TW  a 3-Mb QTL on BTA6 containing the  genes became suggestively associated  although it was not associated in any breed individually. These genes are associated with variation in body size and height in cattle []  humans []  and horses []  thus they are likely plausible candidate genes associated with muscularity linear type traits describing the size of the body. Linear type traits are complex traits that are governed by many genes each with a small effect  and hence  are likely involved in many biological systems. Several GO terms were only associated with a single trait or a single breed; hence there was limited commonality among traits or breeds suggesting the absence of a central biological process that links these traits together. Over-represented GO terms in multiple traits and breeds include those related to skin development  collagen fibril organisation  and the transforming growth factor beta receptor signalling pathway. Each of these GO terms was associated with genes located in the large QTL on BTA2 that contained . Excluding the major  QTL in these breeds  which is known to have a large effect on muscularity  the various GO terms and KEGG pathways represented by the genes associated with the muscularity traits suggest that the majority of genes identified as significantly associated with a trait are not only breed-specific but also trait-specific in many cases. Although millions of SNPs were tested for association with each trait  only 79 of the SNPs suggestively or significantly associated with a trait were located in the coding region of a gene; the vast majority of the SNPs associated with the muscularity traits in any of the breeds were located outside of the coding regions. This is consistent with previous genomic studies for complex quantitative traits in cattle using HD SNP data [] or sequence data []. While the coverage of the HD study [] may not have included the coding regions required to identify significant associations within these regions  our study and a previous study on cattle stature [] used imputed sequence data  and thus  covered the entire genome. Whereas many studies have previously acknowledged the importance of non-coding SNPs to genetic variability  little is actually known about the mechanisms by which these SNPs contribute to variation in complex traits [  ]. One possibility to explain the significance of these non-coding SNPs is that the non-coding regions contain gene regulatory sequences  called enhancers  that act over long distances possibly altering the expression of a gene nearby []. Another possibility is that the folding of DNA into the 3-dimensional nucleus may cause distant loci  such as those in non-coding and coding regions  to become spatially close together thus enabling these regulatory regions to come into contact with genes far away or even on different chromosomes []. Non-coding variants such as 3' UTR  5' UTR and intergenic variants were enriched for most of the traits in each breed. Downstream and upstream gene variants were also enriched in some traits. In general  the SNPs located close to and within the genes identified as candidate genes were located within non-coding or regulatory regions. For example  for DHQ in the CH breed  60 suggestively and significantly associated SNPs were located within the  gene; 10 of these were 3'UTR variants  31 were downstream gene variants and 19 were intronic. Whereas regulatory regions may not have an effect on the coding sequence of any gene  they are thought to be particularly important for growth and development in humans [  ] and cattle [  ]. Thus  similar to previous observations in humans and cattle  enrichment of the non-coding classes of SNPs in our study may indicate the importance of regulatory regions for cattle muscle development. Although we identified many QTL associated with muscularity in beef cattle  our results suggest that these QTL tend to be not only trait-specific but also breed-specific. Overall  the significant SNPs contained in these QTL were more likely located in regulatory regions of genes  which suggest the importance of non-coding regions that may affect gene expression for muscle development in cattle. Some shared regions associated with muscularity were found between CH and LM  with a large-effect QTL on BTA2 containing  being associated with the five traits analysed. This overlap between these breeds was somewhat expected  because they are subjected to similar selection pressures. Apart from this single QTL  extensive differences were observed between the breeds  which may be due to the much smaller sample sizes for AA  HE  and SI compared to the CH and LM populations that result in reduced power to detect QTL or they may be due to differences in genetic architecture of these traits among the populations. In many cases  the strongly associated SNPs in one breed were not segregating in the other breeds  and thus  were missing from the analyses. Knowledge of any potential differences in genetic architecture among breeds is important to develop accurate genomic prediction equations in across-breed analyses.

Commercially  this conclusion will depend on the scheme’s operational costs and resources. The creation of maternal lines in Tilapia breeding schemes may be a possibility if the variation associated with maternal effects is heritable. This work is a part of a wider study on the non-additive genetic effects in Nile tilapia and their potential use in tilapia breeding programs. A previous study [] used the classical approach to partition the phenotypic variance observed in a diallel mating design into additive  non-additive and maternal genetic components using pedigree information to generate the additive and dominance relationship matrices. These variance components were inferred from the variances within and between full-sib families  with the latter further decomposed into variances among sires and among dams. Pedigree-based selection methods have been gradually supplemented with genomic information in various livestock species []  and in some commercial aquaculture species []. Based on the expectation that genomics will lead to improved accuracy of breeding values and provide more detailed information []  there has been a growing interest in quantifying and using non-additive genetic sources of phenotypic variation to achieve breeding objectives more effectively. The development of genomic technologies has raised new challenges for a complete understanding of the interpretation of analyses based on genomic information  and to what degree they are equivalent to classical decompositions of variance based on pedigree. The availability of genomic information in Nile tilapia [] has offered the opportunity to respond to these challenges in an important aquaculture species. Therefore  the first aim was to compare estimates of the genetic variance components obtained when using relationship matrices derived from pedigree or from genomic information in a study designed to estimate non-additive variances. The genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model for a trait builds a matrix of relationships between all individuals based on genomic data  and uses it to partition the phenotypic variance into components  and hence to predict breeding values. Assumptions made in methods for constructing the relationship matrix have a direct effect on the accuracy of the results. There are a variety of methods for constructing relationship matrices using genomics  which typically differ in the scaling parameters [  ] used  and which make it difficult to compare the variance components and heritabilities obtained from them. One method of comparison was published by Legarra []  who showed that it is necessary to re-scale the relationship matrices to the same reference population. The construction of relationship matrices often assumes the state of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)  e.g. in the VanRaden matrices [] as used by the GCTA software []  and the state of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the population []. These assumptions influence the orthogonality of the estimates of the components of the genetic variance (e.g. additive  dominance  etc.) and  hence  whether the estimates change when other components are included in the model. Changes in estimates arising from non-orthogonality also compromise the validity and generality of their biological interpretation [  ]. Thus  the second aim of this study was to examine the impact of assumptions about HWE on the relationship matrices and their impact on the estimates of variance components. Inbreeding depression is a natural phenomenon that is widely assumed to be deleterious for traits of commercial importance and  thus  can have major practical implications [   ]. Its impact is greater in populations with a small effective population size () compared to those with a large   due to more efficient purging of deleterious alleles in the latter [  ]. Thus  inbreeding depression is a concern to breeders since  is often restricted in breeding populations. The use of genomic data allows a direct assessment of the impact of homozygosity from its variation among individuals  rather than relying on changes in homozygosity predicted from pedigree-based inbreeding. To the best of our knowledge  estimates of inbreeding depression in Nile tilapia are not available  even based on pedigree data. Thus  the final aim of this paper was to quantify the effect of inbreeding depression for important commercial traits in Nile tilapia using genomic data. On a wider scale  our aim was to assess the impact of genomic methods on dissecting maternal  additive and non-additive genetic variances in important commercial traits of Nile tilapia. The insights gained into their genetic architecture will provide important information for the future design and operation of breeding programs in an important commercial species. The population used in this study and the experimental design were previously described []. In short  the population was obtained from the reciprocal crossing of two parent groups  A and B  of Nile tilapia. Matings were partially factorial  such that each parent  male or female  had offspring that were both full- and half-sibs. All offspring were subjected to a hormonal treatment  which is a normal aquaculture procedure  to avoid sexual maturation that interrupts growth  especially among females; i.e. offspring were either males or sex-reversed males. Offspring were reared in three batches  harvested over 8 days following 6 to 7 months in the grow-out ponds  and filleted by three filleters. Body weight at harvest (BWH)  body depth (BD)  body length (BL)  body thickness (BT)  fillet weight (FW) and fillet yield (FY) were recorded. These phenotypes were obtained on 2524 individuals  with 1318 and 1206 from each of the two reciprocal crosses  in 155 full-sib families. Of these 2524 fish  1882 individuals were genotyped with the Onil50 SNP-array (see Joshi et al. [] for details). The raw dataset contained 58 466 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  which were analysed using the Best Practices workflow of the Axiom Analysis Suite software [] with default settings (sample Dish QC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.82  QC call rate<U+2009>=<U+2009>97%; SNP call rate cut-off<U+2009>=<U+2009>97%). Ten samples were below the minimum QC call rate and excluded. Then  SNPs were selected based on informativeness  i.e. on the formation of clusters and resolution. Only those classified as ‘PolyHighResolution’ [] (formation of three clusters with good resolution) and ‘NoMinorHom’ [] (formation of two clusters  with one homozygous genotype not present among samples) were selected  resulting in 43 014 SNPs. The mean SNP call rate for these SNPs was 99.5%  ranging from 97 to 100%. Finally  SNPs were filtered for minor allele frequency<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05  leaving 39 927 SNPs for analyses (68.3% of the genotyped SNPs). From the marker genotypes  the individual homozygosity () was calculated as the proportion of homozygous loci for each individual   and this was added to the models described below as a covariate to account for directional dominance [  ]. Of the 1882 genotyped individuals  1119 individuals from 74 full-sib families had phenotypic records  with an average of 15.1 offspring per full-sib family (ranging from 1 to 44; standard deviation<U+2009>=<U+2009>11.2)  and were used for further analysis. Additional file : Tables S1 and S2 show the data structure and descriptive statistics  respectively  while scatterplots and phenotypic correlations among traits are in Additional file : Figure S1. ASReml-4 [] was used to fit mixed linear models  using residual maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate variance components  and breeding values were calculated conditional on the estimated variance components. Eight univariate GBLUP models were tested and compared for the six phenotyped traits. The basic model was an animal model (A)  which was gradually expanded to a model with additive (A)  dominance (D)  maternal (M)  and first order epistatic interaction (E) effects (ADME) by adding each effect as a random effect in a heuristic approach. This resulted in the following models: where  is the vector of phenotypic records;  is the vector of fixed effects  consisting of the effects of reciprocal cross (1 degree of freedom (d.f.))  batch (2 d.f.)  and day of harvest (7 d.f.);  is the vector of genomic homozygosity for each individual  with  the regression coefficient  measuring inbreeding depression;  is the vector of random additive genetic effects;  is the vector of random dominance effects;  is the vector of first order additive x additive epistatic effects;  is the vector of random maternal effects;  is the vector of random residual errors; and        and   are corresponding design matrices for the fixed and random effects. For FW and FY  the mixed model also included filleter (2 d.f.) as a fixed effect. Vectors       and  had an effect for each genotyped individual  where  had an effect for each maternal family. The distributional assumptions for the random effects were multivariate normal  with means zero and where        and  are the additive genetic  dominance  additive-by-additive epistatic  maternal  and error variance  respectively;  is the genomic relationship matrix with elements ;  is the dominance relationship matrix;  is an identity matrix of appropriate size; and  represents the additive-by-additive epistatic relationship matrix  where  is a scaling factor and  is the Hadamard product  resulting in  for all elements  following [  ]. The calculation of elements of    and  is described in the next section. The phenotypic variance was calculated as   and the estimated variance components were expressed relative to the total phenotypic variance (): narrow sense heritability   dominance ratio   and maternal ratio . Broad sense heritability () was calculated as . Variance components for terms that were not included in a model were set to 0. For comparison between models the estimated variances were then multiplied by the difference between the mean of the diagonal elements and the mean of all elements of each variance component’s relationship matrix ) where  is the corresponding relationship matrix and the bar denotes the mean value []). The relationship matrices    and  were calculated following [] using two approaches: either assuming HWE ()  which has been a standard assumption prior to the work of []; or using genomic natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA)  where the assumption of HWE is relaxed. Relaxing the assumption of HWE has consequences for (i) the contrasts between genotypes used to define dominance deviations  and (ii) the scaling factors used for the relationship matrices. However  in both approaches  the contrasts used to define the additive effects are the same (see Additional file )  so the derivation of  is given first  and in a form that shows continuity with further derivations of  and . The result for  is identical to Method 1 of VanRaden []. Let  be the count of an arbitrarily chosen allele for locus  () in individual  ()  such that <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1 or 2. Additive coefficients  are assigned for each genotype for each individual  such that   where  is the frequency of the chosen allele in the population. These elements  form an  matrix   and  for HWE () and NOIA () are calculated as: As noted above and shown in Additional file   the contrasts used to form  for HWE and NOIA are the same but the scaling is different as  in general  without HWE:      Both the contrasts and the scaling differ between the HWE and NOIA approaches to calculate . In the HWE approach  dominance coefficients  are defined for each genotype by orthogonality to the additive coefficients   assuming the population is in HWE. Therefore      and  for <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1  and 2  respectively. The dominance relationship matrix assuming HWE () is then calculated from the  matrix of coefficients    by: In the HWE approach  the relationship matrix for  is the scaled Hadamard product of  with itself   with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 [  ]. If the loci are not in HWE  the relationship matrices  and  are not orthogonal to each other and the estimates of the variance components for the additive and dominance effects will depend on whether or not the other set of effects are fitted.      The NOIA approach removes the assumption of HWE by using dominance values of  that are calculated such that they are orthogonal to the additive values   given the observed genotype frequencies. If     and  denote the genotype frequencies in the population for <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1 or 2  then: The matrix  is calculated from the  matrix of coefficients    by: Note that  in general without HWE  . The relationship matrix for epistatic effects  was calculated from the Hadamard product of  with itself () and scaled by the average of the leading diagonal Scatterplots for different relationship matrices are presented in Additional file : Figures S2 and S3. The software used to calculate the matrices [] does not accept missing genotypes. Therefore  missing genotypes (0.4% of all genotypes) were imputed by sampling from {0  1  2} using R code []  with the probabilities for a given SNP given by the population genotype frequencies for that SNP. The effect of this prediction on the relationships between individuals was checked with GCTA [] by constructing the genomic relationship matrices (GRM) with and without the imputed genotypes. The correlation between the additive and dominance relationships constructed using these two sets of genotypes was greater than 0.9995  as shown on the scatterplots of relationships in Additional file : Figure S4. This suggests that use of imputed missing genotypes does not have a significant effect on our results. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to measure the goodness-of-fit of each model and compared to the LRT of the full model ADME. Critical values for type I error rates of 0.05  0.01 and 0.001 were corrected for boundary effects when testing the null hypothesis H: <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 against the alternative hypothesis H: <U+2009>><U+2009>0 following []. These were obtained from a mixture of  distributions with different d.f.  and calculated using R. The distributions of the likelihood under H for one  two  and three components were: and   respectively  where  corresponds to a point mass of 1 at . The six traits analyzed could be differentiated into three distinct groups based on their likelihood ratio tests for the various models (Table ): BD and BWH showed evidence of significant maternal environmental effects and of additive-by-additive epistasis. BL and FW showed evidence of significant maternal environmental effects only; whereas BT and FY showed no evidence of either maternal environmental effects or additive-by-additive epistasis. None of the traits showed significant dominance variance. The assumption of HWE in the breeding population did not influence the goodness-of-fit for any model  resulting in identical log likelihood values (results not shown). Detrimental effects of genomic homozygosity were evident for all six traits  although the magnitude differed between traits. BWH and FW were more affected by inbreeding than the other traits  with a 0.01 fractional decrease in the trait per 0.01 increase in the individual homozygosity (shown as “” in Table ). The difference between the upper and lower 5%-iles of genomic homozygosity was equal to 0.595<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.533<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.062 units for the population studied. The impacts of this difference when comparing the upper and lower tails of the population (obtained by multiplying  for the trait by the difference between the upper and lower five-percentiles of genomic homozygosity) were: 0.21 cm for BD  23.21 g for BWH  0.47 cm for BL  and 9.76 g for FW (shown as “Difference” in Table ). Traits BT and FY  which showed no evidence of non-additive genetic and maternal environmental effects  were the least affected by genomic homozygosity  with the effects not significantly different from 0 (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). Estimates of variance components with the HWE and NOIA approaches are represented graphically in Fig.  for all models and traits. Summary statistics for the models selected based on the LRT are in Table . Decomposition of phenotypic variance into different components using approaches based on NOIA and HWE assumption for the six traits. The variance ratios are:  is additive;  is dominance;  is additive-by-additive epistatic;  is maternal; and  is residual The simple A model gave the largest additive genetic variances and the highest narrow sense heritabilities for all traits. Addition of a dominance effect to the models had no effect on the estimates of additive genetic variance  while including additive-by-additive epistatic effects reduced estimates of the additive genetic variance markedly  except for BT and FY  which showed no evidence of epistasis (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). Inclusion of maternal environmental effects reduced estimates of the additive genetic variance compared to estimates from the A model  which implies that some of the variance associated with dams was attributed to additive genetic effects in the A model. Including a maternal effect (AME model) also reduced estimates of the additive-by-additive epistatic variance compared to the AE model. As above  these reductions were minimal for BT and FY. The NOIA and HWE approaches resulted in similar estimates of variance components for all models. Thus  in the following  reported estimates are based on the NOIA approach (and so are scaled to the reference population [])  unless otherwise mentioned. Model-dependent differences in estimates of additive variance were also reflected in the estimates of narrow sense heritability. For BT and FY  for which the best-fit model was the A model  heritabilities were the least dependent on the model used. For the other traits  the differences in estimates of heritability between models were as large as 50% for some traits. For the best-fit models  the estimates of heritability were low to moderate  ranging from 0.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 for BL to 0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 for FY (Table ). For BD and BWH  the traits for which the best-fit model included additive-by-additive epistasis  the additive-by-additive epistasis ratio () was equal to 0.15<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.09 and 0.17<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.10 (Table )  respectively  and the variance represented 48 and 63% of the total genetic variance  respectively  but with large standard errors. Various other papers with genomic epistatic models also report large epistatic components [    ] with corresponding large standard errors. For predicted additive-by-additive epistatic effects  large differences were observed between individuals (Fig. a) and between full-sib families (Fig. b). The models were further extended by fitting additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>dominance () and dominance<U+2009>×<U+2009>dominance () epistatic effects  separately and in combination with . The estimates of variance associated with  and  were zero  and estimates of all other components were identical to those of the models described above (results not shown). Scatterplot of estimated breeding values (EBV) and epistatic (additive-by-additive) values (EEV) for BWH using the NOIA approach;  scatterplot for all individuals;  scatterplot for means of full-sib families. Color of the dots in the scatterplot represents the reciprocal cross (rc): A<U+2009>×<U+2009>B (rc1) and B<U+2009>×<U+2009>A (rc2) For the four traits for which the best-fit model included a maternal environmental effect  the maternal ratio ranged from 0.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 to 0.09<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06. As expected  this variance ratio was not affected by the approaches (NOIA  HWE). A major finding of this study is that the use of genomic relationship matrixes found non-additive genetic variance to be almost entirely represented by additive-by-additive epistasis. In pedigree-based analyses  the primary source of non-additive variance is commonly assumed to be dominance [    ]  but this can be very misleading  as is the case here  where estimates of dominance variance were negligible. In our study  information for estimating non-additive variance comes from the variance within full-sib families [see Additional file ]  and with presence of both dominance and epistasis  the additional variance expected in full-sib families over and above the additive variance from the sire and dam is   where     and  are dominance  additive-by-additive  additive-by-dominance  and dominance-by-dominance epistatic variances []. Under a polygenic model with both additive and dominance effects and an increasing number of loci  either the dominance variance tends towards zero or the inbreeding depression tends towards infinity [  ]. Thus  dominance may be present  but the genomic approach shows that this component behaves infinitesimally  with    and  being undetectable in the analyses. The findings from this study add a new dimension to our previous paper []. The availability of genomic data in populations inevitably leads to comparisons between genomic- and pedigree-based heritabilities  but these are not straightforward. Some studies argue that pedigree-based methods overestimate heritabilities [  ]  while some suggest the reverse [   ]  and another that they are similar []. However  few studies recognize that the variance estimates obtained from models that use different relationship matrices  even for the basic additive models  do not refer to the same populations  making simple comparison of estimates meaningless. For pedigree-based analyses  variance estimates refer to the base population of the pedigree (a subset of the individuals in the numerator relationship matrix  )  while for genomic-based analyses using Van Raden matrices [] the estimates refer to the population included in the  matrix  assuming that all markers are in HWE. Only after correcting for the different reference populations [  ] can objective comparisons be made. Here the estimated genetic variance within the entire study population was used for comparing results from different relationship matrices  and was obtained by multiplying the variance estimates by   as described in “” and []. For NOIA estimates this multiplication factor is 1 because of the method used to construct . When models include non-additive genetic components  there are additional reasons why estimates of variance components can differ between models using different relationship matrices (e.g. pedigree and genomic models). In the tilapia population studied here  the estimate of additive variance is qualitatively different when the source of non-additive variation is assumed to be dominance instead of additive epistasis (see Additional file ). Therefore  results from this study are expected to be different from those of []. In addition  only a subset of the data from [] was used  although Additional file : Figure S5 shows that the data used here was close to expectations from random sampling. To aid comparability  model A was fitted using the pedigree-based relationship matrix for the current subset (see Additional file  Table S4). The outcome shows that the pedigree-based and genomic analyses had a qualitatively similar pattern of contributing sources of variance  insofar as additive  maternal  and non-additive variances  for all six traits. Evidence of non-additive genetic effects was found for the same traits (BD  BWH)  irrespective of the type of relationships used. However  as mentioned above  the genomic approach identified the source of non-additivity as additive-by-additive epistasis rather than dominance. Genomic models were more robust to misspecification in partitioning the variance among the components of the genetic and environmental models  which is another potential cause of differences between genomic and pedigree-based models. The greater robustness of the genomic model was clearly observed when the A model was fitted to traits for which the genetic architecture was found to be more complex (results are in Additional file : Table S4). In the A model  maternal effects were absorbed into the estimate of the additive variance when using pedigree data  in contrast to the genomic model  for which the genotypes of the dam and its offspring contribute information to the estimate of additive genetic variance  such that maternal effects are no longer (wrongly) absorbed into the additive variance. Hence  pedigree-based estimates of heritability based on the A model were higher for traits with maternal effects  by as much as 0.18. GBLUP uses a genomic relationship matrix    and assumptions in the construction of  can have a direct effect on estimates of variance components. For example  the  proposed by VanRaden []  assume HWE when scaling the relationship matrices  while this assumption is avoided with  based on the NOIA approach. In this study  the use of the HWE and NOIA approaches for constructing genomic relationship matrices had no impact on the qualitative outcomes related to the genetic architecture of the trait  but did have a quantitative effect on estimates of variance components  e.g.  the estimate of the additive-by-additive epistatic ratio () was inflated by about 20 and 18%  and the estimate of heritability by 6 and 10% for BD and BWH  respectively (Table ). Such quantitative differences in estimates between the HWE and NOIA approaches have also been observed in other studies []. Because of the absence of dominance variance for the traits studied in this population  differences between the NOIA and HWE approaches collapsed into differences in scaling of the relationship matrices since the contrasts used to construct the matrices were identical. As a result  the transformation of estimates of variance components from HWE to a similar scale as the NOIA approach by multiplying estimates by  for the corresponding relationship matrices yielded identical estimates of variance components and ratios for the HWE and NOIA approaches. The NOIA and HWE approaches are statistical models in that they partition the variance observed in a population and use the resulting estimates of variance components to estimate breeding values and dominance deviations []. As such  the latter estimates depend on allele frequencies in the population and on its mating structure  which will influence genotype frequencies. A distinction must be made between the magnitudes of the variance components contributing to the total genetic variance and the size of the effects for each genotype  which are the basis of biological models [  ]. For example  genotypes at a locus may show complete dominance but have negligible dominance deviations  because the superior homozygote is very rare in the population. Although the NOIA approach removes the limitations of the HWE assumption  major barriers to building biological models remain. First  the NOIA approach does not remove the impact of linkage disequilibrium on the estimates of effects and  more seriously  the biological models are meaningful only if they are constructed with the causal variants but not when using anonymous markers. Absence of dominance variance does not imply absence of inbreeding depression when the genetic architecture of a trait approaches the infinitesimal model  and we found evidence for inbreeding depression in precisely the four traits for which the A model was rejected. To the best of our knowledge  these estimates of inbreeding depression are the first reported for commercial traits in Nile tilapia. Most of the previous quantifications of inbreeding depression were based on pedigree information in other aquaculture species  e.g. [  ]  and a few were based on genomic data  e.g. []. In this study  estimation was not possible without the application of genomics because of the near identical pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients among individuals in the population. Most of the traits clearly showed inbreeding depression and  if inbreeding depression was ignored in the model  estimates of variance components and estimates of breeding values can become biased (see Additional file ). Furthermore  inbreeding depression is important in commercial production: for example  FW decreased by 1% per 1% increase in homozygosity and the difference between the upper and lower 5 percentiles for homozygosity in the studied population was 6%  corresponding to a 6% difference in FW. Homozygosity can be minimized by controlling inbreeding or by crossing unrelated lines. The latter will cause a large reduction in inbreeding depression if the regression on homozygosity also holds across lines. In a polygenic model  allelic additive effects () are of the order of  (i.e. )  as the number of loci () becomes large  such that the additive variance remains finite. For inbreeding depression to remain finite  directional dominance deviations () must be . Therefore  a consequence of a polygenic dominance model is that  must reduce by  as  increases. This is consistent with biological pathway models  such as in []  since for loci that have an increasingly small effect  metabolic responses will be more adequately described by a linear function based on the gradient of the response  such that the importance of partial dominance will decrease. In the long term  additive-by-additive epistatic variance is expected to be exploited indirectly because it is converted to additive genetic variance due to random drift and selection. As a result  additive-by-additive epistatic variance affects medium and long-term selection response indirectly []. This argues for the use of a simple breeding scheme that uses only additive genetic effects. However  re-structuring towards a cross-breeding scheme  e.g. reciprocal recurrent selection  may be desirable because of the inbreeding depression and the infinitesimal dominance detected  or the maternal effects if part of this variation was found to be heritable. Nevertheless  for some traits  substantial additive-by-additive epistasis was observed although epistatic variance is expected to be much smaller than the additive genetic variance in elite commercial populations [  ]. This raises two questions. First  should epistatic effects be included when estimating genetic parameters? Doing so likely does not benefit selection decisions  partly because the additive genetic variance already contains some of the variance arising from epistatic effects [    ]. Second  can the large epistatic variance ratio that was observed for some traits in the Nile tilapia population  which predicts large differences in epistatic values between individuals (Fig. )  be capitalized on  in some way  in the Nile tilapia breeding program? While our estimates of epistasis rely upon anonymous loci  a more direct exploitation of epistasis would require identification of the causal variants showing large epistatic interactions [  ] for each trait. The latter will require substantial resources  probably an order of magnitude greater than resources required for identifying causal variants with additive effects. Hence  this approach seems complex and costly to realize. Our findings show that the non-additive genetic variance in the Nile tilapia population was almost entirely additive-by-additive epistatic variance  when using genomic relationship matrices  while these non-additive effects were found to be associated with dominance when using pedigree-based relationship matrixes. Presence of inbreeding depression and lack of dominance variance were consistent with an infinitesimal dominance model for the studied traits. Finally  creating maternal lines in Tilapia breeding schemes may be desirable if the observed maternal variance is heritable. The genotype data used in the study are from commercial family material.
