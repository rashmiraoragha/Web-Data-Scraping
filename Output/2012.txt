Initially  genomic evaluation targeted young bulls but recently  a rapidly increasing number of females (both heifers and cows) are being genotyped. A rising issue is whether and how own performance of genotyped cows should be included in genomic evaluations. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of including yield deviations  i.e. own performance of cows  in genomic evaluations. Two different genomic evaluations were performed: one including only reliable daughter yield deviations of proven bulls based on their non-genotyped daughters  and one including both daughter yield deviations for males and own yield deviations for genotyped females. Milk yield  the trait most prone to preferential treatment  and somatic cell count  for which such a bias is very unlikely  were studied. Data consisted of two groups of animals from the three main dairy breeds in France: 11 884 elite females genotyped by breeding companies and 7032 cows genotyped for a research project (and considered as randomly selected from the commercial population). For several measures that could be related to preferential treatment bias  the elite group presented a different pattern of estimated breeding values for milk yield compared to the other combinations of trait and group: for instance  for milk yield  the average difference between estimated breeding values with or without own yield deviations was significantly different from 0 for this group. Correlations between estimated breeding values with or without yield deviations were lower for elite females than for randomly selected cows for milk yield but were very similar for somatic cell count. This study demonstrated that including own milk performance of elite females leads to biased (over-estimated) genomic evaluations. Thus  milk production records of elite cows require specific treatment in genomic evaluation. Preferential treatment and the bias it induces is a long-standing issue in genetic evaluation. Preferential treatment can be defined as management practices that modify production. Such practices are selective since they are applied to some cows but not to most of their herd mates [] and may be related to housing  feeding or reproduction systems. The bias induced by preferential treatment was initially detected by inconsistencies between the parent average breeding value of a bull (influenced by the breeding value of its dam) and performance of the bull’s daughters (included to estimate the bull’s breeding value after progeny testing known to be less influenced by its dam) []. With the development of genomic evaluation  the issue of bias due to preferential treatment is highly relevant again. In genomic evaluation  the reference population consists of individuals with both genotypes and performance records and which are used to estimate marker effects. The larger the reference population size  the more reliable the genomic evaluations []. In the early years of genomic evaluation  reference populations consisted of progeny-tested bulls only and genomic evaluations were based only on reliable averaged performances of each bull’s daughters. Considering the rapidly increasing number of genotyped cows with own records  it is very appealing to include these genotyped cows in the reference population. Moreover  this will become necessary in the future  to upgrade the reference population if the number of bulls with a progeny evaluation declines. Within the female population  potential bull dams have been the first target for genotyping. The use of potentially biased records of these genotyped elite females in genomic evaluation may have two major impacts  i.e. (1) on the genomically enhanced breeding values (GEBV) of these cows and their relatives and (2) on the prediction equations. Strategies to deal with this issue differ between countries. For example  the USA chose very early to include genotyped cows in the reference population []  whereas  fearing potential bias  Canada and the Eurogenomics consortium [] decided not to include cows in the reference population. Later  Wiggans et al. [] proposed a method to adjust records on genotyped females prior to their use in genomic evaluation  which has since been applied in the USA. There is a need to more precisely assess the impact of including records on genotyped cows in the reference population on the reliability of genomic predictions. With a reference population consisting of AI (artificial insemination) bulls  the phenotypic information of a bull’s daughters is summarized by the daughter yield deviation (DYD) as defined by VanRaden and Wiggans []. DYD represent the average performance of a bull’s daughters corrected for all fixed effects (such as herd  year  season among others)  the permanent environment effect  and also for the genetic contribution of the bull’s mate (i.e.  half the additive genetic value of the cow’s dam). Subsequently  the DYD are used as if they are the performance of the bulls themselves. The equivalent phenotypic measure for females is the yield deviation  YD  which corresponds to the performance of the cow itself (not its progeny’s)  also corrected for all effects except the genetic effect. In a preliminary study in which the own record of genotyped females were either included or excluded (results not shown)  the correlations between phenotypic (DYD) values and GEBV for bulls of the validation population were evaluated for several production traits and for somatic cell count (SCC). This value can be regarded as the square root of the realized reliability. These correlations did not decrease when the own performance records of the genotyped cows  which are ancestors of the validation bulls  were removed from the training set  suggesting two opposite interpretations. On one hand  removing female information did not result in a loss in accuracy  which means that this additional information was (at least partly) biased  providing as much noise as useful information. However  on the other hand  one would expect an increase in the correlation if the removed information had been heavily biased. The objective of this study was to compare predictions obtained with two different genomic evaluations. In the first  only bulls were included in the reference population  while in the second  genotyped cows were added to the reference population. Two traits (milk yield and SCC) were considered that differ in the preferential treatment applied. In contrast with other studies  including our preliminary work  two distinct cow populations were considered  one including only elite dams and one including genotyped cows that were (nearly) “randomly selected” from the commercial population. The latter group is expected to be less affected by preferential treatment or by selective genotyping. Under the assumption that a bias is induced by preferential treatment  GEBV are expected to have different characteristics for the elite cow population and milk yield compared to the other combinations of trait and population. This study focused on genotyped dairy cows. Three French dairy breeds were investigated separately in this study: Holstein  Montbéliarde  and Normande. The impact of two cow populations was investigated: elite females and “randomly selected” cows. Females (both heifers and cows) genotyped by breeding companies were considered as elite females. It was assumed that if a breeding organization was interested in genotyping a particular female as a potential bull dam  and was ready to pay for its GEBV  this female could be defined as “elite”. As a reference  a non-preferentially treated group  i.e. a representative subset of the commercial population was needed. For a research project on genetic and environmental parameters of milk fatty acids composition  7032 dairy cows that were specifically chosen to be representative of the commercial population were genotyped. The choice of the genotyped cows was based on the following constraints: from a set of sires (20 for each of the Normande and Montbéliarde breeds and 30 for the Holstein breed) a limited number of daughters per sire were randomly selected within a given set of participating herds. We considered these cows as “randomly selected”. Elite cows are more likely to be preferentially treated and have records that are biased upward than the “randomly selected” group of cows that are less prone to such a bias. Because elite cows were genotyped before their first calving  i.e.  before any own performance was known  potential selective genotyping was limited to pedigree information on total merit index  which includes both production and SCC. Obviously  the reference populations also included progeny-tested bulls  distributed across several generations. Table  summarizes the number of genotyped bulls  elite females and “randomly selected” cows in the three breeds. In total  1798  2157 and 19 485 genotyped progeny-tested bulls were included in the reference population for the Normande  Montbéliarde and Holstein breeds  respectively. The Normande and Montbéliarde reference bull populations only included individuals genotyped in France whereas the Holstein reference bull population also included bulls genotyped by European partner breeding organizations that exchange genotype information within the Eurogenomics consortium []. All females and most males were genotyped with the Bovine 50K chip (Illumina inc.  San Diego)  while some males from the Dutch population were genotyped with the CRV (The Netherlands) 60K custom chip and imputed. For each breed  two kinds of genomic evaluations were computed. In the first  only males were included in the training population and only DYD were used to estimate marker effects. In the second  genotyped cows with own records were added to the training population and phenotypic data on both males and some females were used to estimate marker effects. Both YD and DYD are by-products of the official polygenic evaluations. Both milk yield and SCC were evaluated with an animal model (polygenic  pedigree-based) evaluation. For milk yield  heterogeneity of variances was accounted for  as described by Robert et al. []. YD and DYD were then corrected for heterogeneity of variance and expressed as in a standardized (reference) environment. Data used for this study were obtained after the official evaluation of November 2011 and were used as inputs for the genomic evaluations. When YD were used for genotyped cows  their contribution was removed from their sires’ DYD in order to avoid double counting of their records. The French genomic evaluation model is an extension of the marker-assisted evaluation approach of Fernando and Grossman []  using haplotypes of three to five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The QTL-BLUP model can be written as: where µ is a constant  y is the phenotypic observation (2xDYD or YD) of individual i  u is its random (pedigree-based) residual polygenic effect  h and h are the random effects of the paternal and maternal haplotypes for QTL j  and e is the residual  with heterogeneous residual variances. Since the model is an individual animal model  it was assumed that phenotypes were obtained for each animal and their weights were expressed in equivalent number of records. The QTL included in the model were selected by a combination of two approaches []. First  several dozens of QTL per trait were detected after QTL fine-mapping using a linkage disequilibrium linkage analysis (LDLA)  as described by Druet et al. []. Then  hundreds of haplotypes were chosen using the Elastic Net algorithm []. Finally  between 327 and 726 QTL for milk yield and between 404 and 525 QTL for SCC were included in the model depending on the breed. To estimate the GEBV  all individuals were included together. Elite and “randomly selected” subsets were analyzed separately  but the GEBV of individuals present in these two populations came from the same evaluation. Mean and standard deviations of national evaluation EBV for the two groups of cows (elite and “randomly selected”) are reported in Table . This table underlines the differences in genetic merit between the two groups for the traits of interest  i.e. the average GEBV ranged from 359 to 737 kg for milk yield (corresponding to 0.5 to 0.95 genetic standard deviations) and from 0.22 to 0.45 genetic standard deviations for SCC. For both traits  the elite population presented a genetic superiority over the “randomly selected” population. The difference was larger for milk yield than for SCC. As already pointed out  some selective genotyping (based on parent average only) may exist in the elite population for both traits. Correlations between GEBV obtained by including either both bulls’ DYD and cows’ YD (GEBV) in the reference population or only DYD (GEBV) are shown in Table . Under the assumption that a bias was induced by preferential treatment only in the case of milk production for elite cows  these correlations should be similar between the elite and “randomly selected” groups for SCC  but for milk yield  they should be lower for the elite group than for the “randomly selected” group. For the Normande breed and SCC  the correlations were essentially the same in the elite and “randomly selected” cows (difference below 0.01). However  for milk yield  the correlation was substantially higher for the “randomly selected” cows than for the elite group (0.82 instead of 0.77). For the Montbéliarde breed  the correlation was also higher for the “randomly selected” group for milk yield (0.77 instead of 0.74)  but for SCC it was lower for the “randomly selected” group than for the elite group (difference of 0.02). For the Holstein breed  differences in correlations between the two groups were almost null (0.001) for SCC and very small (0.007) for milk yield. Box plots of the differences between GEBV and GEBV for the three breeds are presented in Figures     . For each breed  four box plots are displayed  for each combination of trait and population. Note that the values are expressed in kg for milk yield (one genetic standard deviation equals 591  661 and 759 kg for Normande  Montbéliarde and Holstein breeds  respectively) and in genetic standard deviations for SCC. In the absence of bias in the records on cows  these box plots should be centered around 0 and symmetrically distributed.  Milk yield in kg; SCC = somatic cell count expressed in genetic standard deviation.  Milk yield in kg; SCC = somatic cell count expressed in genetic standard deviation.  Milk yield in kg; SCC = somatic cell count expressed in genetic standard deviation. For each breed  the same pattern was observed: three box plots out of four had a mean close to 0. The null value was included in the second quartile for SCC for both groups of cows but only for the “randomly selected” group for milk yield. For milk yield  GEBV for the elite cows clearly presented a different pattern; the box was entirely above 0  meaning that GEBV was greater than GEBV for more than 75% of the cows. This was not observed for SCC. Note that the median is not strictly equal to 0 for any of the four box plots  although it was very close to 0 for SCC in the Holstein breed. The elite cows also presented a higher variability of differences for milk yield  especially in the Montbéliarde and Holstein breeds. Table  focuses on the average differences between GEBV and GEBV. Under the assumption that a bias was induced by preferential treatment only in the case of milk yield for elite cows  this difference should be 0 for the “randomly selected” group or for SCC but significantly larger than 0 for the elite group for milk yield. Across breeds  these average differences between GEBV and GEBV were close to 0 and similar when comparing “randomly selected” and elite groups for SCC. They were equal to 0.01 and 0.02 genetic standard deviations for the Holstein and Montbéliarde breeds  respectively. For the Normande breed and SCC  the elite group had a slightly higher average difference than the “randomly selected” group (0.11 instead of 0.06). Indeed  these values were again not strictly equal to 0. However  for milk yield  this average difference was much larger for the elite group than for the “randomly selected” group  i.e. about 2  3 and 4 times greater for the Montbéliarde  Holstein  and Normande breeds  respectively. In absolute terms  for the Normande breed  the average difference was 0.3 genetic standard deviations greater for the elite group than the “randomly selected” group. Key assumptions in our study were that heifers and cows genotyped by breeding companies are elite females and that the cows genotyped for the research project could be considered as representative of the commercial population. Indeed  each breeding company has its own strategy for bull dam selection: some companies genotype a relatively large proportion of the population and select on a broad basis  while others are more selective and only genotype top females based on their total merit index. Different breeding companies may put a different emphasis on different traits  or the sire analysts may focus on a limited number of maternal cow families  which are more likely to be affected by preferential treatment. For the cows genotyped in the research project  even if the sires (constraint set on number of genotyped progeny) were the most used within each breed  this group of cows may not be a perfect random sample of the commercial population. However  the two groups of cows are easily identified when considering the average EBV of the cows  since the elite group presented a superiority of 0.4 to 1 genetic standard deviations for each breed and trait. The lowest difference in EBV between the elite and “randomly selected” groups was observed in the Montbéliarde breed  likely because the objective of the main breeding organization involved in this breed is to genotype a large proportion of candidates from the whole population. Thus  the elite group includes some females that would not strictly fit with a selection criterion mainly based on milk yield EBV for the Montbéliarde breed. It should also be emphasized that elite cows were genotyped before their first calving  thus  it is unlikely that preferential treatment occurred for all elite cows  especially those with a disappointing GEBV. Milk yield is obviously a more important trait in the breeding goal  which explains why the superiority of the elite group over the “randomly selected” group is greater for this trait. However  the elite group was also genetically superior for SCC. Thus any difference in results between the two traits when comparing the two female groups cannot be explained only by the genetic superiority of the elite group. The two traits not only differ in nature (a production trait  a health trait) but also in their heritability  which is 0.3 for milk yield and 0.15 for SCC in our case. This difference in heritability has an impact on the amount of information that a cow’s own performance contributes to its GEBV; own performance will have a larger impact on the cow’s GEBV for milk yield because of this higher heritability. A main feature of the genomic prediction model is that polygenic effects (based on pedigree) and haplotype effects (based on marker information) are estimated jointly. This is useful to properly estimate both terms  compared with blending procedures [] for instance. However  both polygenic and haplotype effects may be affected by biases in the phenotypic data used. Correlations between GEBV and GEBV presented a different pattern between milk yield and SCC. Indeed  except for the Montbéliarde breed  these correlations were very similar for the elite and “randomly selected” groups for SCC but for milk yield  the decrease in correlation was lower for the elite group than for the “randomly selected” group (difference of up to 0.04). This provides the first evidence of the existence of a bias induced by including own phenotypes of genotyped cows in genomic evaluation. Correlations were also higher for SCC than for milk yield. However  as already mentioned  this can be mainly explained by the lower heritability of SCC. Indeed  the information that is added by a cow’s own phenotype (YD) is less for a lowly heritable trait and is  therefore  expected to result in smaller changes in GEBV. The reference population for the Holstein breed was much larger than that for the two other breeds. This results in more precisely estimated marker effects and more stable genomic evaluations for the Holstein breed. This may be the reason why correlations of GEBV were higher for this breed  regardless of the group and trait considered. This may also explain why the differences observed between the elite and “randomly selected” groups were smaller for this breed. Differences between GEBV and GEBV were computed for the two traits for each cow in the two groups. Graphical representations of these differences (Figures     ) clearly showed a different pattern for milk yield for the elite group compared to the “randomly selected” group and for SCC. A large fraction of the elite cows presented a positive difference for milk yield  meaning that including their own record in genomic predictions led to an increase of their GEBV. This phenomenon was not observed for SSC or for the “randomly selected” group  for which differences were almost equally distributed between positive and negative values. When expressed in genetic standard deviation units  the average differences observed confirmed that the elite group for milk yield presented different characteristics than the “randomly selected” group or for SCC. Admittedly  the mean values were not strictly equal to 0 for the “randomly selected” group or for SCC  and it is difficult to explain why. However  the mean difference was up to 0.3 genetic standard deviations (in the Normande breed) higher for the elite group than for the “randomly selected” group. The elite group was also genetically superior for SCC but no real difference between GEBV and GEBV was observed in either the elite or the “randomly selected” groups. This means that the systematic overestimation of GEBV observed when milk yield YD are included is induced by inflated performances of the elite group. This clearly demonstrates the existence of a bias of GEBV for milk yield but not for SCC. Preferential treatment is the most immediate explanation for this bias  although we cannot exclude some genetic underestimation of the elite cows in our models which did not account for the records of the dams. Our findings were obtained considering a group of cows as a whole. This does not mean that every single individual of this group has inflated performances. In particular  the GEBV decreased for a significant proportion of the elite cows when their own YD were included. Wiggans et al. [] also demonstrated the existence of a bias in genomic evaluations when using unadjusted records for genotyped cows in the reference population. Indeed  for milk yield in Holsteins  the regression coefficient of the progeny test EBV of bulls on their GEBV prior to progeny testing decreased when unadjusted records for genotyped cows were included. The regression coefficient is a measure of how inflated GEBV are compared to EBV and showed a bias equal to 50 kg. The realized reliability  calculated as the squared correlation between GEBV and deregressed proofs for bulls of the validation population  was also lower when records on cows were included. Furthermore  they also observed a bias in genomic predictions equations  as marker effects of the X chromosome presented a specific pattern  suggesting that females behaved systematically differently than males. Since a bias from including records on genotyped cows has now been demonstrated in genomic evaluations  it is necessary to develop methods to correct it. The first solution is to not use own records of genotyped cows. It is possible to estimate direct genomic breeding values obtained using a reference population consisting of bulls only  or to use GEBV (obtained after blending for instance) in which the polygenic component only includes performance (DYD) of male relatives. However  such a solution is not completely satisfactory. First  the AI industry may want to include own records of genotyped cows even if it does not increase reliabilities of genomic evaluations. Secondly  and more importantly  this solution implies that a large amount of potentially valuable information is not used. With the release of an efficient low density SNP chip [] to genotype females at a reduced cost  one can expect that many heifers from commercial herds will be genotyped in the near future  providing a large number of genotyped cows. Obviously  for most of these commercial animals  records are likely to be unbiased and they will build up the reference population of the future. Another solution is to adjust (i.e. pre-correct) the own phenotype of genotyped cows before their inclusion in genomic evaluation. This is the option retained by Wiggans et al. []  who proposed to adjust the mean and variances of the estimated Mendelian sampling term of genotyped cows  such that they are similar to those of bulls. Interesting improvements in several measures related to bias of GEBV and prediction equations were reported. However  whether they are adjusted or not  it is not really possible to distinguish a positive Mendelian sampling from a bias due to preferential treatment for records of cows. Single-step procedures [] are appealing because non-genotyped individuals benefit from marker information of their genotyped relatives. It has also some interesting properties in terms of bias due to pre-selection of young bulls. However  solutions to remove bias induced by preferential treatment (such as blending  or adjustment of Mendelian sampling terms) are still needed. We compared genomic predictions obtained after genetic evaluations with or without including records of genotyped cows in the reference population. Results showed that when genotyped cows belonged to the group of elite cows  their GEBV for milk yield presented a different pattern than when they represent a random sample of the commercial population  whereas these two groups of cows showed similar characteristics for SCC. Correlations between GEBV computed with or without cows in the reference population were lower for the elite group for milk yield but not for SCC. A systematic overestimation of GEBV was also observed when the own milk yield records of the elite cows were included in the reference population. This study demonstrates that explicitly including own records of elite females results in biased (overestimated) GEBV.

Models involving mixed-breed data do not take into account the fact that marker effects may differ among breeds. This study was aimed at investigating the impact on accuracy of increasing the number of genotyped candidates in the training set by using a multi-breed reference population  in contrast to single-breed genomic evaluations.MethodsThree traits (milk production  fat content and female fertility) were analyzed by genomic mixed linear models and Bayesian methodology. Three breeds of French dairy cattle were used: Holstein  Montbéliarde and Normande with 2976  950 and 970 bulls in the training population  respectively and 964  222 and 248 bulls in the validation population  respectively. All animals were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine SNP50 array. Accuracy of genomic breeding values was evaluated under three scenarios for the correlation of genomic breeding values between breeds (r): uncorrelated (1)  r = 0; estimated r (2); high  r = 0.95 (3). Accuracy and bias of predictions obtained in the validation population with the multi-breed training set were assessed by the coefficient of determination (R) and by the regression coefficient of daughter yield deviations of validation bulls on their predicted genomic breeding values  respectively.ResultsThe genetic variation captured by the markers for each trait was similar to that estimated for routine pedigree-based genetic evaluation. Posterior means for r ranged from -0.01 for fertility between Montbéliarde and Normande to 0.79 for milk yield between Montbéliarde and Holstein. Differences in R between the three scenarios were notable only for fat content in the Montbéliarde breed: from 0.27 in scenario (1) to 0.33 in scenarios (2) and (3). Accuracies for fertility were lower than for other traits.ConclusionsUsing a multi-breed reference population resulted in small or no increases in accuracy. Only the breed with a small data set and large genetic correlation with the breed with a large data set showed increased accuracy for the traits with moderate (milk) to high (fat content) heritability.

Accuracies for fertility were lower than for other traits. Using a multi-breed reference population resulted in small or no increases in accuracy. Only the breed with a small data set and large genetic correlation with the breed with a large data set showed increased accuracy for the traits with moderate (milk) to high (fat content) heritability. No benefit was observed for fertility  a lowly heritable trait. Increasing the accuracy of the prediction of breeding values has become a major objective in genomic selection (GS). The success of GS depends on many factors [  ]  some of which cannot be easily controlled  such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL)  the size of the training dataset  and marker densities at a given cost. The heritability of the trait is also a limiting factor. It has been observed that accuracy increases with increasing size of the training data [  ]. For this reason  joint genomic evaluations based on data from a consortium of countries are being carried out for a given breed  such as for the Holstein breed in the EuroGenomics [] and North-American consortiums [] and for the Brown Swiss breed in the Intergenomics consortium []. However  for local breeds and/or of small size  an alternative is to train on data from several breeds simultaneously [  ]. A multi-breed reference population could be an appealing solution to increase the reference population size  especially if some of the analyzed breeds have small population sizes. However  most multi-breed studies assume that marker effects are the same across populations [  –]. This assumption  albeit useful  is hardly tenable  because it assumes that the pattern of linkage disequilibrium is the same in each breed. Also  the underlying architecture (QTL frequencies and interactions) does not need to be the same between breeds. Furthermore  if breeds are not crossed (which is the case for the above studies and in this one)  there is no interest in estimating breeding values of composite animals on a hypothetical “multiple breed” base population. Quite the opposite  dairy cattle breeders are interested in estimated breeding values (EBV) expressed on the scale of each pure breed. Several recent studies have used approaches that overcome the assumption of equal marker effects across populations. Makgahlela et al. [] proposed to define multiple breeds as an admixture of populations by taking breed proportions into account in the context of a random regression model. However  in most cases  this admixture of breeds does not exist or cannot be identified. Varona et al. [] used models that allow for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) effects to differ in variance  value and sign between populations in heteroscedastic or multiple trait settings. In this work  we investigated the impact on accuracy of increasing the size of the training set by using a multi-breed French reference population under differing assumptions for the genetic correlations between breeds  in contrast to single-breed genomic evaluation. Three traits (milk yield  fat content and female fertility defined as non return rate at 56 days)  which have different genetic backgrounds were analyzed in three major French dairy cattle breeds: Montbéliarde (M)  Normande (N) and Holstein (H). Varona et al. [] suggested that the SNP effects could be modeled assuming that there is a genetic correlation of SNP effects across breeds. These authors modeled breeding values () as a sum of marker effects () so that  and ordered by breed (breeds 1 and 2 for illustration): Marker effects were assumed to have a multivariate distribution: Where  is an identity matrix of order equal to the number of SNP markers and  is a 2 x 2 breed covariance matrix for SNP effects. VanRaden [] (and also []) showed how models that assume normality of marker effects (the so-called “BLUP-SNP”  []) can be transformed into equivalent BLUP animal models (usually known as  BLUP) that use a “genomic” relationship matrix  usually termed   rather than a pedigree-based relationship matrix. Matrix  is an estimator of the “true” proportions of genes that are identical by descent between individuals [  ]. Based on this equivalence  the model by Varona et al. [] can be transformed into the following model: Where  is a vector of genomic breeding values (GBV) for breed i   is a matrix of genomic relationships (animals in all breeds)  and  is a matrix of variances and covariances associated to GBV in each breed for a given trait. This model is  thus  a multiple-trait model with two “pseudo-traits”  reflecting the breeding value for the trait in breeds 1 and 2. This model resembles the MACE model [] in which the breeding values of each bull in different countries are seen as different  correlated traits. In this model  the genetic distance (for each trait) between breeds is quantified by the genetic correlations between  and  (similar to the genetic correlations across countries in MACE). Note that if <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>  the model reduces to the regular GBLUP model as used  for instance  by Hayes et al. [] or []. In addition  if <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  the model reduces to two independent GBLUP models  one for each breed. In addition to the theoretical appeal  one advantage of a multi-trait GBLUP model is the possibility of using standard estimators and existing software to predict breeding values and estimate variance components. Table  gives details on the constitution of the different validation and reference populations. The reference population included data on 4896 bulls from the M  N and H breeds and was used to estimate genetic parameters and GBV. Thus  the multi-breed reference population included M (n = 950)  N (n = 970) and H (n = 2976) bulls with a large number of daughters. The average equivalent daughter contributions (EDC) ranged from 407 to 513 for M and H  respectively. The validation populations included the youngest bulls (born after year 2004) from each breed that had at least 40 daughters in production since October 2009. These bulls were used to evaluate the accuracy of the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). All bulls were genotyped with the 50k SNP using the Illumina Bovine array. The SNP were filtered by extreme Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (p < 10) and Mendelian inconsistencies (the genotype of the father was deleted if more than 20% of his progeny showed contradiction). Editing was within-breed. Genotypes of the three breeds were merged  including only SNP which segregated (minor allele frequency > 3%) in each breed. In the final data set  only those loci fulfilling all requirements in all breeds were considered. Finally  43 852 SNP were used. Pseudo-phenotypes for each bull were daughter yield deviations (DYD)  as in VanRaden and Wiggans []  with weights corresponding to the equivalent daughter contributions for each bull. In all analyses  a given trait (i.e.  milk production) was considered a different trait for each breed. To avoid confusion  these will be referred to as traits (milk production  fat content  fertility) and as scales (breeding values on the M  N or H scale). In the first analysis  we estimated genetic variances and correlations between breeds and the heritability of each trait and each breed using a combined data set including the three breeds. For computational reasons (see later)  instead of the multiple-trait model (MTM)  an almost equivalent Random Regression Model (RRM) was used  similar to that used by []. The general equation for this model was: Where   is a vector of 2*DYD;  is a matrix that allocates each DYD to a breed and  a vector of average breed effects;  are design matrices allocating DYD to GBV (   and ) for the M  N and H scales consecutively. For example  the equation corresponding to bull  of breed H  will have a value of 1 in the ( ) position of  and 0 in  and   since no bull has daughters in several breeds. Vector  is a vector of uncorrelated random normal pseudo-errors (“pseudo”  because they include Mendelian sampling effects of the daughters and part of the breeding value of the mates). Homogeneous pseudo-error variances were assumed across breeds. The co(variance) structure for GBV    for one trait was: Where   is the matrix of (co) variances of GBV in each of the three scales  M N H  for a given trait  named as genetic (co)variances henceforth;  is the genomic relationship matrix relating animals of the same and different breeds. The correlation of GBV in different scales for a given trait is denoted by r  and it will be named as genetic correlation between breeds henceforth. Matrix  was created as in VanRaden []: Where  is a centered incidence matrix of genotype covariates (0/1/2); 2<U+2009><U+2211><U+2009>p q is a scaling parameter in which p and q are the allelic frequencies for SNP i (i = 1: 43852)  which were computed across breeds;  is an identity matrix (included in order to make  invertible). Matrix  could have been replaced by   following VanRaden et al. []  but this is not expected to affect results considering the low weight assigned to . To implement this model  the regular relationship matrix was replaced by  using facilities in the Blupf90 series of programs [  ]. Variance and covariance components in the RRM were estimated using Bayesian procedures via Gibbs sampling by the Gibbs2f90 program []. Moreover  estimates of genetic correlations between breeds were computed from the corresponding estimates of the genetic (co)variance components. The interest in using the RRM with Gibbs sampling rather than  e.g.  REML or a multiple-trait model  was the fact that  on one hand  the relationship matrix needed to be stored just once (in contrast to regular REML  for instance)  and on the other hand  no “data augmentation” of missing traits was needed with the RRM  in contrast to using regular Gibbs sampling with a multiple-trait model. Both of these resulted in large reductions in computing time and memory requirements. For instance  storing  (which is a 6330 x 6330 dense matrix) for the MTM would take nine times as much space. The Gibbs sampler was run for a total of 20 000 iterations. The first 4000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. Convergence was checked visually and by the Geweke diagnostic of the Markov chain []. Posterior means of genetic variances for each trait and for each breed and of the correlation between breeds were computed. After the parameters were estimated  the (co)variances in the model were fixed at their estimates and the RRM was used in a GBLUP analysis to estimate the GEBV of all genotyped candidates in the validation dataset. In a second set of analyses  BLUP with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) was applied to estimate the GBV of all genotyped bulls using the following MTM: Where  is a vector of 2*DYD for breed i = {M N H}. In this model  each record is allocated to its breed-specific effects and breeding values. The covariance structure of  was as for the RRM and estimated (co)variances obtained with the RRM were used in the MTM to estimate the corresponding GEBV. However  in the MTM  different residual variances for each breed were used: Because 2*DYD is pre-corrected data  its pseudo-residual variance is not the same as the actual residual variance. Thus  we used  = (4 + 2)  where the  indicates values from routine genetic evaluations for these breeds (S. Fritz  UNCEIA  Jouy-en-Josas  personal communication). In both models (RRM or MTM)  EDC were used as weighting factors and the GEBV were computed using BLUP90iod2 modified by Aguilar et al. []. For each model (MTM and RRM)  three scenarios for the genetic correlation between breeds  r  were assumed to compare the accuracy of GEBV. In scenario 1  r was set to zero to simulate a situation where breeds were uncorrelated  which is equivalent to performing single-breed evaluations. In scenario 2  the estimated value for r was used and in scenario 3  r was set to 0.95  which is equivalent to the assumption that the population is close to homogenous (r = 1) [  ]. Accuracy and bias of the GEBV were assessed in the validation datasets  separately for each breed  by the coefficient of determination (R) and the estimated linear regression coefficients   (intercept) and  (linear term) of the linear regression of 2*DYD on GEBV  weighted by the corresponding equivalent number of daughters (EDC)  respectively. Figures  and  show the distributions of genomic relationship coefficients within and between breeds  respectively. Figure  shows a higher level of relationship within the M and N breeds compared with breed H. This might be due to the larger number of individuals in breed H than in the N and M breeds  because allele frequencies were computed considering all animals. Using breed-specific allele frequencies is expected to give different results (e.g.  []). Pedigree relationships were ascertained as well  resulting in an average within-breed relationship of 0.10. The choice of allele frequencies to be used may depend upon the goals of the analyses [] but the effect of this choice on the results of genomic evaluation is still an open issue  particularly in the multi-breed context. Figure  shows a moderate level of genomic relationships between breeds compared to the within-breed relationships  as expected.                                                                                                           Table  contains estimates of genetic variances (by breed) and pseudo-error variances for milk production  fat content and female fertility estimated in the multi-breed reference population using RRM. Genetic variance estimates were similar to those used in the routine genetic evaluation (S Fritz  UNCEIA  Jouy-en-Josas  personal communication) and the latter were included in the 95% high probability density regions (HPD95%) interval of the estimates from the genomic data  except for the genetic variance for fertility in breed H. Estimated posterior genetic variances showed a narrow HPD95% interval  indicating a high precision of the estimates using the molecular information. Pseudo-error variances differed from the residual variances used in routine genetic evaluation (not shown in the table). This result is explained by the use of the 2*DYD as a pseudo-phenotype  hence the use of the term pseudo-error variance. Posterior means and HPD95% intervals of the heritability for each trait and breed are in Table . Heritabilities were calculated using as genetic variances the GBV variance estimated in the RRM. The phenotypic variance was obtained subtracting the “true” residual variance from the pseudo-error variance estimate and adding the variance of the permanent environmental effect of the cows used in the routine genetic evaluation (S Fritz  UNCEIA  Jouy-en-Josas  personal communication)   which was not estimable in our data because our DYD are “free” of permanent environmental effects. Heritabilities estimated by the RRM were then rather similar compared with those used in routine genetic evaluation. Table  shows the posterior means of the genetic correlations between breeds for each trait when combining information from the M  N  and H reference populations. Posterior means of genetic correlations for milk production and fat content were moderately high  particularly for correlations between breeds M and H (0.66 and 0.79 for fat content and milk production  respectively)  whereas genetic correlations between breeds for female fertility were relatively low (-0.01; 0.39). Estimated posterior correlations showed large HPD95% intervals  especially between breed M and N and breeds N and H  whereas the genetic correlation between breeds M and H showed the narrowest HPD95% intervals. Female fertility showed the largest HPD95% intervals  indicating that the available information was not sufficient to estimate accurately the genetic correlations between breeds for this trait. Estimated accuracies calculated as R for the validation populations in each breed are in Table  for each scenario and each model (RRM vs. MTM). The R in the reference data was close to 1 for all the traits and breeds  as expected (results not shown). Estimated accuracies in the validation populations were slightly greater under the nonzero r scenarios (2 and 3)  as compared to accuracies  estimated in a single-breed scenario (r = 0)  for both models for milk production and fat content. The most important increase of accuracy was observed for fat content for breed M (from 0.27 with the single-breed scenario to 0.33 in the nonzero r scenarios). Female fertility was the only trait for which accuracy was not improved in any population or model when the genetic correlation between breeds was allowed to be different from zero. This result may be because of the low heritability and the smaller estimates of genetic correlations between breeds for this trait  which may indicate that fertility is biologically different between breeds. Accuracies of GEBV were largest for the H breed for milk production (0.30 and 0.31 under RRM and MTM  respectively) and fat content (0.52 and 0.48 under RRM and MTM  respectively) traits because of the larger number of genotyped animals in this breed (Table ). However  for fertility  the M breed had the largest accuracies (0.19 under the two models). A small difference in accuracies was observed between the RRM and MTM models  with the RRM showing a slightly higher accuracy (Table ). Table  shows the estimated accuracies of EBV obtained from routine genetic evaluation based on pedigree for each breed (S Fritz  UNCEIA  Jouy-en-Josas  personal communication). Estimated accuracies of GEBV (Table ) were larger than those obtained using pedigree information for milk production and fat content. For female fertility  only a small gain was observed. Again  the low heritability of this trait is the likely reason of this result. The coefficient of regression of 2*DYD on GEBV () was also used to test the impact of increasing the size of the reference population using multi-breed data. The expected value of  is 1  and this is desired to avoid inflation (or under-inflation) of GEBV’s of young bulls. Table  shows the regression coefficients estimated by the two models and for each scenario and breed. The estimates were larger for MTM than for RRM for all traits  breeds  and scenarios. Female fertility for breed M presented the worst estimate of  (1.50 and 1.80 for RRM and MTM  respectively)  whereas accuracies estimated by R for this breed were largest. Thus  the results show some degree of trade-off between R and  used to evaluate the GEBV predictions. It is important to note that the H breed presented the best quality of predictions in terms of  for all traits and breeds. This study shows that the use of a multi-breed reference dairy cattle population did not have a large impact on the accuracy of prediction of GBV for young bulls. This confirms the findings of Hayes et al. [] and also of [  ] for multi-breed reference populations. However  using a combined H and Jersey reference population and Bayes type methods that rely on estimates of SNP effects to predict the genomic breeding values  Hayes et al. [] found an increase of up to 17% in the accuracy of GEBV for fat yield and for fat and protein percent for young Jersey bulls. Other studies [  ] have reported an important increase in accuracies (up to 20%) if the size of the training set increases when using one breed from different countries (international evaluation). Olson et al. [] found a general increase of 2% from pooling U.S. and Canadian H populations and 5% for the Brown Swiss from European countries when using multiple trait methodology. Given that large or moderately large genetic correlations have been estimated for the same trait measured in different countries but on the same breed (see  e.g.  [] for Holstein populations)  larger benefits in accuracy of GEBV from using a combined reference population seem to be obtained when the genetic correlations between the trait measured in different populations are larger. In this study  a notable improvement in accuracy (6%) from using a multi-breed reference population was observed only for fat content in the M breed. The M breed showed the largest estimated genetic correlations with the H breed (0.79  0.66 and 0.39 for milk yield  fat content and fertility  respectively). This indicates that the SNP effects are more similar between the M and H breeds than with breed N. This might be because of the introgression of Red Holstein animals in the M breed in the 1970’s (e.g. []). Therefore  breed M would be the one expected to obtain the largest benefits from multi-breed evaluation. Although milk yield was the trait showing the largest genetic correlation between breed M and the other breeds  the improvement in accuracy was very small (2%) for this trait. The larger response for fat content might be related to the different genetic architecture of this trait. The 50k bovine chip contains SNP that are in close LD with the DGAT1 polymorphism  which explains about 40% of the genetic variation in fat percentage in the milk of H cattle []. The “K” allele for DGAT1 in breed M probably originated from breed H [] and is expected to show similar LD around it  which may explain why this trait benefits most from multi-breed evaluation; i.e.  some chromosome segments of large effect that segregate in breed M are better estimated when including data on breed H. Fat content has been found to show larger benefits from the use of genomic information in other studies [  ]. The H breed did not benefit from the large genetic correlations with the other breeds  probably because  with the larger size of the H breed reference population  the observed accuracy is close to the maximum achievable value given the existing LD. The N breed had lower estimated genetic correlations with the large H breed  and only showed minor improvements in accuracy (1-2%) from multi-breed evaluation for milk yield and fat content. For female fertility  accuracies of GEBV in the validation populations were the same using multiple-breed or a single-breed reference population (scenarios 2 and 3 versus scenario 1)  showing low sensitivity to the value of the genetic correlation. The small estimated correlations between breeds for fertility (-0.01 to 0.39) could explain the low gain in accuracies for fertility when GEBV were estimated by a multi-breed reference population. This might indicate that the LD between markers and QTL does not persist between breeds and/or that the effects of these QTL differ between breeds. In addition to no effect on accuracy  the regression coefficient of 2*DYD on GEBV was greater than one for fertility in the M breed  which indicates a severe underestimation of GEBV. De Roos et al. [] and (also []) proposed the use of a greater density of markers when the breeds that are used as a reference population are too diverged to detect enough marker-QTL relationships  such that the effect of all QTL can be captured by the SNP []. However  Harris et al. [] did not find significant increase in accuracies of GEBV when a higher density of markers was used in the multi-breed analyses. Pryce et al. [] suggested and evaluated considering only the genomic regions that are known to be associated with the traits of interest for prediction of GBV. Shulman et al. [] reported SNP on nine chromosomes to be associated with female fertility traits in Finnish Ayrshire bulls  and that the BTA2 gene also contained a SNP that was significantly associated with non-return rate in cows. Overall  in this study the use of multi-breed instead of single-breed analyses did not increase the accuracies of GEBV in spite of favourable genetic correlations between breeds  especially for milk production and fat content. Thus  high (higher than 0.6) genetic correlations between breeds were needed in this study to achieve slightly higher precisions. Therefore  for traits with moderately high heritabilities  and using existing genomic relationships between breeds  the genetic correlation between breeds might be an indicator of the expected increase in accuracy of GEBV from the use of a multi-breed reference population. In fact  the genetic correlation provides an indication about the concordance of the effect of the QTL on the trait between breeds (e.g.  it might be different  or the QTL might be fixed in one breed and segregating in another) and about the concordance of LD between markers and QTL between breeds. A model fitting data on a trait in multiple breeds as correlated pseudo-traits has been presented. The trait that showed the lowest genetic correlation between breeds was female fertility. The use of a multi-breed reference population only increased the accuracy of GEBV for traits and populations that showed the largest correlations between breeds and in the breed with the smallest data set. Accuracies of GEBV for fertility were lower than for other traits and values of the regression of the DYD on the GEBV showed severe underestimation of GEBV for fertility in breed M.

Benefits from selecting on direct genomic breeding values are greater for breeders who use natural mating sires in their herds than for those who use artificial insemination sires. Producers with unregistered commercial Limousin and Simmental cattle could also benefit from being able to identify genetically superior animals in their herds  an opportunity that has in the past been limited to seed stock animals. A variety of genotyping arrays  such as the BovineSNP50 BeadChip []  can now be used to genotype cattle for at least 50 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The resultant SNP marker genotypes can be used to produce direct genomic breeding values (DGV) for selection candidates  as proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  as soon as DNA can be obtained and without delaying selection to collect phenotypes. This allows reduced generation intervals  which might increase genetic progress []. First  SNP marker effects must be estimated from an analysis of a population with SNP genotypes and trait phenotypes (training set). The accuracies of the resulting DGV are key to the successful application of this new technology in genetic improvement. MacNeil et al. [] showed that DGV could be considered as a correlated trait to that for which phenotypes are available for traditional estimation of breeding values. The square of the estimated genetic correlation represents the proportion of genetic variance explained by the genomic information and reflects the accuracy of the DGV. The objective of this study was to estimate genetic correlations between nationally evaluated traits and DGV in Limousin and Simmental beef cattle. A total of 2239 registered Limousin and 2703 registered Simmental animals were genotyped either at the University of Missouri (Columbia  MO) or by GeneSeek (Lincoln  NE). Most animals were genotyped with the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA) but 264 Simmental animals were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA). The DNA for each animal was obtained from cryopreserved semen or hair samples provided by artificial insemination (AI) organizations or by numerous breeders of respective registered Limousin or Simmental cattle. For Limousin cattle  DNA was also available from samples sent to the University of Missouri for genetic testing for a mutation responsible for protoporphyria []. Birth year distributions for the genotyped animals within each breed are provided in Table . There are currently two versions of the BovineSNP50 BeadChip  referred to as B and C  which correspond to the initial product release and its re-synthesis  respectively. In this study  Simmental animals were genotyped with either version of the BovineSNP50 BeadChip or with the BovineHD BeadChip. All Limousin animals were genotyped with version B of the BovineSNP50 BeadChip. For animals that were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip  genotypes for markers that were common to versions B and C of the BovineSNP50 BeadChip were extracted. Since we assembled genotypes from different array versions for different breeds  which included monomorphic loci  the final genotype files included 56 794 markers for Limousin and 57 039 markers for Simmental. Only markers that passed quality control (call rate<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95  minor allele frequency<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test p-value<U+2009>><U+2009>1e-30) were used for further analyses. The genotype data were gathered from various sources (respective breed associations and various research projects) and some data was provided without call rate information. Consequently  the marker quality control tests were performed based on data from the 2896 Limousin or Limousin-Angus animals and the 1706 Simmental animals that were in the University of Missouri database at the time of analysis. The number of markers that passed all quality control tests and were used for analysis were 45 147 for Limousin and 47 364 for Simmental animals. Any missing genotypes (0.02% and 2.77% of all genotypes for the Limousin and Simmental animals  respectively) were replaced with the average value (on a 0–2 scale) for each SNP in that particular breed. Deregressed estimated breeding values (DEBV)  derived following Garrick et al. []  were used as response variables to estimate SNP effects and their accuracies were used as weighting factors. This method results in DEBV that are free of parent average effects and the weights can be used to appropriately account for heterogeneous variance due to differences in reliabilities of individual and parent average EBV and therefore of corresponding DEBV. Ostersen et al. [] confirmed in purebred pigs that using DEBV as the response variable yielded more accurate DGV than did using EBV. Expected progeny differences (EPD) and their Beef Improvement Federation (BIF) accuracies were obtained from each Breed Association for all of the genotyped animals  their sires and dams. The EPD were transformed to EBV by multiplying by 2 and the corresponding reliabilities (R) were obtained as: To derive the weighting factors  the proportion of genetic variance not explained by markers (parameter c of []) was assumed to be 0.40 and heritabilities that were used are in Table . In total  15 traits were analyzed (some traits were recorded in only one breed  Table ). The number of genotyped animals with DEBV varied among traits because some animals had no individual or offspring information contributing to their EPD. This occurred in some older animals born before the traits were introduced  and in some young genotyped animals. The number of genotyped animals with DEBV and the average DEBV reliabilities for the studied traits for each breed are in Table . Method “BayesC” [] was used to estimate marker effects for genomic prediction. This method assumes that non-zero SNP effects are drawn from a distribution with constant variance but that some known fraction of markers (p) have zero effect. Habier et al. [] showed that BayesC is less sensitive to prior assumptions than BayesB. For each trait  the following model was fit to the DEBV data for training: where  is the DEBV for animal i   is the population mean   is the number of marker loci in the panel   is allelic state (i.e.  number of B alleles from the Illumina A/B calling system) at marker j in individual i   is the random effect for marker j  with <U+2009><U+2009>(0 <U+2009>) (with probability 1 - p) or <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 (with probability p)  and  is a residual with heterogeneous variance  depending on the reliability of the DEBV information for animal i []. Parameter p was assumed to be 0.95 for all analyses. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with 41 000 iterations were used to provide posterior mean estimates of marker effects and variances  after discarding the first 1000 samples for burn-in. In preliminary analyses  all genotyped animals were included in the training set (for each breed separately) to obtain estimates of genetic and residual variances for constructing priors for genetic and residual scale parameters. The DGV for individual i within a validation set was derived as the sum over all k markers of posterior means of predicted SNP effects  as estimated in the training set  multiplied by the number of copies of the B allele: where DGV is the DGV for individual i in the validation dataset   is the marker genotype of individual i for marker j  and û is the posterior mean effect of marker j over the 40 000 post burn-in samples. All analyses were performed using GenSel software []. The accuracy of DGV was evaluated by pooling estimates from a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. For each breed  genotyped animals were first divided into five unequally-sized mutually exclusive groups. Each training analysis excluded one group when estimating marker effects  which were then used to predict DGV of individuals from the omitted group (validation set). This resulted in every animal having its predicted DGV obtained without considering its own DEBV. K-means clustering was used to partition the genotyped animals into five groups within each breed  whereby relatedness was maximized within each group and minimized between each of the groups []. The CFC Package [] was used to construct the numerator relationship matrix between genotyped animals for each breed  using pedigree information for genotyped animals and all their known ancestors  which comprised 13 790 Limousin and 16 716 Simmental individuals. The Hartigan and Wong [] algorithm  implemented using R []  was used for K-means clustering based on a difference matrix obtained from the numerator relationship matrix among the genotyped animals. The maximum genetic relationship coefficient (a) was calculated between each animal and all other animals within the same group  and between each animal and all other animals in the other four groups  so that each animal had two a values (within and between groups). The average a values of animals of each group were calculated within and between groups to quantify the quality of the clustering. Further details are in Saatchi et al. []. We applied a weighted bivariate animal model using the DGV  computed as described above for each genotyped animal  and their DEBV to estimate variance and covariance components for each of the studied traits in each breed. The purpose of fitting this model was to estimate the genetic correlation between the trait (T) and its respective DGV (). This trait-DGV genetic correlation is required to pool DGV and traditional EBV in national genetic evaluation []. The model was: where  and   are vectors of fixed effects (only the trait mean for  but class effects of the five groups for );  and   are vectors of random additive genetic effects for the trait and its DGV  respectively  where    and   where  is the additive genetic variance of trait   is the additive genetic variance of DGV ( represents the proportion of additive genetic variance of a trait explained by markers) and  is the genetic covariance between trait and its DGV;  consists of nonzero elements of   the usual pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix among individuals in the same group  but with covariances between individuals in different groups zeroed out as follows: This approach effectively pools information across all five groups to estimate the genetic parameters. The remaining effects  and  are vectors of mutually uncorrelated random residual effects for the two traits   and   cov( <U+2009>)<U+2009>=<U+2009> <U+2009>where  is an identity matrix and  is a diagonal matrix containing weights (the same weights as used in the estimation of SNP effects) based on the reliability of the corresponding DEBV [];  and  are known design matrices for fixed effects and random additive genetic effects  respectively. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using the ASReml v3.0 software package []. To evaluate the efficiency of selection based on DGV in relation to selection based on parent average information  relative selection responses were computed for each trait as the ratio of two accuracies []: where  is the genetic correlation between the trait and its DGV  and  is the reliability of parent average information. The available parental information in our dataset represents more than that available on the parents of the genotyped bulls at the time of their birth because they include information on progeny and grandprogeny that would not normally exist at the time of selection. In this efficiency formula  the selection intensity and generation interval were assumed identical for the two selection strategies  which is true when DGV information is available at the same time as parent average information. The efficiency of selection on DGV versus parent average was also computed for the most recent crop of calves - those non-genotyped purebred Simmental animals that were born after January 2012 (overall 323 animals). EPD and BIF accuracies of their sires and dams were obtained from the American Simmental Association evaluation in October 2012. The number of individuals and average a within and between the K-means clustered groups for Limousin and Simmental animals are presented in Table . The average a was much larger within groups than between groups. These results show that the K-means clustering successfully partitioned individuals into related groups with reduced relationships between groups. The estimated genetic (co) variances of each trait and its DGV are shown in Table  and the estimated heritabilities of DGV and the estimated trait-DGV genetic correlations are shown in Table . For most traits  estimates of genetic variance of DGV were smaller than the corresponding estimates of additive genetic variance and were almost the same as the estimates of genetic covariance between traits and their respective DGV. Heritabilities of DGV were 1.00 for most traits. In Limousin animals  estimates of the genetic correlation of the trait with its DGV were higher than 0.40 for all traits except for stayability (0.39±0.06). For Simmental animals  estimates of the genetic correlation of the trait with its DGV were higher than 0.30 for all traits except fat thickness (0.29±0.02). Estimates of the genetic correlation of the trait with its DGV were higher than 0.50 for birth weight  carcass weight  marbling  rib eye muscle area  weaning weight direct and yield grade  in both breeds. Table  presents the efficiencies of selection based on DGV in comparison to selection based on parent average information for genotyped animals in both breeds. Efficiencies differed between traits and ranged from 0.68 (docility) to 1.28 (yearling weight) in Limousin  and from 0.51 (fat thickness) to 1.44 (shear force) in Simmental. Efficiency values larger than 1 (meaning that indirect selection based on DGV is expected to produce greater genetic response than direct selection based on parent average information) were observed for marbling  rib eye muscle area  yield grade and yearling weight traits in Limousin  and for birth weight  carcass weight  marbling  rib eye muscle area  shear force and yield grade traits in Simmental. Table  also presents the reliabilities of parent averages and the efficiencies of selection on DGV versus parent average for non-genotyped young Simmental animals. In general  reliabilities of parent average were lower for non-genotyped young animals than those calculated for genotyped Simmental animals. Efficiencies are influenced by the reliabilities of parent average. Higher efficiencies were obtained for non-genotyped young animals  ranging from 0.60 (calving ease maternal) to 2.04 (shear force) over all studied traits. The results show that parent average reliabilities are quite variable  ranging from zero to 0.50  and show benefits for selection on DGV versus parent average (efficiency larger than 1) for some Simmental animals even for traits with overall efficiency smaller than 1 (Additional file ). Some traits exhibit bimodal distributions of parent average reliabilities  reflecting the difference in reliabilities between animals sired by natural mating compared to artificial insemination (AI) sires. The accuracy of DGV cannot be assessed in the training set but must be assessed in a sample of individuals that are not included in training. Multi-fold cross-validation in beef cattle has some advantages described below in comparison to partitioning the genotyped animals into two groups (old and young animals)  with training in older animals and validation in younger animals  which is the usual approach in dairy cattle studies [  ]. Using multi-fold cross-validation  the DGV can be obtained for all genotyped animals in validation sets  while large training sets can be retained. Habier et al. [] showed that the accuracies of DGV depend on both genetic relationships between individuals in the training and validation sets and on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL). They showed that the accuracy of DGV for a selection candidate decreases as the average genetic relationship of the candidate to the training set individuals decreases. In beef cattle  many registered selection candidates are produced by natural mating sires  which may be distantly related to the individuals in training sets. If the accuracies of DGV are more dependent on genetic relationships than on marker-QTL LD  then the effectiveness of genomic selection will be limited in practice for such distantly-related selection candidates. Saatchi et al. [] showed that conservative accuracies of DGV that are less affected by relationships can be obtained by minimizing the genetic relationships between training and validation sets using K-means clustering. In this study  we also used K-means clustering and found greater a values between groups than reported by Saatchi et al. [] for Angus beef cattle. This indicates that the genetic relationships were greater between training and validation sets for the Limousin and Simmental populations used here than for the Angus population used by Saatchi et al. []. In simulation studies  the correlation between DGV and true breeding values (TBV) has been used to represent the accuracy of DGV. However  in field data  TBV are not available and the correlation between DGV and the response variable (phenotype records  EBV  DEBV  etc.) is commonly used to derive the accuracy of DGV. In dairy cattle  the correlation between DGV and DEBV (or EBV) is a good estimate of the accuracy of DGV  because the reliabilities of DEBV are high. However  in beef cattle  for which the reliabilities of DEBV are usually low (less than 0.70  Table )  these correlations typically underestimate the accuracy of DGV due to the contribution of environmental effects and random error to the DEBV. In some studies  the correlation between the DGV and the response variable is divided by the square root of the average reliability of the response variable [  ] to adjust for the underestimation of the accuracy. However  this adjustment does not consider the heterogeneous error variance that is associated with DEBV when they have different reliabilities in the validation animals  which may lead to bias. Saatchi et al. [] standardized the covariance between DGV and DEBV by an estimate of the genetic variance to estimate the accuracy of DGV in American Angus beef cattle. In this study  estimates of genetic variance were not available to apply that method. Instead  the estimate of the genetic correlation of a trait with its DGV was used to estimate the accuracy of DGV  as the square of these correlations represents the proportion of genetic variance accounted for by the genomic information if the DGV has heritability 1. In general  the DGV accuracies obtained here are lower than those reported for dairy cattle for traits with similar heritabilities [    ]. Saatchi et al. [] also reported that accuracies of DGV using the BovineSNP50 BeadChip were lower in Angus beef cattle than in dairy cattle. One reason is that the accuracies of EBV (used to derive the DEBV response variable) are lower in beef cattle than in dairy cattle because of a less extensive use of artificial insemination in beef bulls having fewer progeny with production records [  ]. Estimates of SNP effects and resulting DGV will be more accurate as the accuracies of EBV (or DEBV) increase  because the response variable will be closer to the TBV. In dairy cattle  the accuracies of DEBV in the training set are much higher than in beef cattle and the number of animals with high accuracy DEBV is greater. The average accuracy of the EBV for traits studied by Su et al. [] was 0.89  compared to 0.57 and 0.52 in our Limousin and Simmental populations. The size of training population is an important factor affecting the accuracies of DGV []  which is typically higher in dairy than beef cattle [    ]. Furthermore  it has been common for dairy cattle studies to validate DGV on progeny []  and progeny are more highly related to the training population than the situation we have created here with K-means clustering. Also  different extents and patterns of LD have been reported for beef and dairy cattle [  ]  which could contribute to the lower accuracy of DGV reported here. The different approaches used to measure the DGV accuracies could also explain these differences. Estimates of variances and of covariances between traits and their respective DGV obtained in this study indicate that the heritabilities of the DGV were 1 for most traits in both the Limousin and Simmental population. Heritabilities of 1 are expected for perfectly inherited attributes  such as SNP genotypes or linear functions of SNP genotypes. However  heritabilities less than 1 (ranging from 0.75 to 0.95) were estimated in Angus cattle using a similar K-means clustering and cross-validation approach []. In that study  the complete numerator relationship matrix among individuals of all clustered groups was used in the bivariate animal model  rather than a matrix with zero covariances between animals that are in different groups. By using the full relationship matrix  the heritability of the DGV was underestimated in [] because the linear functions that predict DGV were different for each group. Using the complete numerator relationship matrix also resulted in estimates of the trait heritability from bivariate analyses to be biased downwards ([]) compared to the values used in national evaluations ([]  Table ). This downwards bias was removed when the DEBV were used to estimate heritability in a single trait model  i.e. ignoring the correlated DGV. Setting the relationships between animals in different groups to zero results in the derivative of the likelihood function being pooled from the derivatives of the likelihood functions that would be obtained from separate analysis of each group. Furthermore  when setting relationships between groups to zero  the heritability of the DGV is depressed only by SNP genotyping errors and the heritability of the DEBV is essentially the same as that obtained from single trait analyses of DEBV. Zeroing relationships between groups results in a block structure to its inverse of the variance-covariance matrix and avoids any cross-products between DEBV used to derive an individual’s DGV and the individual’s DGV. That cross-product introduces some residual covariance between DEBV and DGV but these are assumed zero in the bivariate model used here. We believe that this approach makes better use of the data than could be achieved by estimating the genetic correlation between DEBV and DGV separately in each group and then pooling those estimates. The estimated trait-DGV genetic correlations varied between traits due to different quantities of information and possibly different genetic architectures between the traits (Table ). Hayes et al. [] showed that the accuracy of genomic predictions is higher for traits with a higher proportion of large effect loci than for traits with no loci of large effect. Furthermore  the LD between BovineSNP50 BeadChip loci and QTL could differ between traits and between breeds. The difference in the trait-DGV genetic correlations was relatively small between low and high heritability traits due to the use of DEBV as the response variable  which makes accuracies less dependent on heritability itself and more a function of the EBV accuracies. In general  estimates of trait-DGV genetic correlations were higher in Limousin than in Simmental animals (the averages across traits were 0.55 and 0.50 for Limousin and Simmental  respectively). This may be because registered Limousin animals have a more homogeneous genetic background than the Simmental animals  as the a values between groups were higher for Limousin than for Simmental. Both these US associations allow registration of crossbreds with other beef cattle breeds but upgrading and composite cattle are more common for the American Simmental Association than for the North American Limousin Foundation. The estimated trait-DGV genetic correlations reported here for Limousin and Simmental animals were lower than those reported for Angus beef cattle by Saatchi et al. [] for most traits that were in common in these studies. This could be due to the different selection strategies practiced within Angus compared to Continental breeds or due to differing allele frequencies among the breeds  which could affect the extent of LD between markers and causative genes and consequently the accuracies of DGV. Also  larger training population sizes (about 3570 total genotyped animals) were used in Angus []. Using 1006 Angus animals genotyped with a proprietary 384 SNP panel developed by Igenity (Duluth  GA)  MacNeil et al. [] reported a lower trait-DGV genetic correlation for marbling (0.38) than obtained here in Limousin and Simmental animals (correlations of 0.65 or 0.63  respectively  Table ). The different SNP panels used for the prediction of DGV and different training and validation populations largely explain these differences. In the commercial implementation of genomic prediction in these breeds  training will use all genotyped animals from each breed to predict DGV for selection candidates  which usually are young animals without phenotype records. Thus  higher correlations than reported here are expected due to the larger training dataset sizes (from all genotyped animals) and closer genetic relationships between training and implementation populations. In beef cattle  birth weight is typically the only observation on a young bull at the time of castration when a decision is made to retain the bull. While the animal’s birth weight may contribute to EPD calculated for weaning weight direct and yearling weight in a multi-trait analysis performed before selection  in general  parent average information is the main source of information available for selecting young animals. The efficiencies of selection based on DGV in comparison to selection based on parent average information (Table ) indicate that selection on DGV was more efficient than using parent average information only for some traits. In general  the parent averages used here have higher reliabilities than parent averages that are available at the time of birth of their progeny because they include information on progeny and grandprogeny that would not normally exist at the time of selection. Also  the available parent averages are not adjusted for selection to account for the Bulmer effect. Bijma [] showed that the accuracy of parent average is dramatically reduced by selection  up to a factor of three fold  which is ignored when computing reliabilities in national genetic evaluations. This leads to an underestimation of the efficiency of selection on DGV relative to selection on parent average when the DGV accuracies obtained by cross-validation are compared to parent average accuracies obtained from national genetic evaluation. Reliabilities of parent average are lower and so the efficiencies of selection on DGV versus parent average are higher for non-genotyped young animals  which represent the selection candidates. The distribution of parent average reliabilities exhibits considerable variation within and between traits and therefore there is considerable variation in efficiencies of selection on DGV versus parent average (see Additional file ). Variation in parent average reliabilities within a trait reflects the difference in reliabilities between natural mating sires that have few progeny and AI sires that can have many progeny. Unlike dairy cattle  natural mating is widely used in the beef industry. These factors lead to bimodal distributions of parent average reliabilities for some traits. Even for traits with efficiencies smaller than 1  there are opportunities for selection on DGV at least for that fraction of the population sired by natural mating sires. The proportions of registrations from natural mating sires are about 63% among Limousin calves in 2011 (Bob Weaber  K-State University  personal communication) and about 40% among Simmental calves (Wade Shafer  American Simmental Association  personal communication). This means that there are more benefits from selecting on DGV for breeders who use natural mating sires in their herds. Here  we deliberately tried to minimize the relationship between training and validation set individuals by K-means clustering to establish lower bounds for prediction accuracies. In practice  training will be performed on all genotyped animals and predictions will be implemented in young animals (creating higher genetic relationships between training and validation or implementation sets) and so even higher efficiencies for selecting on DGV are expected. However  parent average information (and/or the animal’s own records) could be blended with DGV information for selecting young animals  for example using a selection index approach []. Saatchi et al. [] combined the DGV and adjusted parent average information in a selection index for 16 traits in Angus beef cattle and showed that the accuracies of blended information are equal or a little higher than the accuracies of the most informative source of information (either DGV or parent average). Progeny testing is a strategy that is commonly used to increase the accuracy of the predicted genetic merit of selection candidates but it increases generation intervals from 2.5 years when using DGV to about 5.5 years []. Furthermore  progeny testing increases the cost of breeding operations and in cattle is practically limited only to males  which potentially can have many progeny  while DGV can be obtained for females with the same accuracies as for males. The availability of DGV creates new opportunities for both commercial Limousin and Simmental producers to identify superior animals in their herds. To date  this opportunity has been limited to seed stock animals enrolled in performance-recording programs. The beef industry will continue to need to record phenotypes to retrain genomic predictions for which accuracies will otherwise erode in successive generations [  ]. This study applied genomic prediction to US Limousin and Simmental beef cattle. By minimizing the genetic relationships between training and validation groups using K-means clustering  lower bounds for the accuracy of genomic predictions were established based on the genetic correlation between the trait and its DGV. Estimates ranged from 0.39 to 0.76 in Limousin and from 0.29 to 0.65 in Simmental cattle. The efficiency of selection based on DGV in comparison to selection based on parent average information for genotyped animals ranged from 0.68 to 1.28 in Limousin and from 0.51 to 1.44 in Simmental cattle. However  these efficiencies are likely to be significantly underestimated because estimates of the accuracies of parent averages used in this retrospective study are higher than those that are generally available at the birth of selection candidates and are higher than those adjusted for the effects of selection. The reliabilities of parent average were lower for non-genotyped young animals  and the efficiencies of selection on DGV versus parent average were higher and ranged from 0.60 to 2.04 in Simmental calves. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing DGV for Limousin and Simmental beef cattle and indicate that greater genetic responses can be achieved through the use of DGV in comparison to parent average information for at least some traits in that fraction of the population sired by natural mating. Both Limousin and Simmental breeders will benefit from using DGV information to increase genetic progress in their populations.

"Compatibility of pedigree-based and marker-based relationship matrices for single-step genetic evaluation"	"Authors: Ole F Christensen"	"Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics  Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics  Aarhus University  Blichers Allé 20  P.O. BOX 50  DK  8830  Tjele  DenmarkOle F Christensen"	"No Co-Author"	"3 December 2012"	"BackgroundSingle-step methods provide a coherent and conceptually simple approach to incorporate genomic information into genetic evaluations. An issue with single-step methods is compatibility between the marker-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals and the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Therefore  it is necessary to adjust the marker-based relationship matrix to the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Moreover  with data from routine evaluations  this adjustment should in principle be based on both observed marker genotypes and observed phenotypes  but until now this has been overlooked. In this paper  I propose a new method to address this issue by 1) adjusting the pedigree-based relationship matrix to be compatible with the marker-based relationship matrix instead of the reverse and 2) extending the single-step genetic evaluation using a joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed marker genotypes. The performance of this method is then evaluated using two simulated datasets.ResultsThe method derived here is a single-step method in which the marker-based relationship matrix is constructed assuming all allele frequencies equal to 0.5 and the pedigree-based relationship matrix is constructed using the unusual assumption that animals in the base population are related and inbred with a relationship coefficient  and an inbreeding coefficient /2. Taken together  this  parameter and a parameter that scales the marker-based relationship matrix can handle the issue of compatibility between marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices. The full log-likelihood function used for parameter inference contains two terms. The first term is the REML-log-likelihood for the phenotypes conditional on the observed marker genotypes  whereas the second term is the log-likelihood for the observed marker genotypes.

An issue with single-step methods is compatibility between the marker-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals and the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Therefore  it is necessary to adjust the marker-based relationship matrix to the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Moreover  with data from routine evaluations  this adjustment should in principle be based on both observed marker genotypes and observed phenotypes  but until now this has been overlooked. In this paper  I propose a new method to address this issue by 1) adjusting the pedigree-based relationship matrix to be compatible with the marker-based relationship matrix instead of the reverse and 2) extending the single-step genetic evaluation using a joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed marker genotypes. The performance of this method is then evaluated using two simulated datasets. The method derived here is a single-step method in which the marker-based relationship matrix is constructed assuming all allele frequencies equal to 0.5 and the pedigree-based relationship matrix is constructed using the unusual assumption that animals in the base population are related and inbred with a relationship coefficient  and an inbreeding coefficient /2. Taken together  this  parameter and a parameter that scales the marker-based relationship matrix can handle the issue of compatibility between marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices. The full log-likelihood function used for parameter inference contains two terms. The first term is the REML-log-likelihood for the phenotypes conditional on the observed marker genotypes  whereas the second term is the log-likelihood for the observed marker genotypes. Analyses of the two simulated datasets with this new method showed that 1) the parameters involved in adjusting marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices can depend on both observed phenotypes and observed marker genotypes and 2) a strong association between these two parameters exists. Finally  this method performed at least as well as a method based on adjusting the marker-based relationship matrix. Using the full log-likelihood and adjusting the pedigree-based relationship matrix to be compatible with the marker-based relationship matrix provides a new and interesting approach to handle the issue of compatibility between the two matrices in single-step genetic evaluation. Single-step methods for genetic evaluation [–] have recently become popular because they provide an approach to incorporate genomic information into genetic evaluations that is both coherent and conceptually simple. A single-step method extends the usual pedigree-based method by replacing the additive relationship matrix constructed from pedigree by an additive relationship matrix that combines the marker-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals with the pedigree-based relationship matrix. An issue with a single-step method is compatibility between the marker-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals and the pedigree-based relationship matrix [–]. To handle this problem  it is necessary to determine which allele frequencies should be used in the marker-based relationship matrix and to adjust this matrix to the pedigree-based relationship matrix. In theory  one should use the allele frequencies in the founder population of the pedigree (base animals) for the marker-based and pedigree-based relationships to be compatible  but these allele frequencies are rarely available in practice since base animals are not genotyped. Chen et al. [] and Forni et al. [] concluded that using the observed allele frequencies improved accuracy of prediction compared to using allele frequencies equal to 0.5. Studies on how to adjust the marker-based relationship matrix to be compatible with the submatrix of the pedigree-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals have been reported [–]. These adjustments consisted of scaling and adding a number to all elements in the marker-based relationship matrix based on equating means of diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the two matrices  and it was demonstrated that accuracy of prediction increased and bias decreased. In relation to this problem of compatibility between marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices  with data from routine evaluations  selection affects the allele frequencies over time  and in principle both observed marker genotypes and observed phenotypes contain information about allele frequencies in the base population. Therefore  studies on the adjustment of the marker-based relationship matrix to the pedigree-based relationship matrix have overlooked the fact that it should in principle incorporate information on observed phenotypes. This work explores two possibilities to solve the problem  i.e. 1) in which the pedigree-based relationship matrix is adjusted to the marker-based relationship matrix and 2) in which the single-step genetic evaluation is extended by using a joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed marker genotypes. This results in a single-step method in which the marker-based relationship matrix is constructed assuming all allele frequencies are equal to 0.5 and the pedigree-based relationship matrix is constructed using the unusual assumption that animals in the base population are related and inbreed with a relationship coefficient  and an inbreeding coefficient <U+2009>/<U+2009>2. The log-likelihood function used for parameter inference contains two terms. The first term is the REML-log-likelihood for the phenotypes conditional on the observed marker genotypes and the second term is the log-likelihood for the observed marker genotypes. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using two simulated datasets. This section presents  first  the statistical model on which the single-step methods are based along the lines of Christensen and Lund []  then the proposal on how to adjust the pedigree-based relationship matrix and finally the adjustment of the marker-based relationship matrix as previously used. The marker genotypes are summarised into a marker matrix   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>-1  0 or 1 if SNP  of individual  is 11  12  or 22  respectively. In the following  capital  and lowercase  indicate whether marker genotypes are considered as random variables or as non-random variables (observed variables or integration variables)  respectively. Let us consider the simple model where  is the vector of phenotypes   is the general mean   is a vector of ones   is the vector of breeding values   is an incidence matrix  and  is the vector of residual errors. The breeding value may be decomposed into <U+2009>=<U+2009> +   where  is the vector of genomic effects and <U+2009>=<U+2009>(<U+2009>-<U+2009>) is the vector of residual polygenic effects. The residual polygenic effects   where matrix  is the pedigree-based additive relationship matrix and  [0;1] is the relative weight on the residual polygenic effect. The genomic values   with   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>(  …   ) with  being the allele frequency for the  th marker and  with  being defined below. The model for the marker genotypes is that  is a multivariate Gaussian distribution with where <U+2009>=<U+2009> is a parameter and  for <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>. The crude assumption that the multivariate distribution is Gaussian is crucial in the derivation  whereas the unrealistic assumption that  for <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009> is made for simplicity. Dividing marker genotypes  into observed marker genotypes  and un-observed marker genotypes   the joint marginal density of observed phenotypes  and observed marker genotypes  is where By rearranging terms and using that   this becomes where () is defined implicitly. The first term () is the density for the phenotypes given the observed marker genotypes  whereas the second term () is the multivariate Gaussian density for the observed marker genotypes. Single-step methods are based on the density ()  which may be written (see []) as where the vector  has a mean zero and a variance-covariance matrix  with inverse with  = (1<U+2009>-<U+2009>)() +  . In the above formula  the sub-division is made according to genotyped and non-genotyped animals. The matrices  and  are the marker-based relationship matrix for the genotyped animals and the submatrix of the pedigree-based relationship matrix corresponding to genotyped animals  respectively. The sparse structure of the matrix in equation () is the corner-stone for efficient computing using a single-step method. Assuming that  is Gaussian distributed  mixed model equations can be solved for BLUP predictions and AI-REML [] provides REML parameter estimates. Issues raised by the single-step method are 1) how are the allele frequencies  that are used in () obtained and 2) how is the required compatibility between () and  that is evident in equation () reached. To investigate these issues  the joint density of observed phenotypes and marker genotypes  (  )<U+2009>=<U+2009>()()  is taken as the starting point. From this  the full marginal log-likelihood becomes where  for fixed    and  is the single-step REML-log-likelihood for the phenotypes conditional on the observed marker genotypes  and with  denoting the number of genotyped animals  is the log-likelihood of the observed marker genotypes. Thus  the parameter  enters into both terms of the full log-likelihood in equation ()  and this implies that estimation of allele frequencies  should be in principle based on this log-likelihood. In particular  if selection has been performed the phenotypes will contain information about the allele frequencies which may cause bias if ignored. However  estimating  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>() by maximising  for all parameters jointly is not feasible in practice since  is a very high-dimensional parameter. Instead  in general the observed marker genotypes are used to estimate  and then they are plugged into   and this log-likelihood is used to estimate the remaining parameters. Estimation of  based on observed marker genotypes may consist of simply using the observed allele frequencies [  ]  or may be done by maximising ( ) as a function of  (this is essentially the method of Gengler et al. []  although  for computational reasons  that method adds a small residual error to the distribution of ). The high-dimensional parameter  also enters into both terms of the full log-likelihood  although it only enters into  via the scaling parameter <U+2009>=<U+2009>()  and therefore estimation of  should also be in principle based on maximising the full log-likelihood. Usually  estimating  is based on the observed marker genotypes  either using   implying  as in [  ]  or using  such that the average diagonal of  equals the average diagonal of  as in []. Furthermore  it has been demonstrated that the accuracy of prediction is improved and bias is reduced by adjusting the marker-based relationship matrix as () +  where  and  are based on the elements in () and ; further details are given below. It should be noted that such an adjustment is based on observed marker genotypes only  and lacks a theoretical justification within the framework considered here. To summarise  the allele frequencies in () and the adjustments necessary for the compatibility of () and  should be in principle derived based on both observed marker genotypes and observed phenotypes. Furthermore  when computing BLUP breeding values  with plugged-in parameter estimates  the uncertainty in these parameters estimates is ignored  which is an important issue in the case of the high-dimensional parameter . Alternatively  uncertainty in parameter estimates may be incorporated into the predictions by using a Bayesian approach. Demonstration that a Bayesian approach with prior distributions on  and  results in an method in which the pedigree-based relationship matrix is adjusted to a marker-based relationship matrix  is presented below. The derivation of the proposed adjustment of the pedigree-based relationship matrix is based on assigning priors on the high-dimensional parameters  and  in the previously described single-step model  and then considers the first and second order moments of the marginal distribution of (integrating  and ). Appendix A shows that the resulting marker distribution satisfies with   <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  …      being a parameter  and  when <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>. Matrix  is an additive relationship matrix that satisfies the usual recursions but with the peculiar feature that base animals in the pedigree are related and inbred. Within the population of base animals  the relationship coefficient is  and the inbreeding coefficient is <U+2009>/<U+2009>2. Table  contains data for a small pedigree used to derive matrix  as shown in Table . The mean and variance-covariance structure of  shown above is of the form in []  with scaling parameter   and hence the breeding values  have a combined relationship matrix   where the inverse is with . This construction is a single-step method for which the individuals in the base population are related and inbred  and the marker-based relationship matrix    has allele frequencies equal to 0.5. Based on the derivation above (see also Appendix A)  the full marginal log-likelihood function for parameter inference becomes where  for fixed    and  is the single-step REML-log-likelihood for the phenotypes conditional on the observed marker genotypes  with marker-based relationship matrix  and pedigree-based relationship matrix   and is the log-likelihood of the observed marker genotypes. Using the log-likelihood in equation () instead of the log-likelihood in equation () makes the estimation of parameters feasible in practice by numeric maximization methods since the high-dimensional parameters  and  are replaced by two parameters  a parameter  that determines the relationship and inbreeding of individuals in the base population and a parameter  that scales the marker-based relationship matrix. The computations require algorithms that compute () and () efficiently. Computations of inbreeding coefficients with related base animals have been considered by [  ] in the context of incomplete pedigrees. In Appendix B  algorithms are presented that extend the approaches of Quaas [] for computing  and of Colleau [] for computing  to the case where base animals are related and inbred. Maximisation of the full log-likelihood in equation () is done by first specifying a discrete three-dimensional grid of values for parameters  and then  for each value of   computing the maximum values of the log-likelihood  and the log-likelihood of observed marker genotypes . This provides a three-dimensional profile log-likelihood   which can then be assessed to find the maximum. For faster computing  an alternative to using the full log-likelihood is to determine parameters  and  based on observed marker genotypes only  i.e. by maximising   and to estimate the remaining parameter based on  for a grid of values for   with estimates of  and  plugged in. Setting the derivative of  with respect to  equal to zero gives which has the solution Substituting  into equation ()  we obtain which has to be maximised numerically to estimate . Alternatively  an adjustment of the form <U+2009>=<U+2009>  +  is used  where  is the marker-based relationship matrix with allele frequencies  equal to the observed ones and scaling parameter   and parameters  and  are determined by fitting  to . This adjustment was used by VanRaden []  Christensen et al. [] and Gao et al. []  with the first paper suggesting that  and  should be estimated by least square estimation  i.e. by minimizing the sum of squares of   + <U+2009>-<U+2009> and the other two papers suggesting that they should be to estimated by equating means of diagonal elements and all elements in the two matrices. Here  the later is applied and  and  are estimated by solving the two equations for  and   where  and  denote means of all elements in the two matrices  and  and  denote means of diagonal elements in the two matrices. This example is deliberately simple and very extreme  and constructed for the purpose of showing that parameter estimates of  and  can depend on the observed phenotypes. The base population consists of two individuals  one sire and one dam with 15 bi-allelic markers  and their genotypes are simulated assuming independence between markers and with equal allele frequencies. Furthermore  it is assumed that the markers are independently inherited  are all QTL with allele substitution effect equal to 1  and heritability of the phenotype is equal to 1. The two base individuals produce 100 offspring (generation 1) that all have observed phenotypes. The two individuals in generation 1 with the largest own phenotype value are selected as parents and produce 100 offspring (generation 2) that are all genotyped. Two different approaches to estimate parameters are compared. In the first approach  all parameters are estimated using the full log-likelihood in equation (). In the second approach   and  are estimated based only on the log-likelihood of the observed marker genotypes in equation ()  and the remaining parameters are estimated based on the REML-log-likelihood   with estimates of  and  plugged-in. This example is inspired by a pig nucleus breeding scheme and consists of five generations in which all animals have recorded phenotypes. In each generation  150 boars are mated to 1 500 sows to produce 15 000 offspring (50/50 males/females). For the next generation  boars with a high own phenotype value are chosen and sows are selected at random. The last three generations of selected boars are genotyped and a sixth generation of 300 candidate boars are also genotyped. The breeding value is the sum of 500 independent QTL effects simulated from a Gamma(5.4 0.42) distribution  and the heritability of the phenotype is 0.22. This dataset is described in more detail in Christensen and Lund []. Three different approaches are compared. In the first approach  all parameters are estimated using the full log-likelihood in equation (). In the second approach  parameters  and  are estimated based only on the log-likelihood of the observed marker genotypes in equation ()  and the remaining parameters are estimated based on the REML-log-likelihood   with estimates of  and  plugged in. Finally  the G-adjust approach is used for which  and  are estimated using equation () and the remaining parameters are estimated by . For all three approaches  the correlation between predicted breeding value  and true breeding value  for the candidate boars is reported as well as the estimated regression coefficient (reg) for the regression of  on   where deviation from one indicates bias. Table  shows that both  and  were smaller when estimated with the full log-likelihood than with the log-likelihood of the observed marker genotypes. Table  shows that  and  were slightly smaller when estimated with the full log-likelihood than with the log-likelihood of the observed marker genotypes. Parameter  was about 0.375 whether estimated with the full log-likelihood or with the log-likelihood   with parameter estimates of  and  from  plugged-in. When presented in three dimensions  the profile log-likelihood showed a very weak association between  and . A contour plot of the profile log-likelihood surface for  and  is shown in Figure  and the profile log-likelihood function for  is shown in Figure .

The profile log-likelihood function for parameter  based on the full log-likelihood in equation (); the plot is constructed with values in a discrete grid that have been standardised such that the maximum value is zero. Estimated parameters obtained with the G-adjust approach are also shown in Table   where it should be noted that . In terms of prediction performance  the correlation between predicted and true breeding value and the regression coefficient were 0.536 and 1.17  respectively  in both cases when the pedigree-based matrix was adjusted  but 0.493 and 1.34  respectively  when the G-adjust approach was used. This paper provides a coherent approach to handle the issue of compatibility between pedigree-based and marker-based relationship matrices in single-step genetic evaluation. The approach is computationally fast and feasible for large datasets  as is the case for previously developed single-step methods. Parameter  can adjust the pedigree-based relationship matrix to the marker-based relationship matrix that is scaled by parameter   and these two parameters should in principle be estimated using the full log-likelihood for observed phenotypes and observed marker genotypes. This is computationally feasible by computing the full log-likelihood values for parameters    and  in a three-dimensional grid. However  in practice this can be computationally burdensome and an appealing alternative is to estimate  and  based on the observed marker genotypes only. Analysis of simulated datasets  shows that the estimates of parameters  and  depend on the observed phenotypes as well as on the observed marker genotypes  although this dependence is not too large. A conjecture is that in a scenario with a small number of genotyped animals it is more important to use the full log-likelihood than in a scenario with a large number of genotyped animals. Based on these two simulated datasets only  no general conclusion can be made and further studies are needed to determine in which scenarios it would be safe to base inference on a two-step procedure in which  and  are estimated based on the observed marker genotypes only  and the remaining parameters are then estimated by the log-likelihood of the phenotypes conditional on the observed marker genotypes. Using the approach developed in this paper may also provide insight on performance of other approaches for making marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices compatible in single-step genetic evaluation. Examples of such approaches are the adjustments of the marker-based relationship matrix reported in [–    ] and also investigated here  and the approach by Meuwissen et al. []. In []  first  an average of position specific identical by descent matrices based on linkage information [] (hereafter denoted ) were used instead of the combined relationship matrix (1)  and second  the final method consisted of replacing the pedigree-based relationship matrix  by the matrix  in matrix (1) and then adjusting the marker-based relationship matrix to the  matrix. Based on simple simulated datasets  without selection  the method resulted in high accuracy and low bias. The computation of  is computationally burdensome and therefore this approach was not considered here. It should be noted that for these other approaches  the combined relationship matrix is constructed based on observed marker genotypes only  and the inference on remaining parameters is based on the log-likelihood conditional on the observed marker genotypes. The approach in this paper may provide guidelines on when it is safe to base inference on such procedures in which  first the observed marker genotypes are used to construct a combined relationship matrix  and second the remaining inference is based on the log-likelihood for the phenotypes conditional on observed marker genotypes. Evaluation of accuracy and bias of prediction with the simulated dataset 2 shows that the approaches based on adjusting the pedigree-based relationship matrix  where  and reg<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.17  seem to perform better than the G-adjust approach  where  and reg<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.34. However   is also larger in the second case (0.60) than in the first case (0.375). If  is set at 0.375 in the second case then   which is close to the value in the first case  but reg is somewhat larger  i.e. 1.30. If  is set at 0.1  then  and reg<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.00 in the first case  and  and reg<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.12 in the second case  and if  is set at 0.01  then  and reg<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.05 in the second case. Thus  the first two approaches seem to perform better in terms of estimating a more proper  and have somewhat less bias  while accuracy is similar for all three approaches. This paper suggests that the pedigree-based relationship matrix should be adjusted instead of the marker-based relationship matrix. On the one hand  from a practical point of view this would be rather inconvenient since standard software used for REML estimation and BLUP would have to be modified  but on the other hand  it is conceptually simpler and may be easier to extend. For example  when the population consists of a mixture of breeds  it may be simpler to extend the approach in this paper and specify a parametric structure on the relationships of the animals in the base population and estimate those parameters  instead of developing an appropriate way of adjusting the marker-based relationship matrix of the genotyped animals across breeds. An additional issue is the interpretation of the genetic variance parameter . The parameter estimates in Table  are  when    when   and  for G-adjust  where base animals are unrelated  i.e. <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. This may seem counter-intuitive since the variance of breeding values for a base animal is . However  when studying the inverse relationship matrix   then the averages of diagonal elements are 3.807  3.809 and 2.93 for the three cases  respectively  and since 3.807/6.507  3.809/6.512 and 2.93/5.084 are roughly the same  the parameter estimates actually make good sense  although the interpretation of  is unclear. Finally  it should be noted that parameter  could influence to some extent accuracy and bias of prediction  and neither <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 nor  estimated to make marker-based and pedigree-based relationships compatible  would be optimal for that purpose. Adjusting the pedigree-based relationship instead of the marked-based relationship matrix to make the two matrices compatible in a single-step method is an interesting alternative. For the simulated dataset 1  the estimate of the relative polygenic weight  was about 0  as was expected since in the simulation the markers were assumed to capture all the genetic variation. However  for the simulated dataset 2   was large when adjusting the pedigree-based relationship matrix  i.e. 0.375  and even larger  i.e. 0.60  when the G-adjust approach was used. For the second dataset  the prediction biases were reduced when  was set at 0.1. This poses the question whether it is actually possible to estimate  at a reasonable value from data  or whether  should be determined manually to control the bias. It should be noted that confidence intervals of this parameter are large in these examples and further studies are needed. Using the full log-likelihood and adjusting the pedigree-based relationship matrix to be compatible with the marker-based relationship matrix provides a new and interesting approach to handle the issue of compatibility between the two matrices in single-step genetic evaluation. The derivation of the proposed adjustment of the pedigree-based relationship matrix is based on assigning priors on the high-dimensional parameters  and  in the previously described single-step model. This derivation is presented here. The model for the marker genotypes    given the allele frequencies  and variances   is as in []  where <U+2009>=<U+2009> is a parameter and  for <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>. Prior distributions for  and  are not specified explicitly  only the necessary assumptions are stated. Assuming that the alleles are randomly labeled 1 and 2  then a priori the expected allele frequency is E[]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5. Additional assumptions are that <U+2009>=<U+2009>Var[] and <U+2009>=<U+2009>E[] do not depend on   and that  for <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>. With these prior distributions  a marginal distribution of  may be obtained by integrating  and . Using well-known formulas for conditional expectations and covariances  the mean and covariances become Defining   and <U+2009>=<U+2009>4<U+2009>/<U+2009>(2 + )  we obtain with . It is not difficult to see that  satisfies the usual recursions for an additive relationship matrix. Requiring that 0<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>1 is equivalent to making a further assumption that 2<U+2009><<U+2009> (this is for example satisfied when ] 0;1 and [<U+2009>=<U+2009>2(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>)  where <U+2009>=<U+2009>1/12 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1/3). The first and second order moments of  are therefore of the form considered in []  with pedigree-based relationship matrix   allele frequencies   scaling parameter  with  not depending on   and marker-based relationship matrix . Note that the random labelling of alleles as 1 or 2 is not important because the resulting expression does not depend on how alleles are labelled. Using   the log-likelihood for the observed marker genotypes becomes This log-likelihood may also be viewed as the log-likelihood for  being Wishart distributed . The aim here is to present algorithms for computing  and  by recursions. Computations of inbreeding coefficients with related based animals were considered by [  ]. For simplicity  let’s assume that  either both parents are known or both parents are unknown. This is not an important restriction in practice  since the case with one unknown parent can be handled by assigning an artificial animal-id to this unknown parent and by letting both its parents be unknown. Let us partition matrix  (skipping the dependence on  in the notation from now and onwards) according to whether the animals are base animals (both parents unknown) or not Similar to the usual  matrix (see []) a decomposition exists where  is a lower triangular matrix with entries <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  <U+2009>=<U+2009>( + )<U+2009>/<U+2009>2 when  has known parents () and () and <U+2009>><U+2009>  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 otherwise (<U+2009>><U+2009> or  has unknown parents)  and  is a diagonal matrix containing the variance of the Mendelian sampling part for matrix   i.e. . Comparing this decomposition to the decomposition for the usual  matrix  then matrix  has replaced an identity matrix and  has replaced a diagonal matrix containing the Mendelian sampling terms related to  for the animals with known parents. The inverse matrix becomes Here  is a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal and the only non-zero elements being -1<U+2009>/<U+2009>2 for offspring-parent entries  and matrix  has diagonal elements equal to (1 + (-3/2))<U+2009>/<U+2009>((1-/2)(1 + (-1/2))) and off-diagonal elements equal to -<U+2009><U+2009>/<U+2009>((1<U+2009>-<U+2009><U+2009>/<U+2009>2)(1 + (<U+2009>-<U+2009>1<U+2009>/<U+2009>2)))  where  is the dimension of . A procedure to obtain the diagonal of  and the inverse  can be constructed similar to the algorithm by Quaas []  which utilises the form  where Matrix  is a lower triangular matrix such that . First  matrix  is computed and  is set to 1 + <U+2009>/<U+2009>2 for the base animals. Second  the remaining part of the algorithm is the same as in Quaas []  where recursively  rows in  are computed using  and . Obtaining  at the same time is done by first setting elements in  for base animals equal to the elements in   and then adding elements to  in the usual way (assuming a half-stored format  add  to the ( ) element  add  to the ( ()) and ( ()) elements  and add  to the (() ())  (() ()) and (() ()) elements). Matrix  can be obtained by a modification of the Colleau algorithm [    ] by using an algorithm to compute   where  is a vector. The product of matrix  and vector  is Therefore  an algorithm (with notation similar to that in Appendix A in Misztal et al. []) consists of first computing <U+2009>=<U+2009> by solving the sparse system  for   then computing and finally computing  by solving the sparse system  for .

This tends to produce overly optimistic exclusion power estimates. In this work  we have developed a new formula that gives almost unbiased results at the population level. Parentage assignment using genomic markers  usually microsatellites  is now widely used for research on population ecology and evolution[]  as well as in selective breeding  particularly for aquatic species. Indeed  maintaining pedigrees for these species is a challenge because of the very small size of individuals at hatching  which prevents physical tagging[]. When developing a marker set for parentage assignment  it is important to be able to predict the assignment efficiency from  data. Exclusion probabilities are easily calculated from allele frequencies and are commonly used to quantify the efficiency of individual markers for parentage assignment. The most frequently used exclusion probability is the probability to exclude a random parent pair that is unrelated to the individual tested (named  in[]  here  for each locus ). Since a single locus is generally not sufficient to exclude all potential parent pairs  several loci have to be combined to reach an appropriate combined exclusion probability   which is calculated as the product of the individual non-exclusion probabilities of all  loci: Then  the combined exclusion probability is raised to the power of the total number of potential parental pairs to be excluded. With  possible parent pairs (including the correct one)  this number is -1  and the probability to have all parent pairs excluded except the correct one is the theoretical probability of having a unique assignment[  ]: However  experience shows that the predicted assignment rates using this formula are often too optimistic  especially in factorial designs  i.e. when the mating structure is unknown and thus all possible mother-father combinations must be taken into consideration[  ]. It is then necessary to make two assumptions when applying formulae (1) and (2)  i.e. (i) exclusion of the -1 incorrect parent pairs represents -1 independent tests and (ii) all excluded parents are unrelated to the offspring  which justifies the use of probability . However  in practice  these assumptions are never met. While the lack of independence between tests does not prevent formula (2) to yield good approximations[]  the second problem is generally overlooked. The most commonly encountered situation is when offspring are collected from a population that has a number of potential parents. The mating structure may be known (in some farmed populations) or not (in the wild or in farmed populations where parents are allowed to mate “naturally”). The practical aim of such studies is to identify the true parent pair of every genotyped offspring that derives from the sampled parents  which means excluding all parent pairs except the true one. Except in very specific cases where only single pair matings occur according to a perfectly known mating structure  the sole use of  is disqualified because some potential half-sib families will have to be excluded. This is especially true when no mating structure is assumed (all mother-father combinations are considered possible  as in Figure) and thus the half-sib families cannot be considered to be unrelated to the correct family under consideration. The general approach is to exclude all mother-father combinations other than the true one  without taking a mating structure into account since  in most cases  the aim is to establish or check the mating structure.  Types of family relationships to be excluded for an offspring with  potential mothers and  potential fathers; black = true family of an offspring; grey =  -1 families that share the same mother and  -1 families that share the same father  that have to be excluded; white = ( -1)( -1) pairs of parents that are unrelated to the true parents and that also have to be excluded.  nother exclusion probability  was initially proposed by Jamieson[] to calculate the probability to exclude one parent when the other parent is known  which is relevant to the exclusion of parents from half-sib families sharing one parent with the correct family. Probabilities  and  can be calculated for each locus with the following formulae[]: with and  the frequency of the  allele of locus  in the population. Combined probabilities over all loci   and  can be calculated with formula (1). Then  the combined probability of having a unique assignment among parent pairs that share one parent with the true parental pair is: while the probability of having a unique assignment among unrelated parent pairs is: Since the probability of having a unique assignment requires having both unique assignments within related pairs and within unrelated pairs  the global probability of having a unique assignment (also named exclusion power) is: It is then clear that the probability of having a unique assignment decreases exponentially as the number of potential parents increases  as already underlined by Wang []. However  the rate of decrease depends on whether term  or term  in formula (7) is most influential. Dodds et al.[] have already shown that  is always greater than  for a given locus regardless of the allelic frequencies[]. In the work reported here  we studied the relative importance of  and  using idealized loci  with three  five or eight equally frequent alleles. Individual  values were 0.370 for a locus with three alleles  0.595 for a locus with five alleles and 0.743 for a locus with eight alleles  while the values for  were 0.519 for a locus with three alleles  0.772 with five alleles and 0.898 with eight alleles. In most cases  these values reflect microsatellites with low  moderate or high variability. As shown in Figure  in general a larger number of loci were needed for the  term to exceed 0.99 compared to the  term  except for very high numbers of potential families (= 10 for loci with eight alleles  = 10 for loci with five alleles and = 10 for loci with three alleles). The only case in which the  term required more loci than the  term to reach 0.99 was with tri-allelic (low variability) loci and more than 10 potential families. Thus in most cases  and especially when the number of potential families is moderate and the variability of the markers is low or intermediate   will be governed by the  term  contrary to the general view[].  Number of markers to achieve exclusion power greater than 0.99 for both terms in formula (7); white symbols for the  term; black symbols for the  term; squares = loci with three equally frequent alleles; triangles = loci with five equally frequent alleles; circles = loci with eight equally frequent alleles; the situations simulated included  potential fathers and  potential mothers and  thus   families. One important thing to note is that formula (7) does not assume a mating structure. This is because no mother-father combination is excluded  on the basis of pre-existing knowledge about mating structure and  thus  exclusion is performed on the basis of a full factorial design (Figure)  which is the general case when no mating structure is assumed. It may be possible to consider fewer combinations when the mating structure is known and thus  modify the exponents of  and  in formula (7)  but this approach is not recommended since it limits the generality of the estimated assignment power. When comparing our results with those previously reported in the literature[  ]  we found that  except for marker sets with a very low assignment power  formula (7) gives much more accurate results than formula (2) (Table). When assignment power is low  formula (7) tends to underestimate it  making it a conservative estimate. Other problems (linkage between markers  genotyping errors  inbreeding  use of relatives as parents  sampling errors  etc.) may further decrease the assignment power of a marker set but the systematic gap between the assignment power computed with formula (2) and the theoretical one (up to now approached only by simulation) is the main cause of overestimation of the power of marker sets for parentage assignment[]. Since formula (7) is easily computed based on allele frequencies in a spreadsheet  we recommend its use to design marker sets with an appropriate exclusion power.

However  this is often questioned  especially when environment or herd management is wide-ranging. The aim of this study was to assess genotype by environment interactions for production traits (milk  protein  fat yields and fat and protein contents) in French dairy cattle using an original approach to characterize the environments. Genetic parameters of production traits were estimated for three breeds (Holstein  Normande and Montbéliarde) using multiple-trait and reaction norm models. Variables derived from Herd Test Day profiles obtained after a test day model evaluation were used to define herd environment. Multiple-trait and reaction norm models gave similar results. Genetic correlations were very close to unity for all traits  except between some extreme environments. However  a relatively wide range of heritabilities by trait and breed was found across environments. This was more the case for milk  protein and fat yields than for protein and fat contents. No real reranking of animals was observed across environments. However  a significant scale effect exists: the more intensive the herd management for milk yield  the larger the heritability. Two main opportunities are available to improve production traits in dairy cattle: through the modification of herd management and/or the genetic level. Except when it is necessary to choose a local breed for a specific environment (such as the Abondance breed in the French Alps)  these two opportunities are generally considered separately  as in genetic evaluation. Indeed  they imply the absence of genotype by environment (G*E) interactions  i.e.  the breeding value of an animal is assumed to be the same regardless of the environment in which it will be raised. Dealing with this situation  some breeders question the efficiency of current breeding schemes for their own particular management system. Thus  the objective of this study was then to estimate G*E interactions for production traits (milk  protein  fat yields and fat and protein contents) in French dairy cattle. The overall objective was to assess whether these interactions could be an opportunity to better adapt animals to their environment. G*E interaction studies raise three main questions: How to define the genotype? How to describe the environment? Which model to choose in order to estimate G*E interactions? This study used an innovative description of herd environment: Herd Test Day (HTD) profiles  which are by-products of a test day model evaluation. Two models  a multiple-trait and a reaction norm model were tested. The approach consisted of two steps. The first step dealt with the definition of herd environment through HTD profiles. This was done across breeds (Holstein  Normande and Montbéliarde) rather than within breed because two herds with different breeds could share the same type of environment. The second step was a G*E interaction analysis. As genetic evaluations are within breed  G*E parameters were estimated within breed. The methodology used to describe herd environment from HTD profiles was described in[]. The main difference with this previous study is that we worked here with a larger dataset. A short description of the main steps involved and results obtained follows. Herd environments were described through HTD profiles for milk yield  fat and protein contents between 2005 and 2010. HTD profiles represent the evolution of HTD effects over time  as HTD effects are obtained from a test day model evaluation which aims at predicting the breeding value of animals at any day of the lactation period. The test day model uses each test day record available in national databases  in contrast to the 305-day lactation model which relies on the performance of an animal cumulated over 305 days. In order to improve the accuracy of daily breeding value estimation  other factors affecting the performance such as age and month of calving  length of dry period and gestation are estimated over the whole lactation through splines. Similarly  genetic and permanent environment effects throughout the lactation are predicted using continuous functions and the detailed description of the French test day model is given in[]. The HTD effect is independent from all other effects and it estimates the effect of all features common to all cows of the herd on a particular test-day  i.e.  essentially the effect of herd management (feeding  housing) of the test day. Therefore  the HTD effect can be interpreted as the herd management level of a herd on a given test-day. The HTD profile is a continuous function showing changes in HTD effects over time and can be interpreted as the changes in the herd management level over time. In previous studies  genetic evaluation using a test day model was carried out for milk yield and for fat and protein contents on French national data bases  separately for Holstein  Normande and Montbéliarde  the three major dairy breeds. This made it possible to describe herds by their three HTD profiles (milk yield  protein and fat contents) from 2005 to 2010 (see dashed curves in Figure).  [] This figure shows an example of a herd described by its three HTD profiles (for milk yield  and protein and fat contents) before (dashed line) or after (solid line) smoothing. HTD profiles  reflecting changes in HTD effects over time  can be decomposed into a systematic within year change that will be assumed to reveal practices related to the global herd management during the year as in[]  and a deviation from this global component due to specific characteristics (unusual weather conditions  feedstuffs availability  etc.) that cannot be related to regular management activities. Therefore  HTD profiles had to be corrected for these occasional features in order to be used as the definition of the environment in a G*E interaction study. For this purpose  HTD profiles were smoothed to focus on their repeated annual features using a model inspired by the model of Koivula [] and described in[]. Basically  the method consisted of describing HTD profiles by a continuous function involving a linear trend and three sine curves. Examples of HTD profiles before and after smoothing are shown in Figure. Note that in the rest of the study  only herds for which smoothing was obtained with a minimum coefficient of determination were retained (see[] for details). Each HTD profile was then summarized by seven descriptors  as shown in Figure  leading to 21 descriptors (7 descriptors times 3 traits) for each herd. These descriptors were reduced with Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to 10 Principal Components (PC) by retaining all PC that explained more than 4% of the total variance. MFA is similar to principal components analysis  which enables the joint use of categorical and quantitative data[]. The MFA was performed on data from 12 061 Holstein  2 591 Normande and 1 104 Montbéliarde herds. The descriptors were centered within breed in order to correct for breed effects.  [] This figure shows the descriptors of smoothed HTD profiles used in the Multiple Factorial Analysis. The first principal component (PC1  explaining 15% of the total variance) was interpreted as a measure of the specialisation of the herd management; it discriminated herds with herd management favouring high milk production (low PC1 score) from the herds favouring high fat content (high PC1 score). The second PC (13%) was interpreted as a measure of the intensity of production related to herd management; it discriminated herds with high HTD effects for milk yield  and for fat and protein contents (high PC2 score) from herds with low HTD effects for milk yield  fat and protein contents (low PC2 score). Principal component 3 (8%) was interpreted as related to the seasonality of herd management. It differentiated herds for which the range of HTD profiles for the three traits was small (high PC3 score) from those with large ranges (low PC3 score)  that is  PC3 discriminated herds in which herd management led to more or less similar milk yield and composition between seasons from herds in which herd management led to variable milk yield and composition across seasons. The next seven PC explained 46% of the total variance but their interpretation was less intuitive. In total  these 10 first PC explained 76% in HTD effects of the total variance and were mainly related to the mean level of HTD effects and the range of HTD profiles  rather than to periods during which minimum and maximum HTD effect were obtained. Based on the MFA  herd environment was characterized by the 10 PC scores for 15 756 Holstein  Normande and Montbéliarde herds. These PC scores and their interpretations were the basis of the different herd environment definitions that were used to describe G*E interactions. G*E interactions were estimated for the three breeds based on data from two different sets of herds within breed (“paragon” or “diversity”  see below) with two different models (multiple-trait and reaction norm models). For clarity  only analyses and results for the Normande and Holstein breeds  which are respectively a national dual purpose and an international dairy breed  are presented here. The following paragraphs describe the methodology used. Studies on the estimation of G*E interactions require the estimation of genetic parameters  which was carried out within breed (Holstein  Normande). A substantial but not excessively large data set is required for this purpose in order to obtain accurate estimates but limit computation time. Among the 12 061 Holstein and 2 591 Normande available herds  herds used in the G*E interaction study were selected by two strategies. Both were based on the PC scores of the herds. The first strategy consisted in selecting only typical herds for which characteristics were representative of a majority of the French herds  leading to what will be referred hereafter as the “paragon herd data set” (a paragon is regarded as a perfect example of a particular feature). The second strategy aimed at representing the complete diversity of French herds  leading to the “diversity herd data set”. For the first strategy  three herd groups were created using a clustering method based on the first 10 factors of the MFA. Note that this was not a classification approach. See[] for more methodological details. At this stage  each cluster included herds of the three breeds. However  since the G*E analysis was carried out within breed  herd clusters were then defined per breed. Practically  Normande and Holstein herds of cluster 1 in the joint breed dataset were respectively assigned to cluster 1 in the Normande and Holstein datasets  and the same for clusters 2 and 3. These herd clusters were also used as classes for the definition of fixed effects in the reaction norm model. The 400 Normande and 750 Holstein herds that were most representative herds of each cluster  i.e. those nearest to the center of each cluster  were selected as paragons and included in the “paragon dataset”. They are represented in pink  orange and red in Figures and for the Holstein and Normande breeds  respectively. This strategy was primarily used to obtain clearly distinct and well-defined clusters for the G*E interaction estimation by a multiple-trait model. Indeed  defining clusters of herds along a continuum and then choosing the paragons in each cluster forced some level of homogeneity within and heterogeneity between clusters. This increased the power to detect possible G*E interactions with the multiple-trait model. The “paragon dataset” was also used with the reaction norm models in order to compare both models on the same dataset.  This figure shows how Holstein herds from the diversity and paragon datasets were distributed over the first factorial map. Herds in pink  orange and red are the “paragon” herds and depict the three herd clusters used in the multiple-trait model for the paragon dataset.  This figure shows how Normande herds from the diversity and paragon datasets were distributed over the first factorial map. Herds in pink  orange and red are the “paragon” herds and depict the three herd clusters used in the multiple-trait model for the paragon dataset. For the second strategy  the first factorial map (PC 1 and 2 of the MFA) was divided into 25 equal-sized cells. Up to 40 or 60 herds (for the Holstein and Normande breeds  respectively) were selected at random for each cell. This led to two “diversity data sets” containing respectively 539 Holstein and 472 Normande herds (in blue in Figures and  respectively). The traits analysed were 305-day milk  fat and protein yield  as well as 305-day fat and protein contents. Data consisted of first lactations from cows which had a first calving between 2000 and 2011. Records were edited on several criteria: performances deviating by more than three phenotypic standard deviations from the breed average  herds with less than 100 first lactations from 2000 to 2011  records from daughters of bulls with less than three daughters that were located in just one herd were deleted  as well as records from cows which had an age at first calving lower than 23 months or greater than 40 months  or a lactation length lower than 180 days. These steps reduced the size of the datasets. Tables  and show the final number of herds and records used to estimate G*E interactions for the different models  breeds and herd data sets. Two models to estimate G*E interactions were tested: a multiple-trait model  in which the environment was considered to be specific to a group of herds  and a reaction norm model  in which the environment varied continuously as a function of PC scores of the herds. Both were animal models from the perspective of fitting breeding values. The pedigree files contained three generations (see Tables  for the multiple-trait model and Table for the reaction norm model). The only difference between the two models was the modelling of breeding values and additive genetic variance; fixed effects were the same for the two models. All analyses were carried out using the WOMBAT software[]  separately for each trait and breed. A more detailed description of the two models follows: · Multiple-trait model The multiple-trait across country evaluation (MACE)[] can be seen as a G*E analysis for which the environment is country-specific. A given trait (e.g. milk production) recorded in different countries is modelled as distinct traits. Consequently  it is named a multiple-trait model  although a single phenotype is analysed. Using this model  genetic correlations can then be estimated between countries/environments. The model used in this paper mimics the model proposed in[]  in which the environment is defined by herd clusters. It was applied to the paragon datasets of each breed. Environments were defined based on the three herd clusters identified in the first strategy of herd selection (basis of the “paragons herd data set”). These are shown in pink  orange and red in Figures and for the Holstein and Normande breeds  respectively. Tables and summarize the average performances for these three herd clusters in the paragon dataset for the Hosltein and the Normande breed respectively. The multiple-trait model was: where:  = 305-day first lactation performance of animal  in herd   HerdYear is the fixed effect of Herd-Year class  AgeYearCluster is the fixed effect of Age at calving-Year-herdCluster class  MonthYearCluster is a fixed effect of Month at calving-Year-herdCluster subclass   is the random genetic effect of cow  in the herd cluster   and is the random residual effect. Note that genetic and residual variances were different for each herd cluster. This model showed problems of convergence whatever the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation algorithm used (combinations of options Average Information (AI)  Parameter Expanded (PX) and Expectation Maximisation (EM) of the WOMBAT software[]). Some eigenvalues of the genetic variance/covariance matrix were close to zero  because all genetic correlations estimated between herd clusters were very close to one. Consequently  the following single-trait model was implemented instead: The trait is assumed to be the same genetic trait in each cluster but the model allows for different genetic variances by cluster. The same fixed effects were estimated as in the previous model. Heterogeneous residual variance () by the combination of herd cluster and birth year period was allowed for rather than only by herd cluster. Birth year periods were based on years 2000 to 2002  2003 to 2005  2006 to 2008 and 2009 to 2011. Hence  four residual variances were obtained for each herd cluster; one for each group of three birth years. The mean of these four variances was used as the overall residual variance of the herd cluster. Finally  heritabilities for each herd cluster were calculated as the ratio of the genetic variance to the sum of the genetic and residual variances for that herd cluster. · Reaction norm model In reaction norm models  the additive genetic effect is described as a continuous function of environmental parameters. In this study  PC scores of herds were used as environmental parameters. The reaction norm model was applied both to the “paragon” and “diversity” herd datasets. Table summarizes average performances and environment descriptors (PC scores) for both sets of herds and breeds. The model was : with. The three herd clusters defined in the first herd selection strategy were included as fixed effects subclasses  whereas the breeding value of a cow was estimated as a function of the PC scores of the cow’s own herd  rather than the PC scores of the herd cluster. This study focused on random genetic effects across environments for the estimation of G*E interactions and not on the fixed effects. Using exactly the same fixed effects allowed comparison of estimates of G*E interactions between the single-trait and reaction norm models. Heterogeneous residual variances by group of birth year period (2000 to 2002  2003 to 2005  2006 to 2008 and 2009 to 2011) were estimated. Animal breeding values  were modelled in two parts: one () expressing the animal’s average effect across environments and one () that depended on the PC scores of the animal’s herd  i.e.  on the environment.   is the PC score of herd  on the  axis of the factor analysis.  is the coefficient applied for animal  on the PC score of its herd. Note that linear reaction norms were assumed. Analyses were carried out taking into account the first one  two or three PC scores ( = 1  2 or 3). Within breed and trait  these three models were compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Only results from the best model (the one with the smallest BIC value) will be presented. The estimated covariance matrix (V) of the reaction norm model combined variances and covariances of the random genetics effects    ..   of  for example  milk yield: Genetic variances and covariances for each herd cluster were obtained using the expression  with: A row of matrix  represented one “state” of the environment gradient  i.e. specific values of the environment  described by  PC scores  with  depending on the model. The number of environment states analysed were arbitrarily chosen to be respectively 25 and 625 for models with one or two PC  respectively  to describe the environment. Four residual variances were estimated per breed and trait; one for each of four birth year periods. The mean of these four residual variances was used as the reference residual variance. Finally  heritabilities for each state of the environment were calculated as the ratio of the genetic variance over the genetic plus residual variance for that state of the environment. Genetic correlations between two environment states were calculated as the ratio of the genetic covariance between these two environments to the product of their genetic standard deviations. With the multiple-trait model  environment was described by three herd clusters which represented three types of herd management. They were built based on the first 10 PC scores  summarizing the features of their three HTD profiles. Therefore  herd clusters were built based on production level only due to herd management rather than the global production level (that includes herd management but also genetic effect for example). Thus in the following  the production level must be interpreted as the level of milk yield and protein and fat contents due to herd management only. The interpretation of herd clusters was very similar for both breeds. Tables and show the number of herds in each cluster and means of PC scores in each herd cluster for each breed. Cluster 1 was made up of herds with management that resulted in an average production intensity (mean PC2 score close to zero) but that was more geared towards milk production than towards protein and fat contents (negative PC1 score). The management of the herds in this cluster was rather insensitive to season of production for the Holstein breed (mean PC3 score is positive) but not for the Normande breed (mean PC3 score is negative). Cluster 2 consisted of herds with a higher herd management intensity (high PC2 score) and rather specialised in protein and fat contents (positive PC1 score). Management of herds in this cluster was affected by the season of production for the Normande breed but not for the Holstein breed. Cluster 3 was composed of herds with a low herd management intensity (negative PC2 score). In the multiple-trait model  which had problems of convergence  the smallest genetic correlation was 0.98 for protein content in the Normande breed between cluster 1 and cluster 3. This indicated that there was no reranking of animals across herd clusters  i.e.  environments. The single-trait model assumed that genetic correlations were one between environments but allowed for heterogeneous genetic and residual variances  leading to different heritabilities across herd clusters (Table). Except for fat yield in the Normande breed and fat content in the Holstein breed  heritabilities decreased from cluster 1 to cluster 3  for all traits and breeds: heritabilities were greater for herds with a high herd management intensity that favoured milk production. The largest ranges of heritabilities were found in the Holstein breed (Table): with a decrease in heritability from herd cluster 1 to herd cluster 3 by 15% for milk yield  15% for protein yield  22% for fat yield. In most cases  these decreases in heritability were due to a greater decrease of genetic variance than of residual variance. In conclusion  the multiple-trait model did not reveal evidence of significant reranking of animals between environments. However  although herd clusters in the paragon dataset did not reflect extreme herd managements  heritabilities were found to differ between environments. Reaction norm models were tested using one  two or three PC as environmental parameter(s) within breed  trait and dataset (paragon or diversity herd sets). According to the Bayesian Information Criterion  the best model used only PC1 as environmental parameter (i.e.  herd management specialisation: milk yield versus protein and fat contents) for protein and fat contents  whereas the best models for milk  protein and fat yields used both PC1 and PC2 (herd management specialisation and herd management intensity) as environmental parameters. This was the case for all breeds and both datasets. The first eigenvalue of the covariance matrix (V) that combined variances and covariances of the random genetics effects    ..  (where  = 1 2 3 is the number of PC included as environmental parameters) was very high whatever the breed  trait and dataset. This eigenvalue corresponded mainly to the random genetic effect   which represents the part of the breeding value that does not depend on the environment. This eigenvalue represented a minimum of 99% of the sum of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (V). This was a further argument supporting the quasi absence of G*E interactions for production traits  in terms of reranking. Estimates of residual variances are shown in Table and genetic correlations and heritabilities in Tables and. Note that for these results  only environment states corresponding to herds in the dataset were taken into account. Indeed  Figures and show that some areas defined by PC1 and PC2 included no herds (e.g. in the top left corner of the figures). On average  genetic correlations between environments were very high for all breeds  traits  and datasets (see Table)  supporting again the absence of reranking of animals across environments. Genetic correlations were higher between environments defined for the paragon dataset than between environments defined for the diversity dataset. This was because herds included in the paragon dataset were chosen to reflect herd managements that were common in France. In contrast  the diversity dataset also included herds that represented extreme environments. In the diversity dataset  the average genetic correlations were lower for the Holstein than for the Normande breed. This is due to the fact that the Normande herds available in the study reflected herd managements less extreme than the Holstein herds: the range of their PC scores was narrower than the one for Holstein herds (see Figures and). The lowest genetic correlations were obtained with the diversity dataset for milk  fat and protein yields: between 0.60 and 0.68 for the Holstein breed and between 0.86 and 0.92 for the Normande breed. These correlations were obtained between extreme environments. Although no reranking was shown  heterogeneity of heritabilities was again found for milk  fat and protein yields for both breeds (Table)  demonstrating a scale effect. Since the residual variance was the same across environments within breed  trait and dataset  this was due to a heterogeneity of genetic variances across environments. In contrast  heritabilities for protein and fat contents were more homogeneous across environments. Similar to what was observed for genetic correlations  the range of heritabilities was higher in the diversity dataset than in the paragon dataset and was even higher for the Holstein breed than for the Normande breed. For the yield traits  environment was described simultaneously by two environmental parameters (PC1 and PC2 scores). The shape of heritabilities across environments was the same for all breeds and datasets for milk  protein and fat yields. Figures and show estimates of heritability for milk and fat yield  respectively  for the Holstein breed as functions of the PC1 and PC2 herd scores using the “diversity” dataset. Heritabilities increased with increasing PC1 and PC2 herd scores. This gradient was more important for herd management intensity (PC2) than for herd management specialisation (milk yield versus fat and protein contents  PC1).  This figure shows heritabilities of milk yield calculated from the reaction norm model applied on the Holstein diversity dataset.  This figure shows heritabilities of protein yield estimated from the reaction norm model applied to the Holstein diversity dataset. For clarity  only analyses and results for the Normande and Holstein breeds were presented. However  estimates of G*E interactions in the Montbéliarde breed led to exactly the same conclusions with multiple-trait  single-trait and reaction norm models (results not shown). The aim of this study was to estimate G*E interactions for production traits in the Holstein and Normande breeds in France. Genetic correlations between environments were very close to unity  except between very extreme environments for all breeds  models  and datasets  demonstrating that reranking of animals for production traits across environments does not exist in France. Such a result was previously reported in studies in France that used herd production level as definition of herd environment[] as well as in other studies[–] that used different definitions of the environment. Yet  other studies did report genetic correlations less than one between environments  i.e.  with reranking of animals. These studies dealt with data from different countries[–]  that is  for ranges of environments that were greater than in this national study. Variable genetic variances across environments for production traits were found in this study and have been reported before[  ]. Genetic variances increased with the capacity of the herd management to promote milk production. These results are in agreement with[    ]  in which genetic variances increased with increasing production level. In a G*E interaction study  the definition of the herd environment is crucial. Definitions used in the literature are extremely diverse; they depend on the scale of the study (experimental farm versus national or international studies) and on the traits analysed. In the case of production traits  definition of the herd environment can be based on specific features of the feeding system  such as the level of concentrate in the diet[  ]  grazing severity and silage quality[]  features of the reproduction system  such as the calving system (seasonal or uniform)[]  features of the herd structure  such as herd size[]  features of the climate such  as temperature humidity index[]  rainfall[]  or features of genetic background (percent of Holstein genes)[]. Many studies have described the environment based on observed performances of the animals  such as herd milk production level[  ]  fat and protein yields[]  peak milk yield  or persistency[]. In these cases  environmental and genetic factors are combined. In this study  herd environment was described based on HTD profiles. This definition focuses on the part of the production due to herd management only. This improves the study of G*E interactions because environmental and genetic factors are no longer confounded in the definition of the environment. Moreover  HTD profiles are available from national databases and do not require extra recording  in contrast to many herd management descriptors. Using HTD profiles allows analysis of large datasets. Finally  HTD profiles summarize all impacts of environment on production and offer a general overview of the environment  whereas some other herd management descriptors reduce environment to a limited number of features (temperature  average performances  herd size). Summarizing HTD profiles descriptors by first PC scores allowed correlations between the 21 descriptors to be taken into account and a focus on the main causes of variability among HTD profiles. However  by limiting the analysis to the first PC scores  part of the diversity of HTD profiles that reflect differences in herd management (i.e.  environment diversity) was not accounted for  regardless of the model used (multiple-trait  single-trait or reaction norm model). In fact  the three herd clusters used to describe the environment in the multiple-trait model were built based on the first 10 PC scores only  which explained about 76% of the total variance in HTD profiles. Moreover  we selected paragon herds for each cluster  which reduced the within-environment diversity. For the reaction norm models  the environment was described only through one or two PC scores. This may seem reductive but reaction norm models based on three PC scores gave poorer goodness of fit in terms of the BIC. The models that were used to estimate G*E interactions were animal models with pedigree information over three generations  in contrast with other studies that used simpler models such as sire models[  ] or sire-maternal grand sire models[]. Two types of models were tested: multiple-trait and reaction norm models. A drawback of multiple-trait models is that they require classification of environments  which cannot represent the full diversity of environments. Moreover  in this study  the multiple-trait model was applied to the “paragon” dataset  in which extreme environments were not represented  which led to a reduction in environmental variance. Despite this reduced diversity of environments  a clear heterogeneity of heritabilities among the three herd clusters was identified. In contrast  reaction norms model an “infinite” number of environments  which more precisely depicts the existing continuum of the environment. Generally  the parameter that describes the environment in reaction norm models is a single measure such as age at calving  herd size[]  or herd-year averages of protein yield[]. This environment parameter can also be a synthetic variable that summarizes information of several environmental variables. In[]  65 environmental variables were reduced into four PC by a factor analysis and were used separately. Hence  one major improvement in the current study was that several PC were used simultaneously to describe the environment. The number of parameters to estimate in the model was limited by using linear reaction norms rather than more sophisticated functions such as polynomials. The next step will be to study the possibility to simultaneously account for a larger number of PC to describe the environment. In particular  a reduced rank genetic matrix could be used to summarize the effect of several PC on the genetic effect. Reaction norm models applied to the diversity dataset allowed the investigation of extreme environments (for one or two PC). Here  an average residual variance which did not depend on the environment was used to estimate heritabilities with the reaction norm model. Consequently  differences of heritabilities across environments were only due to differences in genetic variances  which may have exacerbated differences in heritabilities between environments. These differences of heritabilities across environments might be exacerbated by the use of linear reaction norms and of an average residual variance. Thus  the reaction norm model could be improved by allowing different residual variances across environments. No reranking of animals was shown for production traits. These traits have been selected for a long time  and thus  animals may be well adapted to all herd managements that currently exist in France. Nevertheless  within the context of the development of a sustainable agriculture  new ecological constraints appear such as controlling the use of phytosanitary products or protecting some agricultural areas. Also  new economical constraints due to reorganization of agricultural areas  with a decrease in the number of farmers or the end of quotas and liberalisation of milk production could raise new types of herd managements. Depending on how breeders react to these constraints  the range of environments could get larger. Thus  G*E interaction studies will have to be updated in order to assess whether animals remain well adapted to all herd environments. Greater G*E interactions might exist for more recently selected traits. For these traits  the processes may not have already removed the animals’ capacity to be specifically adapted to a particular environment. Thus  on a follow-up study  we will investigate G*E interactions on functional traits. Presence of G*E interactions was evaluated for production traits (milk  protein and fat yields  protein and fat contents) using multiple-trait (which was eventually converted to a single-trait model) and reaction norm animal models for the Holstein  Normande and Montbéliarde breeds  and using herd environment descriptors derived from HTD profiles. No reranking of animals between environments was found for any breed or model. Therefore  it can be concluded that existing breeding schemes are efficient regardless of the environment in which animals are raised and produce. However  a heterogeneity of heritabilities across environments was apparent. In most cases: the more intensive the herd management for milk yield  the larger the heritability. Ignoring this heterogeneity makes reliabilities of estimated breeding values inaccurate. Moreover  the heritability and the genetic variance gradients across environments could entail a higher genetic response in the most intensive herd managements.

Optimum contribution selection by maximizing gene diversity while constraining breeding values of the offspring or  could eventually lead to the extinction of local breeds with historic migration because maximization of gene diversity or breeding values would be achieved by maximization of migrant contributions. Therefore  other objective functions are needed for these breeds. Different objective functions and side constraints were compared with respect to their ability to reduce migrant contributions  to increase the genome equivalents originating from native founders  and to conserve gene diversity. Additionally  a new method for monitoring the development of effective size for breeds with incomplete pedigree records was applied. Approaches were compared for Vorderwald cattle  Hinterwald cattle  and Limpurg cattle. Migrant contributions could be substantially decreased for these three breeds  but the potential to increase the native genome equivalents is limited. The most promising approach was constraining migrant contributions while maximizing the conditional probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the offspring population are not identical by descent  given that both descend from native founders. Many local varieties of domesticated animal species have been established in the last centuries. However  due to agricultural innovations since the beginning of the 19th century and subsequent intensification of production  many landraces are no longer adapted to their changing environments [  ]. They have been crossed with superior breeds in order to improve the economic value of the breeding stock. Gene flow usually occured from the economically most important breeds to the landraces  but not backwards. Consequently  most historic breeds are now extinct and the remaining ones have considerable genetic contributions from a small number of economically superior breeds. Efforts are needed to prevent the remaining historic breeds and their gene pools to become extinct. Conservation efforts can have different objectives. Objectives of breeding programs can be to breed back the historic breeds by removing genetic contributions of migrants  to conserve the breeds in their present appearance  or to increase the economic values. In any case  genetic contributions arising from more frequent breeds are not subject to conservation efforts since their genes are widespread. Meuwissen [] proposed to maximize the expected mean breeding value of the offspring while constraining its gene diversity to a predefined value. A related but not equivalent approach is to maximize the gene diversity in the offspring with or without constraining its expected mean breeding value to a predefined value. In this paper  the latter approach is applied and generalized. This approach seems more appropriate for conserved populations because for these populations the focus is on conservation. In general  the method consists of calculating an optimum contribution  (or the desired number of offspring) for each breeding individual  such that the offspring population maximizes an appropriate objective function  under some side conditions. In the classical approach [] (Approach A) the gene diversity  in the offspring () is maximized  where the vector  contains the genetic contribution of each breeding individual to the offspring population. Thus  ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>(()). Gene diversity of a population is the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the population are not identical by descent (IBD). However  this objective function may be not appropriate for conserved populations because maximization of gene diversity could be achieved by maximization of genetic contributions of migrants. Thus  this approach could eventually lead to extinction of the native breeds. Gene diversity should not fall below a certain level in order to avoid inbreeding depression. Gene diversity is  however  not the parameter that should be maximized in conserved populations. In conserved populations  we are interested in the conservation of alleles that come from native founders  as migrant alleles usually originate from non-endangered breeds. That is  we want to maximize the probability  that both alleles are not IBD and descended from native founders (Approach B)  or the probability  that both alleles are not IBD and at least one of them descended from native founders (Approach C). We also considered the possibility of maximizing the conditional probability  that both alleles are not IBD  given that both descended from native founders (Approach D). For Approach D  we constrained the mean migrant contribution in the offspring population. Lacy [] introduced the concept of founder genome equivalents (FGE). The FGE of a population is the minimum number of unrelated founders that would be needed to establish a population that has the same gene diversity as the population under study. Recall that gene diversity is the probability that two alleles chosen at random are not IBD. However  a more important parameter to characterize the value of a breed for conservation purposes is the conditional probability that two randomly chosen alleles are not IBD  given that both descended from native founders. We call it the conditional gene diversity of the population. Large conditional gene diversity indicates that many native founder alleles have been retained in the population even though they may be at low frequencies. This has led to the following definition of the native genome equivalents (NGE) of a population as the minimum number of unrelated founders that would be needed to establish a population that has the same conditional gene diversity as the population under study. It can be interpreted as the FGE that originate from native founders and that are still present in the population. Besides maintaining the economic value of the breed  the main objective of a conservation program for a population with historic migration is to maximize the NGE and to minimize the genetic contributions of migrants simultaneously. In this paper  we compare objective functions     and  with respect to their ability to conserve the gene diversity  to increase the FGE originating from native founders (i.e. the NGE)  and to decrease the genetic contributions of migrants. Algorithms for solving these optimization problems are also derived and implemented in the R package . Methods were applied and effective sizes were calculated for three German cattle breeds: Vorderwald  Hinterwald and Limpurg. Since the methods were applied to populations with overlapping generations  all definitions are based on birth cohorts rather than generations. A birth cohort  is a set of individuals born in a particular time interval  e.g. the individuals  born in year   or the population  at time []. Since the date of death is unknown in most cases  the population  consists of all individuals up to a particular age . This age  could be the average age of individuals when their last offspring was born  or  for simplicity  it could be the generation interval . Thus  population  consists of all individuals born in the time interval . The  () of birth cohort  is the probability that two alleles chosen at random from the birth cohort are not IBD. We can write where alleles  and  are randomly chosen with replacement from birth cohort   and founder alleles are assumed to be pairwise different. An equivalent representation is   where  is the average coancestry in birth cohort . Each allele descends from a particular founder. Take  to be the set of founder alleles. We distinguish between native founders and migrants  whereby a native founder is a founder that is not a migrant. A native founder is typically an individual with unknown pedigree that belongs to the population and was born before a certain date . A migrant is typically an individual that either comes from an other population (breed)  or an individual with unknown pedigree that was born after the date. The date could be chosen shortly after establishment of the stud book when a sufficient portion of the population was recorded. We can write where  is the set of alleles that come from native founders and  is the set of alleles that come from migrants. We define the  () of birth cohort  as the conditional probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the birth cohort are not IBD  given that both descend from native founders. That is  The  () of birth cohort  is defined as the minimum number of founders that would be needed to establish a population that has the same gene diversity as the individuals in birth cohort . It can be computed as see []. Analogously  we define the  () of birth cohort  as the minimum number of founders that would be needed to create a population that has the same conditional gene diversity as the individuals in birth cohort . We have However  a problem with this definition is that native founders of the population are assumed to be unrelated  which is not true. As a consequence  in the first generation the NGE would be almost as large as the total population size. However  due to the invalid assumption of unrelated founders  the limited effective size causes the NGE to decrease tremendously shortly after the last native founders have entered the population. In order to avoid this artifact  we extrapolate the history of the breed back in time and use as the reference population not the founders listed in the stud book  but the population at an earlier time . That is  all individuals are assumed to be unrelated in year . In the applications  the base year was <U+2009>=<U+2009>1800. We define the conditional gene diversity of an age cohort at time <U+2009>=<U+2009> with respect to base year  as where  is the population at time    is the generation interval  and  is the historic effective size of the population. The historic effective size can be estimated from marker data []. The term that defines the conditional gene diversity is the product of two factors. The first is the estimated gene diversity in the population at time   and the second is the factor by which the conditional gene diversity decreased between  and . Consequently  the   can be calculated as A further parameter that can be of interest is the  of the population. The effective size () of a population within a time interval  is the size of an idealized random mating population of constant size that causes the same decrease of gene diversity as the true population within  generations. However  in breeds with steady gene flow from other populations  the gene diversity does not decrease below a certain level  so this definition of the effective size does not make much sense for populations with migration. Therefore  we use a slightly different definition. We define the  () as the size of an idealized random mating population of constant size that causes the same decrease of the  gene diversity () as the true population within  generations. The effective population size at time   defined as ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>lim([<U+2009>-<U+2009>  + ])  was calculated as described in []  except that it was calculated from the conditional gene diversity. The native effective size quantifies the decrease of genome equivalents originating from native founders because the NGE depend only on the conditional gene diversity  as can be seen from the previous two equations. In a population without migration   and are equal. However  in a population with steady gene flow from other populations   is smaller than  because the gene diversity approaches a plateau level  so () goes to infinity. The population at time   which consists of all individuals up to an age of  years  has gene diversity ()  native genome equivalents   and genetic contribution  from native founders. Note that   so  is the probability that a randomly chosen allele from age cohort  descends from a native founder. Besides monitoring of these quantities  a major task for a conservation program is the calculation of optimal genetic contributions for the breeding individuals that maximize the conditional gene diversity in the offspring and simultaneously maximize the genetic contribution from native founders in the offspring. Moreover  a sufficient level of gene diversity must be maintained in order to avoid inbreeding depression. In general  however  the quantities  and  cannot be maximized simultaneously  so an objective function is needed that considers each appropriately. The usual approach (Approach A) for populations without migration is the calculation of genetic contributions  for the breeding individuals of population such that the gene diversity is maximized by a hypothetical (infinitely large) offspring population . This approach is called minimum kinship selection []. Note that the gene diversity  of the hypothetical offspring is known as the potential diversity of the population at time []. A more appealing approach for populations with migration is to use genetic contributions  for the breeding individuals such that the probability is maximized by the resulting offspring population . This is the probability that two randomly chosen alleles from the offspring are not IBD and are from native founders (Approach B). As a third approach  we consider maximization of the probability that two randomly chosen alleles from the offspring are not IBD and at least one of them descends from a native founder (Approach C). In this case  genetic contributions  for the breeding individuals are calculated such that the offspring population  maximizes Finally  we consider maximizing the conditional gene diversity in the offspring population. That is  genetic contributions  for the breeding individuals were calculated such that the conditional probability is maximized. This approach is intuitively appealing because it maximizes NGE. It has  however  the disadvantage that the conditional gene diversity can be large even for offspring populations with very large migrant contributions. This is due to conditioning on the event that the randomly chosen alleles  and originate from native founders. This can be seen as follows. Take a solution  of the optimization problem and suppose that at least one migrant is a potential breeding individual. Then it can be shown mathematically that the genetic contribution of this migrant to the offspring population can be arbitrarily increased without changing the value of the objective function. Thus  the solution of the optimization problem may be not unique  and one solution maximizes migrant contributions. In order to avoid this  we put an additional constraint on the maximum permissible value for the genetic contribution from migrants to the offspring population. To calculate the parameters defined in the previous section  the following quantities are needed. First  the coancestry  is needed for each pair of individuals . It is the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the individuals are IBD. That is  where allele  is randomly chosen from the two alleles of individual  at a particular locus. Now we define an equivalence relation on the set of founder alleles. Two alleles   are equivalent (=) if they are IBD or if both are migrant alleles. For two alleles randomly chosen from individuals   the probability for this to occur is A second equivalence relation is defined as follows. Two alleles   are equivalent (=) if both are native founder alleles or if both are migrant alleles. For two alleles randomly chosen from individuals   the probability for this to occur is These probabilities have the advantage that they can easily be computed with existing software  e.g. with function  from the R-package . For calculation of   the parents of all migrants were identified with the same dummy individual and for this individual a pedigree with several generations of selfing was added. The coancestry of individuals   computed from this extended pedigree is equal to . Equality holds only approximately because only a finite number of generations of selfing was added. For calculation of   the parents of all migrants were identified with one single dummy individual  the parents of all native founders were identified with another single dummy individual  and for both individuals pedigrees with several generations of selfing were added. The coancestry of individuals   computed from this extended pedigree  is equal to . For example  consider two full sibs  whose sire is a migrant and whose dam is a native founder. Their coancestry is   but   and . Let  be the × coancestry submatrix for the  individuals from population  that is obtained from the true pedigree (i.e.  . The × matrix that contains the probabilities  for each pair of individuals  from population is denoted as   and the × matrix that contains the probabilities  is denoted as . That is  rows and columns that correspond to individuals not born in time interval [] and dummy individuals were excluded from the matrix. Additionally  the -dimensional vector <U+2009>=<U+2009>( …  is needed and contains the genetic contribution of native founders for each individual of population . Note that  is the mean of vector . Let   and  be the means of the respective matrices. It is well known that the gene diversity can be computed as [] Proofs of all numbered equations are presented in Additional file   in which it is shown that the conditional gene diversity satisfies Let  be an arbitrary (hypothetical) offspring population of size  that is obtained from population  such that each breeding individual <U+2009><U+2009> has genetic contribution to the offspring population. The probability that an allele randomly chosen from the offspring population descends from a native founder is and the conditional gene diversity in the offspring population is It is well known that so the optimum contributions  for the breeding individuals with respect to objective function minimize  under side conditions <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and . Additional side conditions can be added to fulfil biological and practical requirements. Moreover  we have so the optimum contributions  for the breeding individuals with respect to objective function  minimize  under the side conditions described above  where  is a vector with ones. Since the optimum contributions  for the breeding individuals with respect to objective function  minimize  under the side conditions. Finally  we have where  is a <U+2009>×<U+2009> matrix. This function was maximized under the side conditions described above. Moreover  the additional side constraint  was applied  where  is the minimum permissible contribution of native founders to the offspring population. This is a quadratic fractional programming problem with linear constraints  so the objective function could have multiple local maxima. As mentioned in the previous section  one solution of the optimization problem maximizes migrant contributions  so the inequality constraint could be replaced by the equality constraint . For each offspring population  that satisfies this equality constraint  the objective function (i.e. the conditional gene diversity) satisfies where the approximation is exact if the events  and  are independent. Therefore  an approximate solution was obtained by maximizing objective function  under the additional constraint . The resulting contributions for the breeding individuals were used as starting values for general nonlinear optimization in order to obtain the exact solution. In the applications  the threshold value  was quite arbitrarily chosen as the 75% quantile of the genetic contributions from native founders to individuals in the population. The same quantile was used for all breeds and years in order to make the results comparable. Results could be improved by choosing breed dependent threshold values. We used the interior point method  in R-package  (see []) for objective functions  and   whereas for objective functions and with positive definite matrices we used  from R-package . It implements the dual method of Goldfarb and Idnani [  ]. Only three local cattle varieties of Baden and Württemberg in the south-west of Germany have been preserved from extinction. These are the Vorderwald cattle  Hinterwald cattle  and Limpurg cattle. Other local breeds were replaced by Simmentaler Fleckvieh after their introduction at the beginning of the 19th century because the small landraces were not suitable for tillage []. The small  could be preserved as an almost pure breed until the beginning of the 20th century [  ] because the poor soil quality in its region of origin was not suitable for larger breeds. Nevertheless  this breed adopted the colour of the Simmentaler Fleckvieh during the 19th century []. The Hinterwald cattle were occasionally crossed with the Vorderwald cattle [] and with Fleckvieh. The red-and-white marked  colour-sided [] were frequently crossed with Simmentaler cattle. Consequently  the white stripe along the back became rare already around 1900 []. After the Second World War  Vorderwald cattle were also crossed with Ayrshire  Red Holstein and Montbéliard cattle in order to improve milk yield. These crosses were registered as Vorderwald cattle. Extinction probabilities for Vorderwald and Hinterwald cattle were estimated by []. The yellow coloured  were not only frequently crossed with Simmentaler cattle []  but also occasionally with Braunvieh and Gelbvieh cattle [] in order to increase body size. Nevertheless  the population size decreased dramatically. Only 17 Limpurg cows were registered in 1967  so the breeding association was dissolved. Several Limpurg cattle  however  were rediscovered in 1986 and a new stud book was established. Not only Limpurg cattle were registered  but also Fleckvieh crosses  and some Gelbvieh and Glan-Donnersberger bulls []. The data consisted of the pedigrees and additional information on 25 412 Hinterwald cattle  185 315 Vorderwald cattle  and 4 150 Limpurg cattle. Vorderwald cattle without offspring were removed from the data in order to reduce the data set. Pedigrees of Hinterwald and Vorderwald cattle trace back only to 1948 because the stud books were renewed after the Second World War. Pedigrees of Limpurg cattle trace back only to 1970. Cattle from other breeds were considered to be migrants. Additionally  Hinterwald and Vorderwald cattle with unknown pedigree born after <U+2009>=<U+2009>1970 were also considered migrants  although some may have purebred ancestors. Limpurg cattle with unknown pedigree were considered to be migrants if they were born after <U+2009>=<U+2009>1988. The generation intervals were similar for the three breeds (unpublished results). Here  we assumed a generation interval of <U+2009>=<U+2009>5.3 years for all breeds. The left hand side of Figure  shows the development of the native effective size  for the three breeds. Around 1990  the effective size of Limpurg cattle was only about 20  which was due to the small population size. However in most cases  the effective size was above 50 for all three breeds. In 2011  7952 Vorderwald cows  2328 Hinterwald cows  and 471 Limpurg cows were registered. Interestingly  there appeared to be no relationship between the effective size and the total population size when the number of individuals exceeds the minimum number required to reach an of approximately 50.  Native effective size (left) and genetic contributions from migrants (right) in the real population and in the hypothetical offspring populations for selection strategies A  B  C  and D (right) for : Limpurg cattle  : Hinterwald cattle  : Vorderwald cattle. The right hand side of Figure  shows for each breed how the genetic contributions of migrants changed over time. Migrant contributions are shown for the true population  and for the hypothetical offspring populations that would be obtained if optimum contribution selection were applied to population . The solid lines show that migrant contributions increased steadily for all three breeds. The dashed line for offspring A shows that all three breeds would become extinct if optimum contribution selection were used to maximize the gene diversity in the offspring. In contrast  objective functions  and  would reduce migrant contributions substantially by more than 50% in all three breeds. According to the constraint applied for objective function   the corresponding line shows the 25% quantile of the migrant contributions in the population. The left hand side of Figure  shows the development of NGE for the true population and for the hypothetical offspring populations. We used the year <U+2009>=<U+2009>1800 as the base year. The historic  is not known for these breeds. In the figure  we assumed a historic of 150 for each breed  which is in good accordance with the results obtained by [] for various cattle breeds during this period of time. For the population in 2005  the computed NGE with respect to base year  was 3.1 for Limpurg cattle  3.3 for Hinterwald cattle  and 3.2 for Vorderwald cattle. For comparison  the NGE computed under the assumption of unrelated founders was 7.3 for Limpurg cattle  8.3 for Hinterwald cattle  and 8.0 for Vorderwald cattle. Figure  shows that the NGE would decrease by using objective function . This suggests that the individuals with the smallest migrant contributions are closely related  so they share the same founder alleles. The use of objective function would cause a small increase of the NGE for all three breeds. If the constraint on migrant contributions is not too serious  then objective function would cause the largest increase in NGE. However  the potential to increase NGE is limited.  Genome equivalents originating from native founders NGE (left) and gene diversity (right) in the real population and in the hypothetical offspring populations for selection strategies A  B  C  and D for : Limpurg cattle  : Hinterwald cattle  : Vorderwald cattle. The right hand side of Figure  shows the changes in gene diversity. It can be seen that the gene diversity is high for all three breeds. This is caused by migration. Note that the native effective population size quantifies the decrease of genome equivalents arising from native founders  so the gene diversity can be constant (or increase due to migration) even if the native effective population size is small. As expected  optimum contribution selection with objective functions     or  would cause a moderate but an acceptable loss of gene diversity. Most of the time  the native effective size was above 50 for the three breeds and due to migration   was larger than . An effective size of at least 50 is considered acceptable  although an of 100 is recommended to be on the safe side []. Many cattle breeds have effective sizes between 50 and 100 regardless of the total population size. Therefore  in order to conserve the overall gene diversity  it is generally recommended to conserve a large number of breeds with small population sizes rather than a small number of breeds with large population sizes. In this case  different alleles would be preserved in different subpopulations. These populations can be used as resources to identify advantageous genes that can be introgressed into commercial populations. Conserved populations must be sufficiently large to allow for this. However  breeds that are close to the economic viability threshold and populations that are expected to occupy niches that are different from that of established commercial breeds  should have larger population sizes in order to enable a sufficient selection response. Examples of the importance of farm animal genetic resources are the introgression of the polled gene into economically important cattle breeds  the introduction of indicine cattle breeds to South America because of their adaption to extreme environments  and introgression of genes for disease resistance into highly productive susceptible breeds []. The current of the Vorderwald cattle was smaller than the estimates of the effective size obtained by [] with other methods. The reason is probably that other methods do not distinguish between migrants and native founders. Genome equivalents arising from native founders are likely to decline faster than those arising from migrants because migrants are usually from economically superior breeds. The sufficiently large  show that for all three breeds  migration from other breeds was much larger than it was needed to avoid unacceptably high inbreeding depression. As a consequence  these breeds share only a small portion of their genes with the corresponding historic breeds of the same name. We showed that it is still possible to substantially increase the genetic contribution from the historic breeds by optimum contribution selection. For optimum contribution selection  the choice of the objective function was crucial. Maximization of gene diversity (Approach A) turned out to substantially increase the migrant contributions and thus would lead to the extinction of these breeds. Approach B has the desired effect to substantially decrease the migrant contributions but does not put enough weight on the conservation of gene diversity. It is not recommended because it would reduce NGE and cause the largest loss of gene diversity. Approach C is recommended for conserved populations because for all three breeds the use of this objective function substantially decreased the migrant contributions  increased the NGE  and caused only a moderate decrease of gene diversity. Approach D can also be recommended  although it requires choice of a threshold for the migrant contributions. If the threshold is chosen appropriately  then this approach causes the largest increase in NGE. However  the potential to increase the NGE was small for the breeds considered. Interestingly  for the current populations  optimum contributions for Approach A were slightly negatively correlated with the optimum contributions obtained for the other approaches  whereas the optimum contributions for the approaches B  C  and D were pairwise positively correlated (not shown). Amador [] proposed two other approaches to reduce migrant contributions. Their first approach was to minimize migrant contributions in the offspring population. Their second approach was to minimize the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the offspring population are IBD and descend from migrants. This objective function was computed from partial coancestry coefficients []  but could also be computed by the methodology introduced in this paper. For both approaches  the maximum rate of inbreeding was restricted. However  provided that an acceptable rate of inbreeding can be achieved  it is not obvious why it is desirable that alleles originating from migrants should be not IBD in the offspring population. In contrast  all approaches proposed in this paper aim at increasing the probability that alleles originating from native founders are not IBD. Amador [] concluded that even with only a few generations without management  a small amount of introgression can spread into the population and it may be almost impossible to recover. This was not observed in our study. The reason is probably that the total population sizes of the cattle breeds were much larger than their effective sizes  which increased the probability to find individuals with small migrant contributions. Moreover  the cattle populations may deviate from random mating populations because some breeders avoid the use of bulls with high migrant contributions. Another approach could be to minimize the effective number of non-founders   as defined by Caballero and Toro []  in the offspring population. This approach would be equivalent to maximization of  which would be achieved by increasing the average relationship  in the offspring population  and by increasing the effective number  of founders in the offspring generation. Thus  the rate of inbreeding would have to be restricted by this alternative approach. This approach  however  would by definition not be optimal with respect to the objective functions introduced in this paper. Our results show that migrant contributions can be substantially decreased for all three breeds  but the potential to increase the NGE is limited. The reduction of migrant contributions would be largely achieved in the first generation of management. In subsequent generations  some further improvement would be possible due to biological restrictions in previous generations. However  thereafter the management method becomes equivalent to an equalization of family sizes and no further reduction of migrant contributions could be achieved. Moreover  pedigree-based optimum contribution selection cannot remove genetic contributions of migrants that arose before recording of pedigrees started. However  removal of migrant contributions that arose earlier can be done subsequent to pedigree-based optimum contribution selection by identification of chromosome segments that are also present in the migrant breeds and by removal of those individuals with large migrant contributions from the breeding pool. Since migrants are usually males  haplotype variants of the Y-chromosome can be used as markers for paternal lineage [] to identify the migrant breeds. For individuals that are not removed from the breeding pool (i.e individuals with small migrant contributions)  optimum contributions can be calculated based on genomic relationships. In order to avoid that this approach causes the frequencies of migrant alleles to increase  the set of breeding individuals could be enlarged with individuals of the migrant breeds. After the optimum contributions have been computed  the contributions of these additional migrant individuals are set to zero  and the optimum contributions for individuals of the breed of interest are rescaled  so that they add up to one. Thereafter  it would be beneficial to combine closely related breeds with low gene diversity in order to reduce extinction probabilities []  and to split breeds with a high gene diversity into several subpopulations in order to reduce the decrease of overall gene diversity []. Breeds with highest value for conservation should be given priority []. These breeds are likely found near the domestication center (since genetic diversity declines with increasing distance from the domestication centre [])  far from the native areas of economically superior breeds  or live in harsh environmental conditions. Candidates are also breeds that are used for uncommon purposes (e.g. fighting cattle  cattle breeds used for cow racing). The usual recommendation to optimize contributions for breeding individuals by maximizing gene diversity in the offspring is not suitable for populations with historic migration because maximization of gene diversity would be achieved by maximization of migrant contributions. Thus  this approach  applied to populations with migration  would rapidely lead to their extinction. Two approaches can be recommended. The first is to maximize the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the offspring population are not IBD and that at least one of them descended from a native founder (Approach C). The other approach is to constrain migrant contributions while maximizing the conditional probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the offspring population are not IBD  given that both descended from native founders (Approach D). Migrant contributions could be substantially decreased for the three breeds investigated here  but the potential to increase the NGE is limited. Programs for pedigree-based optimum contribution selection and for the analyses presented in this paper are available in R package  from the first author. Since migrants are usually from genetically superior breeds  optimum contribution selection is likely to reduce breeding values if there is no constraint on the expected breeding value of the offspring. The program for optimum contribution selection allows adding the constraint that the expected mean breeding value of the offspring does not fall below a certain value. Moreover it is possible to put a constraint on the maximum number of offspring per male and female.

Our results show that genomic selection for novel difficult-to-measure traits is a feasible strategy to achieve increased genetic gain. Sheep meat production is increasing and replacing wool production as the primary product of the Australian sheep industry[]. Improving growth traits through selection for increased live and a carcass weight is an important driver of profitability. Providing consistently high-quality meat is also essential to maintain high consumer acceptance and depends on several carcass quality criteria  such as intra-muscular fat  shear force and Omega-3 content[  ]. Genomic selection[] is applied in an ever growing number of livestock species  e.g.[–]  and could increase economic returns from lamb production[]. Genomic selection can be applied at a number of well-known entry points of breeding schemes to increase genetic progress. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) can be obtained for selection candidates at a young age before phenotypic information is available and be used to increase accuracy of selection and shorten generation intervals. This is useful for traits measured later in life  such as adult greasy fleece weight and reproduction and in cases when phenotypic evaluation involves invasive or destructive approaches such as for carcass composition and meat quality  which are traditionally measured on the relatives of selection candidates. Estimating GEBV for selection candidates requires a reference population with both marker genotypes and phenotypes. Because selection candidates often lack phenotypic records  the predictive performance of GEBV can be assessed either with a set of validation individuals that have highly accurate EBV  e.g. sires with many progeny[  ]  or by cross-validation  e.g.[  –]. Both validation methods require that the validation population and the potential selection candidates have a similar genetic make-up  such that the accuracies obtained for the selection candidates will reflect those calculated using validation individuals. In particular  the validation and selection individuals should have similar relationships to the reference population[–]. For difficult-to-measure and novel traits  individuals with highly accurate EBV often do not exist. Thus  in such cases  cross-validation is applied. In the cross-validation approach  the reference population is divided into a number of subsets and each subset is predicted using a reference population that excludes this particular subset. The method used to divide the data has been shown to affect prediction accuracy  e.g.[    ]. Choosing fully random subsets is the simplest implementation but this ignores data structures  for example presence of sire half-sib groups. Several studies have divided subsets randomly with constraints on data structure  such as age[]  family[]  and relatedness[]. Another consideration is the size of the subsets used for cross-validation. The larger the subset  the smaller the sampling variance of the correlation between predicted and observed variables is expected to be[  ]. However  larger subsets decrease the size of the reference population  resulting in a trade-off between the size of subsets and the accuracy achieved. The utility of applying genomic prediction must be evaluated against what would be achieved with non-genomic approaches  such as best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) using pedigree[]. Cross-validation studies have compared accuracies of EBV using traditional pedigree methods and accuracies of GEBV[  ] but these comparisons have not been made for multi-breed livestock data. Another point to consider is the phenotype used to estimate accuracies in cross-validation studies. Most studies correlate with phenotypes but the accuracies resulting from these comparisons may be affected by fixed effects that are often included in the prediction models. The aim of this study was to predict GEBV for several carcass and novel meat quality traits in a multi-breed sheep population. A previous study in the same population investigated how much of the accuracy of GEBV could be attributed to population structure[]. Here  an across sire family cross-validation scheme was used to estimate accuracies of GEBV in several sheep breeds and their crosses. GEBV were obtained with three methods: BLUP  genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and BayesR. In addition  accuracies were calculated based on phenotypes or adjusted phenotypes and with or without adding a polygenic effect. Datasets from the Cooperative Research Centre for Sheep Industry Innovation (CRC  genetically connected flocks in 8 locations)[] and SheepGENOMICS (SG  one flock)[] were combined to increase the size of the reference population. Different strategies were used to sample the rams and determine the number of progeny per ram in CRC and SG. Rams used for breeding in the CRC flocks were sampled from the general Australian sheep population to maximise connectedness and sire progeny groups contained approximately 40 animals. In contrast  the SG project was initially set up as a linkage study with 20 sires and large progeny groups. Depending on the traits examined  the combination of these datasets resulted in various sizes of reference populations (animals with both phenotypes and genotypes) for genomic analyses  ranging from 3107 to 8075 animals (Table). The breed content of the reference population for hot carcass weight is shown in Figure and is representative of other traits because hot carcass weight was used as a covariate in most analyses. Both reference populations had a significant proportion of Merino individuals and only this breed had a substantial proportion of purebred animals. Most other individuals were crossbreds of meat breed sires and Merino or Merino/Border Leicester dams.  Texel:TXL  Border Leicester: BL  Polled Dorset: PD  White Suffolk: WS  research lines: RES  Suffolk: SUF  East Friesian: FRIES and Merino: MER. The following traits were analysed and phenotypic information for these traits is provided in Table. Carcass eye muscle depth (EMD  mm)  carcass fat depth at site C (FAT  mm  depth of fat at maximum EMD)  hot carcass weight (HCWT  kg)  dressing percentage (DRESS  %)  calculated as the ratio of HCWT to pre-slaughter weight  intra-muscular fat (IMF  %)  iron content of wet muscle tissue (IRON  mg/kg )  and the concentration of omega 3 fatty acid compounds eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA  mg/100g) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA  mg/100g). Lean meat yield (LMY  %) was estimated on the CRC animals by a combination of other carcass traits and validated by computed tomography (CT) scanning[]. On the SG animals  LMY was computed as the ratio of HCWT and actual lean meat after bone-out[]. To account for these differences in methodology  LMY was standardised (mean = 0  standard deviation (SD) = 1) within the CRC and SG datasets before the datasets were merged. All animals were genotyped using the Illumina 50K ovine SNP chip  containing 54 977 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  USA). After applying the following quality control measures  48 599 SNP were retained: SNP were removed if the call rate was less than 95%  if the Illumina Gentrain score was less than 0.6  if the minor allele frequency was less than 0.01  if the SNP was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (a -value cut-off of 1×10)  if the genome location was unknown or if the SNP showed complete linkage disequilibrium (r > 0.99) with another SNP on the chip. Data for a genotyped animal were removed if the genotype call rate was less than 0.9 for that animal or if the animal’s mean heterozygosity was higher than 0.5  indicating sample contamination. The genotype database was built over a number of years  missing genotypes were initially imputed using fastPHASE[] and more recently  missing genotypes were imputed using Beagle[]  after this program became available. Three analysis methods were used. Non-genomic breeding values were predicted after estimating variance components using pedigree information and restricted maximum likelihood (REML)  using the following single-trait model[]: where  is a vector of phenotypic records    and  are design matrices relating the fixed and random effects to the phenotype   is a matrix containing breed proportions for each animal  derived from pedigree information   is the mean   is a vector of fixed effects   is a vector of random additive polygenic effects   is a vector of random breed effects  fitted as partial regressions  and  is the vector of residuals. The following distributions were assumed:  ~  (0 )   ~  (0 )  and  ~  (0 )  where  is the numerator relationship matrix   is the additive variance   is the variance of breed effects  and  is the residual variance. The base model included the following fixed effects: sex  birth type  rearing type  contemporary group (birth year × site × slaughter group)  and age at trait recording. Age of the dam was fitted only for CRC data. HCWT was included as a fixed covariate for all traits except for DRESS and LMY. The size of the relevant pedigree was 16 985 individuals. The phenotypes (y) were restricted to genotyped animals to make a fair comparison to the genomic prediction methods. Genomic breeding values were calculated using GBLUP  for which variance components were also estimated with REML analysis[]  using the model: where  is a design matrix   is a vector of random additive genomic effects distributed as  (0 )   is the genomic variance   is the genomic relationship matrix[]. SNP with allele frequencies less than 0.005 were removed from the calculation of  to improve numerical stability. Phenotypes  rather than de-regressed estimated breeding values  were used to ensure independence of reference and validation sets. If all phenotypes were used to calculate breeding values  then the accuracy of predicting an animal without a phenotype would be overestimated  because phenotypes of validation animals contributed to the reference pedigree breeding values. A Bayesian genomic prediction method using a mixture of four normal distributions with increasing variance for marker effects (BayesR)[] was implemented in two steps. First  phenotypes were fitted using model 1 but without a polygenic effect (<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>). The resulting adjusted phenotypes (*) or residuals were then analysed using BayesR in model: where  is a design matrix relating adjusted phenotypes to random marker effects (). BayesR is described in more detail in[]. Briefly  marker variances can come from distributions with variances = 0  = 0.0001  = 0.001  or = 0.01  and starting values for  were from GBLUP analysis. The prior for the proportion of markers in each distribution was drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Priors for other parameters were chosen as in Erbe et al.[]. Ten parallel chains of 50 000 iterations (20 000 burn-in) were run for each subset. Posterior means of marker effects of BayesR resulting from post burn-in chains were averaged across chains and replicates and then standardised by dividing them by the standard deviation of the adjusted phenotypes (SD). SNP with effects greater than 0.005 SD were (arbitrarily) chosen and potential candidate genes were searched for on using a 1 Mb interval with 0.5 Mb on each side of the SNP. The probability of the effect of a SNP being in the largest distribution () was also investigated. Performance of genomic prediction was evaluated using cross-validation. It is unlikely that potential selection candidates in the Australian sheep population have full or half-sibs in the reference population. Thus  entire sire families in the CRC dataset were randomly chosen and combined into subsets of approximately 500 individuals (CRC subsets). Thus  genomic predictions were evaluated across sire families and larger reference populations had more subsets. The SG dataset was not divided into subsets but was added to each reference population. The performance of predictions was not evaluated for the SG data  because this population is not expected to be representative of the general sheep population. Genomic predictions were calculated for each CRC subset  with the reference set consisting of all other CRC subsets and the SG dataset. Accuracy was evaluated in each validation subset as the Pearson correlation of genomic predicted breeding values () or genomic plus polygenic predicted breeding values ( +) with either phenotypes () or adjusted phenotypes (*). Accuracies were divided by from model 1 to adjust for the upper limit of accuracy of a phenotype/residual. The bias of breeding values (both and +) was calculated as the regression of phenotypes or adjusted phenotypes on predicted breeding values. Accuracy and bias were calculated for the whole validation subset and for each subdivision of each subset by the sire breeds Merino (MER  effective population size   ~ 850)  Border Leicester (BL   ~ 250)  Polled Dorset (PD   ~ 300)  and White Suffolk (WS   ~ 300)[]. Genetic relatedness of validation animals with the reference population was calculated for each subset as the mean of the squared relationships between validation and reference animals and mean of the top 10 relationships. Other studies have concluded that these measures are more predictive of accuracy than mean relationships  hence the latter was not reported[  ]. Use of genomic data increased the accuracies of prediction  depending on the trait (mean accuracy across traits = 0.2) and both GBLUP and BayesR led to more accurate GEBV than pedigree-based BLUP (Figure). Increases in accuracy were greater when based on correlations with phenotypes adjusted for fixed and breed effects than when based on correlations with unadjusted phenotypes for pedigree-based BLUP and BayesR but not for GBLUP. Correlations with adjusted phenotypes varied less between breeds [see Additional file: Table S1]  e.g. for GBLUP for the trait DRESS. Similarly  when correlations were calculated using the whole subset (i.e. without subdividing by breed)  correlations of GEBV with phenotypes were often much higher than with adjusted phenotypes  although this trend was more pronounced with GBLUP than with BayesR. This confirms that estimating accuracies with unadjusted phenotypes involves a component related to fixed effects or breed  even when these are fitted when computing GEBV. Both genomic methods used in this study included a polygenic effect. Adding the estimate of the polygenic effect to the GEBV resulted in a small increase in accuracy (about 1%  data not shown). Furthermore  GBLUP was also run without a polygenic effect and no significant difference in accuracy was observed compared to GBLUP with a polygenic effect but without adding the estimate of the polygenic effect when computing the GEBV. In the next section  only accuracies based on correlations of GEBV plus estimates of polygenic effects with adjusted phenotypes are reported because they were more balanced between breeds and seemed less confounded with fixed effects.  Accuracy was calculated as the correlation between predicted breeding values and phenotypes or adjusted phenotypes. The increase in accuracy with genomic methods over BLUP was not uniform across traits (Figure). While genomic methods increased the accuracy of IMF substantially  accuracies were similar and closest to those from pedigree-based BLUP for the traits EPA and DPA.                                                  Figure illustrates the relationship between genomic prediction accuracy and the product of reference set size and genomic heritability ( = 0.47). The results show a clear trend of increased accuracy with increasing size of the reference population and suggest that further increases in accuracy should be possible if the reference population is increased further.                                                  The accuracy of GEBV was lower in Border Leicester sire breed groups than in the Merino  Polled Dorset and White Suffolk breeds (Figure). This is probably because Border Leicester sheep have the lowest mean breed proportion in the reference set of the four validation breeds. For the Merino  Polled Dorset and White Suffolk breeds  similar genomic accuracies were obtained  although the Merino breed represented the largest proportion in the reference population. The fact that the accuracy of GEBV for the Merino breed was not larger could be because the Merino population has a higher  (about 800)[] than the Polled Dorset or White Suffolk populations ( ~ 300)  which results in a larger number of independent chromosome segments to be predicted[–]. Thus  in the terminal breeds  the accuracy of GEBV was similar to that in the Merino breed  despite a smaller number of phenotypic records in the reference set  because of lower genetic diversity in those breeds. Another study[]  reported a higher genomic prediction accuracy for wool and weight traits in Merino than in terminal breeds using the same populations  but that is likely because the proportion of the reference population that is Merino is larger for those traits than for meat quality traits.                                                  The slope of regression of either phenotypes or adjusted phenotypes on GEBV was close to 1 for all methods  except when using adjusted phenotypes and GBLUP  which resulted in a regression coefficient of 0.78 (Figure and Table S2 [see Additional file: Table S2]). Thus  overall  there is little evidence for bias in the predictions. Intercepts were close to 0 for all methods.                                                  Table S3 [see Additional file: Table S3] contains the mean genetic relationships of validation with reference animals  calculated as the mean of the top 10 genomic relationships for each individual. Small differences in relatedness between breed groups and between traits were observed  ranging from 0.102 for DRESS to 0.168 for IRON  both in the Merino breed. No clear relationships of the mean genetic relationship with the achieved accuracy were found  for several reasons. First  the sampling variances of the correlations between GEBV and phenotypes were too large due to the small size of the validation sets [see Additional file: Table S4]. Secondly  the genomic relationship matrix used here was based on the original Yang et al.[] implementation  which does not adjust for breed (base) allele frequencies. While these scaling issues are not likely to decrease predictive performance substantially  they will numerically affect mean relationships within a breed and may limit the possibility of finding a relationship between magnitude of mean relationships and within-breed accuracies. One possible solution would be to scale allele frequencies within breeds to their respective breed base allele frequencies before calculating the relationship matrix[]. In the cross-validation design applied here  sires were chosen randomly and all their progeny were assigned to subsets. This prevented the upward bias of accuracies that would result from within-family prediction when half sib families are randomly split between reference and validation datasets. The accuracies obtained with our approach are expected to better reflect what would be achieved across a range of industry selection candidates with varying degrees of relationships to the reference animals. A further complication in our study was that the reference and validation populations were mostly made up of crossbreds  yet potential selection candidates in the industry are likely purebred individuals. Dividing the validation sets by sire breed groups was used to approximate the accuracy of purebred selection candidates. Because all animals have a large Merino component  the accuracies obtained with the Border Leicester  Polled Dorset and White Suffolk validation sets (sire breed groups) are not strictly equivalent to the accuracy which would be obtained with purebred animals. However  in the absence of purebred individuals with carcass data  this represents the best possible approximation. However  while the selection of breeding stock takes place among purebred individuals  commercial stock results from crosses between terminal and maternal sheep breeds. Another aim of this study was to compare the variability of cross-validated EBV accuracies across subsets from pedigree-based BLUP and genomic methods. No large differences were observed  aside from the increase in accuracy using genomic data. In addition  accuracies from pedigree-based BLUP and genomic methods had very similar standard errors  indicating that cross-validation accuracies are just as variable across subsets for pedigree-based BLUP. While BayesR did not increase the accuracy of genomic prediction compared to GBLUP  it does explicitly estimate marker effects and the proportion of markers in each of the four distributions. BayesR estimates of marker effects greater than 0.05 adjusted phenotypic trait SD are presented in Table. The largest estimated effect was observed for FAT (0.0106 SD  Figure) but most markers had very small effects. Thus  few large effects were detected in our analysis (Figure and [see Additional file: Figure S1]). The magnitude of the estimated effects suggests that BayesR can still shrink large effects heavily  although it models four marker distributions  and this could partially explain the small number of large effects estimated or there just may be no true large marker effects in these traits. The SNP with the largest effects also tended to also have the highest probability of being in the largest SNP distribution (). In addition  the largest effects were consistently assigned to the same SNP across the 10 parallel BayesR chains.  The peaks for both traits are close to position 37 Mb on chromosome 6. Potential candidate genes within a 1 Mb interval with 0.5 Mb on each side of the SNP are also presented in Table. One region on chromosome 6 contained SNP with estimated effects ranging from 0.0060 to 0.0106 SD for FAT  IMF  DRESS and LMY. Genes in this region included ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 ( and Polycystin-2 (  which have been reported as having been under selection in an analysis of a large number of sheep breeds[].   a gene involved in ATP binding  has been found to contain a causative mutation that affects milk yield and composition in dairy cattle[] and has also been investigated as a candidate gene for facial eczema in sheep[]. Another potential gene of interest is  protein. This gene is close to SNP OAR3_64213489 (DRESS 0.0052SD) and codes for an adaptor protein that associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated growth-factor receptors. ARF GTPase-activating protein   which is close to SNP OAR11_21345650_X (IMF  0.0058SD)  codes for a GTPase-activating protein that is possibly involved in vesicle trafficking  adhesions and cytoskeletal organisation. The main benefit of genomic selection for carcass and novel meat quality traits is that it is not necessary to sacrifice valuable selection candidates for testing  and GEBV can be obtained early in life. Genomic predictions can be trained within a set of industry representative individuals and then applied in the general sheep population. In its current form  this process is implemented in a centralised approach in sheep  in which test animals are housed in information nucleus flocks. However  data for training could also be collected during slaughter of industry stock  which could substantially increase the number of records. One advantage of an information nucleus is that animals are well identified and similarly managed  and fixed effects are fully recorded. Including industry records would require further investment in recording and tracking of animal production and movement and the development of uniform standards for measurement  sampling and testing at slaughter facilities. One application of genomic selection is the prediction of accurate breeding values of juveniles without phenotypic records. This allows for significant shortening of generation intervals. In addition  some sheep breeders use juvenile in-vitro fertilised embryo transfer (JIVET)  which consists of harvesting immature oocytes from 6 to 8 week old ewe lambs and implanting these into sexually mature individuals after  fertilisation[]. The combination of genomic selection and JIVET could be a powerful tool to increase genetic gain for novel meat traits. For example  lines with high omega-3 content or superior eating quality could be developed. The increase in genetic gain resulting from genomic selection would need to be combined with a strategy to limit a reduction in genetic diversity  such as using optimised contributions and mating schemes[–]. The accuracies of EBV obtained with genomic methods were not substantially higher than accuracies of EBV obtained with pedigree-based BLUP. Given the large reference population size  one could have expected a larger increase. However  in our case  many breeds contributed to the reference population and the limited increase in accuracy could be explained by small contributions obtained from across-breed prediction  which has been found to be very low in this population[]. Increasing marker density  either through a high-density SNP chip or through next-generation sequencing  could increase accuracies from across-breed prediction. Simulation studies with simple genetic architectures have shown that using sequence data can be beneficial[]. In contrast  in a perhaps under-powered study using empirical Drosophila sequence data  no increase in genomic prediction accuracy was observed compared to the use of lower SNP densities[]. In dairy cattle  there is some evidence that across-breed prediction can be increased when using a high-density array[]. A higher density SNP chip could potentially be more beneficial in sheep than in cattle  because the  is greater for most sheep breeds than in dairy cattle[]. In Holstein cattle  80% of the genetic variance was captured by the 50k bovine SNP chip[]. Using the same methodology between 30 to 55% of the genetic variance was captured by the 50k ovine SNP chip in Merino sheep  depending on trait (results not shown). Thus  increasing marker density may result in substantial increases in accuracy  both within and across sheep breeds. Currently  the implementation of high-density arrays  and potentially sequence data  is accomplished using a two-step approach. First  reference populations that are genotyped at medium density (e.g. 50 000 SNP) are imputed up to higher density  using a sample of individuals that is genotyped at the higher density. Second  the imputed reference population is used for genomic prediction. Genomic predictions for meat quality traits in sheep are potentially valuable because they can be applied early in life and do not require potential selection candidates to be sacrificed. In a large multi-breed sheep dataset  genomic prediction resulted in greater accuracies of EBV than pedigree-based BLUP  but for some traits the increase in accuracy was small. Accuracy increased as reference population size increased and the accuracy was greater for the Merino  Polled Dorset and White Suffolk breeds than for the Border Leicester breed. The latter result is explained in part by the lower proportion of Border Leicester sheep in the reference population. It also suggests that across-breed prediction is limited with the 50k SNP chip. The methods GBLUP and BayesR produced very similar accuracies of GEBV  with a mean accuracy of approximately 0.2 across traits. Few markers with large effects were discovered but one region on chromosome 6 was associated with large effects for several traits. Validation correlations of GEBV with phenotypes adjusted for estimates of fixed effects were less variable than correlations with unadjusted phenotypes  and there was little evidence of bias in the GEBV. The general behaviour of cross-validation accuracies was very similar for pedigree-based BLUP  GBLUP and BayesR. In conclusion  genomic breeding values can provide a powerful tool to increase genetic progress in sheep  especially when combined with reproductive technologies.

"Statistical distributions of test statistics used for quantitative trait association mapping in structured populations"	"Authors: Simon Teyssèdre  Jean-Michel Elsen and Anne Ricard"	"INRA  UR 631 Station d’Amélioration Génétique des Animaux  Castanet-Tolosan  F-31326  FranceSimon Teyssèdre & Jean-Michel Elsen INRA  UMR 1313 Génétique Animale et Biologie Intégrative  Jouy-en-Josas  F-78352  FranceAnne Ricard"	"No Co-Author"	"12 November 2012"	"BackgroundSpurious associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotypes are a major issue in genome-wide association studies and have led to underestimation of type 1 error rate and overestimation of the number of quantitative trait loci found. Many authors have investigated the influence of population structure on the robustness of methods by simulation. This paper is aimed at developing further the algebraic formalization of power and type 1 error rate for some of the classical statistical methods used: simple regression  two approximate methods of mixed models involving the effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a random polygenic effect (GRAMMAR and FASTA) and the transmission/disequilibrium test for quantitative traits and nuclear families. Analytical formulae were derived using matrix algebra for the first and second moments of the statistical tests  assuming a true mixed model with a polygenic effect and SNP effects.ResultsThe expectation and variance of the test statistics and their marginal expectations and variances according to the distribution of genotypes and estimators of variance components are given as a function of the relationship matrix and of the heritability of the polygenic effect. These formulae were used to compute type 1 error rate and power for any kind of relationship matrix between phenotyped and genotyped individuals for any level of heritability. For the regression method  type 1 error rate increased with the variability of relationships and with heritability  but decreased with the GRAMMAR method and was not affected with the FASTA and quantitative transmission/disequilibrium test methods.ConclusionsThe formulae can be easily used to provide the correct threshold of type 1 error rate and to calculate the power when designing experiments or data collection protocols. The results concerning the efficacy of each method agree with simulation results in the literature but were generalized in this work. The power of the GRAMMAR method was equal to the power of the FASTA method at the same type 1 error rate. The power of the quantitative transmission/disequilibrium test was low.

Many authors have investigated the influence of population structure on the robustness of methods by simulation. This paper is aimed at developing further the algebraic formalization of power and type 1 error rate for some of the classical statistical methods used: simple regression  two approximate methods of mixed models involving the effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a random polygenic effect (GRAMMAR and FASTA) and the transmission/disequilibrium test for quantitative traits and nuclear families. Analytical formulae were derived using matrix algebra for the first and second moments of the statistical tests  assuming a true mixed model with a polygenic effect and SNP effects. The expectation and variance of the test statistics and their marginal expectations and variances according to the distribution of genotypes and estimators of variance components are given as a function of the relationship matrix and of the heritability of the polygenic effect. These formulae were used to compute type 1 error rate and power for any kind of relationship matrix between phenotyped and genotyped individuals for any level of heritability. For the regression method  type 1 error rate increased with the variability of relationships and with heritability  but decreased with the GRAMMAR method and was not affected with the FASTA and quantitative transmission/disequilibrium test methods. The formulae can be easily used to provide the correct threshold of type 1 error rate and to calculate the power when designing experiments or data collection protocols. The results concerning the efficacy of each method agree with simulation results in the literature but were generalized in this work. The power of the GRAMMAR method was equal to the power of the FASTA method at the same type 1 error rate. The power of the quantitative transmission/disequilibrium test was low. In conclusion  the FASTA method  which is very close to the full mixed model  is recommended in association mapping studies. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) information has enabled the use of linkage disequilibrium to detect and localize loci affecting phenotypes. The first methods developed searched for disequilibrium between one or a few marker loci and loci responsible for disease susceptibility. Case–control designs were used []. Typically  data were analyzed to compare the frequency of marker alleles between healthy and diseased individuals  for instance using the relative risk criterion []. A similar approach for quantitative traits (including production traits in animals or plants) was to model the expectation of their distribution as a linear combination of marker genotype  allele or haplotype effects. Grapes et al. [] and Zhao et al. [] demonstrated that the single marker regression model is as powerful and precise as other more sophisticated techniques  such as multiple regression  regression on haplotypes  or the IBD method proposed by Meuwissen and Goddard []. Detection of spurious associations is a major issue that has been investigated by many authors. Such errors occur when population classification based on marker information is confounded with another source of heterogeneity that affects the trait being analyzed. The problem of genetic heterogeneity has been the most widely studied. Two non-exclusive situations can occur: (i) the population consists of genetically different subpopulations and (ii) the population consists of related individuals  which may be recorded through pedigree or not. Several studies have clearly shown that neither relative risk nor simple regression is robust to genetic stratification of the population resulting from the mixture of different groups (breeds  lines  etc.) or families [–]. Many approaches have been proposed to avoid the effects of spurious associations. The first was to restrict the analysis to within-family comparisons  linking association analysis to transmission studies. Within this framework  samples have to be carefully organized and  families have to be recruited. They are based on the association  within heterozygous parents family  of segregation distortion at a marker locus and progeny phenotypes. This idea was first implemented in the transmission disequilibrium test (tdt) designed by Spielman et al. [] and then further developed by others. Ewans and Spielman []  when comparing tdt and a “within-family contingency statistic” that is similar to the haplotype relative risk developed by Falk and Rubinstein []  demonstrated the robustness of tdt in various subdivision and admixture scenarios. Two widely represented families of methods extend these within-family comparisons to quantitative traits: the “quantitative tdt” or QTDT by Abecassis et al. ([–]) and the family-based association tests or fbat [–]. All these methods are robust to population stratifications  have similar power [  ]  and are more powerful than the first tests developed for family-based association studies []. Although limiting spurious associations by using within-family analyses was very successful  case–control association studies in populations consisting of individuals assumed to be unrelated were nevertheless frequently performed  in particular because the recruitment of the corresponding samples is much easier []. A number of techniques were derived to limit false positives: “genomic control” corrects the test statistic [  ]  a structure effect can be added to the model of analysis [–]  and marker transmission used in family-based tests can be generalized and used between generations [  ]. Concerning quantitative traits  known or hidden population structures can be modeled in mixed models where the phenotype expectation is modeled as the sum of fixed effects  including the effect of the genetic marker being tested  and a random individual polygenic effect. Covariances between the individual polygenic effects are proportional to the polygenic variance and coancestry coefficients  which can be estimated from pedigree or marker information [–]. This mixed model is a standard that has been used in animal breeding and genetics for many years [  ] and more recently in human genetics [  ]. In these mixed models  polygenic and residual variances have to be estimated separately for each marker fitted before its significance is tested. This estimation phase  to be repeated for each marker tested  can be a limiting factor in large designs and simpler approaches have been proposed. The GRAMMAR method was developed by Aulchenko et al. [  ] and by Amin et al. [] to test marker effects on phenotypes that have been corrected for an estimate of the individual’s polygenic effect in a restricted model that is free of the polygenic effect. The FASTA approach described by Chen and Abecasis [] is a score test  derived from the generalized FBAT []. In a first step  environmental fixed effects and polygenic and residual variances are estimated from a mixed model excluding the marker effect. Then  corrected phenotypes are successively correlated to each marker’s genotypes using these estimations  giving FBAT type scores. A similar approach can be considered in which the second step would be based on a simple fixed effect model as in GRAMMAR. Other approaches have been proposed  with the aim of accelerating computations (emma for efficient mixed-model association  []  emmax for eXpedited  [] and P3D for Population Parameters Previously Determined  []). Finally  a few models deal with spurious associations arising from subpopulations and family structures [    –]. The above methods have been evaluated by simulations. Aulchenko et al. [] compared GRAMMAR to the full mixed model  to the regression model without a polygenic effect  to the QTDT method  and to a simple fbat by using simulated datasets that corresponded to typical pedigrees. Genomic control was compared in [] using GRAMMAR and GRAMMAR-GC. Price et al. [] compared Pca (eigenstrat)  Armitage test  emmax with or without pca and roadtrips proposed by Thornton and McPeek []  in which genomic data are modeled as random variables. Pca-based approaches ([]  eigenstrat; []  pca-based logistic regression; []  lapstruct (which makes use of spectral graph theory to build principal components) were compared in [] to the genomic control described by Devlin and Roeder [] and to roadtrips. Three GWAS (genome-wide association studies) techniques were compared in []: simple regression  GRAMMAR and a “mtdt”  which is a QTDT applied to Mendelian sampling terms. On the whole  these numerical studies have shown that within-family approaches are less powerful than case control analyses in populations of unrelated individuals [  ] and that there are no major differences between the latter []. These studies have clearly demonstrated the non-robustness of the simplest methods such as the Armitage test or simple regression [  –] and that more elaborate models are robust to any type of stratification [    ]. Furthermore  these studies have shown that approximate techniques such as GRAMMAR and emmax are very efficient in terms of error control when family structures exist  as well as in computing speed  but are less powerful in certain situations e.g. [  ]. One of the main limits of comparing methods based on simulations is that the simulation results cannot be generalized and only a few studies have provided algebraic results but for simple situations. For instance  Fan and Xiong [] formalized single- or bi-marker association analyses by regression  deriving their power as a function of the non-centrality parameter of the test statistic  which depends on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the markers and the quantitative trait locus (QTL). In []  the relative risk  the within-family contingency statistic and the tdt were compared algebraically using a few admixture scenarios. The Cochran Armitage test was studied by different authors [–]. The power of ANOVA or regression-based association analyses was derived by Ambrosius et al. [] as a function of allelic or genotypic frequencies  and recently completed by Kozlitina et al. []. Abecacis et al. [] obtained results for the QTDT in population mixture situations  by deriving within- and between-family expectations with and without parental information. Boitard et al. [] generalized the corresponding formulae for variances and tests. In []  Lange et al. provided algebraic formulae representing the power of fbat  depending on parental and progeny genotypes. The aim of the work presented here was to further develop the algebraic formulation of power and type 1 error rate for four of the aforementioned methods: simple regression  the approximate methods GRAMMAR [  ] and FASTA []  and the QTDT described by []. Our goal was to explore the effect of population structure but focusing on hidden familial relationships rather than on population mixtures. In such situations  phenotypes are both under the influence of the QTL that is linked to tested markers and the polygenic background. The model of reference used in this study was the standard mixed model which includes the coancestry coefficients as parameters. Results show in which situations the methods studied here can be considered as appropriate and provides some guidance for population sampling. The statistics compared in this paper are testing whether  or not  the variability of a quantitative trait    is associated with the genotype at a SNP considered one by one. Trait  is assumed to be polygenic  i.e. under the influence of many QTL. When testing a particular SNP-phenotype association  the random variable  can be described as the sum of the putative fixed effect  of a QTL linked to this SNP  a random polygenic effect  that represents the collective effect of all other (unlinked) QTL  and random noise  (<U+2009>=<U+2009> <U+2009>+<U+2009> <U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>). Hereafter  this model is designated as the “true model”. The approximate methods  mentioned in the introduction  estimate  using simplified models. Generally  for each of these simplified models   the regression coefficient of the SNP effect (fitted as a covariate according to the number of reference alleles in the genotype  i.e. 0  1 or 2) is estimated by the general least squares estimator . A standard Student’s test is then constructed to test the null hypothesis that the SNP effect is zero. Let  and  be the expectation and variance of the estimator   and  and  be an estimator of the residual variance and its expectation  all assuming model . The t-tests can then be formulated as: As the ratio of a normal distribution with unit variance and an independent square root  distribution  these tests are assumed to follow non-central t-distributions with non-centrality parameter . However  these tests do not follow these distributions because  does not follow the simplified model ; only if the tests are computed with expectations and variance of  corresponding to the true model for   do the tests follow a t-distribution. Let  and  be the expectation and variance of the estimator  and  the expectation of the estimator of residual variance assuming  follows the true model. Then  the valid Student’s tests are: These Student’s distributions tend to normal distributions when the number of animals involved in the analysis is sufficiently high (100 animals). These normal distributions have mean  and variance 1 []. The test  that is used instead of  can be expressed as . Thus  the test  will have a normal distribution with mean: and variance: The aim of the present study was to express these moments as a function of the parameters of the true model for  i.e. the matrix of relationships among individuals and the polygenic variance. The true type 1 error rate and power of the tests of model  were analytically determined. Under the null hypothesis (H0   = 0)  the tests  were assumed to have expectation 0 and variance 1. For a given expected type 1 error rate   the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis was set at <U+2009>=<U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>/2)  where  is the standardized cumulative normal distribution. With the same threshold  knowledge of the true variance and expectation of the tests  allowed us to compute the actual true type 1 error rate   where () is the expectation of the test statistic and () the variance of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Under the alternative hypothesis (H1   = )  the statistical power was computed as   using the same definition for the threshold and the true regression coefficient . The bias of the estimator of the regression coefficient of the SNP effect was computed as  In the following  the true model and the simple models  used for analysis are defined. The expectation and variance of the test  used are expressed as a function of the parameters conditional on genotypes and on the variance of polygenic effects. Finally  the marginal type 1 error rate and power are given by integrating the SNP genotypes and polygenic variance estimators given the relationship matrix and the true variance parameters. It should be noted that power was calculated based on the SNP effect  not based on the effect of a QTL linked to the SNP. To calculate the power to detect a QTL  assuming LD  between the SNP and the QTL  the regression coefficient of the QTL effect is equal to the SNP effect divided by . The true model was assumed to be the following mixed model: where  is the vector of the observed trait (one phenotype per animal)  µ is the vector of the overall mean   the regression coefficient of the fixed SNP effect   the vector of random additive genetic effects of the animals and  the vector of random residuals. Let () =   ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  with  being the relationship matrix and  the additive polygenic variance  and ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  with  the residual variance. Heritability was defined as the ratio between the polygenic genetic variance and the sum of polygenic variance and residual variance:  and we defined the phenotypic variance as <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>. The vector  is the incidence vector of the SNP effect  defined as  (see for example [])  where  is  for genotype 11   for genotype 12  and  for genotype 22  with  being the frequency of allele 2 and  the frequency of allele 1  so that () = 0 and () = 1. Based on the definition of   the relationship between the regression coefficient of the true model and the allele substitution effect (the difference between genotype 11 and 12 or 12 and 22) is: So  the same statistical power was obtained for different allele substitution effects  depending on the allele frequencies. For the sake of simplicity  no other fixed effect was added to the model. We analyzed four simpler models that were used to estimate the SNP effect instead of the true model. The first three models were association analyses and the fourth was a linkage and association analysis. The superscript  = 1 … 4 was added to identify the effects specific to each of the four models. The first model was a simple regression model with no polygenic effect:  The second model was the GRAMMAR method developed by [] and []. GRAMMAR is a two-step method in which first the following model is fitted:  then the estimates of residuals are used to estimate the SNP effect: The third model was derived from the FASTA approach from []. To homogenize comparisons  we did not use the score as formalized by the authors but simply considered the marker effect t-test from the following model:  but with variance components estimated from the same random model like in the first step of GRAMMAR (<U+2009>=<U+2009> <U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>)  i.e. with  instead of  and  The fourth model was the linkage analysis and association method  QTDT  developed by []. Let   where  and  denote the genotype of the sire and dam of the animal. Then:  where  is the regression coefficient between families and  the regression coefficient within families. Details on the algebra used to obtain the results are provided in Additional file  [See Additional file ]. Several approximations were used in the derivations  notably: ignoring the variance of the estimator of the SNP effect caused by estimation of the variance component instead of using true variance []  replacing quadratic forms by their expectations in products and ratios. Therefore  simulations were first performed to validate the formulae for each method. Validation was restricted to the family structures and heritability values used in the “Comparison of methods” section of the paper. The population used for the simulations therefore consisted of 600 genotyped individuals  offspring of 120  20 and 10 sires that produced 5  30 and 60 offspring  respectively. To do this  the genotypes for a SNP were simulated for sires and dams with allele frequencies of 0.5  and the genotypes of the offspring were extrapolated from their parents’ genotypes. Next  the polygenic values of the sires and offspring and the phenotypes of the offspring were computed with and without the effect of a corresponding QTL with an allele substitution effect of 0.20 (equivalent to a regression coefficient of 0.141 phenotypic standard deviations or a QTL explaining 2% of the phenotypic variance). The robustness and power of each method were then evaluated using these two phenotypes (with or without a QTL) with a significance threshold of 5% (which is different from the 1% threshold used in the application section). The simulations were performed with heritabilities ranging from 0 to 1 by 0.1 steps. 10 000 replicates were simulated for each scenario. In total  1 320 000 simulations were performed. For the GRAMMAR and FASTA methods  the ASREML software [] was used to estimate variance components. The relationship matrix used for these two methods was derived from pedigree data and not from genomic data. Details are provided in Additional file  [See Additional file ]. An R program (see Additional file ) was written to compute the type 1 error rate and the power of the four methods under any relationship matrix and heritability. This section only considers the formulae for the expectation and variance of the estimator  the expectation of the sum of the squares of residuals and the expectation and variance of the test statistics. Details are provided in Additional file . Assuming model (1)  the SNP effect was estimated by: If the vector  followed model (1)     and the residual variance is estimated from the sum of the squares of residuals assuming  . But in fact  when considering that  follows the true model  the true expressions are as follows. The expectation of this estimator is: The variance of the estimator is: So the variance of the estimator of the SNP effect was a function of heritability and of the relationship matrix  in addition to the usual factor involving residual variance. The residual variance was estimated using the sum of squares of residuals. The expectation is: where  is the number of animals analyzed. Finally  the mean and variance of the test statistic that was actually used are: Assuming model (2b)  the SNP effect was estimated by: Assuming  followed model (2b)   and . To develop the correct formulae  we need to know the expectation and variance of estimators of the polygenic effects in the random model (2a). The mixed model equation of model (2a) can be denoted as: where Then  assuming that  followed the true model: The estimates of the polygenic effects were biased  and: Thus  when computing the expectation of estimator of the SNP effect: the estimator of the SNP effect was biased  and the residual variance was estimated using the sum of squares of residuals: Hence  The only difference between this model and the true model was the variance components used  which were the same as in the GRAMMAR model. The mixed model equation for model (3) is: with   from the first model (2a) used in GRAMMAR. If: the estimator of the SNP effect is: Assuming  follows model (3)   and the sum of products between phenotypes and residuals were used to estimate the residual variance  as is customary in mixed models  so that . Then  the expectation and variance of the estimator of the SNP effect  assuming a true model for   are Hence  Assuming model (4)  two regression coefficients had to be estimated: If  with  assuming model (4)  the variance and expectation of the estimators are: and assuming the true model  the expectation and variance of estimates of the regression coefficients are in fact: and the sum of the squares of residuals: Thus  the expectation and variance of the test on  (the within-family regression) is: where [] denotes the coefficient of line 3 and column 3 that of matrix  With the true model  the classical formulae are: The above formulae give the conditional expectation of the estimators of the SNP effects and the conditional expectation and variance of test statistics based on specific data  i.e.  given   the marker genotypes (or  the centered genotypes defined in the true model) and the known variance component of the polygenic effects. These formulae can be applied to any kind of data. The aim of this section is to derive the marginal expectation and variance of the test statistics  by integrating over the distribution of genotypes and the variance components of the random polygenetic effects  given the relationship matrix and variance components of the true model. For this purpose  the quadratic forms involving  and  and the variance components of the random model (2) were replaced by their expectation. If  denotes these expectations and  is the relationship coefficient between animals  and  then the relationship coefficient for the Mendelian sampling variance  can be defined as: where  is the sire of animal  and  the dam.  is the diagonal matrix with elements . Assuming Hardy Weinberg equilibrium  we know that []:()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>()<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>  and ()<U+2009>=<U+2009> when the genotype    is expressed in a standardized form  as shown in the introduction. Thus: and for the sums involved in the QTDT (as in []): These expectations replace their corresponding terms in the preceding formulae in order to express all expectations and variances of the tests used for detection of the SNP effect as a function of heritability and the relationship matrix. To this end  the following approximations were made: expectations of ratios and products were replaced by ratios and products of expectations. For the expectation of variance components given the relationships  the following expectations were used: As pointed out in the Methods section  simulations were performed in order to validate the previous analytical results. Table  summarizes these results as absolute deviations of type 1 error rate and power from analytical results. Details and standard errors of these simulations are provided in Additional file  [See Additional file ]. The average deviation of simulation results from analytical results were in general of the same order as the standard deviation of the simulation results (0.22% for 5% estimated) for type 1 error rate and slightly higher for power (0.36% for example for 85% estimated). Thus  simulations were in very good agreement with analytical results and make a general discussion possible. The only exception may be for extremely high values of heritability. The above formulae can be applied to any data without simulation when the relationship matrix is known. The results presented here are an illustration based on 600 recorded and genotyped progenies belonging to 120  20 and 10 families of respectively  = 5  30 and 60 half-sibs  which is typical for animal breeding data. The power was calculated for a SNP with a regression coefficient of 0.14 in phenotypic standard deviations (or 2% of phenotypic variance  which is equivalent to an allele substitution effect of 0.20 for a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 50% or an effect of 0.33 for a MAF of 10%. The effect of changes in the total number of animals  and estimates of variance components used in GRAMMAR and FASTA was also analyzed. For families of half-sibs  the preceding formulae concerning expectation and variance of the tests throughout the Results section were calculated using:  the diagonal term of     the off-diagonal term of  between half-sibs   the off diagonal term of  between animals from different families. Diagonal coefficients of the relationship matrix  were 1 and off-diagonal coefficients were Â¼ between half-sibs and 0 elsewhere. Matrix  was diagonal with coefficients ½. It should be noted that with families of equal sizes: For an assumed type 1 error rate of 1%  the expected true type 1 error rate is plotted in Figures a to d according to the heritability of the polygenic effect and the number of half-sibs per family  for the same overall number of genotyped animals (600). For the regression model  there was a marked increase in type 1 error rate with heritability and family size; the type 1 error rate was equal to 12% with  = 0.50 and families of 60 half-sibs. With the GRAMMAR model  the type 1 error rate decreased with heritability and family size. FASTA and QTDT models were practically not affected by polygenic variance and relationships.  : regression model; : GRAMMAR model; : FASTA model; : QTDT model. Figures a to d show the power of the methods. With the regression method  the power decreased with heritability and family size. With both the FASTA and GRAMMAR methods  the power first decreased to a minimum at a heritability of about 0.30 and then increased with heritability towards a value equal to the power obtained with a heritability of 0. The power was always higher with smaller families. The power of the QTDT method was not affected by population structure or by the polygenic effect but was very low compared to the other models.  The following conditions were tested i.e. true regression coefficient of 0.20 phenotypic standard deviation () with minimum allele frequency (MAF) of 50%  which is equivalent to 0.33 with MAF 10% or equivalent to 2% of phenotypic variance for : regression model; : GRAMMAR model; : FASTA model; : QTDT model. The power was also calculated for the same true type 1 error rate (Figure ). In that case  the power of the regression model was always lower than that of the FASTA model  which was equal to the power of the GRAMMAR model. The power of the true mixed model is not shown in Figure  because it was almost the same as the power of the FASTA model  except for very low heritabilities and large families (for example  for h = 0.10 and a family size of 60 half-sibs  the power of the FASTA model and the true mixed model were 73.2% and 73.3%  respectively).  The following conditions were tested i.e. true regression coefficient of 0.20 phenotypic standard deviation () with minimum allele frequency (MAF) of 50%  which is equivalent to 0.33  with MAF 10% or equivalent to 2% of phenotypic variance for : regression model; : GRAMMAR model; : FASTA model; : QTDT model. Only the GRAMMAR model resulted in biased estimators of the SNP effect and this is plotted in Figure . The value of the SNP effect was underestimated and the bias increased sharply as heritability increased (-56% for  = 0.50 and families of 60 half-sibs).                                                      Robustness did not deviate greatly with total sample size. For example  with the regression method and for  = 0.50  families of 60 half-sibs and an assumed type 1 error rate of 1%  true type 1 error rate was 11.9% with a total sample of 600 animals and 12.6% with 6000 animals. With the same data structure and the GRAMMAR method  type 1 error rate was 0.38% with 600 animals and 0.35% with 6000 animals. For both the GRAMMAR and FASTA methods  the final models use variance components that are estimated with the same simple random model. Results presented in the previous section were marginal expectations using the distribution of the estimator of the variance components. However  one question is: what happens if the variance components are not estimated using the same sample as that used to estimate the SNP effect? Heritability can be introduced in the model if the user considers that a better estimate of heritability was obtained using other data. Figure  shows type 1 error rate for the GRAMMAR and FASTA methods assuming that true heritability was 0.30 but that the heritability used in models (2b) and (3) was under- or overestimated by 0.05 to 0.55. In the case of underestimated heritability  the type 1 error rate increased with decreasing heritability. For example  consider a large family (60 half-sibs) and a much smaller heritability than the true value (0.05 vs. 0.30). In that case  assuming a 1% type 1 error rate  the expected true type 1 error rate reached 1.9% for the GRAMMAR model  and 2.5% for the FASTA model.  The calculations were done with the GRAMMAR model and the FASTA model with erroneous heritability introduced in the models and a true heritability of 0.30. Our algebraic results can be used as a tool to design populations or estimate the success of a given design before starting the genotyping process. FASTA statistics  which are not subject to type 1 error rate due to population stratification  should be used for this purpose. As shown in Figure   the power of the method mainly depends on the total number of individuals included in the analysis. Although power is only marginally affected by the family structure of the data and by the heritability of the trait  the experimenter may be limited (e.g.  for budgetary reasons) to a fixed total size and may consequently only be able to adjust family structure. Figure  shows how the total population size should be adjusted to obtain a power of 80% for a given family structure for a SNP with a moderate effect of 2% of the phenotypic variance. Results show a difference of 183 individuals between the least and most favorable situations. Although this difference may appear reasonable  183 individuals represented one fifth of the genotyping costs.                                                                                                           The genomic control (GC) inflation factor developped by Delvin and Roeder [] is a very common measure of the deviation of a test’s empirical distribution from its theoretical distribution in association studies. As pointed out by Bacanu et al. []  in the case of multiple Student t tests for quantitative traits  the GC inflation factor may be interpreted as the variance of the normal distribution approximately followed by the Student t distribution. Even if  as presented here  the expectation of the test’s distribution is influenced by population structure under the alternate hypothesis  its variance is closely related to the GC inflation factor. Figure  presents the GC inflation factor  as approximated by this variance as a function of heritability and family structure. It clearly shows that inflation is very limited with the GRAMMAR method but may be considerable with the regression method when families are large and heritability is high.                                                      The formulae presented in the Methods section of this paper are not easy to interpret. In the following  we explain the behavior of each method in common terms. The high type 1 error rate with high heritability for this method was caused by the probability of two half-sibs sharing the same SNP because of their relationship  rather than the effect of a common QTL genotype. If a polygenic effect is present  this local similarity in SNP is confounded with the similarity of relatives in phenotype due to the polygenic effect. The expectation of polygenic effect is null. Thus  the expectation of the estimate of SNP effect is not affected by this confusion between SNP and polygenes: the test is unbiased. However  the variance of the test increases according to the variability of the relationship level in the data. If all animals in the sample share the same level of relationship (e.g. all sample are half-sibs of the same family)  they would all have a similar phenotype and the same probability of sharing the same SNP. Therefore  the increase in type 1 error rate was not caused by close relationships between genotyped animals but by the presence of a mixture of close and more distant relationships. This occurs when independent large families (half-sibs  full-sibs) are present in the data. The effect of this family structure on the variance of the test was proportional to the ratio of the polygenic variance and residual variance and hence increased exponentially with heritability. However  the increase in type 1 error rate with heritability and family size did not systematically result in an increase in power. Under the alternate hypothesis ( = )  the variance of the test was still higher than 1 and increased with heritability  while the expectation of the test did not vary greatly with heritability. So when the threshold chosen for type 1 error rate () was lower than the expectation of the test (power greater than 50%)  a smaller proportion of the normal distribution is expected to be greater than  as heritability increases. This explains why the power for the regression method decreased with heritability and the variance of relationships. In the GRAMMAR model  differences in the type 1 error rate and power with respect to heritability were due to the relationships between animals that were used to simultaneously estimate the polygenic effects and the SNP effect. In this case  the variance of the new phenotype  i.e. the residual of model (2a)  used to test the SNP effect was approximately equal to the residual variance of the true model minus the genetic variance times (1 minus the reliability of estimates of polygenic effects). Reliability is defined as the square correlation between estimate of polygenic effect and true effect. However  due to the covariance between estimates of the polygenic effect of relatives  which are also likely to share the same SNP genotype  the variance of  was proportional to the residual variance of the true model times (1 minus the reliability of estimates of polygenic effects). The difference in these evolutions of the variance of the new phenotype and variance of  as a function of heritability explained the decrease in the variance of the test for a medium value of heritability and hence the decrease in type 1 error rate. The fact that the GRAMMAR estimate effect was greatly biased (and the only one to be so in this comparison of models) did not play a role in the changes in power with heritability  compared to these changes in the variances. If most phenotypes used to estimate the polygenic value of the animal were those of animals that were not genotyped and that had no relationships with the other genotyped animals  the GRAMMAR test would not show these type 1 error rate and power patterns. This may be the case when unrelated genotyped sires are analyzed and their phenotypes are the mean phenotype of non-genotyped progeny. In this case  the estimator of the SNP effect would still be biased downwards but the type 1 error rate and power would be practically unaffected by heritability and family structure. The only difference between the FASTA model and the true mixed model is the error in variance components since they were estimated with a pure random model. Therefore  under the null hypothesis  i.e. without a SNP effect  the variance components were the same and the type 1 error rate was not affected by heritability of the trait or relationships within the sample. Under the alternate hypothesis  the influence of heritability on power was only moderate and affected only with low to medium heritabilities. This is caused by the variance of  which depends on the reliability of the estimates of polygenic effects  due to the mixed model (). This was particularly important when reliability differed from heritability and thus when  decreased more rapidly than residual variance as a function of heritability. This was the case when half-sibs affected the reliability of estimates of polygenic effects  i.e. when heritability was low. As heritability increased  the reliability tended to heritability so the power became less sensitive to changes in heritability and equaled the power observed without a polygenic effect. These differences were observed both with the true mixed model and the FASTA model. The error in the estimation of heritability via the two-step procedure in FASTA had only a very small effect on these differences and was noticeable only for low heritabilities  in which case estimation errors for heritability were higher. As the QTDT method uses information within families  the variance of  was not affected by the relationships that exist between phenotyped animals in the dataset. The variance of  depended only on the trace of Mendelian sampling variance matrix and thus possibly on inbreeding within the data but not on relationships between phenotyped animals (regardless of the type of family  assuming the genotypes of the parents are known). The expectation of  integrating a given relationship matrix over SNP genotypes [See Additional file ] without inbreeding  is . So  the polygenic effect has no influence on this variance. For the same reason  power was not affected by heritability or by the relationship matrix. However  power of the qdtd method was much lower than that of the other models because the test uses only half the genetic variance (only the Mendelian sampling variance). This reduced the expectation of the test by a factor  and consequently decreased power. Type 1 error rate increased with relationships and heritability with the regression method  decreased with the GRAMMAR method  and was not affected by heritability with the FASTA and QTDT methods. The power calculated with an assumed type 1 error rate (not the real type 1 error rate) was higher with the regression method than with the FASTA method for low (large families) to moderate (small families) heritability values. Power was always lower with the GRAMMAR method than with the fasta METHOD. However  for the same true type 1 error rate (i.e. with the threshold chosen to reach the same true type 1 error rate)  power was always lower with the regression method than with the FASTA method and decreased very rapidly with heritability and family size. In this situation  powers of the GRAMMAR and FASTA methods were identical. Thus  using the true type 1 error rate  these two methods have the same power. The power of the two methods was also almost identical to that of the true mixed model  except for very low heritabilities  for which a very slight difference was observed between the FASTA and true mixed models. These results are in general agreement with the few papers on the subject that are present in the literature. Using a simple example with three pedigrees  [] demonstrated that the type 1 error rate of the regression method increased with heritability and family size (from unrelated small nuclear families to a mixture of half- and full-sib families in pig-type pedigrees)  while the opposite was observed with the GRAMMAR method  which is fully consistent with our Figures a and b. The authors also ranked the methods in order of decreasing empirical power: FASTA > GRAMMAR > regression > TDT  and found very little difference in power between the true model and the FASTA method. Using a limited range of family sizes from 1 to 4  Zhang et al. [] found that the power of the QTDT method increased with family size  a result that is in agreement with the slight increase we observed for increases in family size from 5 to 60. Erbe et al. [] confirmed that the GRAMMAR method allowed for better control of the type 1 error rate than the regression method  and found that in a population of 500 progenies  the type 1 error rate was greater when the progeny came from 25 rather than from 250 sires. Therefore  as a general result  we do not recommend the regression and GRAMMAR models but do recommend the FASTA method. The FASTA method is very close to the full mixed model but is expected to be computationally faster. However  situations do exist for which the first two methods are preferred and using the FASTA method could be dangerous. The advantage of the regression model is that no heritability is required  so it could be useful when heritability is unknown or when the number of animals is too low to estimate heritability based on the data. The regression method may also be useful in situations in which having a large type 1 error rate is not a problem  for example if the objective is to first select markers before performing another type of analysis  since here the aim is to select only good markers  regardless of the number of bad ones. The advantage of the GRAMMAR method is that it has the same power as the FASTA method when corrected for underestimation of the type 1 error rate and that it allows derivation of empirical p-values  as residuals can be permuted. Correcting for underestimation of the type 1 error rate can be performed easily using analytical formulae or by analyzing the QQ plot []  which would allow for a faster analysis than with the FASTA model. Moreover  if the GRAMMAR method uses an estimate of the polygenic heritability from another experiment and from animals that have no relationships with other genotyped animals  the GRAMMAR method is as robust and powerful as the FASTA method. Concerning the situations in which use of FASTA could be dangerous  the FASTA (and GRAMMAR) method depends on the variance components that are introduced. The difference between the expected heritability estimated in the pure random model and the true one was small when the fixed SNP effect was small  so the final effect of this error in the heritability used was not significant (the low performance of the GRAMMAR method was due to the use of residuals  not to the error on heritability). This explains why the FASTA method is close to the full mixed model (in type 1 error rate and power). However  what would happen if a variance component other than the one estimated in the sample was used or if fortuitously  the variance component given by the sample was very different from the true one? What happens to the conditional distribution of the test when using an incorrect heritability? In this case  the coefficient in the GRAMMAR method involving the difference in heritability is important and increases the variance of the test. The difference between true and used heritabilities produces a high coefficient for low values of used heritabilities and increases the variance of the test and then type 1 error rates. Since GRAMMAR is supposed to be a very conservative method  the difference observed between expected and obtained type 1 error rates may be surprising. The FASTA method behaved similarly but only a considerably underestimated heritability produced moderate increases in type 1 error rates. In this case  the true power (for true type 1 error rate) was reduced when heritability was underestimated (-4% when heritability was 0.10 instead of the true value of 0.30) but the decrease remained limited. Therefore  it appears that the fasta method works regardless of which estimate of heritability is used. When using the FASTA method  underestimating heritability was actually more risky (in terms of type 1 error rate and power) than overestimating it. However  it should be kept in mind that the power of even the true mixed model is lower for moderate heritabilities than for heritabilities of 0 or 1  regardless of the method used. It should be noted that this discussion concerned only the first and second moments of the test statistics and did not compare higher moments such as skewness and kurtosis  which could also be of interest. Analytical formulae of the first and second moments of the distribution of the test statistics used to detect the SNP effect in four of the most common models are given in the case of structured populations due to relationships between individuals. These formulae were used to compute the type 1 error rate and power of these methods for any type of genetic relationships between phenotyped and genotyped individuals in any situation of heritability for a polygenic effect. The objective was to determine if these formulae can be easily used to obtain the correct type 1 error rate and to calculate the power in order to design data collection. An R program is provided in Additional file  [See Additional file ]. This paper also gives general results concerning the efficacy of each method. The type 1 error rate increased with the variability of relationships among phenotyped and genotyped individuals and with heritability for the regression method  decreased for the GRAMMAR method and was not affected for the FASTA and QTDT methods. For the same true type 1 error rate  powers of the GRAMMAR and FASTA methods were the same but that of the QTDT method was low. In conclusion  we do not recommend the regression and GRAMMAR models but do recommend the FASTA method  which gives results very close to the full mixed model.

Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is a common allergic skin disease in various horse breeds found throughout the world  and results from bites of  spp. Sensitive horses develop a severe itch  which results in self-inflicted trauma and severely affected horses sometimes need to be euthanized[]. Welfare of affected horses is therefore reduced. No cure is available  and methods to prevent or reduce clinical symptoms often require dedication from the owner and greatly differ in efficiency e.g.[–]. Owners of affected horses incur costs related to preventive or curative methods and veterinary consultation. Moreover  the commercial value of affected horses is reduced and use of affected horses can be restricted due to discomfort and disfiguration[]. Insect bite hypersensitivity is a multi-factorial disorder that is affected by environmental and genetic factors. Environmental factors are  among others  related to  spp. density. Partial genetic control has been confirmed in various horse breeds[–]. Monogenic inheritance of sensitivity to IBH has been rejected by segregation analysis[]  which showed a polygenic mode of inheritance. However  little is known on the genes contributing to genetic variance. Genomic research on IBH using a candidate gene approach or genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been limited. Using a candidate gene approach  Andersson et al.[] showed that variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region are associated with IBH sensitivity. The same allele (:274) increased IBH sensitivity in both Swedish-born Icelandic horses (odds ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.19) and Exmoor ponies (odds ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.48). Moreover  homozygosity across the MHC class II region increased IBH sensitivity in both breeds. Serological research on IBH has also shown a significant difference in the distribution of specific MHC antigens between cases and controls[  ]. The MHC genes in the horse  known as equine lymphocyte antigen (ELA) genes  are located on horse chromosome () ECA20 and their resulting protein structures recognize many foreign molecules  thereby evoking an immune response[]. Using GWAS  Schurink et al.[] found associations between ECA20 and IBH. The identified genomic region was approximately 8 Mb from the MHC region and was poorly covered in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from the marker panel. Schurink et al.[] identified 24 SNP on 12 chromosomes in Shetland pony mares associated with IBH sensitivity (-<U+2009>log<U+2009> (p) >2.5). Insect bite hypersensitivity is observed in many horse breeds throughout the world and could have common genetic components across breeds. Across-breed analyses could facilitate fine-mapping by reducing the length of associated genomic regions  since haplotypes shared across breeds are expected to be shorter than within-breed haplotypes e.g.[  ]. The aim of our study was to expand these findings through identification and quantification of genomic associations with IBH using phenotypic and SNP information from Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses in the Netherlands. Knowledge of genomic regions associated with IBH will contribute to our understanding of its biology  enabling more efficient selection  therapy and prevention in order to decrease IBH prevalence. Cases were defined as individuals showing clinical IBH symptoms  while controls were free of symptoms despite exposure to  spp. Selection of cases and controls was described in detail by Schurink et al.[]  and cases and controls were matched on various factors to minimize effects of population stratification. Shetland pony mares were recruited through routine inspections in 2009 and through publications by the studbook in their magazine and on their website in 2010. Shetland pony mares were matched on withers height category  coat colour  location and sire. Icelandic horses were recruited in 2010 through publications on various equine related websites and were matched on coat colour  location  sex  importation from Iceland (yes/no) and sire. Age at onset is generally between 2 and 4 years-of-age e.g.[]. Therefore  controls were required to be at least 4 years-of-age and to have been at least one year at risk for developing symptoms. Proximity to a case was required to ensure exposure to  spp. and thereby increase reliability of phenotypes on controls. Paternal half-sibs were sought to minimize population stratification due to pedigree. The dataset (Table) contained 200 Shetland pony mares and 146 Icelandic horses. The same Shetland pony mares analysed by Schurink et al.[] were included in our study  although 70 k genotype data were available  since the mares were re-genotyped. Participating owners were visited by an experienced veterinarian and researcher to take blood samples  score phenotypes and conduct an IBH related questionnaire (more details in Schurink et al.[]). All Icelandic horses and most Shetland pony mares (95.0%) were scored by the same veterinarian (Table) to ensure uniform classification. Blood sample collection from Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses was approved by the Board on Animal Ethics and Experiments from Wageningen University (experiments 2009055 and 2010109). Shetland pony mare data contained 103 cases and 97 controls collected in autumn 2009 or 2010 (Table). Data contained half-sib mares (50.0% of the data) descending from 41 sires with both case(s) and control(s) among their offspring  and mares (50.0% of the data) descending from 88 sires with only case(s) or control(s) among their offspring. Mares were located on 73 premises. The number of mares per premise ranged from 1 (23.3% of all premises) to 9 (2.7%) and the mean number of mares per premise was 2.7. Icelandic horse data contained 73 cases and 73 controls collected in autumn 2010 (Table). It contained both females (64.4%) and males (i.e. geldings and stallions; 35.6%) (Table). In total  13.0% of Icelandic horses were imported from Iceland and 87.0% were born in Europe (mainly the Netherlands) (Table). Data contained half-sib horses (45.2% of the data) descending from 23 sires with both case(s) and control(s) among their offspring  and horses (54.8% of the data) descending from 72 sires with only case(s) or control(s) among their offspring. Horses were located on 31 premises. The number of horses per premise ranged from 1 (19.4% of all premises) to 14 (3.2%) and the mean number of horses per premise was 4.7. Genotypes from all Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses were obtained using the equine HD chip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) containing 65 157 SNP. Those SNP with a call-rate<U+2009><<U+2009>90% or minor allele frequency<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02 were excluded from the data. Call-rate per animal was considered sufficient (> 90%) for all animals. The majority (319 out of 346) of animals had a call-rate greater than 99%. After breed-specific quality control (applying the same quality control to each breed separately)  the Shetland pony mare data contained 46 888 SNP and the Icelandic horse data contained 51 453 SNP. Cases and controls were matched on various factors to minimize effects of population stratification and thereby reduce possible spurious associations. To test whether matching of cases and controls in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses was successful  the relation between IBH (case or control  binary phenotype) and matching factors was assessed in univariable and multivariable models using the LOGISTIC procedure incorporated in SAS 9.2© software (SAS Institute Inc.  Cary  NC). Fixed effects of withers height category  coat colour  sex  import from Iceland  veterinarian and month and year of scoring  and the covariate of age of the animal were tested for significance. Similar genomic kinship within and across cases and controls indicates successful matching on pedigree. Breed-specific genomic kinship among animals was therefore computed using the  function of the R package GenABEL[] as: where  is the genomic kinship (identity-by-state) between animal  and   based on <U+2009>=<U+2009>48 810 autosomal SNP in Icelandic horses (SNP with call-rate<U+2009><<U+2009>90%  monomorphic SNP and SNP on the X chromosome excluded) and 44 576 autosomal SNP in Shetland pony mares;  or  are the genotypes (coded as 0  ½  1) of the i or j animal for SNP  and  is the frequency of the allele (top strand). The genomic kinship matrix was transformed to a distance matrix to perform classical multidimensional scaling[]  which returned the first two principal components. The principal components for each breed were plotted to visualize distances between animals and more specifically between cases and controls. Further  Icelandic horses were categorized into ‘imported from Iceland’ or ‘born in Europe’ to see whether their genetic background differed. Breed-specific GWAS were performed using genotypes from the same marker panel but the number of SNP after quality control differed between Shetland pony mares (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>46 888) and Icelandic horses (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>51 453). The Bayesian variable selection method Bayes-C with a threshold model  described by Kizilkaya et al.[] and implemented in the GenSel software ()  was used to identify and quantify genomic regions associated with IBH. Method Bayes-C assumes a common variance for all SNP in the model and is less sensitive to the prior for genetic variance e.g.[–] compared to Bayes-B as described by Meuwissen et al.[]. Method Bayes-C fits all SNP simultaneously using a mixture threshold model and assuming additive SNP effects: where  is the linear predictor that is related to observed IBH phenotypes (case/control) through a probit link function and was sampled during each iteration from a normal distribution that comprises the liability scale corresponding to the observed threshold score following Sorensen et al.[];  is an overall mean;  is the number of SNP;  is the column vector representing the genotype covariate at SNP  (input as AA<U+2009>=<U+2009>-10  AB<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  BB<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 with missing genotypes set to the average value of the particular SNP in the data set);  is the random allele substitution effect of SNP   and  is a random 0/1 variable indicating the absence (with probability ) or presence (with probability 1<U+2009>-<U+2009>) of SNP  in the model. In our analyses   was set to 0.999  resulting in roughly 30 to 70 SNP being included in the model in any particular iteration. Fewer SNP than individuals were fitted in any iteration to decrease the risk of overfitting the data  and previous work[] showed that a limited number of SNP reach significance level. The allele substitution effect for SNP  () was assumed normally distributed <U+2009>(0 <U+2009>) conditional on  when SNP  was included in the model (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)  but  was 0 when <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. Variance  was assumed to follow a scaled inverse chi-square distribution with <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 degrees of freedom and scale parameter   which was derived from the additive genetic variance as according to Gianola et al.[] and Kizilkaya et al.[]. The prior of  was derived from the heritability of IBH on the liability scale (= 24%)  as estimated in a pedigree-based population genetic analysis by Schurink et al.[]. Residual variance  is not identifiable and was set to 1 and not sampled. Sampling of effects is described in more detail by Kizilkaya et al.[]. A total of 200 000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations were run  with a burn-in period of 20 000 iterations. Model frequency  i.e. the proportion of total post burn-in iterations in which a particular SNP was included in the model  was used as evidence for an associated SNP. However  if consecutive SNP are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a particular quantitative trait locus (QTL)  effects and model frequencies may be distributed across those SNP  and effects and model frequencies of individual SNP will completely capture the effects of the QTL. Thus  a window approach  which accumulates effects of adjacent SNP  was used to better identify genomic regions associated with QTL[]. The approach described by Wolc et al.[] and implemented in version 4.0 of the GenSel software () was used to identify associated windows (i.e. genomic regions). For this purpose  physical map order (build EquCab2.0) was used to allocate SNP to consecutive non-overlapping 1 Mb windows (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2376)  and the posterior distribution of the percentage of genomic variance explained by each of these windows was derived. For this purpose  the variance of genomic breeding values for each window (= window genomic variance) was computed among individuals for every 100 iteration of the MCMC chain based on the marker effects sampled in that iteration. Window genomic variance was divided by genomic variance explained (sum of all SNP) across the genome in that particular iteration to determine the percentage of genomic variance explained by the window. The resulting posterior distribution of the % variance of each window was used for testing. The posterior distribution included results from iterations that excluded the window (or SNP) from the model. Window genomic variance greater than 0.04% [i.e. the expected percentage of variance explained by each window in an infinitesimal model ()]  was used as a threshold to declare regions that explained more variance than expected. Questionnaire results from Shetland pony mare and Icelandic horse cases are shown in Table. In Icelandic horses  questionnaire data from 14 out of 73 cases was missing. The observed clinical symptoms of IBH in all cases are summarized in Table. Severity of itch was lower in Icelandic horse cases compared with Shetland pony mare cases (Table)  probably because eczema blankets (a preventive measure) were used in many Icelandic horse cases. Preventive or curative measures were applied more often for Icelandic horse cases than for Shetland pony mare cases (Table) and more measures per case were applied to Icelandic horse cases compared to Shetland pony mare cases. Owners of cases replied that they experienced negative effects of IBH  as it reduces equine welfare  requires much time and limits rideability and marketability. For both Icelandic horses and Shetland pony mares  questionnaire results and observed clinical symptoms agreed with the typical course of IBH e.g.[]. Matching of Shetland pony mares to minimize effects of population stratification was successful  as none of the matching factors had a significant effect on IBH (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Analysis of matching factors in Icelandic horses indicated that import from Iceland (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002) had a significant effect on IBH. To test whether matching of cases and controls based on sire was successful  breed-specific genomic kinship among animals was computed based on identity-by-state of SNP genotypes. Figures and show the first two principal components of the transformed breed-specific kinship matrices to visualize genetic distances between animals. The multidimensional scaling plots showed a high degree of overlap between cases and controls in both Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses (Figure). Effects of population stratification due to pedigree were therefore limited. -. Each point corresponds to one animal and indicates the distance between animals represented by the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2)  based on the genomic kinship matrices. -. Each point corresponds to one animal and indicates the distance between animals represented by the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2)  based on the genomic kinship matrices. Two imported approved stallion cases were more distant to the other Icelandic horses in our dataset  although the imported Icelandic horses seemed to originate from a similar genetic background (Figure). However  imported Icelandic horses (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>17 cases and n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 controls) were removed from the analyses due to less successful matching of Icelandic horses on import status (Table and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002 for import status). The final Icelandic horse data therefore included 56 cases and 71 controls and were all born in Europe. In Shetland pony mares  13% of variance was explained by all SNP  which is lower than the pedigree-based estimate of heritability of IBH on the liability scale (24%  SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>6%) in Shetland pony mares in the Netherlands[]. The 20 non-overlapping windows that explained the largest percentages of genetic variance were located on nine chromosomes (Table). The percentage of genetic variance explained by the top 20 associated windows ranged from 0.62 to 0.14% (Table) and was highest for the window on chromosome 20 position 35 Mb (Table). In 2.7 to 5.3% of iterations of the MCMC (Table)  the percentage of variance explained by a window exceeded the expected percentage of variance explained (i.e. 0.04%). For each of the top 20 associated windows  the SNP with the highest model frequency is presented in Table  including the frequency of the unfavourable allele in cases and controls. In Icelandic horses born in Europe  28% of variance was explained by all SNP  which is equal to the pedigree-based estimate of heritability of IBH on the liability scale (27%  SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>17%) in Swedish-born Icelandic horses[]. The 20 windows explaining the largest percentages of genetic variance were located on 14 chromosomes (Table). The percentage of genetic variance explained by the top 20 associated windows ranged from 0.66 to 0.14% (Table) and was highest for the window on chromosome X position 59 Mb (Table). In 2.2 to 7.9% of iterations of the MCMC (Table)  the percentage of variance explained by a window exceeded the expected percentage of variance explained (i.e. 0.04%). For each of the top 20 associated windows  the SNP with the highest model frequency is presented in Table. A comparison of associated genomic regions in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses (using the percentage of genetic variance explained by 1 Mb non-overlapping windows in the breed-specific GWAS) is depicted in Figure. An overlap in the top 20 associated genomic regions (= 0.14% of genomic variance explained) was found on chromosomes 3  7  11  20 and 23 (within 5 to 15 Mb)  and represent the most promising candidate regions to follow-up on. . Non-overlapping 1 Mb windows are based on the physical order of consecutive SNP across the genome (ECA1 to X; build EquCab2.0); black bars represent windows explaining<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.14% of genetic variance and dashed black bars represent windows explaining between 0.12 and 0.14% of genetic variance; diminishing grey colour represents a decrease in genetic variance (< 0.12%) explained by windows. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify genomic regions associated with IBH in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses in the Netherlands. Breed-specific GWAS were performed and overlapping associated genomic regions (within 15 Mb or less) were identified in both breeds. Data were gathered according to a matched case–control design to limit unwanted spurious associations due to population stratification  which might be caused by confounding of ‘the trait of interest’ with pedigree and other relevant (e.g. environmental) effects e.g.[]. Population stratification due to pedigree was minimized by including paternal half-sib pairs. The multidimensional scaling plots based on breed-specific genomic kinship showed a high degree of overlap between cases and controls (Figure). Also  the Bayes method accounts for population stratification due to pedigree by fitting all SNP simultaneously e.g.[]. In Shetland pony mares  confounding of IBH with relevant effects such as region and withers height category was negligible  since the analysis revealed no significant association between IBH and these effects. In Icelandic horses  importation from Iceland had a significant effect on IBH (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002). Our results showed (Figure) that differences in genetic background between imported Icelandic horses and Icelandic horses born in Europe were limited  which agrees with Broström et al.[] and Andersson et al.[]. However   spp. is absent in Iceland and consequently IBH is not observed e.g.[]. Increased environmental pressure after export and lack of exposure to  spp. before export are suggested to result in increased incidence and more severe cases after export e.g.[  ]. The insect bite hypersensitivity statuses of imported Icelandic horses and Icelandic horses born in Europe may not represent the exact same phenotype. The final Icelandic horse data  therefore  only included horses born in Europe. Schurink et al.[] published genomic regions associated with IBH in 188 Shetland pony mares using 50 k SNP genotypes. In our study  several similar associated genomic regions within 1 Mb distance were identified in Shetland pony mares on chromosomes 3  11  20 and 27. However  Schurink et al.[] used logistic regression fitting single SNP effects  while our Bayes-C method fitted all SNP simultaneously. Mucha et al.[] concluded that estimated variances of identified QTL were not overestimated when all SNP were fitted simultaneously  since the variance explained will be distributed across all SNP in high LD with the QTL and therefore cannot exceed the total variance (in contrast to single SNP analysis). Indeed  Sahana et al.[] compared various association mapping methods and showed that a Bayesian variable selection model that fitted all SNP simultaneously performed best overall. The Bayesian variable selection model using the posterior probability of a QTL in 1 cM overlapping regions to identify associated genomic regions had the highest power to map small QTL (i.e. explaining 2% of genetic variance) and most precise estimates of QTL location. However  a mixed model analysis fitting random additive genetic effects and testing single SNP performed almost as well  although it was computationally more demanding and multiple testing correction was needed. Like in Sahana et al.[]  analysis of the Shetland pony mare data using logistic regression with single SNP effects  as in Schurink et al.[]  was computationally much more demanding than the Bayesian variable selection method used here and ignored dependencies between SNP. Although several similar associated genomic regions were identified using these two methods  Bayesian variable selection model using posterior probabilities of genomic regions is preferred as it is computationally less demanding  it does not require correction for multiple testing and it accounts for population stratification due to pedigree by fitting all SNP simultaneously. The window approach takes LD between SNP into account and is therefore a better criterion for QTL identification than posterior probabilities of single SNP[  ]. However  optimal choice of the size of a window is not clear  as a specific window may contain more than one QTL or a QTL may be spread over more than one window[]. For example  after merging windows at 75 and 76 Mb on chromosome 17 in Shetland pony mares and performing another GWAS  the percentage of variance explained by this 2 Mb genomic region was 0.426  which roughly equals the sum of genetic variance explained by the two separate 1 Mb windows (Table). Because these 1 Mb windows were consecutive  the percentage of variance explained by the 2 Mb windows might be considered as total QTL variance (if indeed the two consecutive 1 Mb windows represent the same QTL)  whereas the percentage of variance explained by each 1 Mb might each represent a proportion of QTL variance. However  the true QTL position might not be contained in the window with strongest association. Precision of QTL mapping depends on several factors  such as the method of analysis  marker density  sample size and variance explained by the QTL[]. In a simulated data set of binary phenotypes and SNP genotypes by Mucha et al.[]  the mean distance of estimates from true QTL positions ranged from 0.30 to 0.77 Mb  depending on the method of analysis used. However  the SNP density simulated by Mucha et al.[] was higher than in our study. Because LD can differ between genomic regions e.g.[  ]  LD within a genomic region could be used to determine the optimal size of a window in a given region  although further research is needed to determine the relationship between LD structure and optimal window size. Associated genomic regions identified in both breeds (Figure) suggest interesting candidate genomic regions to follow-up on. A simultaneous GWAS of both breeds is expected to increase power to detect associations  as more data would be included. However  GWAS across breeds will be less likely to detect SNP that are in LD with QTL in only one breed and will be more likely to detect SNP in LD with QTL across both breeds  provided LD phase is conserved across breeds e.g.[  ]. To meet these requirements  SNP and QTL need to be physically close or  ideally  represent the actual mutation (which is unlikely). De Roos et al.[] concluded that roughly 50 000 SNP are required to have sufficient LD (i.e. = 0.20) for genomic selection within a dairy cattle breed but that 300 000 SNP are required to find SNP that are in LD with the QTL across breeds. Persistency of LD phase extended less than 10 kb between bovine breeds that diverged hundreds of generations ago[]. The consistency of LD phase between Shetland ponies and Icelandic horses was not investigated. Shetland ponies and Icelandic horses did cluster together in the phylogenetic analysis of van de Goor et al.[]  which used equine short tandem repeat loci. However  divergence of the breeds occurred many generations ago  thus LD from the ancestral population is expected to have been broken down[]. Also  the current equine SNP density results in insufficient LD (roughly 0.3[]) to expect to find SNP that are in LD with QTL across breeds. Research on IBH using the candidate gene approach or GWAS in horses has been limited. Using a candidate gene approach  Andersson et al.[] concluded that  (serine peptidase inhibitor  Kazal type 5) on ECA14 was not associated with IBH in Swedish-born Icelandic horses. In our study  no genomic regions associated with IBH were found on ECA14. Horin et al.[] investigated polymorphisms in various immune response related genes to identify associations with .  and .  that cause respectively lung and gastrointestinal infections in horses. Several polymorphisms were significantly associated with these infections  including microsatellite locus HMS01 on ECA15. Marti et al.[] in[] concluded that locus HMS01 is associated with IBH. In our study  genomic regions associated with IBH were identified on ECA15 but only in Icelandic horses. Various  (interleukin 1) related genes are located in or around these regions. We anticipated a common genetic background of IBH across breeds  although breed-specific genetic influences on IBH cannot be excluded. However  SNP densities within genomic regions could differ between Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses due to breed-specific edits based on MAF and call-rate. Also  LD between SNP and QTL might be present in one breed but absent in the other e.g.[]  thereby impeding validation of QTL across breeds. Associated genomic regions identified in both Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses were considered most interesting to follow-up on and were found on ECA3  7  11  20 and 23 (Figure  Tables and). However  positional candidate genes adjacent to associated genomic regions were identified only for the genomic region on ECA20. No other candidate gene with known function in immunology or allergy was identified in or adjacent to across-breed associated genomic regions. The equine lymphocyte antigen (ELA) class II region is located on ECA20 (spanning 32 and 33 Mb) between the associated genomic regions identified in the Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses (Tables and  Figure). ELA  or equine major histocompatibility complex  evokes an immune response by recognizing many foreign molecules[]. Both serological[  ] and genomic research[] have identified an association between ELA class II antigens and IBH. Andersson et al.[] concluded that the same allele at an ELA locus is associated with IBH in two distinct horse breeds and homozygosity across the ELA region increased IBH sensitivity. An association with IBH on ECA20 was also found by Schurink et al.[]  although the identified region was approximately 8 Mb away from the ELA class II region. However  coverage within the region was poor for the Illumina® EquineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina Inc.) used by Schurink et al.[]  but improved in the current equine HD chip. Associated genomic regions on ECA20 that were identified in the Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses were within 2 Mb from the ELA class II region  which is reasonably close to confirm the impact of ELA class II region on IBH. The genome-wide association study performed here identified several genomic regions associated with IBH in both Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses. On ECA20  associated genomic regions were identified in both breeds that were within 2 Mb from the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region containing candidate genes. Knowledge on genes associated with IBH will contribute to our understanding of its biology  enabling more efficient therapy  prevention and selection in order to decrease IBH prevalence. Sequencing candidate genes within the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region might identify the functional mutation. Selection on functional mutations  i.e. direct markers  is more effective than indirect markers (i.e. LD and linkage equilibrium markers)[]. However  genetic gain for marker-assisted selection using only a small number of significant markers to trace a limited number of QTL (although often with larger effects) is likely to be small because a large number of QTL are expected to explain genetic variation in complex traits e.g.[]. In genomic selection  dense genome-wide markers are used to estimate genomic breeding values based on marker effects across the entire genome. Marker density is assumed to be sufficient so that each QTL is in LD with at least one marker or with a set of markers. Therefore  genomic selection could potentially capture the total genetic variance for a complex trait e.g.[]. Possibilities for genomic selection on IBH in horse populations or even across horse populations and corresponding implications must be investigated before implementation is considered.

This will be particularly interesting for traits that cannot be recorded on the selection candidates and require the use of sib tests  such as disease resistance and meat quality. In traditional aquaculture breeding schemes  selection for traits that cannot be measured on the selection candidates (e.g. disease resistance and fillet quality) is based on a performance test of sibs of the candidates  i.e. information on test sibs is used to calculate breeding values for the selection of parents. This is due to the fact that measuring meat quality traits requires killing of the fish and fish that have been challenge-tested for disease resistance cannot be used as breeding stock. However  with a sib test  only 50% of the total genetic variance of the candidates is exploited  perhaps less. Recently  with the advent of high-throughput genotyping of genetic markers  genomic selection[] has been taken up by animal breeders. With genomic selection  the total genetic value of the selection candidates is predicted based on the simultaneous estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects using a set of individuals that have been genotyped and phenotyped[]. Compared to traditional genetic evaluation methodologies and marker-assisted selection  genomic selection can result in an increase in the accuracy of selection for an individual without a phenotype provided that the test set is sufficiently large and relevant to the selected population[]. Genomic selection is increasingly used in dairy cattle breeding[–] and in plant breeding[  ] but is not yet used in selective breeding in aquaculture. Simulation studies have examined possible strategies to implement genomic selection in family-based aquaculture breeding schemes  generally following two stages[]: first  SNP marker effects are estimated in a test population consisting of sibs of the selection candidates and second  genome-wide breeding values of the genotyped selection candidates are estimated by summing up the estimated SNP marker effects. The benefits reported from these strategies are promising. In one study[]  in which sibs were performance-tested every generation  the accuracy of the estimated breeding values of selection candidates increased  which increased genetic gain because genetic gain is directly related to the accuracy of selection. In addition  genomic selection more than halved the rate of inbreeding compared to traditional BLUP selection using similar resources. A major contributor to these results is the accurate estimation of the within-family variance with genomic selection. Other studies have supported these findings[]. Two factors are important for maximizing the accuracy of genomic breeding values: (1) increasing the precision of estimates of SNP marker effects in the test population; this can be achieved by increasing the number of animals in the test population and by increasing the number of SNP markers sufficiently to capture the genetic variance throughout the genome[  ]; (2) maximising the relationship between individuals in the test and candidate populations[]. Another means of increasing the accuracy of estimates of SNP effects is to have the test population consist of extreme genotypes. This approach has been exploited with the use of double haploids for QTL mapping in fish[]. Double haploids are homozygous for all loci and thus achieve in a single generation more homozygosity than 10 generations of continuous full-sib mating[]. Double haploids are produced by chromosome manipulation techniques such as gynogenesis and androgenesis  which produce female and male double haploids  respectively. With both these techniques  the duplicated chromosomes can be combined either before (mitotic) or after recombination (meiotic). Although the availability of double haploids is a major advantage in fish breeding  a number of drawbacks have also been reported  including technological challenges  costs of implementation  and the low viability of the progeny due to inbreeding depression[]. An alternative approach to increasing homozygosity is to use non-random mating designs such as maximum coancestry mating. Based on these considerations  it is hypothesized that designing a test population using double haploids or non-random mating can increase the accuracy of estimates of SNP effects in test sibs  which in turn will increase the accuracy of predicted breeding values when applied in genomic selection schemes. Given the reliance of many aquaculture schemes on sib testing  this hypothesis was tested by simulating a typical breeding scheme in fish. Simulation of populations was carried out in two steps: (1) to create base populations (G0) with a set of genomic data and (2) to simulate breeding schemes derived from these base populations. Details are presented in the following section. We simulated a Fisher-Wright population with an effective population size of 1000 (500 males and 500 females) for 4000 generations to construct the base population G0. Four thousand generations has been shown to be sufficient to achieve mutation-drift equilibrium and stationary distributions of pair-wise linkage disequilibrium[]. Within each of these generations  500 males and 500 females were produced by random selection and mating of a sire and dam  with replacement after each mating. A diploid genome with 10 chromosomes of 1 Morgan (M) each was simulated. SNP mutations and recombinations were introduced every generation at a rate of 10 per base pair per meiosis  assuming 10 base pairs per M  which is close to the infinite sites mutation model[]. SNP were passed from parent to offspring following Mendelian inheritance and recombination followed the Haldane mapping function[]. After 4000 generations  the G0 generation was created with N = 3000 and N = 3000 offspring obtained from the random mating of  = 50 sires and n = 50 dams with replacement. To obtain a reliable result  the base population was replicated 100 times. For each base population  six different breeding schemes were run. The average of these replicates was used for comparison of the breeding schemes. Quantitative SNP effects were simulated to attribute breeding values to each individual for the trait evaluated in the sib test  as described in the following section. Males and females from each G0 family were equally divided to create a test population and a candidate population  each with 3000 individuals. The phenotypes and genotypes of the test population were then evaluated using genomic evaluation techniques to estimate the SNP effects. Genomic estimated breeding values (EBV) for the candidates were computed based on their genotypes and these estimates. The best  = 50 male and  = 50 female candidates were selected to be sires and dams based on the EBV and randomly mated in pairs with  = 120 offspring/pair to produce generation G1 with 6000 offspring. Generation G0 also acted as the base population for pedigree numerator relationships. In G1  the procedure for G0 was repeated up to the point of mating. The offspring were divided into test and candidate populations. Genomic evaluation was carried out using the phenotypes of the test population to estimate SNP effects; the best  = 50 male and  = 50 female candidates were then selected. In the genomic evaluation of G1  the accumulated data from both G0 and G1 test populations were used to estimate SNP effects. The selected males and females in G1 were then used to produce a candidate population and a test population in G2. The mating of the G2 individuals defined the different breeding schemes of the study. For all schemes  the 3000 individuals from the G2 candidate population were created by pair-wise random mating among the  = 50 sires and  = 50 dams. However  individuals in the test population were created either as diploids following random mating  or following minimum or maximum coancestry mating  or as double haploids as described in the following section. Finally  in G2  SNP effects were re-estimated using all the accumulated test data from G0  G1  and G2. Then  the genomic EBV of the candidates were calculated and comparisons among the different breeding schemes were made. Two types of approaches were adopted to design the test population in G2: a diploid approach in which mating among G1 parents was managed  and a double haploid approach following the random mating among the G1 parents. Three diploid approaches were simulated as follows:                                      Mating pairs were chosen from the  and  selected parents using random sampling without replacement to produce the G2 test population. Mating pairs were re-sampled from the same sets of parents to produce the G2 candidate population. This was done to allow fair comparisons with the assortative mating schemes described below.                                      Using the selected males and females  mating pairs were chosen to maximize the average coancestry of the mates based on pedigree. First  a matrix of coancestries for all possible matings was constructed. Starting from an initial set of mating pairs  two pairs were chosen at random and their mates swapped. If this resulted in an increase in average coancestry  the swap was accepted  otherwise it was rejected. This was repeated until no further improvement was obtained.                                      Minimum coancestry mating was the same as maximum coancestry mating  except that mating pairs were designed to minimize average coancestry among the set of mates as in[]. Three double haploid approaches were simulated. For all three approaches  the parents and mating pairs that created the G2 test and candidate populations were the same randomly selected group. In  1500 progeny each were created by mitotic androgenesis from the G1 male parents  and by mitotic gynogenesis from the G1 female parents. Each parent produced 30 double haploid offspring. In   all 3000 progeny came from the 50 male G1 parents by mitotic androgenesis  with 60 offspring per parent and no contribution from the female G1 parents. In   G1 female parents contributed all the offspring by mitotic gynogenesis in a similar fashion as  In G0  a random sample of 1000 SNP from among those with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.05 were assigned to be QTL. Additive allelic values were assigned to each QTL by independent sampling of effects from a Laplace distribution. True breeding values were computed as the sum of allelic effects at the 1000 QTL as follows: where  is the number of copies of allele  ( = 0  1 or 2) at the  QTL locus of individual  and  is the sampled effect. Allelic effects were then scaled to set the total genetic variance () observed in G0 equal to 10. Phenotypes with a heritability of 0.05  0.1 or 0.4 were created by sampling environmental deviations from appropriate normal distributions and added these to the true breeding value. The  = 5000 SNP loci with the highest MAF  excluding those that had been selected to be QTL  were selected as markers and the test and candidate sibs were genotyped for these  markers. Estimation of SNP effects followed the GS-BLUP model[] for  phenotypes with the  marker loci: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is the standardized number of a randomly chosen reference allele (allele “1”) carried by animal  at the  marker locus as described below   is the effect of allele “1” at locus   and  is a vector of random errors assumed to be distributed as (0 <U+2009>). The variance of each marker effect was assumed to be drawn from identical independent distributions with. standardized number of “1” alleles was computed as: where  is the frequency of allele “1” at the  marker locus and  is the number of “1” alleles carried by individual . The elements x form the incidence matrix  and the vector of SNP effects  was estimated () from: The EBV of candidate  was predicted by using their SNP genotypes and summing up their marker effects  as estimated using the test population  as: Standardization of SNP covariates  for the candidates was carried out using the same values of  as used for the test animals  i.e. the estimates of frequencies were obtained using both candidate and test sets. Outputs of the base populations obtained from the simulation of the founder ancestors were stored. Each replicate had its own base population. Averages of 100 replicates of each breeding scheme with different scenarios were compared in terms of inbreeding  genetic gain  accuracy of selection and variance reduction generated in G2. Inbreeding coefficients were computed using G0 as the base population. Figure shows the trend in genetic parameters from G0 to G2 for the candidate population. Results are only shown for the  and  schemes and h = 0.05 because of their extreme values  while with the other schemes intermediate values were obtained. More detailed results will be presented in the next section. In the base generation G0  the accuracy of selection (1A)  genetic levels (1B) and levels of inbreeding (1C) were zero and genetic variance (1D) was 10. For all schemes  the onset of inbreeding was in G2. An increasing trend in genetic gain and accuracy of selection was observed from G1 to G2 and genetic variance decreased. Increases in genetic gain and selection accuracy and the reduction in genetic variance were greatest for the  scheme.  ) Accuracy of selection. ) Genetic level. ) Level of inbreeding. ) Genetic variance. Trends of genetic parameters in the candidate population in the  scheme (solid line): half of the test sibs were maternal double haploids and the other half were paternal double haploids in G2 and in the  scheme (dashed line): candidate and test sibs were mated at random in G1; in each scheme there were 1500 males and 1500 female candidate sibs  50 sires and 50 dams were selected each generation and heritability was 0.05. Accuracies of selection generated in the candidate population for all schemes are in Table. The highest accuracy of selection was obtained with the  scheme  while with the  and  schemes it was lowest. As expected   and  were always very similar in accuracy. A substantial increase in accuracy was observed for the  scheme compared to the  scheme. For example  accuracy of selection increased by 19% for h = 0.05  by 12% for h = 0.1 and by 7% for h = 0.4. In contrast  use of a non-random mating scheme had only a small impact on accuracy and none of the differences were statistically significant (p > 0.05). The genetic gains ( ) generated in the candidate population are presented in Table and on the whole they agree with the observed accuracies in Table. The highest   was achieved with the  scheme  while the lowest   was obtained with the  and  schemes. Compared to the  scheme  all schemes had a statistically significant (p > 0.05) increase in   by 22% for h = 0.05  by 12% for h = 0.1 and by 6% for h = 0.4 (Table). Levels of inbreeding generated in the candidate population are in Table. As expected  level of inbreeding decreased as heritability increases. Compared to the diploids schemes  the differences in inbreeding attained appeared to be slightly higher in the double haploids schemes at lower heritability (h=0.05). Thsese differences diminished as heritability increases. In addition  across all level of heritabilities  the level of inbreeding generated in the double haploid and diploid schemes were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from each other. The genetic variances generated in the candidate population are in Table. As a result of selection of parents in G1  the genetic variance was reduced by 15% to 30% in G2 compared to G0  depending on the scheme and heritability. Comparisons among the double haploid schemes show that the genetic variance retained was slightly higher in the  and  schemes and lower in the  scheme. In contrast  the genetic variances retained within the diploid schemes were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from each other  and for higher heritabilities tended to be intermediate between the  and the single sex double haploid schemes. Overall  the pattern of differences in genetic variances between heritabilities and schemes was qualitatively similar to the pattern observed for differences in accuracies (Table). It has been reported that genomic selection in aquaculture breeding schemes can increase selection accuracy for candidates and increase genetic gain compared to traditional aquaculture sib testing schemes[    ]. Our study shows that  when using genomic selection  creating double haploids as part of the process of sib testing can increase the selection accuracy of candidates and the genetic gain even more. These additional increases in accuracy and genetic gain were most dramatic with a low heritability (~22%) but were still substantial when heritability was 0.4 (~7%). However  this result was only obtained when both sexes were used to create double haploids for testing. When only one sex is double haploid  selection accuracy was reduced because only chromosome sets from the dam (sire) entered the test population and this was not offset by increasing the number of observations per chromosome set. In this study  attempting to increase homozygosity above that obtained from random mating through maximum coancestry mating when breeding the test population had no detectable impact on genetic gain or inbreeding. This is because assortative mating was only done for one generation  which is unlikely to produce extreme genotypes. If breeding of the test population with the  scheme had been continued for 10 generations or more  similar results to those obtained with the double haploids scheme would have been observed because it takes approximately 10 generations of continuous full sib mating to produce fully inbred lines[]. Clearly one generation of either  or  is insufficient to deliver any benefit. The increase in selection accuracy of the candidate population is due to the increase in accuracy of the estimates of SNP effects in the test population because the double haploids have more extreme genotypic values. It is important to note that the study design used here permits this inference because the non-random mating structure in the test population was not replicated in the candidate breeding population  which was always bred at random. Therefore  the increased predictive accuracy was due to the test design and not the results of differences in family structure amongst the candidates. For example  if  mating had been implemented in the candidate population  say for five generations  to improve the family structure  genetic effects would eventually have been better estimated and a substantial increase in selection accuracy might have occurred[]. The benefit of the improved accuracy from generating extreme genotypes in the test population does come at a cost in robustness to the underlying genetic architecture. The design provides an estimate of   i.e. half the difference between the genetic value of homozygotes. In this study  the allelic effects were simulated to be additive  so the estimates of an allelic substitution were not biased by the absence of heterozygotes. However  if the dominance deviation  is not equal to zero  the average effects obtained from homozygotes are biased by (1-2) where  is the minor allele frequency. This bias increases as  reduces. Most QTL are expected to have a low minor allele frequency  potentiating the bias. Presence of epistatic gene actions are expected to result in similar biases from estimations based on homozygotes only. The advantage obtained with the  scheme was achieved at a cost of reduced genetic variation in G2 compared to other schemes. However  the results show that this reduction in genetic variation was mainly generated by additional linkage disequilibrium[] created by the higher accuracy obtained with the  scheme. First  inbreeding accounted for only a loss of 2% of the genetic variance and any difference in inbreeding between  with the other schemes was not substantial. Under the infinitesimal model  the loss of genetic variance due to linkage disequilibrium would be ½ where  is the accuracy of selection[]. Thus with  = 0.6  predicted loss would be 18%. Using (1-½)(1-) predicted losses in genetic variance observed in Table from the accuracies of selection presented in Table gives a very close approximation. Experience with the infinitesimal model has demonstrated that increasing selection intensity results in greater short and medium term genetic gain even though this also increases the linkage disequilibrium. However  this is not the case when selection is on a known or marked QTL along with estimates of unlinked polygenic effects  for which slowing fixation of the QTL has been shown to result in increased long-term gain[]. The existence of a trade-off between accuracy and long-term gain that is independent of inbreeding (genomic or pedigree) has not been reported to date. There are two methodological approaches to produce double haploids  either mitotic or meiotic. In this study  mitotic gynogenesis and mitotic androgenesis were used. There are good reasons to expect that the extra genetic gains would have been somewhat less with meiotic gynogenesis and meiotic androgenesis because these technologies result in fish that are less homozygous than their mitotic counterparts  i.e. only a subset of their genotypes are homozygous[]. The increased accuracy of selection with use of a double haploid sib test population results from the explanatory variables in the regression equation (Equation 2) taking more extreme values due to inbreeding  which  based on regression theory[]   is known to increase the accuracy of the estimation of SNP effects. As derived in the Appendix  the increase selection accuracy from the perspective of genomic relationships and selection index theory can be explained using the formula: Where  is the relationship between sib test individuals and one of the selection candidates  and  is a phenotypic covariance matrix for the sib test individuals  and  is the variance of relationships between the test sibs. This shows the expected reliability (= squared accuracy) of genomic selection is approximately equal to the reliability of traditional EBV plus a term that increases with the variances of the deviations of genomic relationships from their expectations in the test population. The implications of this formula go further in defining conditions that maximize the expected reliability of genomic selection: (1) the training animals should be as little related as possible  which makes  large; (2) the training animals should be as much related to the selection candidates as possible  which makes  large; and (3) deviations of the genomic relationships from the traditional relationships should be as large as possible  resulting in large . Points (1) and (2) were also observed by[]. Double haploids have the same expected relationship with the candidates as diploid training animals (½)  but the variance of their genomic relationship with the candidates is increased due to inbreeding. Thus  the increase in accuracy of genomic selection when using double haploids can be explained in two ways: (1) the more extreme regression factors in (Equation 2) allow SNP effects to be more accurately estimated  or (2) their more variable relationships with the candidates can be used by selection indices and BLUP to increase the accuracy of the EBV of the candidates. Here  GS-BLUP[] was used for genetic evaluation. Similar outcomes in terms of increases in accuracy and genetic gain from double haploids and non-random mating are expected with other genomic evaluation methods that are currently used. For example  the  method[] concentrates on certain important regions of the genome. Double haploid individuals are also double haploids for these regions of the genome. Therefore  the variance of genomic relationships between individuals in the test and candidate individuals also increases at these regions of the genome and thus delivers a more accurate estimation of SNP effects than the test population produced by random mating. It is expected that the use of double haploid sib test populations increases the accuracy of genomic selection for any candidate population because use of double haploids achieves a more accurate estimation of the SNP effects in the test population by increasing the variance of the genomic relationships between the test and candidate population. This is expected to hold for any candidate populations. However  the selection candidates should not be completely different from the test population This study shows the benefits of using double haploids as test sibs in aquaculture genomic selection breeding schemes. An increase of 7 to 19% in selection accuracy  leading to a 6 to 22% increase in genetic gain was obtained. This resulted from more accurate estimation of SNP effects and required a mixture of paternal and maternal double haploid test sibs in combination with genomic selection. Increases in accuracy and genetic gain from use of double haploids were greater with lower heritability levels. Therefore  the outputs of this study can be used to increase genetic gain for difficult traits such as disease resistance and meat quality  which cannot be recorded on selection candidates. In practical applications  eggs may be collected from the nucleus breeding parents and divided in two parts and 50% would be fertilized in a natural way  forming the candidate population  and the rest further divided into one half that is submitted to gynogenesis and the other half to androgenesis. This would result in a mixture of maternal and paternal double haploid genome fishes from each family in the test population. However  there are practical problems to overcome for the implementation of double haploids in aquaculture breeding schemes  including biases from non-additive gene effects costs and other practical constraints. There may also be ethical and regulatory issues related to animal welfare associated with the use of chromosome manipulation techniques. This study has shown that the use of double haploids that produce inbred test sibs for estimation of SNP effects significantly increased selection accuracy and genetic gain. This required a mixture of test sibs with maternal and paternal double haploid genomes. The approach yielded increases in selection accuracy of up to 19% and in genetic gain of up to 22%. The double haploid technique produces inbred fish in one generation  which increased the accuracy of the estimation of SNP effects. Another strategy  in which the test population was designed based on non-random mating such as maximum coancestry mating  hardly improved selection accuracy. Finally  this study demonstrated the benefit of using distinct designs for the testing versus the candidate population. Based on selection index theory and assuming genetic variance is 1  the reliability (squared accuracy) of traditional selection is (assuming): where  is the relationship between sib test individuals and one of the selection candidates  and  is a phenotypic covariance matrix for the sib test individuals  i.e.  =  +   where  is the pedigree-based relationship between the sib test individuals and  is a diagonal matrix of scaled environmental variances with (1-) /  on the diagonal. Let the genomic relationship matrices be denoted by  =  +  and  =  +   where  and  represent changes from the expected relationships due to the genomic information. Then with genomic selection  the squared accuracy of selection is: assuming that  and  are independent.

This is true of Bayesian models for genome-enabled selection  which uses whole-genome molecular data to predict the genetic merit of candidate animals for breeding purposes. In this regard  parallel computing can overcome the bottlenecks that can arise from series computing. Hence  a major goal of the present study is to bridge the gap to high-performance Bayesian computation in the context of animal breeding and genetics.ResultsParallel Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithms and strategies are described in the context of animal breeding and genetics. Parallel Monte Carlo algorithms are introduced as a starting point including their applications to computing single-parameter and certain multiple-parameter models. Then  two basic approaches for parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo are described: one aims at parallelization within a single chain; the other is based on running multiple chains  yet some variants are discussed as well.

This is true of Bayesian models for genome-enabled selection  which uses whole-genome molecular data to predict the genetic merit of candidate animals for breeding purposes. In this regard  parallel computing can overcome the bottlenecks that can arise from series computing. Hence  a major goal of the present study is to bridge the gap to high-performance Bayesian computation in the context of animal breeding and genetics. Parallel Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithms and strategies are described in the context of animal breeding and genetics. Parallel Monte Carlo algorithms are introduced as a starting point including their applications to computing single-parameter and certain multiple-parameter models. Then  two basic approaches for parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo are described: one aims at parallelization within a single chain; the other is based on running multiple chains  yet some variants are discussed as well. Features and strategies of the parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo are illustrated using real data  including a large beef cattle dataset with 50K SNP genotypes. Parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are useful for computing complex Bayesian models  which does not only lead to a dramatic speedup in computing but can also be used to optimize model parameters in complex Bayesian models. Hence  we anticipate that use of parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo will have a profound impact on revolutionizing the computational tools for genomic selection programs. In recent decades  Bayesian inference has been increasingly used for analysis of complex statistical models  in part because of increased availability and performance of personal computers and workstations. However  such models are generally not analytically tractable and  hence  computationally demanding numerical techniques are inevitably required. This is especially true of Bayesian computation for genome-enabled prediction and selection  which aims at using whole-genome molecular data to predict the genetic merit of candidate animals for breeding purposes []. Typically  implementation of a high-dimensional model based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques is notoriously intensive in computing and often requires days  weeks  or even months of CPU (Central Processing Unit) time on personal computers and workstations []. Therefore  in order to overcome such computational burden  parallel computing becomes appealing [  ]. Parallel computing operates on the principle that a large problem can be split into smaller components and solved concurrently (i.e.  ”in parallel”)  each on a separate processor (or CPU core) []. An instance of a computer program and its activities that are taking place on each processor is referred to a process. Thus  parallel computing involves activating multiple processes that concurrently carry out related computing jobs and combining results by the main “controlling” process. Parallel computing can be achieved by programming with C  C++  or Fortran  e.g.  using the MPI (Message Passing Interface) library to handle inter-process communication []. High-performance computing communities have developed parallel programs for decades but were previously limited to programs running on expensive super-computers. In the past twenty years  interest in parallel computing has grown markedly due to physical constraints that prevent frequency scaling [] and to the need to handle datasets of unprecedented dimensionalities that are being generated []. Parallel computing has now become a dominant paradigm in current computer architectures  mainly in the form of multi-core processors []. Parallel MCMC methods have recently been adopted in statistics and informatics [  ] and in image processing [] but they have not received much attention in animal breeding and genetics. There are several reasons for this gap. First  MCMC algorithms are seemingly serial  and parallelism is not as straightforward as one would expect. Second  many intensive computational tasks in breeding and genetics applications have been handled via some simple data parallelism  implemented through the “multiple-tasking” mechanism provided by multi-core Linux workstations. Multiple-tasking allows each processor to switch between tasks being executed on it  without having to wait for each task to finish  but this type of “parallel” computing is not scalable with the number of jobs. Recently  parallel MCMC algorithms and strategies have become a focal point for scientific computing in the post-genome era []. This is largely due to the need to handle genomic datasets of unprecedented sizes  such as genome-wide dense markers or sequences for genome-enabled selection programs []. With a set of whole-genome markers (say 50K SNP markers or higher density) in a model  the computing task is highly challenging  particularly with sophisticated Bayesian models via MCMC implementation [  –]. In this paper  we present a technical description of parallel MCMC methods in the context of animal breeding and genetics. These algorithms typically fall into two categories: running multiple MCMC chains or parallelization within a single chain; some variants of these algorithms are discussed as well. A major purpose of this paper is to advocate the use of parallel MCMC methods  hence infusing high-performance computing technologies into animal selection programs in the post-genome era. We start with parallel Monte Carlo methods  as a prelude to parallel MCMC. In practice  many statistical problems involve integrating over hundreds or even thousands of dimensions but usually these problems are not analytically tractable. Instead  Monte Carlo simulation methods [] can be used to tackle high-dimensional integrals. Standard Monte Carlo integration algorithms distribute the evaluation points uniformly over the integration regions. To begin  consider the following integral for some high-dimensional  with density . Suppose the integral cannot be evaluated analytically. If n realizations of  can be sampled independently from  then  according to the strong law of large numbers  the sample average  provides an approximation to  when . Simple Monte Carlo algorithms proceed by averaging large numbers of values that are generated independently of each other. Obviously  Monte Carlo simulation is parallel in computing because it can be conducted concurrently. By parallel computing  the entire set of samples can be divided among the available CPU cores and then each core generates a portion and summarizes its local samples. After all processors have finished their tasks  a master program summarizes all the partial data and outputs the final result. Suppose that there are  CPU cores that generate a total of  samples  each handling an equal portion of these samples. For simplicity  we assume that  is divisible by   such that the quotient () is an integer. Then  parallel Monte Carlo simulation proceeds as follows []: <U+2794>  Process 0 (master process): computes and passes  to each process. <U+2794> Each (slave) process (say ): simulates  independent realizations of  computes  and passes   back to the master program. <U+2794> Process 0 (master program): sums   and generates the final sum  computes the Monte Carlo estimate as  Note that  in this example  the master process does not involve computing the sum of a portion of the data but it actually can. Also  note that each process is given the same number of samples. This works well if all CPU cores process the data at the same speed or approximately so. In practice  however  clock frequencies (i.e.  computing speed) can vary markedly among processors. Hence  it can be more effective for each processor (or CPU core) to process a different number of samples  roughly proportional to its computing speed  and then let the master program compute the weighted average of all samples obtained from the  cores. A single-parameter model can serve as a building block for Bayesian modeling []. Consider a normal distribution with known mean  and unknown variance  to be inferred. The data density for a vector  of  identically independently distributed () observations is: where  is the sufficient statistic. Assuming an inverse- prior distribution with scale and  degrees of freedom  it can be shown that the posterior density of  is a scaled inverse-distribution with scale  and  degrees of freedom []: Hence  the posterior mean of  is  for  Numerically  the posterior distribution of  can be inferred based on posterior samples generated from (4). Computing for this single-parameter normal model can follow exactly the same algorithm as parallel Monte Carlo simulation. Briefly   parallel processes are executed  each generating a portion of the posterior samples of  Then  the master process generates the final sum and computes the estimated posterior mean of  as a weighted average of all sample averages. To show why the algorithm of parallel Markov chain simulation applies to parallel computing of a single-parameter model  consider equation (). For this single-parameter normal model  for example  the marginal posterior expectation of  can be expressed as: Clearly  (5) implies a similar Monte Carlo implementation: if  samples of  are generated from its marginal posterior density then  as  can be approximated by the sample average: Many models involve more than one unknown. Although many parameters are involved  conclusions are often drawn about one or only a few parameters at a time. In Bayesian analysis  the aim is to obtain the marginal posterior distribution of each parameter of interest. Often  we can construct the joint posterior distribution of all unknowns and then integrate this distribution over the unknowns that are not of immediate interest  leading to the desired marginal distribution of the parameter of interest. Now  consider the normal distribution (2) but with both mean and variance unknown. Assuming prior independence of location and scale parameters  a vague prior density for  and  is uniform on  that is  Then  it can be shown that the marginal posterior distribution of  is a scaled inverse- density with  degrees of freedom and scaling parameter : where  and  The marginal posterior distribution of  can be obtained by integrating the joint posterior density over  leading to a student-t density: Therefore  posterior samples for  and  can be generated independently from the following marginal posterior distributions  for  iterations: <U+2794> Sampling  from (8)  <U+2794> Sampling  from (9). Analytical solutions are not always available for most multiple-parameter models. Instead  MCMC simulation can be used to draw samples from the joint posterior distribution and then evaluate sampled values for the parameter(s) of interest while ignoring the values of other unknowns. MCMC methods are a variant of Monte Carlo schemes in which a Markov chain  is constructed with equilibrium distribution  equal to some distribution of interest  such as a posterior distribution in a Bayesian analysis []. Typically  the initial value is not a draw from the distribution  but if the chain is constructed properly  then  (here   means convergence in distribution) and  under certain conditions  an estimator  converges to  as  However  a Markov chain is sequential by nature because the distribution of  depends on the value of  where  indexes the order of MCMC iterations. This introduces a difficulty to parallelization of a Markov chain. A naive yet natural approach to parallel MCMC is simply to generate several independent Markov chains on different processors and then combine results appropriately [  ]. Given that running multiple chains is simple and that they scale well with the number of available processors (or CPU cores)  this type of “multiple-chain” parallelism is usually the strategy to strive for in the first instance. Assume that we want to estimate some target distribution but samples of  cannot be drawn directly from  Instead  a Markov chain  can be generated  which  through some transition density  converges to  at equilibrium. Let there be  parallel chains  each initialized and burned-in independently for  updating steps before more samples are drawn at intervals. As  and all it can be shown that the ensemble is ergodic (tending in the limit) to []. An appealing advantage of running multiple chains is that these processes can be conducted concurrently with minimal coordination among tasks  as in the case of parallel Monte Carlo simulation. However  unlike parallel Monte Carlo simulation  a major concern with running multiple MCMC is that the overall reduction in runtime from parallelism can be limited by the portion of each chain to be discarded in the beginning of MCMC sampling for convergence purposes (i.e.  burn-in). If every chain has to spend a significant proportion of its time in burn-in  this would place serious limitations on the performance of the algorithm  because it would not scale well with an increasing number of processors []. According to Amdahl’s (1967) law []  if some portion  of steps  for  must be removed as burn-in from each chain  then the maximum speedup in computing through parallelization is (assuming that each step takes an equal amount of time): where  is the number of iterations after burn-in. Thus  parallel MCMC computing by virtue of running multiple chains is rewarding only when  is small. However  if  is large  the gain in computation through running multiple chains instead of a single long chain can be very disappointing. Although running multiple Markov chains is theoretically straightforward  chains are not necessarily ergodic. Hence  some variant multiple MCMC methods have been proposed. For example  samples from multiple Markov chains may be confined to isolated modes if the target distribution is multi-modal  or the chains may mix poorly when there are strong correlations between variables. Unfortunately  the latter is a common problem of Gibbs samplers []. Hence  pooling samples from multiple short chains may not necessarily give a better representation of  than using a single long chain. If several chains are drifting to disparate modes  they will tend to be strongly influenced by the chains that they confine  because the weights will not necessarily be proportional to their relative masses. Several strategies have been proposed for handling the aforementioned issues for single chains  such as adaptive MCMC algorithms [  ] and tempering [  ]. Metropolis-coupled MCMC is an algorithm that is related to simulated tempering and tempered transitions [  ]. It proceeds by simultaneously running a number of different Markov chains that are governed by different (but related) Markov chain transition probabilities. Occasionally  the algorithm “swaps” values between two different chains  with probability governed by the Metropolis algorithm to preserve the stationarity of the target distribution. These swaps can speed up convergence of the algorithm substantially []. Craiu et al. [] targeted the posterior with an ensemble of chains  using the covariance of samples across all chains to adapt the proposal covariance for a set of Metropolis-Hastings chains. While these multiple-chain methods use synchronous exchange of samples to expedite convergence  Murray [] proposed mixing in an additional independent proposal  representing some hitherto best estimate or summary of the posterior  and cooperatively adapting across chains. The idea is to construct a global best estimate of the posterior at any given step and then mix this estimate as a remote component with whatever local proposal that a chain has adopted. This does not preclude adaptive treatment or tempering of that local proposal. It also permits a heterogeneous blend of remote proposals  so that the ensemble of chains can mix well. By running multiple Markov chains  we often observe that samplers mix poorly and each chain may require a very long burn-in time. Hence  it would be preferable to develop parallelism within a single chain  instead of running multiple chains. As mentioned in the previous section  Markov chain simulation is an iterative procedure  in the sense that simulation of the next value of the chain depends on the current value. This creates difficulty for delivering parallelism for a single Markov chain. Nevertheless  we will show that a single chain can be parallelized  subject to assumptions of conditional independence in the model. The key is to identify such steps that can be implemented in parallel. Consider a Bayesian model with  scale parameters   where  can be equal to 1 in some cases  and  location parameters. In MCMC sampling  each element is updated once per iteration using a kernel density that preserves the desired target posterior distributionAssume that updating  is very fast (given some sufficient statistics regarding the current state of ) but updating  is highly time-consuming. This is typical of a multivariate normal distribution with a common scale parameter (or different groups of scale parameters) and a large number (say a few hundreds or thousands) of location parameters. In these cases  it would be preferable to parallelize the update steps for  in order to gain speed up in computing. In theory  parallelization of the update of  depends crucially on the conditional independence structure of the model. First  assume the simplest possible case  where   meaning that the update of any particular  will not depend on the state of any other  Thus  all  can be updated in parallel by delivering subsets  say  of the elements in  to the  CPU cores. For illustrative purpose  let there be only one  but many Then  after all parameters are given initial values  the parallel MCMC algorithm proceeds by repeatedly conducting the following steps: <U+2794> Master program: samples a new   given realization of  and the data   and distributes the new  to each process. <U+2794> Each process (): updates a subset of  s that have been assigned to it  conditional on  and   computes summary statistics for the updated  and passes the summary statistics back to the master program. Often  the above algorithm works quite well when the  are all independent of one another  given  and . In practice  however  such independence may not necessarily hold and strategies must be developed to deliver efficient parallel MCMC algorithms given specific dependence between elements []. Consider a normal distribution model with unknown  and known For a vector y of  observations  the likelihood is: If a normal prior is assumed  that is  where  and  are hyperparameters  it can be shown that the posterior density of  is also normal []: Intuitively  the posterior mean of  is expressed as a weighted average of the prior mean () and of the sample mean ()  with weights equal to the corresponding precisions   and   respectively. Because this is a single-parameter model  posterior samples of  can be simulated in parallel by following the same algorithm as for Monte Carlo simulation. The example data are average body weight daily gains (ADG) measured on 7670 Angus cattle. The kernel density of ADG is shown in Figure   which approximately suggests a normal distribution. Assume that we know  from previous studies  that the population variance of ADG is 0.58. In this example  the prior distribution is assumed to be normal with mean equal to 4.0 and variance equal to 1.0 (these are just guesses of the parameter values in the distribution of ADG). A parallel C program was used in this analysis (Appendix). To compile the parallel program  say using MPICH2  type: mpicc singNormMod_Parallel.c –o singNormP –lm [enter]. To conduct computing in parallel  type: mpirun –np xx ./singNormP [enter]  where xx is the number of processors involved (or CPU cores). To estimate  we simulated a total of 1 000 000 values for  which were handled by  processes  each generating 100 000 values and computing the partial sum. Then  the  partial sums were transferred back to process 0  where the Monte Carlo estimate was computed. The illustrative program only outputs the posterior mean and the standard deviation. The original program used in the demonstration also outputs minimum and maximum values  and quartiles. This part of the code is omitted in the Appendix for simplicity of demonstration. The computing was conducted on a DELL Precision workstation equipped with Intel® Xeon® CPU (3.20GHz)  16G memory  and cache size 6144KB. . The posterior mean was estimated to be 3.394  which corresponded very well to the sample mean of ADG of the 7670 Angus cattle (Table ) because the impact of the prior on the posterior could be ignored given the very large sample size. The median and mean agreed well with each other and the first and third quartiles were also very similar (Table ). These are indications that the posterior distribution of the mean of ADG is symmetric. The purpose of this example was to show parallel computing using the MPI (Message Passing Interface) library. The change in computing time for this example was  however  almost insignificant because sampling from a normal distribution is very quick. In addition  with parallel simulation  inter-process communication requires some extra time as overhead  which offset gains from parallel computing. MPI is a language-independent communication protocol used to program parallel computers that is extensively used for high-performance computing. More specifically  MPI is a library of routines for creating parallel programs e.g.  in C or Fortran 77  that allow users to create programs that can run on most parallel computer architectures. (Note that there is a language extension to Fortran90 called High Performance Fortran – HPF  which supports high-performance computing.) In the example code  the MPI library was used to handle inter-process communications in the C program. With MPI  each task can have its own local memory during computation (but multiple tasks can reside in the same physical machine and/or an arbitrary number of machines). Typically  tasks exchange data by sending and receiving messages but data transfer usually requires cooperation among processors  that is  a “send” operation must have a matching “receive” operation. A few details about this program in the Appendix are described in the following. MPI_Comm_rand() is used to find out the ID of all participating processors and MPI_Comm_size() is used to get the number of participating processors. A common pattern of interaction among parallel processors is to use MPI_Send() and MPI_Receive() to allocate work among them. In the present example  however  this was done in a slightly different manner. MPI_Bcast() is used to send common parameter values (e.g.  number of simulation steps) to all participating processors. Then  after each processor has finished its work  the subroutine MPI_Reduction() is used to sum up the posterior values from all processors. Subroutine MPI_Reduction() collects data from all processors  reduces the data to a single value (e.g.  by summation)  and then stores the results on the master process (and on all processes as well). There are several predefined operations that MPI_Reduction() can provide. In addition to summation  it can also conduct multiplication  and find minimum or maximum values. Finally  the master processor computes the means and standard deviation (and other posterior statistics  when relevant) for the mean of the normal model. Note that  in this illustration  we used sequential functions to generate random numbers ()  with process ID used as the random number seed. Preferably  one can use a parallel random number generator  such as the Scalable Parallel Random Number Generators (SPRNG) Library (). In this example  we show how to parallelize multiple chains for the Bayesian LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression model [  ]. In the whole-genome prediction context  consider the following linear model: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is an effect common to all observations   is a vector of unknown marker effects   is an incidence matrix  and  is a vector of residuals. The prior specification follows de los Campos et al. [] but without the terms for additive genetic effects. An R package  BLR  was used to implement the Bayesian LASSO model []. The dataset used here consisted of 147 Angus cattle  each genotyped for 37 892 polymorphic SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) markers and with estimated breeding values (EBV) for marbling score as response variable. In addition to running a single long chain of 100 000 iterations (after a burn-in of 1000 iterations)  we also ran 10 chains  each consisting of 10 000 iterations (after a burn-in of 1000 iterations). All jobs were submitted and run on a Condor cluster at the University of Wisconsin – Madison []. This cluster provides 1860 cores for distributed parallel computing. Among them  1847 run a Linux operation system and the remaining a Windows operation system. Memory size ranges from 256M to 214G: 7.04% (<1G)  67.58% (1-3G)  22.69% (4-8G)  and 2.67% (>10G). A Perl script was used  that installs the R system and required libraries (such as the SuppDists package) onto remote nodes prior to the computing and then executes the Bayesian LASSO program. This Perl script served as the executable in the Condor job batch file. For the multiple chains approach  each started with over-dispersed initial values (and with different seeds for the random number generator)  and the chains converged after a certain number of iterations. Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence was examined using posterior samples of the residual variance collected from the first 4500 iterations of each chain. Trace plots of posterior samples of the residual variance showed that most chains tended to stabilize after 1000 iterations  and all approached 0.0034 (Figure a)  which corresponds well to estimated residual variance in this example. The trace plot of the shrink factor  from the Gelman and Rubin method [] suggested that a burn-in of 3000 iterations would be more appropriate  because  approached 1.00 after the first 3000 iterations (Figure b). With  within-sequence variance dominates between-sequence variance  and all sequences escape the influence of starting points and traverse all target distributions. The same convergence diagnosis can be done for all model parameters.   () Trace plots of posterior samples of residual variance obtained within 4500 iterations from each of the 10 chains; () trace plot of shrink factor  according to the Gelman-Rubin method y. The parallel computing took between 141 and 178 min to complete each of the 10 processes. The differences were due to varying CPU speeds and workloads on these computer nodes. In contrast  running a single chain with 100 000 iterations (after a burn-in of 1000 iterations) on a Linux workstation with similar specifications took 1386 min (Figure a). Thus  the reduction in runtime from parallel computing was approximately 7.78 fold. Posterior estimates of the model parameters were similar between the two computing approaches (data not presented).  () Comparison of computing time; () expected speedup by parallel computing with the chain length equal to ten times the burn-in length for the Markov chain. When running multiple chains  the reduction in runtime is limited by the time required for burn-in. Let  denote the number of burn-in iterations that is required  and  be the number of iterations after the burn-in. Then  in a serial implementation  the chain will consist of <U+2009>+<U+2009> iterations in total. Let there be  processes running chains in parallel  each taking on an equal length of Markov chain (i.e.  <U+2009>+<U+2009> iterations). Assuming each iteration takes the same amount of processing time  the reduction in runtime is given by: The above is an alternative form of (10) with  and  treated as unknown. Ideally  if  this means “perfectly parallel computing”  in which the potential reduction in runtime is  fold. However  when  is a significant proportion of   the actual speedup falls well short of its potential. Practically  burn-in time is related to the mixing rate of the chain  which is related to the total length of the Markov chain. Let <U+2009>=<U+2009>10  which is a useful rule-of-thumb in most practical situations. Then  equation () depends only on parameter . Hence  we have  and  respectively  for <U+2009>=<U+2009>8 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>16. As  the speedup is upper-bounded at: Thus  when running multiple chains  each with a significant length of burn-in  the speedup does not scale well with the number of available CPU cores. Let  Then  the speedup  is a function of  and   as depicted in Figure b. Clearly  given the fixed relationship between  and   the speedup will reach a plateau after the number of CPU cores reaches a certain level. Finally  we show a real application of parallel computing on genome-enabled prediction in beef cattle. The computing was implemented with a high-throughput computing pipeline called parallel-BayesCpC []. This is a high-throughput computing package and a member of the WGSE (Whole-Genome-enabled Selection and Evaluation) family [] of distributed high-throughput computing pipelines. In computing  a pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series (i.e.  the output of one element is the input of the next one) and the elements of a pipeline can be executed in parallel or sequentially. Typically  pipelining increases the computing throughput. In the context of whole-genome prediction  the pipeline that we have developed can automate all steps involved in the computing and decision making for whole-genome prediction  which includes and is not limited to data input and quality control  model feature selection (FS) if applicable  post-FS statistical inference and cross-validation (CV)  and output and documentations (Figure a). The parallel-BayesCpC package is so named because it uses the BayesCp model for FS and the BayesC  model for post-FS statistical inference and CV (Figure b). This package can reside on both Condor and OSG (Open Science Grid) and is provided with a Condor SOAR web interface for automatic scheduling of jobs and storage of output files (Figure c). In Condor  for example  job dependency can be conveniently handled as so-called “DAGMan jobs” (Appendix – b). Note that the user does not need to know how to write Condor job batch files as all these files will be automatically produced by scripts of BayesCpC based on the user’s input.

For simplicity of illustration  consider a linear model with only the overall mean and marker effects: where  is the phenotype (or estimated genetic value) of the  animal;  is the overall mean;  is the substitution effect associated with the  SNP ();  is a variable corresponding to the genotype of the  SNP (0  1  2) for the  individual  and  is a residual term  where  is the residual variance.   the BayesCp model assumes that the effect of an SNP is null with probability  or that it follows a normal distribution   with probability 1- That is  Here   is a variance common to all non-zero SNP effects  which is assigned a scaled inverse chi-square distribution   Furthermore  the value of  is unknown and needs to be inferred  given the prior distribution of  that is taken as uniform between 0 and 1   A Bernoulli indicator variable   is introduced to facilitate sampling from the mixtures of the SNP effects   Hence  unconditionally  the variable  follows a multivariate-t distribution   if  or equals zero otherwise []. Posterior inference of unknown parameters in the Bayesian model via Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation is described by Habier et al. []. With a subset of  say  markers selected in a certain iteration of the MCMC for the BayesC  model  then the next iteration assumes that all the  selected SNP have non-null effects on the quantitative trait. The above defines BayesC model with  which takes the same form as (15) but with  and  replaced by . Posterior inference in BayesC  is the same as for BayesC except that  is fixed at zero and sampling indicator variables is no longer relevant. Typically  -fold CV is often used to evaluate predictive models  in which the whole dataset is divided into  portions of approximately equal size. The model is then trained in the set of  portions of the data and predicted in the remaining one portion. Portioning of training and testing sets is then rotated  times in each CV experiment. Furthermore  each CV experiment can be randomly replicated a number of times in order to increase the stability of model evaluation (but we did not do that in the present study). As an example  we used the parallel BayesCpC package to select the optimal number of SNP to predict rib eye area in a beef cattle population. The data consisted of 2919 animals each with estimated breeding values for rib eye area and genotypes obtained from the Illumina 50K SNP Beadchip. After data editing and data quality control  46 723 polymorphic SNP markers were used. The optimal panel search started with the top 50 SNP markers according to the posterior model probability for having a non-zero effect for this marker  and then increased from the top 100 to the top 3000 markers at an increment of 100 markers each time. We did not exhaust all possible panels beyond 3K because the prediction accuracy showed a constant trend of decrease after the panel reached 1000 SNP. In the parallel-BayesCpC package  MPI is used for data quality control and parallel MCMC is employed by both FS and CV. In our example  distributed jobs were submitted to a local Condor pool with 128 cores. These are Linux workstations  with Intel® Xeon® CPU (2.67 GHz)  > 8G memory per slot and a cache size of 12 288 KB. The submit machine is also a Linux workstation with Intel® Xeon® CPU (3.00 GHz)  16G memory and 6144 KB cache size. Each parallel MCMC chain for feature selection consisted of 10 000 iterations after a burn-in of 2000 iterations  thinned every one-tenth. Each parallel MCMC for CV consisted of 25 000 iterations  after a burn-in of 5000 iterations  thinned every one-tenth. We examined three computing strategies to search for an optimal panel size for predicting genetic merit using SNP markers. The first strategy executed 30 meta-jobs in parallel  each consisting of one round of parallel FS jobs using all SNP markers and one round of parallel post-FS inference and CV for a specific panel (X<U+2009>=<U+2009>50  100  200  …  3000  respectively). In the second strategy  one round of parallel FS jobs was executed  followed by 30 rounds of parallel post-FS inference and CV jobs conducted sequentially for all panel sizes. Parallel CV jobs for the 500-SNP panel started only when parallel CV jobs for the 400-SNP jobs had finished. The third strategy consisted of 30 meta-jobs executed in series  with each meta-job consisting of one round of parallel FS jobs using all SNP markers and one round of parallel post-FS inference and CV for a specific panel. The difference between the second and the third strategy is that different optimal panel sizes were selected based on the same set of FS results with the second computing strategy but each panel was selected based on a different set of FS results with the third computing strategy. There were very significant differences in computing time between the three computing strategies (Figure a). The first strategy consumed the least time (mostly completed within 12 h)  because it used more features of parallel computing  but it also required far more slots for computing (in total 90 slots were needed). The second strategy avoided the use of many slots because it ran only one round of parallel FS jobs and then executed 30 rounds of parallel post-FS inference and CV jobs sequentially based on the same set of FS results. We ran three parallel chains for FS and also used 3-fold CV to evaluate prediction accuracy and  hence  only three slots were needed for this strategy. Because CV jobs on a subset of markers typically ran much faster than a FS job on all markers  it was computationally efficient to run these CV jobs sequentially. The computing time necessary for the second strategy was approximately two times greater than for the first strategy. However  the third strategy consumed the greatest amount of time (over two weeks). With this strategy  jobs for different panel sizes were executed in series but FS jobs and post-FS inference and CV jobs for each panel size were executed in parallel. If all these jobs were executed sequentially  the computing time necessary would exceed one month and half  and this is definitely not optimal. Comparatively  the first computing strategy was twice as fast as the second strategy and 29 times faster than the third strategy.  Three parallel computing strategies were used in search of optimal SNP panel sizes for predicting genetic merit. The first strategy executed 30 meta-jobs in parallel  each consisting of one round of parallel feature selection (FS) jobs using all SNP markers and one round of parallel post-FS inference and CV for a specific panel (X<U+2009>=<U+2009>50  100  200  …  3000  respectively); In the second strategy  one round of parallel FS jobs was executed  followed by 30 rounds of parallel post-FS inference and CV jobs conducted sequentially for all panel sizes (P1_A); The third strategy consisted of 30 meta-jobs executed in series  with each meta-job consisting of one round of parallel FS jobs using all SNP markers and one round of parallel post-FS inference and CV for a specific panel (Pn_A). Despite the differences in computing times  predictions obtained with the three computing scenarios were highly comparable. The correlation between estimated breeding values for rib eye area and their fitted values in the training set (referred to as fitting accuracy hereafter) increased almost monotonically with panel size  until it plateaued with a panel size of around 2000 SNP (Figure b). However  the correlation between the estimated breeding values and their predicted values in the testing set (referred to as predictive accuracy hereafter) reached its peak (0.8886) with a panel size of 1000 SNP  and then went down slightly. The highest predictive accuracy was observed with 500 to 1500 selected markers. The decrease in predictive accuracy with<U+2009>><U+2009>1000 SNP possibly reflected over-fitting  which  in this case  occurred much before the panel size exceeded the training population size (i.e.  around 2000 animals). Hence  with Bayesian regression models  prediction using more SNP may not necessarily give better results than prediction using a smaller panel. A model that describes the training set well does not necessarily yield the best predictions when generalized to the population. This is referred to as poor generalization in machine learning []. The fitting and prediction accuracies are illustrated in Figure  for various panel sizes.   () 100 SNP; () 1000 SNP; () 2000 SNP; () 3000 SNP. In the Bayes CpC procedure  the BayesC  model postulates that a portion  of all SNP have zero effect. In a high-density SNP panel   is typically expected to be large  meaning that the portion of “signal” SNP  1- is small (Figure )  so the chance of over-fitting is diminished. Using the Illumina Bovine50K SNP genotypes  the posterior mean (standard deviation) of  was 0.0148 (0.0027). In prediction  the best predictions were obtained with 500 to 1500 selected SNP  supporting an optimal predictive ability with 1.07% to 3.21% selected markers. Interestingly  this optimal range covered the posterior mean of  which is the portion of markers estimated to have non-zero effects on the trait. This result differs somewhat from what we obtained using 3K SNP panels (data no published yet). For the 3K genotypes  the estimated number of SNP having non-zero effects based on BayesC  in the training set did not correspond to the number of SNP in the optimal SNP panel for prediction. Hence  we postulate that parameter  in a BayesC  model may not provide information on the size of an optimal SNP panel for prediction for small panels but could be informative for a higher density of markers.    The results were obtained from feature selection using computing strategy II  that is  one round of parallel FS jobs was then executed  followed by 30 rounds of parallel post-FS inference and CV jobs conducted sequentially for all panel sizes. With the Bayesian regression models explored here  feature selection may be important since a model with all SNP does not necessarily give the best predictions. This situation is unlike ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction [] or prediction using the G-BLUP method []  for which a model with all markers would typically be favored. While selecting models of varying dimensions may be an issue to explore  it brings tremendous challenges to computing  particularly when the dataset is large. In this regard  high-performance computing offers a markedly competitive edge  not only in reducing computing time but also in tuning optimal models for whole-genome prediction. To date  almost all statistical software packages for animal breeding and genetics have been developed for serial computation. In such programs  only one instruction is executed at a time and after that instruction is finished  the next instruction begins. Hence  serial computing performance depends heavily on the speed (clock frequency) of CPU  and the runtime of a program is approximately equal to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Keeping everything else constant  higher clock frequency leads to faster computing speed and thus decreased runtime for all computation-bounded programs []. This was the situation with the performance enhancement of microprocessors based on a single CPU from the 1980s to the early 2000s. However  rate of improvement has slowed down since 2003 due to hardware limitations incurred by energy consumption and heat dissipation. On the other hand  parallel computing has gained impetus as a result of increasingly available multiple-core computers  computer clusters  and networking and has been referred to as the concurrency revolution []. In theory  multiple threads of execution can cooperate to complete the work faster than a serial setting. Parallel computing uses multiple processing elements concurrently to solve a problem. To implement parallel computing  one first needs to break the problem into discrete “chunks” of work  so that they can be distributed to run on multiple processors. This is known as task decomposition or partitioning. The next fundamental step in designing the parallel algorithm involves identifying independencies that are assumed explicitly in the model. Without loss of generality  let  and  be two program jobs  where <U+2009><<U+2009> indexes the order of execution. Bernstein’s conditions [] can be used to identify whether or not the two jobs are independent and can be executed in parallel []. Let  and  be the input variables and output variables  respectively  of . Likewise  the same definitions hold for  and  of  . Then   and  are independent if they satisfy (1)  (2)  and (3)  Violation of condition (1) introduces a flow dependency because the results from the first job () are used by the second job (). Violation of condition (2) introduces an anti-dependency  because  would overwrite a variable needed by  . The third condition represents an output dependency: when two statements write to the same location  the final result is determined by the last executed statement. MCMC algorithms have revolutionized the application of Bayesian inference  because it tackles a large range of complex inferential problems that were previously not considered possible  tractable. In the meantime  statisticians are becoming ever more ambitious in the range (complexity) of models they consider and MCMC algorithms for large complex models often require enormous amounts of computing power. Consequently  effective exploitation of parallel algorithms is of high relevance to Bayesian computation. A difficulty  however  is that MCMC algorithms are serial by nature and do not easily migrate onto a parallel system. Nevertheless  various strategies can be used to design parallel MCMC methods. The key is to identify steps with data independence or conditional independence on which parallelism can reside. Several algorithms or strategies exist for running parallel MCMC  which is straightforward and it requires minimal inter-process communication. However  poorly mixing MCMC algorithms with long burn-in periods are not ideally suited to this situation  because a long period of burn-in must be repeated on every available CPU core. Thus  it is often desirable to explore strategies for parallelism within single chains. The actual performance of parallel MCMC depends on several issues. Among them  inter-process communication is a primary factor. Many parallel applications require processes to share data with each other  which is known as inter-task communication and implies overhead. Inter-task communication can offset the gain in computing speed from parallel computing  because it frequently requires some type of synchronization between tasks  causing processes to spend time “waiting”. In the worst case  competing communication traffic can saturate the available network bandwidth  leading to poor parallel computing performance. Thus  there is always a need to balance the distribution of work among tasks. There is no simple rule for this type of load balancing. Ideally  all tasks are to be kept busy all of the time  so that task idle time is minimized [  ]. The ratio of computation to communication is qualitatively measured by the concept of granularity (). On one hand  a low computation to communication ratio (fine-grain parallelism) facilitates load balancing  as relatively small amounts of computational work are done between communication events but this can imply high communication overhead and less opportunity for performance enhancement  because communication and synchronization between tasks may take longer than the computation. On the other hand  a high computation to communication ratio (coarse-grain parallelism) allows more opportunity for performance enhancement; because relatively large amounts of computational work are done between communication and synchronization events. However  it is difficult to balance loads efficiently with coarse-grain parallelism and computing time may differ dramatically between computer cores. Therefore  there is a tradeoff between computing and communication and the optimal granularity depends on the problem at hand. In most parallel MCMC problems  it is advantageous to have coarse granularity because the overhead associated with communication and synchronization is high relative to execution speed  but fine-grain parallelism can sometimes help reduce overhead due to load imbalance. In this paper  we have shown the principles and examples of parallel MCMC  with applications to whole-genome prediction of breeding values. Parallel computing operates on the principle that a large problem can be split into smaller components and solved concurrently (i.e.  “in parallel”)  each on a separate processor (or CPU core). In the context of parallel MCMC  two basic algorithms exist: running multiple chains and parallelism within a single chain  yet some variants can be useful as well. In principle  all Bayesian models can be parallelized in computing but the associated algorithms and strategies may differ  leading to varied computing efficiencies. Although many technical details have yet to be explored  we expect that the use of parallel MCMC methods will revolutionize computational tools for research and breeding programs for animals in the post-genome era.

Although  in principle  genomic selection based on identity-by-state does not require pedigree data  it does use the available pedigree structure. Our findings may explain why the prediction equations derived for one breed may not predict accurate genome-wide breeding values when applied to other breeds  since family structures differ among breeds. Substantial advances in genotyping technology have been achieved over the past decade. With the availability of genome-wide  dense molecular markers  genomic selection (GS) has now become practical and its effectiveness in dairy cattle breeding has been demonstrated in many countries [–]. In this approach  genome-wide breeding values (GW-EBV) are predicted through the use of dense markers covering the whole genome []. It differs from traditional breeding value estimation  which uses only phenotypic data and pedigree information. Availability of marker genotypes for many thousands of loci across the whole genome allows GS to predict genetic value more precisely than traditional selection methods []. The basic principle of GS is that  given a sufficiently high marker density  each quantitative trait locus (QTL) is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a number of nearby markers  and a high fraction of the genetic variance is expected to be explained by these markers. Habier [] found that accuracies of GW-EBV also incorporate information on LD arising from recent family structures. The fact that this LD generated by family structure can be explained by linkage analysis (LA) implies that GS can also use LA information. A genomic identity-by-descent (IBD) matrix  containing identity-by-descent probabilities within the known pedigree  depicts this LA information. In addition  information from identical-by-state (IBS) markers may provide LD information among the founders of the pedigree  since the markers may be shared through older common ancestors than those included in the known pedigree. This LD information is equivalent to allowing non-zero genetic covariance among founders for the traits of interest. Since mutations occurred on average 2 generations ago  where  is the effective population size  IBS can consider relationships up to 2 generations back in time  while IBD takes into account only generations back to the founders of the known pedigree. The implications of these studies are that GS combines information on LD among founders and relationships between known relatives (IBD relationships). When genomic selection applies an IBS derived relationship matrix  it relies on the assumption that the relationships between individuals at the marker level reflect to a large extent their relationships also at the QTL level []. For low-density marker panels  the accuracy of the resulting GW-EBV would therefore be expected to be reduced compared to using high-density panels  since the relationships at the marker level would be an imperfect estimator of relationships at the QTL level []. However  even for highly dense marker maps  LD between marker and QTL alleles may be imperfect  due to the fact that QTL and marker (SNP) mutations in the population may be of different age []. If the flanking SNP markers are older than a closely linked QTL mutation  similarity at the marker level will be an imperfect indicator of similarity at the QTL level. Similarly  if the QTL mutation is older than the flanking marker alleles  individuals with different marker alleles may still share closely linked QTL alleles. However  among close relatives  the close linkage between marker and QTL alleles implies that genomic similarity at the marker level will closely reflect similarity at the QTL level. Hence  one option for genomic evaluation is to combine genomic and pedigree information to estimate IBD relationships across all loci  using linkage analysis. Here  animals will be regarded as related to the extent that identical marker alleles can be traced back to a common ancestor. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of GW-EBV prediction using IBS relationships based on (population-wide) LD and using genomic IBD relationships based on a limited number of generations within a known pedigree  and how much IBS information can improve the accuracy of GW-EBV over and above the use of IBD information. Genomic evaluations were conducted on deregressed estimated breeding values for milk traits of progeny tested Italian Brown Swiss bulls using IBS and IBD information. Linkage analysis was performed at the marker positions in order to estimate the IBD relationships. Accuracy of the GW-EBV was assessed by replicated cross-validation. One thousand and eighty six Italian progeny-tested Brown Swiss bulls were genotyped with the  BovineSNP50 BeadChip  which included 51 582 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 35 706 SNPs remained after removing SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF)<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 and those that failed the test of missing genotypes (>5 %). The phenotypic data of the 1086 progeny-tested bulls were conventional estimated breeding values (EBV) for the following traits: kilograms of milk yield  kilograms of milk fat yield and kilograms of milk protein yield. The EBV were deregressed [] to be used as response variables and will be referred to as Deregressed Proofs (DP). A histogram of the reliabilities of the DP is given in Figure . About 92% of the reliabilities were very high  i.e. >0.8  which implies that the DP were close to the true breeding values of the bulls.                                                      To obtain test datasets for cross-validation  the phenotypes of a defined number of individuals were masked  i.e.  by defining their phenotype as “unknown”. Six non-overlapping cross-validation datasets were created by randomly selecting 181 bulls at a time  without replacement  i.e.  every phenotype was masked precisely once. The DP of the masked individuals were predicted by the GS methods (see next section). For each of the six cross-validation sets  the correlation coefficient between the 181 predicted GW-EBV and DP was calculated and squared to be used as a measure of the reliability of the EBV predictions from GS. In order to obtain standard errors  the division into sets and all GW-EBV predictions were replicated six times. The model used in the study to predict GW-EBV with IBS information (i.e. based solely on LD) is best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP). A model equivalent to that described in the literature [  ] was used  where individual animal effects are fitted together with a genomic relationship matrix  instead of individual marker effects. The model can be expressed as: where  is a vector of phenotypes for the traits;  is the overall mean;  is a <U+2009>×<U+2009> design matrix linking the animals to the records  where  () is the number of bulls (with records);  is a <U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector of genetic effects of the animals and  is the random residual vector. It is assumed that <U+2009>~<U+2009> (  ) where  is additive genetic variance   is the genomic relationship matrix based on IBS markers. GW-EBV of animals without records were calculated by including them in the  vector (and )  but not linking the animal effect to a record in matrix   such that the solution to the mixed model equations also yields EBV for animals without records. To construct IBS relationships  let  denote the “standardized” genotype of animal  for SNP   i.e.   where  is the genotype of animal  and SNP   with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1 or 2 where SNP genotypes are “0 0”  “1 0” or “1 1”  respectively  and  is the allele frequency of SNP . Standardization is such that the mean is zero and the variance of  is 1 []. Then  is the covariance matrix of the standardized marker genotypes  which is calculated as <U+2009>=<U+2009>  where  is the number of markers.  was inverted  and BLUP was used to predict EBV of masked and non-masked individuals. The model was implemented by using the package ASReml []. Using a standard animal model the same trait phenotypes  can be described by the overall mean   the <U+2009>×<U+2009> incidence matrix   a <U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector of additive genetic effects of individuals   and a random residual vector . It is assumed that <U+2009>~<U+2009> (  )  where  is the LA based genomic IBD relationship matrix. The  matrix assumes that the founders of the pedigree are non-IBD and that all the IBD is due to common ancestors within the known pedigree. In order to estimate the  matrix  first  the LDMIP method (Linkage Disequilibrium Multilocus Iterative Peeling) []  was used to estimate the probability that an offspring inherits the paternal/maternal allele from its sire  and similarly the probability it inherits the paternal/maternal allele from its dam. Five or more generations of pedigree were available for the iterative peeling for all bulls. The probability of maternal inheritance was equal to 1 minus the probability of paternal inheritance. Secondly  the probabilities of paternal inheritance were used to set up an IBD matrix    at every marker position   using Fernando and Grossman’s rules []. Third  the  matrices were averaged across all marker loci  to obtain an overall IBD relationship matrix  . The inverse of  was then used by ASReml to predict GW-EBV of both phenotyped and non-phenotyped individuals. Prediction of EBV using both IBS and IBD information can be expressed as: where it is assumed that <U+2009>~<U+2009> (  ) and <U+2009>~<U+2009> (  )  with the IBS and IBD based genomic relationship matrices  and  defined as described above. ASReml was used to predict breeding values and estimate    and . Subsequently  GW-EBV were calculated as  where and  are vectors of predicted breeding values associated with  and   respectively. Table  shows the reliability  i.e. the square of the accuracy of the GW-EBV prediction  by using only IBS information  IBD information  and IBS<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBD information. The table shows the mean and the standard error of the predictive reliability obtained for the 181 masked individuals when the 905 non-masked animals were in the training set. The mean is an average of 36 values  six replicates of random division of the bulls into six sets. The reliabilities were similar for all three methods and for all traits studied. The reliability of the GW-EBV prediction using IBS<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBD information was virtually the same as that using IBD information alone  indicating that combing IBS and IBD information yields hardly any improvement. To investigate the effect of the number of generations in the pedigree  which defines the base generation with non-IBD individuals  on the reliability of the GW-EBV with IBD information  we performed iterative peeling using 1  2  3  4 and 5 generations of pedigree data  respectively. The corresponding  matrix was inverted and used by ASReml for the EBV prediction. Table  shows that reliability decreased when less than 3 generations of pedigree data were used  and the reliability of the prediction increased only very slightly when the number of generations of pedigree used was greater than 3. Table  shows variance components estimated by ASReml using IBS  IBD and IBS<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBD information. Results suggest that the IBD matrix explained substantially more variance than the IBS matrix  when they were fitted together in the model. Table  presents coefficients of regression (mean and standard error) of DP on the GW-EBV predicted using only IBS information  IBD information and IBS<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBD information  and on the GW-EBV predicted with IBD using 1  2  3  4 and 5 generations of pedigree data  based on six replicates of six training datasets. The regression of the DP on the GW-EBV predicted using IBD information was higher than that on the GW-EBV predicted using IBS information. The regression coefficients were generally slightly higher than 1  which suggests that the variance of the GW-EBV was slightly too low relative to the variance of the DP. The means of the correlations between the GW-EBV using IBD information and GW-EBV using IBS information  for six replicates of six training datasets  were 0.959  0.955 and 0.959 for fat  milk and protein traits  respectively. Thus  the GW-EBV obtained using IBD versus IBS information were somewhat different  although their reliabilities were very similar  suggesting that the information comes from slightly different sources. The correlation between the elements of the  and  matrices was 0.959  which agrees well with the differences in GW-EBV. In our data there was no evidence that IBS information improves the accuracy of selection or the fit of the model  when the model already contains four or more generations of IBD information. A number of factors can have caused or contributed to this finding  which will be discussed below. We believe that the most important factor is that recent family relationships are strong in our bulls population and that older  more distant relationships contribute little to the accuracy of selection. If this is the case  our result would also apply to other populations with strong recent family relationships. In the next paragraph  we explain why we believe that other factors are less important. The estimates of the variance components in Table  show that the IBD matrix explained much more variance than the IBS matrix when they were fitted together in the model. This could be due to (1) the IBD matrix being more accurately estimated than the IBS matrix  although 35 K markers were used for both matrices; and (2) the relationships further back in time  which are not depicted by IBD  are not important for explaining covariances between records. In addition  estimates of the residual variance () were substantially lower when IBD information was used in the model. This may be explained by (1) the IBD and IBD<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBS model overfitted the data; or (2) the IBS model did not explain all the genetic variance which increased the estimate of . In order to distinguish between these two explanations  we also estimated the variance components using a pedigree-based relationship matrix  which is known to yield unbiased estimates. The resulting  estimates were 4.21  11 603  and 16.4 for fat  milk and protein yield  respectively. These estimates are close to those of the IBD and IBD<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBS model  suggesting that explanation (2) is more likely than (1)  although the IBD and IBD<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBS model seem also to overfit the data a little (since their estimates of  were somewhat lower than those of the pedigree based model). A possible explanation for the too high regression coefficients in Table  is that the models overfit the data. However  when fitting a pedigree-based relationship matrix  the regression coefficients were about 1.17 for all three traits (results not shown elsewhere) and thus similar to those of the IBD and IBD<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBS models. Since the pedigree-based model is expected to be unbiased  these biases seem to be due to the deregressed EBV data rather than due to the models being used. Possibly the coefficient used to perform the deregression when calculating the deregressed EBV was too high  resulting in these inflated regression coefficients. It may be postulated that the Italian Brown Swiss population is perhaps rather homogeneous  and that our results cannot be generalized to other populations with more population stratification  e.g. due to a recent admixture of populations. However  this would require that the population admixture took place just before the pedigree recording started  because if the population admixture occurred more than eight or more generations ago  the contributions of the founder populations would have converged and be the same for every bulls. In this case  genetic differences between bulls could not be explained by differential contributions of the founder populations. In the present study  we randomly selected 181 bulls at a time without replacement  to produce six non-overlapping cross-validation datasets. This cross-validation yields a statistically valid estimate of accuracy and predicts the accuracy of a random bulls that could have been in the training dataset but was not. In practical animal breeding  the prediction of young bulls is however more relevant. This requires the prediction of bulls which do not represent a random sample of the training data  and whose genotypes systematically deviate from those of the training bulls  which thus requires an extrapolation from the training data. We did not attempt such an extrapolation here  because the number of young bulls was rather small and included only one set of young bulls. This would not have allowed us to replicate results  which would have made it impossible to calculate standard errors and compare accuracies for statistically significant differences. The IBS<U+2009>+<U+2009>IBD model was not more accurate than the IBD model  which may be due to the 35 k SNP chip not showing a perfect LD with all the genes  and thus that a part of the genetic variance is not accounted for []. The genetic variance that was not picked up by IBS information is explained by the  matrix  since it focuses on within-family linkage analysis  which may have caused the IBD information to yield slightly higher accuracy than the IBS information. The IBD genomic relationship matrix    shows the relationships since a defined base generation  in which animals are assumed unrelated. The  matrix estimates the probability of IBD only based on the pedigree and the inheritance of marker alleles through the pedigree (linkage analysis). Marker alleles that are IBS are not necessarily IBD  unless they can be traced back to a common ancestor within the pedigree. The IBS genomic relationship    shows the genomic similarity between two animals based on the markers being IBS  which also depicts relationships before the base generation of the pedigree. Therefore  the IBS genomic relationship matrix can be regarded as including many more  up to 2  generations of pedigree. GS relies on marker information to predict breeding values and hence in general  the  matrix is used for GS based on the BLUP method. In this study  we used real data to show that using IBD information from a few recent generations can achieve similar accuracy of GS as using IBS information from the markers. Since the accuracies only marginally improve when including IBD information in a model that already contains IBS information  the IBS information alone  and thus LD information  is capable of recovering a large part of the IBD information. The amount of IBD information that can be recovered by the markers may depend on marker density. Table  suggests that most of the information in genomic selection using 35 K SNP in the study came from the last four generations of data. It could be that a higher marker density reduces errors in the estimates of relationship between distant relatives  which may improve the contribution of ancient relationships to the accuracy of GW-EBV. However  prediction of GW-EBV using IBD relationships depends less on marker density  since closely related animals usually share larger chromosomal segments  which may be accurately identified even with a sparse marker map. Thus  the IBD matrix approach may achieve the same accuracy with a less dense SNP panel. Magnitude of LD  and thus reliability of GS  depend on the effective population size []. However  the effective population size varies with time. Our results show that the very recent population structure is critical for the accuracy of GS since the use of four or more generations of pedigree data to calculate IBD genomic relationships gave similar (or even slightly better) accuracy than using . The results also suggest that the recent effective population size is most relevant for the prediction of the reliability of GS with the current SNP densities ~30 – 50 K. The question of how important IBS is depends on the family structure of the population: IBS is less important if recent family relationships are strong  as is usually the case in dairy bulls populations  and was the case here. With increasing SNP density  it is possible to better capture LD with QTL since the expected distance between QTL and flanking marker loci becomes smaller (The Bovine Hapmap Consortium [])  and the estimation error of distant genomic relationships decreases. This is expected to increase the importance of the IBS contribution to accuracy and consequently increase the importance of the historic effective population sizes. The results show that the accuracy of GW-EBV obtained by IBD relationships  estimated through linkage analysis using four or more generations of pedigree and marker information of the bulls  cannot be improved by including IBS information. This is most likely because the recent family structure in our dairy bulls population was so dominant that more distant relationships became less important. Possibly  the distant genomic relationships were also too inaccurately estimated by the 35-50 K SNP. Although GS based on IBS does in principle not require pedigree data  it does use the available population structure  which is indirectly included through the IBS marker information. Our findings may explain why the prediction equations derived in one breed may not predict accurate GW-EBV when applied to other breeds []  because the information derived from the family structure is not relevant for the other breeds.

These consequences were measured by genetic gain  pedigree- and genome-based rates of inbreeding  and local inbreeding across the genome. Breeding schemes were compared by simulating truncation selection or optimum contribution selection with a restriction on pedigree- or genome-based inbreeding  and with selection using estimated breeding values based on genome- or pedigree-based BLUP. Trait information was recorded on full-sibs of the candidates. When the information used to estimate breeding values and to constrain rates of inbreeding were either both pedigree-based or both genome-based  rates of genomic inbreeding were close to the desired values and the identical-by-descent profiles were reasonably uniform across the genome.

In contrast  with a genome-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based estimated breeding values  marker frequencies changed  but this change was limited by the inbreeding constraint at the marker position. To control inbreeding  it is necessary to account for it on the same basis as what is used to estimate breeding values  i.e. pedigree-based inbreeding control with traditional pedigree-based BLUP estimated breeding values and genome-based inbreeding control with genome-based estimated breeding values. Traditional pedigree-based BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) estimated breeding values (EBV) [] are based on pedigree information and recordings of selection candidates and relatives  e.g. sibs of candidates  as in aquaculture breeding schemes  where many traits (e.g. disease resistance and fillet quality) cannot be measured on the candidates. For genomic breeding values  the effects of dense genetic markers are first estimated in a test population and later used to predict breeding values of selection candidates []. Genome-based EBV  i.e. EBV based on high-density marker data across the genome  generally have higher accuracy than pedigree-based BLUP EBV  because genetic markers provide a more accurate relationship matrix than pedigree []  which is based on expected genetic relationships. For example  the expected relationship between two full-sibs is 0.5 but markers show that the true relationship deviates from 0.5 [] and varies among pairs of sibs  depending on the segregation of the parental chromosomes. However  the increased accuracy of genome-based EBV can differ between methods used to estimate them and  e.g.  the number of genes affecting the trait. The genomic BLUP methodology has shown highest accuracy for traits without large quantitative trait loci (QTL) but the BayesB method has shown highest accuracy for traits with known large QTL  because it puts higher weight on genetic markers with large effects [  ]. Optimum contribution selection [  ] is a selection method that maximises genetic gain while restricting the rates of inbreeding in the progeny by restricting relationships between selected parents. Until now  pedigree-based relationship matrices have been used to control inbreeding rates  which constrain inbreeding rates at a neutral locus that is not linked to any QTL. It may be questioned whether such a locus exists  especially since genomic selection and other studies suggest that most traits are affected by a large number of QTL across the genome [–]. Thus  using genomic relationships may help to better control genome-based inbreeding  and may provide a tool for breeders to manage footprints of selection [–]. The aim of this study was to understand the consequences for genetic variability across the genome when genomic information is used to estimate EBV and in managing the inbreeding generated in the course of selection on genome-enhanced EBV. The consequences are measured by genetic gain and the pedigree- and genome-based rates of inbreeding and local inbreeding across the genome. Breeding schemes are compared by simulating truncation selection or optimum contribution selection with a restriction on pedigree- or genome-based inbreeding  and with selection on genome- or pedigree-based BLUP EBV. The trait under selection is a trait for which information on selection candidates comes from full-sibs  which provides a challenging test for developing theory  because the use of genome-based EBV is most beneficial in this situation []. In addition  these so-called sib-tests are commonly applied in practical breeding schemes. A base population with an effective size of 1000 was simulated for 4000 generations. Details are described in []. One hundred sires and 100 dams from generation 4000 were randomly selected to create generation   consisting of 3000 selection candidates () and 3000 or 6000 test sibs (). In later generations ()  selection was done by truncation or optimum contribution selection. Inbreeding coefficients based on pedigree () and rates of inbreeding based on pedigree () assumed that the  individuals were unrelated base individuals. Simulation of the genomes has been described elsewhere []. The genome consisted of 10 pairs of chromosomes (1Morgan each). All polymorphisms were generated during the 4000 generations of the Fisher-Wright population model [  ]. The infinite sites mutation model [] was used to create new bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)  using a mutation rate of 10 per nucleotide and assuming 10 nucleotides per cM. Inheritance of the SNP followed Mendel’s law and the Haldane mapping function [] was used to simulate recombination. One hundred SNP per chromosome were sampled randomly without replacement from SNP with a minor allele frequency (MAF)<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05 and used as QTL  i.e. the total number of QTL was 1000. From the remaining SNP  1000 SNP with the highest MAF over all chromosomes were chosen as genetic markers. In addition  100 artificial identical-by-descent (IBD) markers were positioned at equal distances on each chromosome. These IBD markers were not involved in selection  but were assigned unique founder alleles in generation   in order to monitor the increase of the local genomic IBD at these positions. Additive effects of the QTL alleles were sampled from a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.4 and a scale parameter of 1.66 []. The QTL effects were assumed to be either positive or negative with a probability of 0.5 because the gamma distribution only gives positive values. After sampling  these QTL effects were standardized so that the total genetic variance was 1. The true breeding value () of an individual was calculated as: where  is the number of copies of the  allele that individual  has at the  QTL position and  is the effect of the  allele at the  position. The phenotypic values    of individuals in the sib-test were simulated by: where  is an error term for animal   which was normally distributed with mean zero and variance   which was adjusted so the heritability was 0.4. Marker effects    were predicted using the genome-based BLUP method described in []  named GBLUP hereafter. The statistical model used was: where  is the record of test sib    is the overall mean   is the total number of markers   denotes the standardised marker genotype   is the random effect of the  marker and Var() is assumed 1/ since the total genetic variance was standardised to 1   is a random residual.  was standardised to a mean of 0 and a variance of 1: denotes that the individual is homozygous for the first allele; (1-2)/v denotes that it is heterozygous; and (2-2)/v denotes that it is homozygous for the second allele  where  is the marker heterozygosity and  is the frequency of the second allele. Division by v results in every SNP explaining an equal amount of variance a priori (independent of the frequency of the SNP). The genetic variance explained by a SNP is *  where  is the linkage disequilibrium between the SNP and the nearest QTL  and  is the variance due to this QTL. Division by v  avoids making the assumption that SNP with high  have proportionally higher   which would especially be questionable in a situation where most QTL have a low frequency  as is the case when the QTL alleles are in mutation-drift equilibrium and even more so if the QTL are under selection. However  QTL with low allele frequencies are expected to have lower . Here  none of the markers used had low   thus correction of  by v is expected to affect the results only marginally. Genome-based BLUP EBV () were estimated by summing across the estimated effects of the markers: In addition   were calculated with method BayesB  as described in []. BayesB uses the same statistical model as GBLUP but attempts to reduce the weight of SNP that are estimated to have no association with QTL. It also assumes a priori that many SNP have no effect and few SNP (1000 here) have t-distributed effects. Traditional pedigree-based BLUP EBV () were estimated with the method described in []  named TBLUP hereafter  in which genetic relationships are based on pedigree information. Pedigree recording started in generation . The optimum contribution selection algorithm of [] was used  i.e. the genetic level of the next-generation animals  <U+2009>=<U+2009> ( contains either  or )  was maximised  where  is a vector of genetic contributions of the selection candidates to generation <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. Rates of inbreeding were restricted by constraining the average relationship of the selection candidates to   where  was a relationship matrix among the selection candidates    and  was the desired rate of inbreeding []  i.e. 0.005 or 0.010 per generation. The relationship matrix was either based on pedigree or genomic data. For the latter  it equalled <U+2009>=<U+2009>/[]. Having calculated the optimum contribution vector   the next generation of offspring were produced by sampling a male and a female parent with replacement  according to the probabilities given by 2  which resulted in random mating. One hundred full-sib families were created each generation  from  to . Each family was split into 30 selection candidates and 30 or 60 test sibs. The test sibs were recorded for the trait. For the schemes using   test sibs were only phenotyped  while for those using   test sibs were phenotyped and genotyped to estimate the SNP effects and selection candidates were genotyped. This sib-test provided a challenging test for the management of genetic variation but it is also very relevant as it in such circumstances that the use of genomic data in breeding value estimation is of greatest value. For a simple comparison of TBLUP and GBLUP  truncation selection was used instead of optimum contribution selection. Each generation  100 sires and 100 dams were selected from 3000 selection candidates on their breeding values estimated either from TBLUP or GBLUP. These sires and dams were pair-wise mated to produce 100 full-sib families for the next generation  using sampling without replacement. Genomic IBD was obtained by calculating the allele frequencies of the founder alleles at the IBD markers  i.e.  for founder allele  at IBD marker . Their homozygosity  i.e. probability of IBD was then calculated for IBD marker  as S. To calculate   this IBD probability was averaged over all IBD markers to evaluate the overall IBD over the genome in generations to . IBD profiles differed between replicates because the position and size of the QTL differed. TBLUP and GBLUP schemes were compared using either truncation selection or optimum contribution selection. In the latter case  the constraint was based on relationships derived either from pedigree () or from markers (). The schemes were run for ten generations (-) and summary statistics for each of the schemes were based on 100 replicated simulations. The breeding schemes were compared for rates of inbreeding per generation () and genetic gain ()  expressed in genetic standard deviation units of generation  (s) in generation . The rates of inbreeding per generation were calculated in two ways  either from the pedigree  or using the IBD loci  Here  the symbol  denotes a constraint on pedigree-based relationships and thus on inbreeding  and  denotes the rate of inbreeding as calculated from the pedigree that results from the breeding scheme. Inbreeding coefficients at each IBD locus were also stored to analyse inbreeding rates as a function of locus and generation. The truncation selection schemes evaluated constitute classical selection with comparisons made at constant selection intensity and scheme size. For these schemes  genetic gain was 11% higher for GBLUP than for TBLUP and  although  was much lower for GBLUP than TBLUP   was only slightly lower for GBLUP than TBLUP (Table ). Rate of inbreeding measured by  was 51% greater than inbreeding measured by  for TBLUP schemes but 292% greater for GBLUP schemes (Table ). Thus  with GBLUP schemes the increase in genomic inbreeding was well above the increase in pedigree inbreeding. A higher genome-wide IBD profile was obtained with TBLUP than with GBLUP (Figure ). These results show the importance of considering the basis for constraining rates of inbreeding.

Table  shows that  with the current practice of explicitly constraining  the desired rate of inbreeding    was observed in  but not when the constraint was implemented based on . Table  also shows that when selection was on TBLUP  the observed  substantially exceeded .

Due to the inadequacy of constraining    increased above  even more strongly with GBLUP than with TBLUP (by ~320-360% with GBLUP and ~35-50% with TBLUP). The greatest increase in  was observed when <U+2009>=<U+2009>6000. When  was constrained   was again greater with GBLUP than with TBLUP  however in this case  the magnitudes of the increase depended on   i.e. by ~35% when  was set at 0.005 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>3000 and by ~65% when  was set at 0.010. When applying the constraint using  with TBLUP   substantially exceeded the desired . The observed  was even more extreme  and was ~50% greater than  However  when applying the constraint using  with GBLUP   was ~70-80% of the desired  With GBLUP  schemes that constrained  showed a substantially more variable IBD profile across the genome (Figure A)  than those that constrained  (Figure B). In contrast  with TBLUP  schemes that constrained  showed little variation in the genome-wide IBD profile (Figure C)  while those that constrained  showed a very erratic profile (Figure D).

Schemes that constrained  showed a constant  over generations but at a higher level than the constraint when selection was on TBLUP (Figure ). Schemes that constrained  showed an increase in  over generations  in particular when selection was on GBLUP. This increase in  over generations is probably due to fixation of favourable alleles  which occurs faster with GBLUP. This increased  over time also suggests that the constraint on  becomes less restrictive over time when selection uses .

Use of  derived using BayesB showed very similar results as using  from GBLUP in terms of  and accuracy of selection (Table ). BayesB had significantly higher  (0.0235 compared to 0.0209)  which can be explained by a larger focus on some SNP  which increased local IBD values but also the overall . These results are in concordance with []  who found that BayesB is advantageous for traits with a few large QTL and many smaller QTL. Here  1000 QTL were simulated  which disadvantaged BayesB compared to GBLUP. With BayesB  the IBD profile had a few IBD peaks but was generally quite uniform (Figure ).  Variance (s-unit) explained by QTL in generation  () and IBD () in generation  with truncation selection and BayesB estimated breeding values; results are from one replicate with 3000 selection candidates and 3000 test sibs. Several methods for the management of  have been suggested in the literature [        ]. With the development of genomic selection  genomic relationships have become available in addition to the traditional pedigree-based relationships. An immediate question then is whether the constraint should be based on pedigree () or genomic () relationships  when combined with breeding value estimation based on pedigree (TBLUP) or genomic (GBLUP) information. Our results address this question by showing that if the information sources used to estimate breeding values and to constrain  are identical  i.e. either both pedigree-based or both genomic-based  then the resulting rates of genomic inbreeding correspond to the desired values and the rates are reasonably uniform across the genome. However  if different information is used to calculate breeding values and to constrain   e.g.  the EBV are based on genomic information and the  constraint is on pedigree information  the resulting rate of inbreeding  based on   is much higher than expected. It is important to recognise the distinction between the three relationships measures between two individuals  and  that are considered in this study:   the numerator relationship derived from pedigree;   the identity by state relationship obtained from the markers accumulated over time and used to estimate ; and   the relationship between the identity-by-descent markers defined in the base population used for reference. EBV were estimated either using  (TBLUP) or  (GBLUP) and rates of inbreeding were controlled using either  or  since these values are accessible and known. However  the examination of the development of relationships over time is based on  or  since these measure IBD with respect to the base generation   with the objective of controlling the drift in an unknown locus from the start of selection. Using  for this control will be predictive and unbiased for a neutral locus that is unlinked to variants with an effect  whereas  is an empirical value that is not restricted by neutrality or position of the locus. Using  to control inbreeding has the advantage of acting upon relationships that already exist in generation   whereas both  and  assume that  animals are unrelated. Interpretation of the consequences of these differences in breeding value estimation  control of inbreeding and assessment of IBD may be helped by considering the impacts when  and  are full-sib candidates. For the simulated sib-tested trait  the distinctions between EBV estimated using TBLUP versus GBLUP are clear  since  and  will have the same EBV with TBLUP but information on Mendelian sampling terms to differentiate the sibs is available with GBLUP. For the same reason  full-sibs    and  will be treated as having equal pair-wise relationships when measured using  but different pair-wise relationships when measured using . The incentive to include genomic data into breeding schemes comes from its use in breeding value estimations. With GBLUP  the results of Table  are interpretable from the framework outlined in the previous paragraph. When  is constrained  the relationship of two selected individuals  and  will be greater than their pedigree relationship since their high merit implies that on average they are more likely to share QTL  as well as flanking segments that  over time  will tend to become more homozygous along with the QTL. Thus the genome will contain segments where segregation is not free from the influence of selection and where there is more homozygosity than predicted by  and so E[|]<U+2009>><U+2009>  i.e. when we condition on or constrain   we expect  to exceed . Hence  constraining  will result in underestimating . The extent of this underestimation will depend on the density of the QTL across the genome and the linkage disequilibrium between the QTL. In a similar way  when  is constrained  E[|]<U+2009><<U+2009>  and so  will be less than the target value  whereas E[|]<U+2009>~<U+2009> in this context. If breeding value estimation is based on TBLUP then truncation selection will select whole full-sib families but not with selection with optimized contributions. When inbreeding management is based on   then E[|]<U+2009>><U+2009> after selection  for the same reasons as before  i.e. large segments are not free of the influence of selection  and  is greater than the desired rate of inbreeding. With TBLUP  the impact on  is not as large as when using GBLUP since the QTL are not identified as accurately and response to selection is less. The most challenging outcomes occur when  is constrained. In this case  two full-sibs might be selected if they appear less related based on markers than expected based on pedigree. On the one hand  E[|] is greater than  since the prediction errors of  from  will be positive because variation not explained by  is more likely to reflect the full-sib pedigree relationship. On the other hand  E[|] will be much greater than  since the genomic relationships of those sibs that are selected will be below average and thus lower than . Hence   will be greater than  It is notable that the combination of TBLUP with  delivers the least gain for close to the highest rates of inbreeding  by either measure (see Table ). Although this combination may not be practical  it is instructive. The dynamics of  over time can also be explained within this framework. The only combination without a stable trend in inbreeding was when  was used as the constraint with GBLUP; all other combinations showed a stable  (Figure ). With GBLUP and    continuously increased during generations  to  (i.e. the rate of inbreeding increased)  probably because the estimates of marker effects are more persistent over generations than the pedigree relationships  implying that changes across many generations of the frequencies of (selected) chromosome segments are not picked up by pedigree relationships. As a result  GEBV favour specific chromosome segments generation after generation  thereby increasing  but not . Thus  especially in the longer term  discrepancies in the information used to estimate the breeding values and to control inbreeding will hamper the control of inbreeding. Some of the outcomes observed here depend on the number and distribution of effects of the QTL: we simulated 1000 QTL on a genome of 10 M. With a much smaller number of QTL  i.e. when the genome is predominantly composed of neutral loci that are weakly linked to QTL   is expected to be closer to  However  increasing evidence from well-studied traits such as human height indicates that many traits are composed of many QTL each explaining a small part of the variance []. Trait heritability was rather high here (0.4). With a lower trait heritability  the number of sib-tested animals needs to be increased in order to obtain similar accuracies as found in the present study []. Inbreeding at QTL positions is desirable in breeding schemes because this increases the frequency of the positive alleles towards homozygosity. However  narrowing the genomic IBD peak at the QTL positions is also desired  so that the remaining genome is as little as possible affected by selection at individual QTL  i.e. the footprint of selection should be as small as possible. Based on the hitchhiking effect []  a broad genomic IBD peak around the largest QTL would have been expected. However  when GBLUP was used and  was constrained  the genome-wide IBD profile was rather flat (Figure B)  which suggests that this selection method spreads the selection pressure quite evenly over many loci in order to control . This implies that  in practical breeding schemes  it is not necessary to implement additional constraints on the genomic inbreeding at positions surrounding large QTL in order to avoid excessive rates of genomic inbreeding in QTL regions. A reduction of the footprint of selection may also be achieved by increasing the frequencies of a broad spectrum of QTL alleles slowly  instead of heavily selecting on the biggest QTL with the danger of a large selection footprint. The latter seems to have occurred with genomic optimum contribution selection with estimation based on GBLUP  since the increase of the IBD was rather flat across the genome for that scenario (Figure B). The GBLUP method assumes that all SNP explain the same genetic variance (1/  i.e. 5000 here). Use of BayesB resulted in an IBD profile with more peaks (Figure ) but not to the extent that local restrictions of inbreeding would be required. Further research is needed to investigate whether in situations with a few large QTL and using BayesB  directed measures would be required to reduce the footprint of selection in the regions of large QTL  and how such measures should be implemented. In case the SNP effects are estimated accurately and do not change over time  a model that maximises the genetic gain over a specified time horizon can also be used []  since this will spread the selection intensity optimally across the genomic regions in order to maximise long-term genetic gain. In our study  allelic effects were assumed purely additive  whereas dominance and higher order interactions may occur. Dominance interactions can be partly accommodated by including a regression on (genomic) inbreeding in the model used to estimate breeding values. This will correct the (G)EBV so that they are valid for matings that result in non-inbred offspring. In practice  animals are expected to be mated to related selection candidates and thus their (G)EBV should be corrected for the inbreeding depression times their expected future inbreeding  which is their average coancestry with the selection candidates []. The design of the breeding scheme studied here resembles that of aquaculture breeding schemes  which rely heavily on sib-testing. In this design  traditional selection relies only on family information and either selects entire full-sib families or rejects them. The use of genomic selection makes it possible to estimate within-family deviations  and thus to distinguish between family members. This sib-testing design may have exaggerated the differences between genomic and traditional selection  and their effects on genome structure  because in most practical breeding schemes traditional selection also yields an estimate of the within-family deviation. However  in such schemes  genomic selection will estimate within-family deviations more accurately and thus the general outcomes of our study will still hold. In addition  genomic selection will be applied mainly in situations in which traditional selection yields little or no information on the within-family genetic component. This study shows that serious interactions can occur between the methods used to estimate breeding values and the types of relationships used to control inbreeding. Results showed that outcomes are most stable and predictable  i.e. the final outcome reflects the constraint  when the same information is used to estimate breeding values and to control inbreeding. Thus  genomic selection has to be combined with genomic control of inbreeding in order to effectively manage . Desired control of inbreeding was only achieved when it was managed using the same information as is used to estimate breeding values  i.e. pedigree-based inbreeding control with pedigree-based estimation of breeding values and genome-based inbreeding control with genome-based estimation of breeding values. In addition  the genome-based estimation of breeding values allows management of changes in genomic inbreeding  and thus changes in pedigree-based inbreeding are probably no longer relevant.

Genomic selection (GS) is a variant of marker-assisted selection in which genetic markers covering the whole genome are used so that all quantitative trait loci (QTL) are in linkage disequilibrium with at least one marker []. Simulation results and practical data in dairy cattle suggest that breeding values can be predicted with high accuracy using genetic markers alone [  ]. Since the introduction of the idea by Meuwissen et al. [] ten years ago  there has been a number of developments  including the implementation of GS in dairy cattle breeding []. Until recently  the major limitation to implement GS was the large number of markers required and the cost of genotyping these markers. Both these limitations have now been overcome in most livestock species  following the sequencing of the genomes and the subsequent availability of high-density SNP chips []. It is now feasible to meet the requirements for the implementation of GS in breeding programs. In fact  after deriving a prediction equation from a reference population that uses markers and phenotypes as input and predicts breeding values as output  there is in principle no need to record phenotypes of the candidates for the selection. Thus  GS can potentially cut costs for producing and testing potential breeding animals considerably. Moreover  GS can have a large impact on breeding programs for many livestock species as it can shorten generation intervals  which is of special importance in long-lived species such as dairy cattle and horses  or when trait values become available late in life or on progeny only. This is important  as genotyping can be applied to new-born animals or even embryos []  and because of the reduced need for progeny testing. A limitation of GS  however  is that large reference populations are needed to obtain high accuracies of estimated breeding values (EBV). When the size of the reference population increases  the accuracy of EBV can reach high values  approaching 0.8 to 1.0 [    ]. Reference population sizes used in simulations sometimes even exceed 100 000 animals [] but in practise  reference populations are in some cases limited to less than 1000 animals []. In many livestock populations and some livestock species  creation of large reference populations is not very feasible for many traits  especially when phenotypes are difficult or expensive to record  such as methane emission in cattle or traits related to disease resistance. If large reference populations cannot be obtained  GS will reach relatively low accuracies  and may yield no or relatively little additional response compared to traditional selection on EBV based on phenotypic information. This applies particularly to populations with a large historical effective size  and to traits that are determined by many genes  which is common in livestock [  ]. The more genes involved  the smaller the effect of individual genes  and the larger the reference population needed to reach a certain accuracy []. For those reasons  it is important to investigate when GS offers advantages over traditional selection in cases in which the size of the reference population is limited. In this study  we compared response to GS with response to selection on BLUP-EBV based on own performance (OP) or progeny testing (PT) information  in cases with a limited number of phenotypic records available to develop a reference population. We focussed on the equilibrium response obtained after a few generations of selection []. Thus  we first investigated the reduction of accuracy and response to selection due to the effect of selection on the genetic variance  the so-called Bulmer effect []. Second  we investigated the optimal construction of the reference population when the number of phenotypic records is limited. In dairy cattle  construction of a reference population started with genotyping progeny tested bulls  merely because accurate EBV based on progeny testing were available for these bulls []. When the number of phenotypic records is limiting   when records still need to be collected  it may however be suboptimal to use progeny tested individuals to construct the reference population. Finally  we investigated the minimal size of the reference population necessary for GS to become advantageous over traditional BLUP EBV selection  and the dependency of this break-even point on heritability and generation interval. Response to selection is predicted with deterministic simulations based on selection index theory  using the SelAction software. SelAction predicts the response to selection and accuracy of selection for breeding programs. The software accounts for reduction in variance due to selection  known as the “Bulmer-effect” []  and for the use of pedigree information  as with selection on BLUP-EBV. Features of SelAction and the theoretical background are described in []. Genomic selection schemes can be simulated in SelAction by including an additional trait representing the marker information [  ]. The marker information was modelled as a trait with a heritability of 0.999  which was genetically correlated to the trait of interest. The genetic correlation between the marker information and the trait of interest was equal to the accuracy of genomic EBV    which depends on the reference population. The  represents the accuracy of genomic EBV in an unselected population and is calculated using Equation -d given below []. Because it is assumed that genotypes can be observed without error  the marker information is fully heritable and has no residual variance. Thus  the environmental correlation between the marker information and the trait of interest is meaningless and was set to zero in SelAction. Further details of this approach are given in []. Because the accuracy of genomic EBV established in the reference population   refers to the accuracy in a population that is not under selection  there is a distinction between  and the Bulmer equilibrium accuracy of a breeding scheme based on genomic selection  denoted  in this paper. The Bulmer effect reduces the proportion of genetic variance explained by the markers  so that  will be smaller than  in an on-going breeding scheme. The results of the deterministic simulations presented in the Results and Discussion section refer to the Bulmer-equilibrium accuracy and response that are reached after a few (= 3) generations of selection. The deterministic simulations accounted for the Bulmer effect. Numerical results may  however  give less insight into the magnitude of the Bulmer effect than a simple mathematical expression. In this section  therefore  a mathematical expression is derived for the Bulmer-equilibrium response  accuracy and additive genetic variance with genomic selection. In generation   the variance of the genomic EBV of the  parents can be expressed as where the * denotes values after selection   is the variance of the genomic EBV before selection  . among the candidates for selection in generation   and  is the proportional reduction in the variance of the selection criterion due to selection of the parents. Because  refers to the variance of the selection criterion  rather than the variance of true breeding values  it is independent of the accuracy of selection. With truncation selection on a normally distributed selection criterion   is determined entirely by the intensity of selection   =  ( )  where  is the intensity of selection and  the standardized truncation point [  –]. Values of  are usually in the range of 0.7 to 0.9. To illustrate the impact of the Bulmer effect as simple as possible  equal selection intensity is assumed here for both sexes. The variance of the genomic EBV in the next generation is the sum of the between-family variance of genomic EBV and the Mendelian sampling variance of the genomic EBV  which originates from segregation of the markers  where the  is the Mendelian-sampling variance of the genomic EBV  which is half the variance of the estimated marker effects in an unselected population. This equation assumes that the effective number of marker loci with effects is large  so that changes in marker allele frequency can be ignored in the short term. The equilibrium variance of genomic EBV follows from substituting  =  and solving for   which yields For example  for a phenotypic variance of  = 1  and a heritability of the unselected base-generation of  = 0.3  an initial accuracy of genomic EBV of  = 0.8  and a selected proportion of 5%  so that <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.86  the initial variance of genomic EBV equals 0.8 × 0.3 × 1 = 0.192 and the equilibrium variance of genomic EBV equals 0.192/1.86<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.103. Since response (R) to GS equals   which is proportional to  rather than   the equilibrium response to GS  expressed relative to initial response  equals This results shows that the relative reduction in response due to the Bulmer effect is independent of the accuracy of selection  which agrees with results from the deterministic simulations (See Results and Discussion). For example  for a selected proportion of 5%  the Bulmer effect reduces response to GS by  = 27%  irrespective of the initial accuracy of genomic EBV. The Bulmer-equilibrium accuracy and additive genetic variance with GS can also be derived from the unselected base-generation parameters. The equilibrium additive genetic variance follows from   where the first term represents the between-family variance in true breeding values   is the Bulmer-equilibrium accuracy of genomic EBV  and the second term is the Mendelian sampling variance of the true breeding values. Solving for  yields The Bulmer-equilibrium accuracy follows from  and substitution of Equations  and   which yields an expression for equilibrium accuracy in terms of base generation parameters  Continuing the above example yields an equilibrium accuracy of  = 0.70. An expression for the Bulmer-equilibrium additive genetic variance  expressed in terms of base-generation parameters  follows from substitution of Equation  into   Continuing the above example yields an equilibrium additive genetic variance of 0.3[1-(0.86×0.8)/(1+0.86)] = 0.21. Equations  through  show that Bulmer-equilibrium parameters can be calculated from base-generation parameters using simple equations. The equilibrium additive genetic variance can be understood as the sum of the equilibrium variance of the genomic EBV  which is given by Equation   and the variance of the prediction error  which is unaffected by selection  Accuracies of genomic EBV depend on the size of the reference population ()  the effective number of loci for which effects have to be estimated ()  and the correlation of the true breeding value of a genotyped individual with its phenotypic record (). In a random sample of the population  the accuracy of genomic EBV    being the correlation between the genomic EBV and the true breeding value  can be calculated using where <U+03BB> = / being the number of individuals in the reference population with both phenotypic records and genotypes []. Parameter  depends on the historical effective size of the unselected population () and on the size of the genome   in Morgan  and can be estimated as []  When genotyping and phenotyping the same individuals in the reference population   is equal to the square root of heritability of the trait  When the reference population is based on progeny-tested individuals    when parents are genotyped while their offspring are phenotyped   equals the accuracy of EBV obtained from progeny testing []  where  is the number of half-sib progeny on which the EBV is based. To investigate the optimal construction of the reference population  values for  were compared for different numbers of progeny per sire and reference population sizes  for a fixed heritability of 0.3. For the comparison of GS with selection based on traditional BLUP-EBV estimated from phenotypic information  deterministic simulations were performed with SelAction  using the approach described above. Alternative breeding schemes were compared based on the Bulmer-equilibrium response to selection. Several selection schemes were evaluated  to illustrate the general characteristics of selection on traditional BLUP-EBV versus GS. For GS  the reference population size ()  and heritability () were varied  to investigate the effect of these parameters on response to selection. All other parameters were kept constant across scenarios. Selection was for a single trait and in males only. To mimic the absence of selection in females  the selected proportion in females was set to 0.99. Three scenarios were investigated: Selection on BLUP-EBV estimated from own performance information (OP). Selection on BLUP-EBV estimated from progeny information (PT). Genomic selection based on marker information on selection candidates (GS). To investigate the benefit of genomic information on top of phenotypic information  genomic information instead of phenotypic information  the GS scheme was applied both with and without phenotypic information on the candidates for selection. The following assumptions were made for all scenarios: The population had discrete generations and a fixed number of sires and dams per generation. There was a population of 1 000 dams per generation. Twenty sires were used per generation. Each dam produced two male and two female offspring per generation. In the case of progeny testing  10 half sib progeny per sire were available in the progeny test. In scenarios (1)  (2) and (3) with genomic information in addition to phenotypic information  full pedigree information was available for breeding value estimation as assumed in the pseudo-BLUP selection index used in SelAction []. The historical effective population size was assumed to be 100 (required for Equation ). One-stage selection  with a selection proportion of 0.02 in sires and 0.99 in dams. It was assumed that  of all progeny born  50% were not suitable as selection candidates because of health  fertility or veterinary reasons. Therefore  we used selected proportions of 99% in females and 2% in males. In scenario (1)  OP  no phenotypic information was assumed to be available on sibs of the selection candidate. Results will be presented in two ways. First  we compare responses to selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on own performance or progeny information with GS  where GS schemes either include or exclude phenotypic information. Second  we identify the break-even size of the reference population at which GS without phenotypic information yields the same response as selection on traditional BLUP-EBV. In this approach  we model the break-even size of the reference population as a function of the reduction in generation interval that can be achieved when implementing GS. Results of the deterministic simulations revealed that GS schemes show a greater reduction in response due to the Bulmer-effect than schemes with selection directly based on phenotypic information (i.e. without the use of pedigree information)  such as mass selection or selection on the mean of a progeny group (Table<U+2009>). This occurs because GS targets a proportion of the genetic variation with full accuracy  whereas selection based on phenotypes targets the full genetic variation with limited accuracy. As a consequence  the genetic variance used in GS  i.e the variance of the sum of marker effects  is strongly reduced by selection as a result of the build-up of negative covariances between the effects of markers (under the infinitesimal model)  which in turn reduces the accuracy. This can be illustrated by a comparison of mass selection with an initial heritability of 25% to GS with an initial accuracy of 0.5  for a trait with unit phenotypic variance and 5% selected (Table<U+2009>). In an unselected population  both schemes have the same accuracy of 0.5. Results of the deterministic simulations showed that the equilibrium accuracy and additive genetic variance were 0.47 and 0.21 for mass selection but 0.39 and 0.22 for GS. Consequently  equilibrium response was 14% lower than first-generation response for mass selection but 27% lower for GS. Hence  at equilibrium  mass selection yielded 118% of the response of GS. In fact  an accuracy of 0.59 prior to selection would have been required for GS to be equivalent to mass selection at equilibrium. Results of the deterministic simulations also revealed a second difference between GS and mass selection. With mass selection  the reduction in response due to the Bulmer effect was greater at higher accuracy (i.e. ). With a selected proportion of 5%  for example  response to mass selection is reduced by only 7% when <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.10 but by 21% when <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.50 (Table<U+2009>). With GS  in contrast  the reduction in response due to the Bulmer effect did not depend on the accuracy of selection. With a selected proportion of 5%  the Bulmer effect always reduced response by 27% in GS schemes  irrespective of the accuracy. Again  this occurred because the estimated genetic effects used in GS are known with full accuracy  since the markers are observed. The above results show that reduction in response due to the Bulmer effect is always larger for GS than for selection based directly on phenotypic information (e.g mass selection)  except when accuracy of selection approaches 100%  in which case the reduction will be the same. The theoretical results found here (Equations 1a-e) are identical to the results found by Dekkers [  ] for selection on traditional BLUP-EBV. Hence  the impact of the Bulmer-effect on response  accuracy and additive genetic variance is the same for GS as for traditional BLUP selection. The reduction in response to selection  for example  is independent of the accuracy of selection for both GS and selection on BLUP-EBV. The above calculations of the Bulmer effect will be approximations when marker effects are updated each generation (known as “retraining”). Nevertheless  the effect of updating marker effects is expected to be small  because the additional data becoming available for retraining each generation will usually be smaller than the already existing reference population  and the change in accuracy due to adding records to the reference population shows a diminishing return relationship. The expressions derived here for the Bulmer-equilibrium response  additive genetic variance and accuracy with GS (Equations 1a-e above) are identical to those for selection on classical BLUP-EBV presented in [  ]. This makes sense because a model with genome-wide estimated marker effects is equivalent to a mixed model with a genomic relationship matrix []. Hence  results for the Bulmer effect presented here are consistent with the equivalence of GS based on estimated marker effects . a mixed model with a genomic relationship matrix. However  the derivations in [  ] have a different foundation; they rely on the property of BLUP that selection on EBV does not affect the prediction error variance of the EBV [  ]. Hence  the agreement of our results with those in [  ] constitutes an independent proof of the expressions derived here. When the total number of phenotypic records is fixed  a reference population with phenotypic information on the genotyped individuals yields a greater accuracy of genomic EBV than a reference population with progeny information on the genotyped individuals (Equation 2  Figure ). With progeny information  the number of sires on which the reference population is constructed will obviously decrease when the number of progeny per sire increases  which consequently reduces the accuracy  particularly when the number of phenotypic records is small (Figure ). For example  with 4 000 phenotypic records and 20 progeny per sire  the reference population consists of  = 200 genotyped sires with EBV based on 20 progeny  whereas with two progeny per sire  the reference population consists of  = 2 000 genotyped sires with EBV based on two progeny. Although increasing the size of the progeny groups increases the accuracy of the sire’s EBV  the number of sires with which the GS reference population is constructed has a much larger impact on the accuracy of genomic EBV. Thus  when the number of phenotypic records is limiting  it is optimal to genotype the individuals that produce the phenotype  not their parents.  Different lines indicate different progeny group sizes; PG<U+2009>=<U+2009>genotyped individuals in the reference population have an own performance records (same individuals phenotyped and genotyped); when the progeny group size is  e.g.  20  the number of genotyped individuals in the reference population () equals the total number of phenotypes divided by the size of the progeny group; accuracy  is calculated from Equations -d  for N<U+2009>=<U+2009>100  L<U+2009>=<U+2009>30  and h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.3. Studies using stochastic simulations have shown that the accuracy of genomic EBV decreases as the number of generations between the selection candidates and the animals in the reference population increases []. Thus  a reference population is ideally constructed using individuals most closely related to the candidates for selection []. Buch et al. [] also showed that the number of daughters that need to be genotyped to replace their sires in the reference population is a function of the number of offspring underlying the sire’s EBV but is independent of the number of sires. Our results are based on a theoretical relationship between reference population size and accuracy (Equation 2)  which assumes that individuals in the reference population and selection candidates are not closely related []. Hence  the accuracies of genomic EBV used here may be conservative. In addition  we assumed no decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) or change in marker frequencies. Figure  shows that the increase in the accuracy of genomic EBV with the number of phenotypic records is strongly non-linear  showing a diminishing-return relationship. As a consequence  increasing the total number of phenotypic records increases accuracy less than proportional. Increasing the number of phenotypes in the reference population from 5 000 to 10 000  for example  which is 2-fold  increases accuracy of genomic EBV by only 32% (Figure ). Results presented in this section refer to the Bulmer-equilibrium response and assume that the reference population is optimized for a limited number of phenotypic records. Thus  the same individuals are both phenotyped and genotyped  so that  refers to both the number of phenotypic records and the number of genotyped individuals in the reference population. Figure a compares response to selection per generation between selection on traditional BLUP-EBV and GS schemes when the selection candidates do not have phenotypic information. The results show that large reference population sizes are required for GS to outperform traditional breeding schemes. Even with reference population sizes of 10 000 individuals  GS did not generate a larger response per generation than traditional breeding.   - Response expressed in phenotypic standard deviations  for different information sources and reference population sizes. Different lines refer to different heritabilities; the GS schemes do not have phenotypic information on the selection candidate (NOP<U+2009>=<U+2009>No Own Performance)  hence  genomic information replaces phenotypic information; OP<U+2009>=<U+2009>selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on own performance records; PT<U+2009>=<U+2009>selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on progeny testing; GS<U+2009>=<U+2009>genomic selection; number indicates the size of the reference population; in the reference population  the same individuals are genotyped and phenotyped; note that the x-axis scale is non-linear; for N<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and L<U+2009>=<U+2009>30.  - Response expressed in phenotypic standard deviations  for different information sources and reference population sizes. Different lines refer to different heritabilities; in the GS schemes  individuals also have information on their own phenotype  hence  genomic information is available in addition to phenotypic information; OP<U+2009>=<U+2009>selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on own performance records; PT<U+2009>=<U+2009>selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on progeny testing; GS<U+2009>=<U+2009>genomic selection; number indicates the size of the reference population; in the reference population  the same individuals are genotyped and phenotyped; note that the x-axis scale is non-linear; For N<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and L<U+2009>=<U+2009>30. Figure b compares selection on traditional BLUP-EBV to GS schemes when the selection candidates also have phenotypic information. Hence  in the GS schemes in Figure b  genomic information is available in addition to phenotypic information. Results show that in these cases  GS is of little additional value  unless the reference population is very large. Figures a and b show that the response pattern does not change much with heritability. In conclusion  Figures a and b show that GS cannot compete with traditional selection when the number of phenotypic records is limited  unless the generation interval can be decreased by GS. Figures a and b show the break-even size of the reference population that is needed to reach a similar response to that with selection on traditional BLUP-EBV  as a function of the decrease in the generation interval that can be obtained when implementing GS. When the generation interval cannot be decreased  large reference population sizes are required  particularly when heritability is high  which agrees with Figures a and b. However  when generation intervals can be decreased  the break-even size of the reference population decreases rapidly  particularly when heritability is high  because of the non-linear relationship of accuracy with the number of phenotypes; a reduction in reference population size yields a less than proportional reduction in accuracy (Figure ). In contrast  a reduction in generation interval yields a proportional increase in response. As a consequence  small reductions in generation interval lead to relatively large reductions in the break-even size of the reference population. For example  for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100<U+2009>×<U+2009>30  compared to selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on own performance information  a reference population size of<U+2009>~<U+2009>6 000 individuals is needed when the generation interval is reduced by 20%  whereas only<U+2009>~<U+2009>2 000 individuals are needed when the generation interval is halved (Figure a). Compared to selection on BLUP-EBV based on 10 progeny per sire  a reference population size of<U+2009>~<U+2009>10 000 individuals is needed when the generation interval is reduced by 20%  whereas<U+2009>~<U+2009>3 500 individuals are needed when the generation interval is halved (Figure b). Because traditional progeny testing schemes require rather large numbers of phenotypic records and have long generation intervals  GS schemes will often be superior to progeny testing schemes when compared at an equal number of phenotypic records. Although precise results will depend on the value of  and   the patterns shown in Figures a and b are not expected to depend on these factors.  3a -Based on own performance information. In the reference population  the same individuals are genotyped and phenotyped; for N<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and L<U+2009>=<U+2009>30. 3b - Based on progeny-testing with 10 progeny per sire. In the reference population  the same individuals are genotyped and phenotyped; for N<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and L<U+2009>=<U+2009>30. Breeding programs usually focus on improvement of multiple traits and  thus  the generation interval is not determined by a single trait. This raises the question whether the conclusions drawn above from Figures a and b can be applied to breeding programs in practise. We believe they can  for the following reasons. First  for traits that are easy to record but that cannot be recorded on the selection candidates of both sexes  such as milk yield or egg number  GS is attractive since it allows a substantial reduction in generation interval. Thus  selection for such traits will not be an obstacle for the reduction in generation interval that is required to make GS of interest for traits with a limited number of phenotypic records. Second  for traits that can be recorded early in life on all candidates for selection  such as growth rate in broilers  GS can be combined with phenotypic information to estimate breeding values early in life []. Hence  in such cases  GS for the trait with a limited number of phenotypic records will allow a reduction in generation interval and this also increases response in traits that can be recorded on all candidates early in life. Thus  when considering multi-trait selection  GS is equally or more beneficial than suggested by results in Figures a and b. In this work  the accuracy of genomic EBV was based on the expression presented in [] (Equation 1a)  rather than based on stochastic simulation. This expression is independent of allele frequencies  in contrast to the expression derived by Goddard []. However  Hayes et al. [] found these two expressions to result in very similar accuracies but the method in [] yielded slightly lower accuracies at low to moderate heritabilities. For traits with a limited number of phenotypes  heritabilities will be mostly in this low to moderate range []. Hence  this suggests that the accuracies used here are slightly conservative. With an equivalent intensity of selection  the reduction in response to selection due to the Bulmer-effect is the same for GS and for selection on traditional BLUP-EBV  irrespective of the accuracy of EBV used for selection. Hence  when schemes have the same selection intensity in both sexes  accounting for the Bulmer-effect is not essential to obtain the correct ranking of GS versus traditional BLUP schemes. However  when selection intensities differ between schemes  the Bulmer effect can affect the ranking and a comparison based on accuracies in an unselected population can be misleading []. Schemes in which selection is based directly on phenotypic information  such as mass selection  have a lower reduction in response due to the Bulmer effect than GS or traditional BLUP schemes. To maximize the accuracy of genomic EBV when the number of phenotypic records is limiting  the same individuals should be genotyped and phenotyped  rather than genotyping parents and phenotyping their progeny. When the generation interval cannot be decreased with GS  large reference populations are required to obtain a similar response to that with own performance selection or progeny testing. However  the accuracy of genomic EBV has a diminishing-return relationship with the size of the reference population. As a consequence  when GS schemes have a moderate decrease in generation interval  relatively small reference population sizes are needed to obtain a response equal to that with selection on traditional BLUP-EBV based on own performance or progeny information. Thus  when the trait of interest cannot be recorded on the selection candidate  GS schemes are very attractive  even when the number of phenotypic records is limited  because traditional breeding schemes would have to rely on information from relatives with many phenotypic records and long generation intervals in the case of progeny testing.

Genomic information offers great potential to increase rates of genetic gain but it is expensive to generate. Low-cost genotyping strategies combined with genotype imputation offer dramatically reduced costs. However  both the costs and accuracy of imputation of these strategies are highly sensitive to several factors. The objective of this paper was to explore the cost and imputation accuracy of several alternative genotyping strategies in pedigreed populations.MethodsPedigree and genotype data from a commercial pig population were used. Several alternative genotyping strategies were explored. The strategies differed in the density of genotypes used for the ancestors and the individuals to be imputed.

Genomic information offers great potential to increase rates of genetic gain but it is expensive to generate. Low-cost genotyping strategies combined with genotype imputation offer dramatically reduced costs. However  both the costs and accuracy of imputation of these strategies are highly sensitive to several factors. The objective of this paper was to explore the cost and imputation accuracy of several alternative genotyping strategies in pedigreed populations. Pedigree and genotype data from a commercial pig population were used. Several alternative genotyping strategies were explored. The strategies differed in the density of genotypes used for the ancestors and the individuals to be imputed. Parents  grandparents  and other relatives that were not descendants  were genotyped at high-density  low-density  or extremely low-density  and associated costs and imputation accuracies were evaluated. Imputation accuracy and cost were influenced by the alternative genotyping strategies. Given the mating ratios and the numbers of offspring produced by males and females  an optimized low-cost genotyping strategy for a commercial pig population could involve genotyping male parents at high-density  female parents at low-density (e.g. 3000 SNP)  and selection candidates at very low-density (384 SNP). Among the selection candidates  95.5<U+2009>% and 93.5<U+2009>% of the genotype variation contained in the high-density SNP panels were recovered using a genotyping strategy that costs respectively  $24.74 and $20.58 per candidate. Successful breeding programs based on genomic information rely on large numbers of animals that are both phenotyped and genotyped at high-density [  ]. Imputation of high-density genotypes for large numbers of phenotyped animals has been shown to be effective in generating large datasets at lower cost (e.g. [–]). Genotyping strategies for imputation generally involve genotyping some individuals in a pedigree at high-density  others at low-density  and in some cases not genotyping other individuals at all. Imputation of genotypes involves two steps. First  the haplotypes carried by the high-density genotyped individuals must be resolved. Then low-density genotypes are used in conjunction with pedigree  familial linkage  and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to determine the combinations of haplotypes that are carried by animals that are not genotyped or that are genotyped at low-density. Several imputation algorithms have been developed (e.g. []; []; []; []; []) that vary in accuracy and speed.  is sufficiently accurate to permit the use of extremely low-density (e.g. 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across the genome) genotype panels for imputation. The accuracy of imputation is influenced by several factors  including the number of markers on the low-density genotyping panel  the number of individuals that are genotyped at high-density  the local LD between each low-density genotype and its surrounding high-density genotypes and the number of high-density genotyped relatives of the individuals to be imputed [–]. In pedigreed populations  the two major determinants of imputation accuracy are the high-density genotyping status of immediate ancestors and the density of the panel used to genotype the individuals whose genotypes need to be reconstructed []. Several alternatives exist to address both these factors. A conservative strategy is to genotype the eight great-grandparents  the four grandparents and the two parents at high-density. This will probably ensure that the phase of the parents is resolved for almost all markers  therefore reducing the task of imputation to the choice of the gamete passed to the offspring and the modelling of recombination events. Furthermore  increasing the density of the low-density genotyping panel reduces the length of the regions for which recombination has to be modelled  resulting in higher imputation accuracy. However  such a conservative strategy can be very costly  especially because in most commercial breeding programs  individual female parents make a relatively small genetic contribution to the next generation. Alternative genotyping strategies can be far less expensive. For example  only male ancestors could be genotyped at high-density and female ancestors at low- or intermediate- density or not be genotyped at all. However  these cheaper alternatives may lead to a sizeable reduction in imputation accuracy. The objective of this research was to compare the effectiveness of imputation accuracy and the potential cost of alternative genotyping strategies for a commercial breeding program. Specifically  we investigated the imputation accuracy stemming from different sets of ancestors genotyped at high- and low-density  and the interaction between these genotyping strategies and the marker density on imputation candidates. Finally  based on accuracy of imputation of several schemes  the costs of the more relevant of these alternatives were estimated. To evaluate the accuracy of imputation for various genotyping strategies  data on a set of 98 testing individuals were extracted from a commercial pig-breeding program. These individuals did not have any descendants (i.e. they represented young selection candidates). For each testing individual  both parents and all four grandparents were genotyped at high-density using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 Beadchip. In addition  data on another 2436 genotyped individuals were available. The relationship of individuals from this group (if any) with the testing individuals occurred only through their parents. Genotyped individuals were from a single PIC (a Genus plc. company) nucleus pig line born since 2000  and thus all individuals were moderately to highly related. In this line  individuals were selected for genotyping to target a specific trait in genomic evaluation or were added to fill-in missing herd sires to calculate genomic breeding values. The original selection avoided sampling multiple members of full-sib families. In total  2779 animals  genotyped at high-density using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 Beadchip  were available. A pedigree of 6473 individuals  consisting of two generations of pedigree for each genotyped animal  was extracted. Genotypes on a total of 5396 SNP from chromosome 1 with known genome locations were used for analysis after routine editing of the genotype data  which included filtering for extreme minor allele frequency (MAF < 0.001)  extreme deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Pearson's Chi-squared test statistic > 300)  and proportion of missing genotypes by SNP (> 10<U+2009>%). Three  low-density panels were constructed  with densities equivalent to 6065 ()  3022 ()  and 384 () SNP across the entire genome. To select SNP for these panels  600  299  and 37 non-overlapping sliding windows of roughly the same size were generated on chromosome 1 for L6k  L3k and L384  respectively. In each sliding window  the SNP with the highest MAF was selected to enter the low-density panel. Summary statistics and assumed costs for each of the low-density panels are given in Table<U+2009>. Although only chromosome 1 was analyzed  the results are expected to hold for all chromosomes as in routine genotype imputation work carried out in commercial pig (Matthew Cleveland  unpublished results) and poultry (Andreas Kranis  unpublished results) populations. These studies have employed genotyping strategies and genotype imputation algorithms similar to those used here and very little variation in genotype imputation accuracy has been observed between chromosomes. The genotyped pigs were split into four groups  consisting of the 98 testing individuals  their parents  their grandparents  and the remaining high-density genotyped individuals. As a result of the general population structure  in the parental group  nine sires were also grandsires and nine dams were also granddams. When only one group of animals was used  the overlapping individuals were removed from imputation. The numbers of individuals in each group are given in Table<U+2009>. To explore the importance of the high- and low-density genotyping status of immediate ancestors of the testing individuals  twelve genotyping strategies were investigated (Table<U+2009>). These included genotyping all ancestors of the testing individuals at high-density  genotyping the male ancestors at high-density and the female ancestors at low-density  and only genotyping the remaining individuals at high-density. Other intermediate strategies that involved genotyping some ancestors (e.g. female ancestors at low-density) were also investigated. These twelve scenarios were each tested for all low-density panels created. In order to investigate the influence of having high-density genotypes on individuals who are neither parents nor grandparents of the testing individuals  three of the twelve scenarios were further expanded (Table<U+2009>). These additional scenarios were created by removing (a) none  (b) a random 50<U+2009>%  or (c) a random 75<U+2009>% of the high-density genotyped individuals in the group that were not parents or grandparents of the testing individuals. Considering a general livestock population structure where male parents produce a disproportionately large number of progeny compared to females  a number of scenarios emerged from the initial explorations that appeared more suitable for application in the commercial animal-breeding sector. The most suitable scenarios included genotyping selection candidates at very low-density  genotyping male parents at high-density and re-genotyping female parents at high- or medium-density (e.g. from L384 to L6k panels) once they have become parents. Therefore  in this part of the analysis  the use of different low-density panels for female ancestors was explored (Table<U+2009>). The costs of the alternative genotyping strategies were calculated assuming prices of $120  $48  $35  and $20  for the high-density  L6k  L3k and L384 panels  respectively. Costs were calculated on the basis of an ongoing breeding program  so that for any given generation new genotyping was only relevant for selection candidates and sometimes their parents. For the parents  genotyping  if required  entailed obtaining higher density information compared to that obtained for the same individuals as selection candidates. As a result  the costs of genotyping other ancestors (e.g. grandparents) would be already covered and included when these individuals were themselves parents or candidates. Costs were calculated on a per individual candidate basis  assuming 100 000 selection candidates  from 480 sires and 11 884 dams. These figures do not necessarily reflect those of different commercial breeding programs. Thus  an EXCEL worksheet is provided in which the costs and ratios can be changed to reflect other situations that may exist in practice [see Additional file ]. Imputation was carried out using the software package  (version 1.0) []  which combines simple phasing rules  long-range phasing  haplotype libraries  segregation analysis  and recombination modelling  to impute genotypes for all loci on the highest-density panel of all animals in a pedigree. The genotypes imputed by  take the form of the sum of either fully imputed alleles or allele probabilities. Allele probabilities are used when alleles cannot be fully called as integers due to incomplete information (i.e. close to a recombination location or for some markers of individuals that are distantly related to individuals genotyped at high-density). Accuracy of imputation was measured as the squared correlation (R-squared) between true and imputed genotypes. The R-squared was chosen because it relates to the amount of variation that the imputed genotypes explain in the masked high-density genotypes. The average distances in megabases (Mb) between adjacent SNP that are informative for the imputation of paternal and maternal alleles and the percentage of the genome surrounded by informative SNP for each of the four SNP genotyping panels are presented in Table<U+2009>. As the density of the genotyping panel decreased  the proportion of the genome surrounded by informative SNP for the paternal and maternal alleles decreased. For the L384 panel  only 88.8<U+2009>% (83.4<U+2009>%) of the genome was surrounded by SNP that were informative for the paternal (maternal) gamete and differences between animals were large. The L6k and L3k panels showed a significantly larger proportion of the genome surrounded by informative SNP and lower sampling variance between individuals. Accuracy of imputation for the different scenarios is reported in Tables<U+2009>    and . In all the scenarios  the accuracy was moderate to high and  as expected  it was affected by both the high-density genotyping status of the immediate ancestors and by the density of the panel used to genotype both the testing individuals and their immediate ancestors. Across the twelve basic scenarios (Table<U+2009>)  the R-squared ranged from 0.996 for s1 (the scenario in which all parents  grandparents  and the remaining individuals were genotyped at high-density and the testing individuals were genotyped with the low-density L6k panel) to 0.719 for s9 (the scenario in which only sires were genotyped and the testing individuals were genotyped with the very low-density L384 panel). All twelve scenarios showed relatively small differences between the L6k and the L3k panels (e.g. 0.996 for L6k and 0.990 for L3k for scenario s1; 0.953 for L6k and 0.931 for L3k for scenario s12). However  the L384 panel was noticeably less accurate than the L3k or L6k panels (e.g. 0.990 for L3k and 0.967 for L384 for s1; 0.931 for L3k and 0.817 for L384 for s12). The overall accuracy decreased and the differences in accuracy among the panels increased as the amount of high-density genotyping in the ancestral relatives decreased. Once the parents of the testing individuals were genotyped at high-density  there was little benefit in having other ancestral relatives genotyped (i.e. scenario s7 was almost as accurate as scenario s1  except for the very low-density scenario). In scenario s6 (i.e. ancestral relatives but not the parents are genotyped at high-density)  low accuracies were again obtained when the L384 panel was used for the testing individuals. Genotyping the parents with the same low-density panel as the candidates (scenario s3) recovered some of this loss. In comparison to scenario s6 (i.e. no genotyping of parents)  which had accuracies of 0.984  0.974  and 0.910 for the L6k  L3k  and L384 panels respectively  scenario s3 (i.e. parents are genotyped at low-density) had accuracies of 0.989  0.984  and 0.941. Extending the low-density genotyping to the grandparents (scenario s11) resulted in a notable loss in accuracy compared to limiting the use of the low-density panel to the parents only (scenario s3). When compared to using high-density genotyping on both male and female ancestors (scenario s1)  genotyping the female ancestors at low-density (i.e. the dam and granddams) and genotyping the male ancestors at high-density (i.e. the sire and grandsires) (scenario s4) resulted in small losses in imputation accuracy  even when using the L384 panel on the testing individuals. When the grandparents and other ancestors were not genotyped  a considerable loss was observed when the dam was not genotyped at high-density  especially when the L384 panel was used on testing individuals  as shown by the comparison of scenarios s7  s8  and s9. The effect of having high-density genotypes on ancestral relatives that are not parents or grandparents on the accuracy of imputation is shown in Table<U+2009>. For scenarios s4 (i.e. sire and grandsires genotyped at high-density and dam and granddams at low-density) and s5 (i.e. sire and grandsires genotyped at high-density and dam and granddams not genotyped)  no effect was observed when all the other 2436 individuals in the dataset were used for imputation  as opposed to using a random subset of 50<U+2009>% or 25<U+2009>% of them. For scenario s12 (i.e. no genotyping of parents or grandparents)  decreasing the “other” group from 100<U+2009>% to 50<U+2009>% and 25<U+2009>% produced only a small effect when the low-density L6k and L3k panels were used to genotype the testing individuals but a large effect when the low-density L384 panel was employed. This initial analysis suggested that a practical genotyping strategy for a commercial breeding program could consider genotyping male parents at high-density and female parents at high- or low-density. Candidates to selection could themselves be genotyped with one of the low-density panels. The accuracy of imputation and the costs per individual of each of these scenarios are shown in Table<U+2009>. When the testing individuals were genotyped with the L6k panel  there was little difference in accuracy of imputation between genotyping dams and granddams with the high-density panel  the low-density L6k  L3k  L384 panels or not genotyping them at all (0.981 - 0.996). Small differences in accuracy were observed between strategies for genotyping dams and granddames when testing individuals were genotyped with the L3k panel  while larger differences were observed with the L384 panel. Not genotyping the dams and granddams and genotyping the testing individuals with panel L384 gave an accuracy of 0.888  while accuracies of 0.935  0.955 and 0.956 were obtained by adding L384  L3k and L6k genotypes for the dam and granddams  respectively. By comparison  an accuracy of 0.967 was achieved when the dams were genotyped at high-density. The costs of these scenarios ranged from $20.58 to $34.84 per individual and were substantially lower than the cost of genotyping every candidate at high-density ($120). Three factors influenced the genotyping costs of a scenario: the price of the low-density panel used to genotype candidates  the number of offspring produced by a female parent coupled with the cost of genotyping this female  and the number of offspring produced by the male parent coupled with the cost of genotyping the male parent at high-density. Of these factors  the cost associated with the male parent was the least important because of the large numbers of offspring produced by sires. In general  costs were sensitive to all of these parameters and an Excel spreadsheet is supplied in Additional file  [see Additional file ] that can be used to evaluate alternative prices of the different genotyping panels and alternate reproductive ratios of males and females. For the purposes of pedigree-based genotype imputation  several strategies involving genotyping male and female ancestors of candidates for selection at various high- or low-densities and the candidates themselves at various low-densities were evaluated. The results demonstrate that most of the information contained within the high-density genotyping panels can be recovered using low-cost genotyping strategies such as genotyping the candidates for selection at a very low-density (i.e. a 384 SNP panel)  the female parents at a very to moderately low-density (i.e. a 384 or 3000 SNP panel)  and genotyping male parents at a high-density. Furthermore  the costs of initiating such a genotyping strategy in a new line of animals would be low because genotyping large numbers of individuals at high-density does not appear to be required once the male and female parents (or the maternal-grandsires) of the generation for which the strategy is implemented are genotyped at high-density. Imputation of genotypes involves two steps: (1) determining the phase of high-density haplotypes and (2) determining which combination of these haplotypes are carried by an individual genotyped at low-density and modelling any recombination that occurs during the meiosis that created this individual. These two steps have different impacts on the accuracy and costs of imputation and the different genotyping strategies tested in this study illustrate this. To obtain accurate phasing of the high-density genotypes of key ancestors  it is necessary to genotype other individuals at high-density.  uses a phasing algorithm ([] – long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation) that does not require restrictive high-density genotyping strategies (e.g. multiple generations of ancestors genotyped at high-density). Previously  it has been shown that for  to give accurate phasing results  it requires at least 1000 high-density genotyped individuals []. However  the results of this study show that  within the  framework  highly accurate imputation can be obtained once the parents  or the sire and maternal-grandsire of the selection candidates are genotyped at high-density  without the need for a large pool of individuals genotyped at high-density. There are two reasons for this. First   incorporates a number of phasing error detection steps that were not included in . Second   implements some simple pedigree-based phasing rules that interact with the other phasing procedures to eliminate much of the phasing errors. The ability to accurately impute genotypes from such a small training population considerably reduces the costs of initialising a genomic selection program based on imputation in a new line that has not been previously genotyped at high-density. Determining the high-density haplotypes carried by an individual genotyped at low-density and modelling recombination were relatively accurate once the parents were genotyped at high-density. For more complex scenarios (i.e. female ancestors not genotyped at high-density)  having some level of genotyping on the female ancestors increased the accuracy of the imputation as shown in Table<U+2009>. Several recombination events occur during meiosis and accurate imputation requires identification and modelling of these events. When using low-density SNP panels (e.g. 384 SNP) for imputation  there are relatively few informative SNP (Table<U+2009>) and therefore large regions surrounding a recombination event may not have information for the purposes of imputation. With multiple generations of low-density genotyping on one or both sides of the pedigree  the overall proportion of the genome that includes a recombination event between a pair of informative SNP increases. This severely restricts imputation accuracy of genotyping strategies that make use of very low-density SNP panels (e.g. 384 SNP) to genotype parents or grand-parents of selection candidates. Commercial breeding programs aim at maximising the rate of genetic gain within cost constraints. Genomic information offers great potential for increased rates of gain but the cost of realizing that potential can be high  especially if large numbers of selection candidates need to be genotyped or parents have relatively few offspring and the cost of genotyping them is therefore spread across relatively few individuals  as is the case in pig and poultry breeding programs. The costs of alternative genotyping strategies presented here are specific to the assumptions made in relation to the costs of the different genotyping panels and the numbers of offspring produced by male and female parents. Small changes in these factors can have big impacts on the relative costs of different strategies and this can be explored using the excel spreadsheet provided in Additional file  [see Additional file ]. Ninety-five percent of the genotype variation among the selection candidates contained in the high-density SNP panels could be recovered at a cost of $24.74 per candidate when using a genotyping strategy that involved genotyping male parents at high-density  female parents at low-density (e.g. 3000 SNP)  and selection candidates at very low-density (384 SNP)  and the mating and offspring per parent ratios described in the additional file (480 sires; 11884 dams and 10000 offspring). However  results will depend on species-specific characteristics. For example  in a hypothetical sheep breeding program scenario in which five males and 250 females are used to produce 300 candidates for selection  the same strategy would cost $51.17 per candidate. While the results of this study show that most of the information content of full high-density genotyping can be recovered using low-cost genotyping strategies  the effect that this will have on the accuracy and bias of the resulting estimated breeding values is unknown and deserves further study since decisions on investment cannot be made based on costs alone. Furthermore  imputation errors may affect the different components of the estimated breeding values differently. Imputation error or loss of information due to incomplete imputation could impact the accuracy of the estimated Mendelian sampling term only and not the parental average component or it might in turn influence only the accuracy of the dam’s contribution to the estimated breeding value. Under these circumstances  the advantage of genomic over pedigree information for delivering higher rates of gain at reduced levels of inbreeding will be decreased. Furthermore  if imputation accuracy is unevenly distributed across the genome  parts of the genome could potentially be less accurately selected upon and therefore be subject to greater random genetic drift over time. The proportion of the genome that was covered by low-density SNP that were informative for imputation decreased when going from high- to low-density scenarios. This decrease was moderate for L6k and L3k panels  but approximately 13<U+2009>% of the genome was not covered in the L384 scenarios. This results in approximately 6<U+2009>% of the genome at each end of a chromosome not being informative for imputation  regardless of the imputation method employed. Thus  when designing extremely low-density marker panels (e.g. L384) allocating more markers at the ends of the chromosomes could be advantageous. It could be that the high imputation accuracies observed in this study are partially explained by the high level of relationships among individuals of the population analysed  particularly for scenarios where immediate parents were not genotyped at high-density. In this case  imputation requires that the haplotypes of the individuals to be imputed are (at least partially) represented in the haplotype libraries. However  high relationships between individuals in the population are likely not needed for accurate imputation when the parents or grandparents are genotyped at high-density  since good performance of the phasing algorithm does not depend on high levels of relatedness between the high-density individuals  as shown by Hickey et al. (2011)  and the imputation does not depend on information from other individuals once the parents or grandparents are genotyped at high-density. Commercial breeding programs seek to maximise genetic gain while minimising the costs of attaining that gain. Low-cost genotyping strategies involving genotype imputation offer dramatically reduced costs for the implementation of genomic selection. However  both costs and accuracy of imputation of these strategies are highly sensitive to several factors. Given the mating ratios and numbers of offspring produced by males and females  a low-cost genotyping strategy for a commercial pig population could involve genotyping male parents at high-density  female parents at low-density (e.g. 3000 SNP)  and selection candidates at very low-density (384 SNP). Among the selection candidates  95.5<U+2009>% and 93.5<U+2009>% of the genotype variation contained in the high-density SNP panels were recovered using a genotyping strategy that costs respectively $24.74 and $20.58 per candidate.

Using genomic models increased the accuracy of prediction compared to traditional BLUP methods. Our results show that  among the methods used to predict genome-enhanced breeding values  the single-step method was the most successful at increasing the reliability for most traits. The single-step method takes advantage of all the data available  including phenotypes from non-genotyped animals  and can easily be incorporated into current breeding evaluations. The inclusion of genomic information in models for prediction of genetic merit is expected to result in increased accuracies of prediction. In 2001  Meuwissen et al. [] described how breeding values can be predicted from marker data alone in order to obtain what are now commonly known as direct genomic values (DGV). These values are calculated as the sum of the effects of dense genetic markers across the genome  capturing all quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to variation in the trait. Implementation of DGV in genetic evaluations and selection indices is commonly referred to as genomic selection. Today  genomic selection programs are routinely implemented in the United States  Canada  New Zealand  France  Netherlands  Denmark  Norway and Sweden. Wiggans et al. [] reported an increase in reliabilities of US genomic predictions using an Illumina 50<U+2009>k panel [] as compared to predictions of genetic merit based on traditional parental averages. Milkability belongs to the group of traits termed functional traits  which also include health  feed efficiency  fertility  and calving ease. Milkability is defined as the ease of milking of dairy cows and is usually measured as milking speed  either recorded objectively or through subjective measures [  ]. Milking speed or flows measured using electronic measuring devices are not collected on a frequent basis and can be considered novel traits. Other indicators of milkability include flow measures such as Average Milk Flow (AVGF) and Maximum Milk Flow (MMF) []. Milkability measures  either as milking flow or speed  have long been recognized as relevant criteria in animal selection [  ]  due to their impact on management costs of milking cows []. An increase in MMF or AVGF  or a reduction in total milking time (TMT)  results in a reduction of milking labor requirements and in an increase in the efficiency of automatic milking systems []. Considering that labor accounts for a large fraction of the total costs of milk production  it is not a surprise that Prins et al. [] estimated economic values for milking time to range from 1.63 to 25.97€ /minute/cow/year  depending on the size of the milking parlor. Milking speed and milking time significantly influence the farmer’s economic bottom line and can be improved through selection [  ]. Indeed  in the past 50<U+2009>years  milk flow has been actively selected for in some dairy populations []. However  due to the cost and labor associated with collecting milk flow data  it has been difficult to make substantial progress compared to other traits. To our knowledge  the use of molecular information to select for milkability based on milk flow and milking time data has not been investigated. Thus  the main objective of our study was to evaluate the potential of genomic selection (GS) for this relatively novel trait in a medium-sized population  i.e. milk flow collected in Italian Brown Swiss cattle. First  breeding values for milkability traits were predicted using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker genotypes; second  the reliability of these breeding values was evaluated for sires with a relatively small number of daughters with phenotypic information; third  the reliabilities of alternative methods to predict breeding values were compared to EBV obtained from traditional BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) methods and finally  differences between methods were evaluated based on the reliabilities of predictions obtained. Data for this study were provided by the Italian Brown Swiss Breeders Association and included information spanning 13<U+2009>years between 1997 and 2009. The dataset included 37 213 cows  daughters of 2361 sires and 30 231 dams with pedigree information spanning seven generations. Milk flow was measured once for each cow using a portable milk flow recorder (LactoCorder  WMB AG  Balgach  Switzerland). Milk flow characteristics were detected every 0.7<U+2009>s and saved at intervals of 2.8<U+2009>s. To describe the overall pattern of milk removal  milk flow was divided into six phases(Figure<U+2009>): 1) ascending time (AT)  period of time from when milk flow reaches a value greater than 0.5<U+2009>kg/min until it plateaus; 2) time of plateau (TP)  period of time with a steady milk flow; 3) descending time (DT)  period of time for the milk flow at the end of TP to reach a value below 0.2<U+2009>kg/min; 4) over-milking time (OT)  period of time necessary for the milking machine to be detached from the udder  once the milk flow is below 0.2<U+2009>kg/min; 5) stripping time  period at end of milking  with milk flow greater than 0.2<U+2009>kg/min and lasting for at least 4.2<U+2009>s; and 6) over-milking time after stripping  period after stripping during which the milk flow decreases to below 0.2<U+2009>kg/min and the milking machine is removed. In addition  maximum milk flow (MMF) was recorded as the maximum flow preceding TP. Thus the six traits investigated in this study were: TMT  AT  TP  DT  MMF and average milk flow (AVGF). A complete description of data collection and data editing for these traits is reported in Gray et al. [].  TMT: Total Milking Time; AT: Ascending Time; TP: Time of Plateau; DT: Descending Time; MMF: Maximum Milk Flow; AVGF: Average Milk Flow. A total of 1351 bulls that were genotyped in the Italian Brown Swiss population had direct relationship ties with cows that had milk flow data. Bulls with daughters in the dataset had an average of 28<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.6 daughters with milk flow data available for analysis. Bulls were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine SNP50BeadChip []. After quality checking  34 052 SNP spanning 29 bovine autosomes remained for the analysis. Markers with a call rate<U+2009><<U+2009>0.90  markers with a minor allele frequency (MAF)<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05  and markers violating Hardy Weinberg equilibrium test (Chi-square<U+2009>><U+2009>300 with 1 d.f.) were discarded from the analysis. The average number of SNP per chromosome was 1175. Genomic predictions were first computed using a multi-step approach []. First  a traditional evaluation of milking traits was performed. Using a six-trait animal model similar to the model described in Gray et al. []  traditional breeding values and parent averages for the genotyped bulls were predicted for TMT  AT  TP  DT  MMF and AVGF applying the BLUP methodology with ASREML []. Genotyped animals were then split into a training and a validation dataset depending on the reliability of their BLUP EBV. Genotyped sires with a reliability higher than 0.50 for TP and 0.60 for the remaining traits were included in the training dataset  which amounted to separate older sires from young sires with less progeny  i.e. older sires were assigned to the training dataset and the remaining younger animals to the validation dataset. Pseudo-phenotypes (dEBV) were obtained as deregressed EBV free of the effects of parent average and adjusted for the number of daughters contributing to the EBV for the data vector used in genomic predictions []. In the second step  the dEBV were then analyzed for prediction of genomic EBV including a genomic relationship matrix in place of the traditional numerator relationship matrix in the mixed model equations []  which will be referred to as GBLUP. The genomic relationship matrix  was constructed using the formula   where  is the frequency of marker   estimated from all genotyped sires  and  is the matrix of marker codes (0/1/2) adjusted by setting the mean for each SNP across genotypes to 0 by subtracting  defined as a matrix with allele frequencies expressed as a difference from 0.5 and multiplied by 2  such that column  of  is []. With GBLUP  predicted breeding values were obtained for animals in the validation dataset through . Using ASREML software []  records from the training population entered the mixed model equations as the  vector  solving for the predicted breeding values. Two different non-linear prediction approaches  Bayes-A  and Bayesian LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)  were used to estimate a genetic variance component for each marker  accounting for a non-normal prior distribution. A comparison of these two methods is in Cleveland et al. []. The general structure of the models in matrix form was: : vector of de-regressed breeding values for TMT  AT  TP  DT  MMF and AVGF; : overall mean; : vector of additive effects for each marker; : matrix of genotypes coded as number of copies of an arbitrary allele (0  1  and 2) for each SNP; : vector of residuals assumed normal with variance weighted as outlined by Garrick et al. [] with a  constant for the genetic variance unaccounted for by the markers set at 0.4 after an exploratory analysis (data not shown). A flat (1) prior was assigned to   while the prior distribution for  was assumed inverted chi-square with 4 degrees of freedom and an expectation equal to the value used in the traditional BLUP evaluation with individual cow records. The remaining prior structure was: for the i SNP  for the BayesA approach and for the LASSO approach. In the current analysis  a straightforward generalization of the BayesA method was applied  in which scale parameter  and degrees of freedom  were treated as unknown and were estimated from the data []. They were assigned a uniform prior in the interval (0 1] for  and a uniform prior for  for the range of (0 Q]  with Q being 100. At each round of the Gibbs sampler that was implemented  samples of  where obtained from  Since the  parameter does not have a closed form  parameter samples were obtained at each round of the sampler with a Metropolis step The pseudo-code and a summary of posterior results for scale and degrees of freedom for this step are provided as additional data [see Additional file ]. The <U+03BB> parameter in the LASSO approach was assigned a gamma prior distribution  0.05 1.0  so the prior of <U+03BB> was essentially uniform over a wide range of values []. A Gibbs sampling algorithm was implemented in R to obtain samples from the joint posterior distribution []. Marker effect estimates were obtained using the above models within the training population and were then applied to the validation dataset to predict genomic breeding values. Assuming a completely additive model  marker effects were summed across the entire genome for each animal to obtain the DGV. Genome-enhanced breeding values (GEBV) were obtained by combining DGV and parental averages  as outlined by Saatchi et al. []. As an alternative to the two-step approach  Misztal et al. [] proposed a unified single-step approach  which automatically combines genomic and phenotypic information into a single set of equations. This approach is basically a modification of current animal model genetic evaluation methodology  in which the inverse of the relationship matrix  is modified. The resulting matrix  referred to as   is obtained by simply adding the difference between the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix and the inverse of the pedigree-based relationship matrix for genotyped animals to the corresponding block in the inverse of pedigree-based relationship among all animals []: where  is the inverse of the pedigree-based relationship matrix of genotyped animals. Using ASREML software []  EBV were obtained by substituting the inverse numerator relationship matrix ( with a user defined matrix () in a 6-trait multivariate model. In this study   was used to compute  and breeding values predicted from this method will be referred to as . Scaling factors have been used to control potential bias in the [  ]. In our analysis  scaling factors equal to 0.5  0.7 and 0.9 were employed  as suggested by Forni et al. []. Scaling did not result in any overall change and only the results from using a scaling factor equal to 0.9 will be presented. Reliabilities (r) for dEBV predicted from BLUP  were computed as  where <U+2009>=<U+2009>standard error of the prediction  <U+2009>=<U+2009>inbreeding coefficient for animal  and  = genetic variance []. Reliabilities for the genomic predictions were measured from accuracies calculated according to Saatchi et al. [] as: where  is the genetic variance as obtained with the complete data   is the covariance between GEBV and deregressed EBV and  is the GEBV variance. Pearson correlations were estimated between dEBV from validation individuals with GEBV obtained from the other models to measure the relationship between EBV obtained from different models. Differences in model performance for the dEBV calculated with GBLUP  Bayesian LASSO  BayesA and HBLUP were evaluated by regressing dEBV of validation individuals on GEBV obtained from the other models. Estimates of heritability and genetic correlations from the six-trait pedigree-based animal model are reported in Table<U+2009>. Estimates were low for the milking time traits  except for TP and milk flow traits  which had moderate heritabilities. Estimated heritabilities were in agreement with other studies [  ]. All comparisons were based on reliabilities of EBV and parental averages estimated from the validation set. Parental averages in the data employed here include information corresponding to genotyped bulls. In order to eliminate it from the cumulative information on the parents  adjusted parent averages (aPA) were obtained following what proposed by Garrick et al. []. Breeding values predicted from marker data had a better predictive ability than estimates of aPA from pedigree-based relationships. The average increase of GEBV reliabilities ranged from 0.11 to 0.18 over aPA when using GBLUP and from 0.12 to 0.2 when using BayesA and Bayesian LASSO (Table<U+2009>). Among the six traits analyzed  the increase in reliability was largest for MMF and AVGF when GEBV were calculated with GBLUP. MMF and AVGF also had the largest heritabilities compared to AT  TP  DT and TMT. BayesA and Bayesian LASSO methods produced near identical mean reliabilities for all milk flow traits  i.e. with Bayesian LASSO: 0.44 for AT  0.49 for TP  0.35 for DT  0.48 for MMF  0.49 for AVGF and 0.48 for TMT  while with BayesA they decreased slightly by 0.01 for AT and AVGF and by 0.02 for TP (Table<U+2009>). With the single-step approach  reliabilities were either identical or increased slightly compared to the other prediction methods for all traits. Increases in reliability ranged from 0.14 to 0.24 over aPA reliabilities and from 0.01 to 0.07 over reliabilities from non-linear methods (Table<U+2009>). It should be noted that all two-step approaches were univariate models  while the one-step approach was a multi-trait model. Most implementations of two-step genomic selection methods are currently based on single-trait analyses but multivariate approaches are emerging. In this work  we did not consider a multivariate approach for the two-step methods although it would be interesting to include this option. Therefore  increases in reliability are probably partly due to the modeling of covariances among traits in the analysis. Furthermore  the slight increase in reliability observed here could also be attributed to the fact that measured phenotypes of cows were used instead of pseudo-phenotypes derived from breeding values of the sires. When pseudo-phenotypes are derived from animals with small progeny numbers and are implemented in evaluations involving the two-step method  EBV tend to be less accurate. Simple linear models were used to regress dEBV on genomic breeding values obtained from GBLUP  HBLUP  Bayesian LASSO and BayesA models (Table<U+2009>). Correlations of breeding values obtained from PBLUP and GBLUP predictions ranged across traits from 0.70 to 0.86  from 0.70 to 0.86 between PBLUP and both Bayesian LASSO and BayesA and from 0.87 to 0.93 between PBLUP and HBLUP (Table<U+2009>). It is likely that an increase in the number of progeny per sire within the validation set would reduce the difference between PBLUP and the two-step methods. It should be noted that in this study  the size of the training dataset was limited compared to studies performed on Holstein cattle. However  even with the limited size of the Italian Brown Swiss population  the breeding values obtained with the HBLUP method showed stronger correlations than other models indicating that its features are very robust and that it can be applied in the case of small populations. Breeding values for milk flow traits estimated from genomic markers show an increase in reliability in most cases compared to traditional pedigree-based evaluations. Most of the increase in reliability can be attributed to the improved estimation of Mendelian sampling. The choice of priors in the analysis of non-linear methods evaluated here  did not significantly affect reliabilities. In most cases 2-step non-linear models slightly outperformed GBLUP. Some advantages associated with using two-step non-linear procedures include flexibility in the incorporation of genomic information by maintaining a separation from traditional breeding value estimation. Although traditional breeding value estimation has been used in numerous populations and diverse situations  it was not the best method in our study. Two-step methods can be useful to continue work in genome-wide association studies and are easily scalable as the number of animals and markers increases. However  these methods tend to be slow due to the necessity to sample often more than 100<U+2009>k rounds in an MCMC procedure. They are also heavily dependent on parameters specified by assumptions given by the user that could be incorrect and are not easy to implement in more complicated models  which could include maternal effects or random regression. Our results suggest that  among all the methods evaluated  the single-step method was the most successful at increasing the reliability for all traits. This method takes advantage of all the data available and is easily incorporated into current breeding evaluations. Although milk flow is a fairly novel trait and the measurements used in this study were obtained on a relatively small population compared to other dairy breeds  selection based on single-step methods is expected to provide the best response with the greatest flexibility.

Estimated genetic parameters for calving traits of UK Holstein cattle are consistent with literature. Calculating an aggregate estimated breeding value including direct and maternal values should encourage breeders to consider both direct and maternal effects in selection decisions. Calving is a key event on a dairy cattle farm and successful calvings are important to financial success of the farm. Calving complications lead to an increase in veterinary and labour costs and a decrease in revenue (loss of animals and/or reduced subsequent performance) [–]. Furthermore  difficult calvings compromise animal welfare and thereby consumer acceptability of dairy production systems []. In recent years  dairy cattle breeders have shown an increasing interest in selection for functional traits [] and gradually the focus of selection is shifting from traits that increase profit towards traits that reduce costs []. For example  easy parturition and calf viability are economically important traits but are not classical production traits. Since genetic selection could improve calving performance  it is important to include calving traits in genetic evaluations  although their implementation is not straightforward. Calving ease (CE) and stillbirth (SB) are phenotypes that are generally scored on categorical or binary scales which make them sensitive to subjectivity  especially CE []. Furthermore  heritabilities of these traits are generally low [] and thus much data is needed to obtain sufficiently accurate estimates that have an impact on selection indices. But above all  calving trait phenotypes are affected by two separate components  the calf’s contribution (direct effect; e.g. arising from size  hormonal balance  weight) and the dam’s contribution (maternal effect; e.g. arising from pelvic measurements  ability to respond to parturition signalling)  and this complicates statistical analysis [–]. In quantitative genetics  the objective is to separate additive genetic variances and co-variances from other sources of variance. The statistical model fitted for calving traits should therefore allow the separation and estimation of both direct and maternal effects but there is no consensus on which is the most accurate model to achieve this objective. Various statistical models have been reported throughout the years  each aimed at improving one aspect of their predictive ability. Consequently  many different statistical models are used in routine genetic evaluations to estimate genetic parameters for calving traits []  while for production traits there is a greater consensus across countries []. For CE  statistical models range from sire-maternal grandsire (S-MGS) models to animal models in univariate or multi-trait form that either allow a direct-maternal genetic covariance or fix this covariance to zero []. Overall  statistical models can account for direct and maternal effects in two ways i.e. animal models that fit calf and dam effects directly and S-MGS models that fit direct and maternal effects through the sire of the calf and dam  respectively []. Each of these then has a family of implementation depending on how traits are defined and modelled e.g. univariately or multi-trait  which leads to the divergence in models seen today. The genetic covariance between direct and maternal effects plays a key role in the interpretation of estimated genetic parameters and the prediction of response to selection. For example  in the case of CE  this parameter represents the genetic relationship between the animals’ genetic predisposition for ease of being born and ease of giving birth. This genetic covariance is however suggested to be sensitive to estimation bias [–]. Thus  estimates of direct-maternal genetic correlations reported for calving traits  which are often negative and of moderate to high magnitude  are questioned []. Theories on the source of bias in estimates of direct-maternal genetic correlations range from ignored environmental covariances [    ] to unaccounted contemporary groups [    ]. Estimation of the direct-maternal covariance and remaining genetic components is said to be further improved by using a multi-trait model instead of a univariate model [  ]. Since CE and SB are highly correlated and show low heritabilities  it has been suggested that a multi-trait model that incorporates a highly heritable and correlated indicator trait such as birth weight  calf size and/or gestation length (GL)  would lead to a more optimal analysis [–]. In addition to models incorporating indicator traits  it has also been proposed that the extension of univariate models to a multi-trait model between parities would be useful because of the potential genetic distinctiveness of calving traits in first and later parities. This implies that models fitting first and later parities as correlated traits are theoretically more correct than models that fit parity as a non-genetic effect [–]. However  given the high standard errors of the estimated maternal variances and direct-maternal covariances  it appears that statistical models used to analyse calving traits can still benefit from optimization. Previous studies on the estimation of genetic parameters for calving traits have been comparing models. However  in most cases  studies limit themselves to single comparisons  such as univariate versus multi trait models within either a sire or animal model framework [  ]. The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters of calving traits for United Kingdom (UK) Holstein-Friesian cattle with a range of present-day statistical models for national genetic evaluations of calving traits. A comparison was made between S-MGS versus animal models and univariate versus multi-trait models between traits and parities. GL was added to the multi-trait model to study any benefits of this indicator trait to the predictive ability of the model. Specific attention was given to the potential bias of the sensitive genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects and  lastly  a ‘total heritable variance’ for calving traits was estimated  combining direct and maternal variance components. This parameter was recently reported for the analysis of traits affected by indirect genetic effects [] and is suggested to represent the total amount of total genetic variance available for response to selection. Its practical use for calving traits is discussed. Data on calving in Holstein Friesian cattle was provided by two milk recording organisations (MRO) in the UK i.e. the Cattle Information Service (CIS) and National Milk Records (NMR). GL was calculated from insemination and calving dates and restricted to 265–295<U+2009>days. Only records on single born calves were used. Datasets from first and later parity records contained 43 135 and 330 753 records respectively  spanning the years 1995 to 2009. This data was checked for inconsistencies in parity  breed  calving date and age at calving. Incorrect records were discarded  as were contemporary groups with fewer than two records (herd  herd-year  sire and maternal grandsire). Age at calving was restricted to 18–48<U+2009>months for heifers and 30–70<U+2009>months for cows. To avoid herds where farmers unrealistically recorded the same CE score for most or all contemporary groups of calvings  the standard deviation of CE score within herd-year was calculated. Herd-year classes with standard deviations of zero were deleted when this was considered statistically improbable (97.5% confidence interval) given the herd size and CE score distribution. Sex of stillborn calves was not recorded by one of the data sources. As sex has been shown to have a considerable effect on SB [] data from this specific data source was deleted for the univariate and bivariate between-parity analyses on SB. For all univariate analyses on CE and GL  the data from this source for a stillborn calf was set as missing but the remaining data obtained by the specific data source was used. The final dataset consisted of 30 640 first parity records originating from 2 098 herds representing 2 012 (service) sires and 4 783 maternal grandsires (MGS). The accompanying pedigree consisted of<U+2009>~<U+2009>200 000 individuals and was 5 generations deep. Since the later parity dataset created computational problems when fitting the animal model  it was reduced by only retaining records that were of 2 and 3 parity and had values for each of the three traits (prior to edits on SB data described earlier). Furthermore  the thresholds for the minimum size of herd-year and sire contemporary groups were increased to 7 and 5 records  respectively. Finally  the final later parity dataset consisted of 54 744 records  originating from 2 108 herds  1 918 sires and 5 886 maternal grandsires  with an accompanying pedigree of<U+2009>~<U+2009>290 000 individuals and 4 generations deep. CE was scored on a categorical scale  which ascends in calving difficulty and differs between data sources. Scores were therefore harmonised and transformed into values on the underlying normal distribution (average liability value) within data source and parity prior to analysis. Detailed information on the recording system and transformation of CE scores is reported in Eaglen et al. []. SB was recorded as a binary trait with a 0 value if alive and 1 if stillborn. Frequency distributions per data source within edited datasets  GL means  SB frequencies and other descriptive statistics of the data are given in Table . In this study  models will follow Willham’s model [] where the phenotype observed on an individual calf  for CE  SB and GL is modelled by Thus  during the life of   the direct additive effect (A) is expressed at the start of life while  if  is a female  the maternal additive effect of  (A) is expressed whenever she calves. E and E are the direct environmental effect  property of calf   and maternal environmental effect  property of dam   respectively. In all cases  optional fixed effects and potential interaction effects were tested for significance in SAS V9.1 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) [] and then the variance components were calculated using REML  with ASREML version 3.0 []. Sex by parity and sex by age interaction effects were not significant. Prior to using multi-trait models involving GL  the relationship of GL with CE and SB was examined according to Hansen et al. [] to ensure that the use of traditional bivariate models was appropriate given their assumption of linearity. Furthermore  the limitations of analysing categorical traits  such as CE and SB  with linear models are well known. Multiple model assumptions are violated due to the fact that values of categorical data are bounded within certain limits e.g. 0 to 1 or 1 to 4. Therefore  generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) such as threshold models can be more appropriate for the analysis of categorical traits since scores are transformed by the model into values on an underlying continuous liability scale. This study aimed to evaluate statistical models with the ultimate goal of implementation in national genetic evaluations of CE  SB and GL. Although threshold models are implemented in routine national genetic evaluations in France and the USA [  ]  in the UK and most other countries  calving traits are evaluated with a linear model. Therefore  we chose to evaluate several modelling possibilities within linear rather than threshold models. In the discussion section of this paper  we will elaborate further on this choice. To study the difference between animal and S-MGS models  first parity data were analysed by linear univariate models. Direct and maternal genetic effects were incorporated by fitting genetic effects for calf and dam for the animal model and sire and maternal grandsire for the S-MGS model: In Equation<U+2009>2   is a vector representing the observations for CE  SB or GL;    and  are known incidence matrices for non-genetic  and direct and maternal genetic and herd-year effects  respectively;  is a vector of non-genetic effects   is a vector of the random direct additive-genetic effects of the calf (sire)   is a vector of the random maternal additive- genetic effects of the dam (maternal grandsire)   is a vector of random herd-year effects and  is a vector of residuals. Vectors  and  were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution  with MVN(0  <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009> where   was a 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 direct-maternal (S-MGS) variance-covariance matrix <U+2009>is the Kronecker product of matrices  and  was the relationship matrix.  was assumed to be MVN(0   s)  where  denotes the identity matrix and s the residual variance. Non-genetic effects in the models included sex of the calf  herd  sire breed (only for GL)  year and month of calving  the interaction of year and month of calving; age of the dam (months) treated as a covariate and the interaction of herd and year of calving treated as a random factor. S-MGS models yield sire and maternal grandsire (co)variances (  ) which were subsequently transformed algebraically into direct and maternal (co)variances (  ) according to Bivariate animal models were fitted pairwise among CE  SB and GL  separately for first and later parity data: In this model  vectors and incidence matrices correspond to those in the univariate animal model (Equation<U+2009>2) and subscripts 1 and 2 denote traits. Non-genetic effects for later parities were the same as for univariate first-parity models  with the addition of a interaction between age of dam and parity treated as a fixed factor  and a random permanent environmental effect (). The covariance matrix of the genetic terms equalled  <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009> where  was a 4<U+2009>×<U+2009>4 symmetrical direct-maternal variance-covariance matrix Residuals    and permanent environmental effects    were assumed to be MVN(0  )  and MVN(0  )  where  and  denote the residual and permanent environmental 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 variance covariance matrices and and  were the residual variance and permanent environmental variance. To study the genetic correlation between calving traits in first and later parities  bivariate S-MGS models were fitted with first and later parities (2 and 3 parities combined) treated as correlated traits. The model equalled equation<U+2009>4  with  a vector representing the observations for each trait in first (y) and later parities (y). Random genetic effects were fitted for the sire and maternal grandsire. The fixed and random non-genetic effects were the same as in the univariate animal model. Estimates of sire and maternal grandsire variances were transformed into direct and maternal effects according to equation<U+2009>3. Direct and maternal heritabilities ( and ) were estimated by: and where  and  are the direct and maternal additive genetic variances   is the additive direct maternal covariance and  is the environmental variance. To allow easy comparison with other studies  herd-year variances and permanent environmental variances were not included in the phenotypic variance but are provided in Additional file : Tables S1 and S2. The heritabilities and genetic direct-maternal correlations were estimated more than once by the several bivariate models and these were pooled in meta- analyses according to Corbin et al. [] A negative direct-maternal relationship would be worrying for the dairy cattle industry since it suggests that selecting a sire that is genetically superior for ease of birth may later cause a problem when its daughters calve. Koch [] showed that  when ignored or assumed to be zero  a direct-maternal environmental covariance (cov(E E)) can cause bias in the estimated genetic parameters. Although it is possible to fit a correlation structure in the residual to avoid this problem  computational complexity is then substantially increased. Therefore  in this study  we chose to avoid this potential bias by removing from the data all individuals that appeared as both calf and dam. Residuals of these specific records would otherwise be correlated []. Then to evaluate the bias  animals were reintroduced and the analyses were repeated. Throughout the paper  animal model 1 (A1) represents the animal model which was used to analyse the reduced data  whereas animal model 2 (A2) represents the animal model used to analyse the total data. Additive genetic variances are estimated to evaluate the genetic differences between animals that can be used to generate a response to a chosen selection strategy. Equation<U+2009>8 demonstrates that in the case of maternally affected traits  there are two additive genetic variances that can respond to selection. Analogous to the additive direct genetic variance  the additive maternal genetic variance is equivalent to the variance of maternal breeding values of individuals in the population  under random mating. The presence of two genetic variances responding to selection raises the question of a ‘total’ additive variance. According to Bijma et al. []  the total breeding value of an individual for a maternally affected trait can be expressed as the sum of its direct breeding value () and its maternal breeding value ()  which is referred to as the  from which the total heritable variance follows as: In this context  the  represents the total genetic variance available for response to selection  with response predicted by <U+2009>=<U+2009> where  is the selection intensity and  is the accuracy of selection []. This is distinct from the total heritable variance reported by Willham []  Meyer [] and Koch []  which refers to mass selection  as explained in Eaglen et al. []. Given the current selection strategies based on PTA in dairy cattle  we estimated and explored  as described by Bijma et al. []. Table  presents the descriptive statistics of the data. It shows that in the UK  approximately 20% of the calvings required assistance of some sort. Incidence of calving assistance was higher in first than in later-parity calvings  which agrees with the general consensus that calving complications are of more concern in heifers than in cows []. Moreover  severe calving difficulty was experienced by approximately 4% and 2% of heifers and cows respectively. These are in line with international prevalences of calving difficulty in the Holstein breed [] although comparison is not straightforward since the scoring system of CE allows for a large variety of score definitions []. The incidence of SB in first and later parities (Table ) agrees with incidences reported by Hansen et al. [] and Jamrozik et al. []. Table  also shows that there were fewer males than females in the first-parity dataset  which could indicate a bias in data recording due to the difference in value between a bull and a heifer calf in dairy cattle. Since the calving of bull calves is known to be more difficult []  it is possible that CE is under-reported. However  all studies using field records for CE data in dairy cattle will likely suffer from the same problem. The frequencies of female and male calves were more equal in later parities. Given the amount of results obtained in this study  it was decided to separate the biological findings (genetic parameters)  in Table      and   from the findings on the model comparisons. To aid in the comparison of different models  accuracies of predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) for 25 randomly selected young and older sires were calculated by their prediction error variances (PEV); PEV<U+2009>=<U+2009>(1-r) (Table ). The PEV are provided in Additional file : Table S3. Throughout the study  the default model fitted was A1. When results of other models are discussed  this is indicated. Table  and  show the estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations among traits obtained from bivariate animal models in first and later parities and Table  presents parameter estimates obtained by between-parity models for each trait respectively. Therefore  results for later parities in Table  account for selection based on first parity  whereas results in Table  do not. All heritabilities estimated for CE  SB and GL were within the range of previously published estimates of these traits in dairy cattle [    ]. Heritabilities of CE were low (direct: 12% first parity and 3% later parities; maternal: 5% first parity and 2% later parities) and the direct heritability was approximately twice as large as the maternal heritability. GL appeared moderately heritable  with the direct heritability (57% first parity and 41% later parities) being considerably larger than the maternal heritability (7% first parity and 7% later parities). This supports the view that the genetic variation of this trait lies primarily in the triggering of parturition by the foetus [    ] rather than in the maternal response to this trigger. All heritabilities were larger in first parity than in later parities  as reported elsewhere in the literature [  ]. This supports the general assumption that the variation in calving performance is larger in heifers than in cows [  ]. In addition  heritability estimates are frequency dependent when applying linear models to categorical traits. Both direct and maternal heritabilities for SB were low  irrespectively of parity  with the direct heritability ranging from 1.8% to 2.0% (not significant in first parity) and the maternal heritability ranging from 2.0% to 3.2%. These estimates agree with values from the literature  which range from 1.6% to 10% for direct heritability and from 2.0% to 13% for maternal heritability [  –    ]. The estimated genetic direct-maternal correlations for CE and GL presented in Table  and  were low to moderate (-0.52 to -0.22). For GL  the direct-maternal correlations were not significantly different from zero. For CE  a significant genetic relationship between the direct and maternal effects in first parity (-0.53) was detected. This negative direct-maternal correlation suggests that animals with a lower genetic risk of being born with difficulties are genetically prone to have more difficulty at first calving. Numerous studies confirm a negative genetic relationship between the direct and maternal effect of CE [–]  although positive correlations also appear in the literature []. The negative genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects of CE implies that dairy farmers need to base selection decisions on both the direct and the maternal PTA of a sire for CE in first parity  to avoid long-term negative consequences. An optimum index value for genetic merit in CE is therefore preferable  as discussed later. Due to very low heritabilities and very high standard errors  the estimated direct-maternal genetic correlation of SB  obtained by the different models  were not informative. Studies estimating this covariance in large datasets (> 400 000) report correlations close to zero [    ]  although with considerable standard errors. To date  there is no clear evidence to recommend a change from the common practice of assuming this covariance as equal to zero. Table  shows the estimated genetic correlations between the direct and maternal effects of CE  SB and GL in first parity heifers obtained from bivariate analyses. Table  shows the estimates of the same models for later parity cows (parity 2 and 3). In general  CE and SB were strongly genetically correlated  whereas the relationships of GL with CE and SB were weak to moderate. Both the direct and maternal correlations between CE and SB were positive and high in first parity (0.84; 0.85)  and positive and moderate in later parities (0.37; 0.67). This suggests that both difficult birth and difficult calving are genetically associated with a higher frequency of direct and maternal stillbirth respectively  regardless of parity. The findings for the UK dataset thereby support the consensus of a strong genetic relationship between CE and SB [  –]. In this study  correlations of CE and SB were not significantly different from 1. However  Hansen et al. [] and Cervantes et al. [] provide evidence of genetic distinctiveness for these traits  with estimates of similar magnitude to those from this study  but with smaller standard errors. Furthermore  a simple meta-analysis [] pooling estimates from this study and four other studies [      ] results in a direct and maternal genetic correlations of between CE and SB of 0.79<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02 and 0.65<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03  respectively  which suggests a genetic distinctiveness of these traits. The genetic correlations between GL and the calving traits differed between parities (Table  and ). A moderate positive genetic correlation (0.65) was found between maternal GL and maternal SB in first parity. This suggests that an individual with a longer than average gestation period is genetically more likely to give birth to a stillborn calf in first parity and . Genetic correlations between GL and SB in later parities were not significant (Table ). A direct genetic relationship between GL and CE was detected  but only in later parities. No maternal relationship was detected in later parities. The direct effect of GL was found to be moderately correlated to the direct effect of CE. This positive correlation (0.50) between direct CE and direct GL suggests that a calf that gestates longer before birth to a multiparous dam is genetically prone to a difficult birth and . Similar positive correlations between direct GL and direct CE are reported in beef cattle []  Danish Holstein cattle [] and UK Holstein cattle []  and support the findings from the UK dataset here. However  in this study  the genetic correlation between maternal GL and maternal CE was non-significant  although this relationship is generally reported to be low to moderate [  ]. All relationships between direct effects of one trait and maternal effects of the other trait (and ) were non-significant  except for the genetic correlation between direct SB and maternal CE in first parity  which was high and positive. This specific relationship is difficult to estimate at the animal level and the high estimate may be due to the inaccuracy of the SB variance components. In general  studies in the literature report non-significant genetic correlations between the genetic direct effects and the genetic maternal effects between traits [      ]. Table  presents the genetic parameters estimated by the bivariate S-MGS models that treat first and later parity records as correlated traits. Estimated genetic correlations between first and later parities were 0.80<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.12 for direct CE and 0.84<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.15 for maternal CE. These estimates are similar to those estimates obtained by the threshold model reported by Wiggans et al.  [] but slightly higher than those reported in general [    ]. Among the studies estimating genetic correlations of CE between parities  there is general agreement that both direct and maternal CE are genetically distinct traits in first and later parities  which suggests that both ease of birth and ease of calving represent a different trait in heifers and in cows [    ]. However  the standard errors reported here are too large to infer genetic distinction between first and later parities from this study alone. Direct and maternal GL are rarely considered separately in studies that estimate between-parity correlations. Table  shows that different between-parity genetic correlations are found for direct GL and maternal GL. This emphasizes the fact that direct and maternal GL are separate traits  and thus must be analysed and interpreted with this in mind. For direct GL  the estimated correlation between first and later parities was near unity (0.96<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02) but the same correlation for maternal GL was lower (0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.13). However  in this case too  the standard error is too large to conclude that maternal GL is a distinct trait in first and later parities. Other studies on larger datasets show a correlation that is high but nevertheless significantly different from 1 [  ] which implies that maternally  the gestation length of a heifer and a cow are genetically distinct traits. When fitting a between-parity S-MGS model for SB  results were difficult to obtain. Other analyses  using univariate and bivariate models  already showed the difficulty of obtaining an accurate estimate of the direct-maternal genetic correlation for SB within parities. With the between-parity model  the likelihood surface was practically flat which hampered convergence to sensible estimates. The total heritable variance gives a holistic measure of the genetic variance affecting calving and accounts for both the maternal and direct sources of variance. Although some estimates in this study were inaccurate (in particular the direct-maternal genetic covariance for SB)  the estimates of  presented in Table  show how the maternal variance and direct-maternal genetic covariance contribute to the total genetic variance. Focusing on animal model A2  the total variance was smaller than the direct variance for CE and GL by 26% and 3%  respectively  although these differences were not significant. For SB  the very large and positive direct-maternal genetic covariance  in combination with the small direct variance  caused  to be by<U+2009>~<U+2009>400% larger than the additive direct variance. When a farmer makes a selection decision based on a maternally affected trait  population mean performances change in response to both its direct and maternal breeding value. The TBV as described by Bijma et al. [] is suggested to represent the total additive value of an individual. However  it does not represent the impact of that individual on the population mean since this impact will depend on the time period and the frequency of expression of the direct and maternal effects in the population within that period. Gene flow methodology [  ] shows that contributions of the direct and maternal effects to genetic change in calving traits depend on several factors which determine how often the maternal effect is expressed  e.g. how many calvings  how many calves are kept as replacement heifers and the breeding system (pure breeding or crossbreeding). Therefore  while theoretically TBV and  show the importance of considering maternal effects and their interrelationship with direct effects  practically  an index value that is not the simple sum and represents the total impact of an individual would be useful to farmers. This would be in addition to the separate direct and maternal EBV that are already provided. In this section  animal models are compared to S-MGS models  and univariate models to bivariate models. Furthermore  the benefit in treating first and later-parity calvings as correlated traits in a bivariate between-parity model is discussed. A potential bias due to an environmental direct-maternal covariance is also evaluated. All models that are discussed are linear models. Several studies have explored the advantages of threshold models over linear models for the analysis of calving traits [  ] given that according to the categorical nature of the traits  threshold models should theoretically be superior  as explained by Gianola []. Findings show that computational requirements are greater for threshold compared to linear models and Monte Carlo methods needed to obtain the most reliable parameter estimates. However  software that can estimate variances without relying on Monte Carlo simulation methods  e.g. through the use of approximations to maximum likelihood in complex GLMM is available but limited []. For calving traits  comparisons between linear and threshold models have shown very high correlations between PTA  meaning that the ranking of sires is not greatly influenced by the use of a linear model [    ]. Threshold models have been shown to take specific interactions into account which can potentially be problematic for linear models [  ]. Table  contains the results of the univariate analyses on first parity data and compares animal model A1 with the S-MGS model  since neither of these two models are expected to show bias due to the ignored environmental direct-maternal covariances discussed in the Methods  unlike animal model A2. Table  shows that  between traits  direct heritabilities and phenotypic variances when estimated by A1 and S-MGS models were very similar but the residual variances were consistently larger for S-MGS models compared to both A1 and A2 models. The residual variance of an S-MGS model contains the default environmental variance plus a Mendelian sampling term and the remaining unexplained additive variance terms from dams totalling . Accuracies of PTA for young and older sires are presented in Table . Comparison of the S-MGS model with A1 and A2 models shows that there was only a small loss in accuracy when fitting the S-MGS model. In some cases  mainly for older sires for which more progeny information is available  there was an increase in accuracy of PTA when the S-MGS model was fitted as opposed to the animal model. This is probably due to the slightly higher heritabilities that were estimated by the S-MGS model (see Table ). The computation time required with univariate animal models was 10 times greater than with univariate S-MGS models. Furthermore  when increasing the model complexity  animal models failed to converge  whereas S-MGS models were robust. The between-parity model in this study was an example where animal models failed  whereas S-MGS models performed well. Advantages in computation time and versatility of the S-MGS model therefore compensate well for the slight loss in accuracy of any resulting estimates. Table  shows the estimated genetic direct-maternal correlations within traits for first parity data  when applying two univariate animal models. As described earlier  part of the data corresponding to specific dam-offspring pairs was deleted from the dataset (7.8%) to remove for a potential environmental direct-maternal covariance. In Table   animal model A1 represents the analysis of the edited data  whereas A2 represents the analysis of the complete data. Comparison of the results for A1 and A2 models shows that deleting records on dam-offspring pairs had only a small and non-significant impact on direct-maternal genetic correlations. The observed change implies that the environmental direct-maternal covariance was negative and small in this dataset. Since estimates of the direct-maternal genetic correlation do not differ significantly  the magnitude of the environmental covariance in this dataset is likely to be negligible and changes observed could be due to chance alone. One of the important points when using GL as an indicator trait for the analyses of calving traits is its potential non-linear relationship with CE and SB. The relationship of GL with both SB and CE was clearly non-linear on a phenotypic scale (Figure   first parity). However  a visual assessment of plotted EBV obtained from univariate first parity animal models showed that relationships were not better approximated by a quadratic relationship (quadratic regression coefficients P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) than by a linear relationship. Figure  and  show this for 150 sires with<U+2009>><U+2009>25 progeny. Thus  it was concluded that quadratic relationships between GL  CE and SB were not detected and that  for this study and under the assumption that relationships of higher polynomial degree would be unlikely  the use of GL as indicator trait in linear bivariate models was justified.                                                                                                                                                                            Table  demonstrates that  for calving traits  bivariate models are slightly superior to univariate traits. In particular  the maternal variance of low heritable traits (CE and SB) benefitted from including a correlated trait in the model. Accuracies of direct PTA also showed a slight improvement from bivariate analysis  in particular for the low heritable SB trait. Estimates obtained for SB heritabilities with the univariate and bivariate models (Table  and ) demonstrate that these models provided nearly identical estimated direct variances  although the maternal variance showed a small but significant higher estimate with bivariate analyses. Strong genetic correlations were found between CE and SB  SB and GL  and CE and GL  which are likely to explain the increase in accuracy of PTA obtained by the bivariate model compared to the univariate model. The maternal variance of the indicator trait  GL  also benefitted from the bivariate model compared to the univariate model  although the accuracy of the maternal PTA of GL was slightly decreased with the bivariate model. Genetic direct-maternal correlations for CE and GL showed little change between univariate and bivariate models  while the estimate of this correlation for SB showed considerably more change but is too imprecise to be interpreted. Calving traits in first and later parities were highly correlated  which results in a considerably greater predictive ability of PTA for all traits when later parity information is added as a correlated trait to the model (Table ). Accuracies increased  for both direct and maternal PTA of CE and GL  when compared to the univariate model. Heritabilities for CE  SB and GL in UK Holstein cattle were in the range of previously reported genetic parameters for these traits. Both the direct and maternal genetic variances were considerably lower in cows than in heifers. Direct and maternal effects of CE were negatively correlated but this was established only in first parity. CE and SB were genetically highly correlated traits for both direct and maternal components  especially in first parity. GL showed a moderate relationship with CE and SB  which differed between parities but implies that genetically longer gestations are associated with reduced calving performance. The three traits all had high and positive genetic correlations between parities but parities were not demonstrated as being genetically distinct for any trait with the data available. Different between-parity genetic correlations estimated for direct GL and maternal GL emphasize that these are separate traits and thus should be treated as such. Estimates of  indicate that the total additive genetic variance in a calving trait may be lower than the additive direct variance when the genetic direct-maternal covariance is highly negative and the additive maternal variance is small. Results from this study further demonstrated that estimating genetic parameters for calving traits is complex. Developing a statistical model for a maternally affected trait requires a careful balance between sufficient predictive ability and computational practicality  which in turn are affected by the size of the dataset  potential biases in data recording  the trait in question  computational facilities and the amount of time in hand. However  in general  PTA estimates for calving traits benefitted from multi-trait models. Furthermore  estimates were only slightly less accurate when a S-MGS model was fitted instead of an animal model. With the current computing facilities  S-MGS models exceeded animal models in terms of practicality  as their robustness allowed the analysis of more data and the inclusion of more traits e.g. information from later parities. In the genetic evaluation of calving traits genetic correlations between traits and between parities need to be estimated and the direct-maternal genetic correlation must be considered with caution.

Genetic parameters for IBK infection and its genetic and phenotypic correlations with cattle tick counts  number of helminth (unspecified species) eggs per gram of faeces and growth traits in Australian tropically adapted  cattle were estimated.MethodsAnimals were clinically examined for the presence of IBK infection before and after weaning when the calves were 3 to 6<U+2009>months and 15 to 18<U+2009>months old  respectively and were also recorded for tick counts  helminth eggs counts as an indicator of intestinal parasites and live weights at several ages including 18<U+2009>months.ResultsNegative genetic correlations were estimated between IBK incidence and weight traits for animals in pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets. Genetic correlations among weight measurements were positive  with moderate to high values. Genetic correlations of IBK incidence with tick counts were positive for the pre-weaning and negative for the post-weaning datasets but negative with helminth eggs counts for the pre-weaning dataset and slightly positive for the post-weaning dataset. Genetic correlations between tick and helminth eggs counts were moderate and positive for both datasets. Phenotypic correlations of IBK incidence with helminth eggs per gram of faeces were moderate and positive for both datasets  but were close to zero for both datasets with tick counts.ConclusionsOur results suggest that genetic selection against IBK incidence in tropical cattle is feasible and that calves genetically prone to acquire IBK infection could also be genetically prone to have a slower growth. The positive genetic correlations among weight traits and between tick and helminth eggs counts suggest that they are controlled by common genes (with pleiotropic effects).

Genetic parameters for IBK infection and its genetic and phenotypic correlations with cattle tick counts  number of helminth (unspecified species) eggs per gram of faeces and growth traits in Australian tropically adapted  cattle were estimated. Animals were clinically examined for the presence of IBK infection before and after weaning when the calves were 3 to 6<U+2009>months and 15 to 18<U+2009>months old  respectively and were also recorded for tick counts  helminth eggs counts as an indicator of intestinal parasites and live weights at several ages including 18<U+2009>months. Negative genetic correlations were estimated between IBK incidence and weight traits for animals in pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets. Genetic correlations among weight measurements were positive  with moderate to high values. Genetic correlations of IBK incidence with tick counts were positive for the pre-weaning and negative for the post-weaning datasets but negative with helminth eggs counts for the pre-weaning dataset and slightly positive for the post-weaning dataset. Genetic correlations between tick and helminth eggs counts were moderate and positive for both datasets. Phenotypic correlations of IBK incidence with helminth eggs per gram of faeces were moderate and positive for both datasets  but were close to zero for both datasets with tick counts. Our results suggest that genetic selection against IBK incidence in tropical cattle is feasible and that calves genetically prone to acquire IBK infection could also be genetically prone to have a slower growth. The positive genetic correlations among weight traits and between tick and helminth eggs counts suggest that they are controlled by common genes (with pleiotropic effects). Genetic correlations between IBK incidence and tick and helminth egg counts were moderate and opposite between pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets  suggesting that the environmental and (or) maternal effects differ between these two growth phases. This preliminary study provides estimated genetic parameters for IBK incidence  which could be used to design selection and breeding programs for tropical adaptation in beef cattle. Cattle reared in tropical northern Australia are exposed to varying levels of environmental challenges  including high ambient temperature and high incidence of infection by a variety of pathogens and ecto- and endo-parasites. Over the past 40<U+2009>years  a number of crossbreeding experiments have been conducted to examine genetic and environmental aspects of cattle performance under the influence of such tropical environmental stressors. Since the 1950’s  one of the most important animal breeding experiments in Australia has been the development of a cross between Hereford and Shorthorn cattle (hereafter named the HS line)  which is commercialised under the name ‘Adaptaur’; bulls from the HS line were released to the beef industry to provide genetic material. The HS line remains a ‘closed’ line of pure British  breeds with unique characteristics []. Although its level of genetic diversity is relatively low []  it has been successfully selected for both production traits (i.e. high post-weaning growth) and for increased resistance to cattle ticks  while enduring various environmental stressors such as ecto-parasites and endo-parasites  heat  humidity and seasonal variation in pasture quality []. A combination of natural and artificial selection has resulted in a breed with a relatively high level of acquired immunity to cattle tick infestations []. In Australia  there have been several studies on HS composites [  ] and other tropical beef cattle [  ] that have investigated genetic and phenotypic parameters for growth  reproduction  external and internal parasite tolerance. However  there is a lack of information on the genetic and phenotypic parameters for infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) in tropical cattle composites. IBK  commonly known as ‘pinkeye’  is an inflammatory bacterial infection that affects the eyes of cattle. It is characterised by inflammation of the conjunctiva  ulceration of the cornea  excessive tearing  and in severe cases  perforation of the cornea which can lead to permanent blindness (Figure ). In the 1980’s  an Australian postal survey recorded that 81% of cattle owners reported the occurrence of IBK in their herds and 75% observed a reduction in weight gain of the affected cattle []. Although this survey is outdated  IBK remains a serious problem for livestock industries  with an estimated annual incidence of 10% that costs over $AU 23 million in cattle production losses and management []. In the United States  more than 10 million calves are affected by IBK annually  with an estimated economic loss of more than $US 150 million []. Hence  cattle producers are keen to reduce the incidence of IBK by selective breeding. Although improving herd management  treatment or vaccination may provide a short-term solution  genetic selection is an alternative long-term solution to control IBK incidence in cattle.

Analysis of health records of 45 497 animals from purebred and crossbred  and tropically adapted breeds  i.e. mainly from Brahman  Boran and Tuli cattle populations  estimated heritability for IBK incidence ranging from 0.00 to 0.28 []. A significant between-breed difference in IBK incidence has been reported [  ]  with the purebred Hereford breed being the most susceptible compared to other pure and composite breeds. Thus  sufficient genetic variation for resistance to IBK exists in these breeds to consider genetic selection. To date  genetic parameters for resistance to IBK in Australian tropical composite breeds have not been reported. Thus  the main objectives of our study were to estimate genetic parameters and breeding values for resistance to IBK of a HS composite population at different stages of cattle growth. Results will enable northern Australian cattle producers to select animals with high genetic merit for resistance to IBK. However  before selection decisions are made  it is important to quantify possible genetic antagonisms between IBK and growth traits. For example  in dairy cattle  the increased genetic merit for milk yield is associated with a decline in average fertility and health (i.e. mastitis  claw and foot disorders) [–]. Therefore  another objective of our study was to estimate the genetic and phenotypic correlations between IBK and growth and parasite infestation traits by including these in a multi-trait genetic parameter estimation program. These multi-trait settings make use of economic weights more optimal in a total genetic merit index. Genetic and phenotypic parameters for IBK  weight measurements at different ages  helminth egg count and cattle tick count were estimated in an HS composite cattle population. A detailed history of the tropically adapted Australian HS composite cattle population has been reported elsewhere []. Briefly  the herd was developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) during the 1950s at the National Cattle Breeding Station  ‘Belmont’  latitude 23.22 °S longitude 150.38 °E  near Rockhampton  Queensland  Australia  and was a nominal composition of 50% Hereford and 50% Shorthorn. Animals were born from October to December each year and weaned around March or April of the following year from 1973 to 1998. These animals were reared under similar stressful environmental conditions  which included high ambient temperatures and humidity  high IBK incidence and gastro-intestinal and external parasites []. Data on both the incidence and severity of IBK infection were collected from 1973 to 1997. Calves were observed for clinical signs of IBK at two stages of development  first  when they were 3 to 6<U+2009>months old (‘pre-weaning’ time point) and second  when they were15 to 18<U+2009>months old (‘post-weaning’ time point). The pre-weaning and post-weaning assessments involved 932 calves (403 males and 529 females) and 1 084 adult animals (514 males and 570 females)  respectively. The pedigree of these animals was traced back to four generations and contained 3 360 animals sired by 168 sires (average of 20 progeny per sire) from 990 dams. Animals were restrained in a head-bail located under an open-sided shelter and clinical examinations were performed by trained staff. Each eye of every animal was scored on a 1 to 6 scale  with 1 = cornea showing no clinical signs of ulceration or opacity (this score was used as a base line or reference); 2 = healing central corneal scar less than 3<U+2009>mm in diameter  opaque but without active vessels; 3 = healing central cornea from 3 to 6<U+2009>mm in diameter  opaque but without active vessels; 4 = healing central cornea scar greater than 6<U+2009>mm diameter  opaque but without active vessels; 5 = dense corneal opacity  central opaque area less than 5<U+2009>mm diameter with complete vascular ring; and 6 = complete dense corneal opacity  eye often with complete blindness. IBK score of the left and right eye were summed for each animal  ranging from a score of 2 for healthy eyes and scores 3 to12 for increasingly diseased eyes. Sizes of the lesions were qualitative estimates. The system of scoring was an attempt to classify the infection according to its severity and whether the lesion was active (and hence of direct effect at the time of scoring) or an inactive scar from a previous infection. No attempt was made to isolate the causal organism. Cattle tick () counts (TKC) were performed once every 21<U+2009>days during the tick season  generally late autumn to early winter and/or spring to early summer for the years 1979 and 1983 through 1997. TKC counts were repeated three times per animal and consisted of counting the number of engorging female ticks 4.5 to 8.0<U+2009>mm long on one side of every animal following field infestation []. Mean of these three TKC counts was used for the assessment of tick resistance. A count was considered usable if the mean count for that month was equal or greater than 20 ticks per animal side to allow for sufficient variation. The TKC counts were recorded on 875 animals (430 males and 445 females) from weaning (approximately 6<U+2009>months) to 18<U+2009>months of age. The animals originated from 57 sires with progeny group sizes ranging from 1 to 64  with an average of 14 animals per sire. The number of helminth (unspecified species) eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces were counted on a fresh faecal sample using a McMaster slide under a microscope at 100 × magnification []. The EPG counts were assessed as the mean of the first three EPG counts recorded on each animal after weaning (approx. 6 to 9<U+2009>months of age) during the period between 1987 and 1998. Those EPG counts were taken three weeks apart during parasite season (from June to July). A total of 727 animals (363 males and 364 females) with EPG counts were available. These animals were offspring of 53 sires (average 14 progeny per sire  ranging from 1 to 70). Four live weight measurements were taken at several ages from birth to 18<U+2009>months for the period between 1978 and 1998. At birth  calves were individually identified and weighed (birth weight = BWT  kg). Weights for weaning (WWT  kg)  yearling (YWT  kg) and final weight (FWT  kg) were recorded when animals were approximately 6  12 and 18<U+2009>months of age  respectively. A total 1 298 animals (636 males and 662 females) with weight measurements were available in this study. Animals were progeny of 77 sires (average 17 progeny per sire  ranging from 1 to 70). Data provided for the present study had previously been recorded as the sum of the left and right IBK scores for each animal  thus  we could not perform ordinal regression (multiple thresholds) analyses  which would otherwise have been the most appropriate analysis. Consequently we converted the summed scores to a binary (0/1) trait  setting score 2 equal to 0 (i.e.  IBK absent) and scores 3 to 12 equal to 1 (IBK present). Most health and reproduction traits are usually given as all-or-none (0/1)  and it is often assumed that 0/1 traits have an underlying continuous distribution []. There are several examples in the literature where ordinal multiple scores of lesions or disorders in animals have been converted to a simple binary form  e.g. for osteochondral bone disease in pigs [  ] and for hip dysplasia in dogs []. First  data (phenotypes and fixed effects terms) exploration was performed for each trait using numerical and graphical descriptive analyses (i.e.  outliers  distributions and relationships). This has revealed that TKC and EPG counts were not normally distributed. Thus  consistent with previous studies [  ]  counts were transformed using log (mean TKC + 1) for mean TKC counts and a cube-root transformation for mean EPG counts. Quantile-quantile plots indicated that these transformations produced residuals that approached normality (data not shown). All genetic parameter estimates for TKC and EPG counts presented here were based on the transformed scale. Then  significance of environmental fixed effects was assessed (using a statistical significance threshold of  < 0.05) by fitting linear regression models using the  function for TKC  EPG and weight traits  and the  function for IBK binary in the R software package []. The effects included in the models were age in number of days as a covariate  year when traits were recorded  and sex of the calf for IBK  TKC and EPG traits. For weight traits  the previous lactation status of the dam was included as an additional fixed effect (1 = maiden  2 = having lactated in the previous year  3 = dry non-pregnant cow in the previous year  and 4 = dry  cow calved in the previous year but the calf did not survive). A univariate animal model was fitted to the data using ASReml [] to estimate variance components  heritability and breeding values for each trait considered. The basic linear mixed model notation was: where  = vector of phenotypes (TKC  EPG or weight traits)   = vector of fixed effects included in the model  as described previously   = incidence matrix for fixed effects   = vector of random animal effects   = incidence matrix of random animal effects and  = random residual effects. The animal and residual terms were assumed to be  where  and  are variances of random animal genetic effect and random residual error effect  respectively.  is a numerator relationship matrix across all animals inferred from the pedigree (n = 3 360)  and  is an identity matrix with an order equal to the number of observations in . Binary IBK trait was analyzed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with the logit link function. The model in matrix notation was: where  = vector of probabilities of IBK present (= 1). The fixed and random effects were the same as used in the linear mixed models. Random effects in the model were assumed to be from multivariate normal distributions as described previously. Heritability on underlying scale was calculated as: where  is the estimate of the additive genetic variance and p/3 is the liability variance scale for the binomial distribution  where p/3 ~ 3.28987. In order to estimate genetic and phenotypic relationships among the traits considered  the individual datasets for TKC  EPG and weight were merged with both the IBK pre-weaning dataset and the IBK post-weaning dataset  resulting in a pre-weaning dataset with 535 animals and a post-weaning dataset with 650 animals. Although our intention was to fit a multi-trait model that analysed all traits simultaneously  this was not feasible due to computational limitations; therefore  in order to estimate genetic and phenotypic correlations  bivariate animal models were fitted for various combinations of traits. The bivariate animal model can be represented as follows: where  = vector of observations for the  trait ( = 1 or 2)   = vector of fixed effects for the  trait ( = 1 or 2)   = vector of random animal effects for the  trait ( = 1 or 2)   = vector of random residual effects for the  trait (i = 1 or 2)   = incidence matrices relating records of the  trait to fixed effects ( = 1 or 2)   = incidence matrices relating records of the  trait to random animal effects ( = 1 or 2). The expectations and variance were and where are additive genetic variances for traits 1 and 2   is the additive genetic covariance between traits 1 and 2  are residual variances for traits 1 and 2   is the residual covariance between traits 1 and 2   and  are as described previously   and  were assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and (co)variances as specified above. Using the (co-)variance component estimates  genetic correlations were calculated as and phenotypic correlations as Resistance of the tropically adapted HS line to tropical parasites is well documented []. In this work  we have investigated its resistance to IBK. Summary statistics for the traits considered are presented in Table . IBK status was scored on 932 calves before weaning (aged 3 to 6<U+2009>months) and on 1 084 calves after weaning (aged 6 to 18<U+2009>months). Mean IBK incidences were 0.34 and 0.21 for pre-weaning and post-weaning calves  respectively. The higher pre-weaning IBK incidence is consistent with the results of a previous study on purebred Herefords []. The average raw (untransformed) TKC and EPG counts were 53.3 and 566.1. Coefficients of variation for the traits measured ranged from 13.6 to 88.6%  with the raw (untransformed) data for TKC counts having the highest relative variability (see Table ). IBK incidence varied across years (see Figure a)  with a peak in 1991. Pre-weaning calves exhibited a higher IBK incidence than post-weaning calves in the years during which IBK occurrence increased i.e. 1973–1974  1983–1984  1991 and 1997. TKC and EPG counts varied across years (see Figures b-c  respectively)  with large median counts observed in 1979  1985 and 1990 for TKC counts  and in 1988  1993 and 1996 for EPG counts. Analyses of fixed effects showed that year when traits were recorded and age (in days) were statistically significant ( < 0.05) for all traits. For the weight traits  the fixed effects of sex and previous lactation status of the dams were also significant ( < 0.05).

Estimates of heritabilities and their standard errors estimates were obtained using univariate (or single trait) analyses and are presented in Table . Estimates of heritability for IBK were small to moderate for both pre-weaning and post-weaning calves (0.17 ± 0.06 to 0.19 ± 0.03  respectively). These estimates were consistent with a previous study that reported a moderate direct heritability of 0.20 ± 0.06 for IBK incidence in  ×  crossbred calves []. They examined a large dataset with health records over 20<U+2009>years for IBK incidence in calves of multiple breeds. Estimates of heritability ranged from 0.00 to 0.28  with the largest estimates for Hereford ( = 0.28)  composite ‘MARC III’ ( = 0.26) and Angus ( = 0.25) breeds. The heritability estimate for log transformed TKC counts was low to moderate ( = 0.20 ± 0.12). This estimate is comparable to those reported in several Australian studies on Brahman and tropical composite populations (0.13 ± 0.03 to 0.34 ± 0.03) [    ]. A study on South African Bonsmara cattle reported heritability estimates of 0.17 ± 0.05 for Box-Cox transformed mean tick counts []. However  the current heritability estimate of TKC is lower than that reported in Belmont Red cattle (0.42) in Australia []. Our estimate of the heritability of cube-root transformed EPG counts was moderate ( = 0.41 ± 0.09) and similar to that reported in Brahman heifers (0.40 ± 0.12) [] and in several Australian studies (0.33 – 0.44) [  ]. A study on Angus cattle under a natural challenge situation in New Zealand using a log (faecal count + 100) transformation reported a heritability of 0.32 []. In ruminants  immune response varies with the age of the host  the duration of parasite exposure  the number of parasites (dosage) and the nutrition status of the host [  ]. In our study  differences in heritability estimates for the parasite-resistance traits may be due to differences in these factors and/or different populations  season effects  and models used. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.35 ± 0.10 to 0.60 ± 0.09 for weight traits (Table ). Estimates were 0.60  0.47  0.38 and 0.35 for BWT  WWT  YWT and FWT  with standard errors ranging from 0.09 to 0.10. Our estimates were slightly higher than those reported in Australian Angus cattle [] but since maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects were not included  the estimates may be biased upward. Distributions of estimated breeding values (EBV) for IBK pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets are presented in Figure . The extremes of each distribution show a small number of animals with either high or low EBV. The EBV has a narrower range for pre-weaning calves (i.e. from -0.5 to 0.5) than for post-weaning calves (from -2.0 to 2.0).  () breeding values for pre-weaning animals; () breeding values for post-weaning animals. Genetic and phenotypic correlations and their standard errors for different combinations of traits are presented in Tables  and  for the pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets  respectively. Genetic correlations between IBK and different weight measurements were all negative and ranged from -0.10 to -0.50 (s.e.: 0.15 to 0.30) for both datasets  except the correlation between IBK and BWT  which was close to zero for the post-weaning dataset. The negative sign of these genetic correlations indicates that animals that are genetically prone to acquiring IBK infection are also genetically prone to slower growth/weight gain. For the pre-weaning dataset  the phenotypic correlation between IBK and FWT was -0.16 ± 0.04 but close to zero for all other weight traits (BWT  WWT and YWT) (Table ). For the post-weaning dataset estimates of phenotypic correlations were negative between IBK and weight measurements  ranging from -0.42 ± 0.04 to -0.53 ± 0.03  except between IBK and BWT (0.10 ± 0.05) (Table ). In general  calves with IBK appear to have a lower weight  which is consistent with previous studies []. Estimates of genetic correlations between IBK and TKC counts were 0.29 ± 0.27 and -0.14 ± 0.23 for the pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets (Table  and Table ). Genetic correlations between IBK and EPG counts were negative at -0.46 ± 0.26 for the pre-weaning dataset The direction of genetic correlations of IBK with TKC and EPG counts were opposite between the two datasets. This may be due to the fact that the calves’ pre-weaning environment is different from the post-weaning environment  including with regard to maternal effects. To our knowledge  genetic relationships between IBK and TKC or EPG counts have not been previously reported. Genetic correlations between TKC and EPG counts were positive in pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets (0.33 ± 0.23 and 0.31 ± 0.20  Tables  and ). Such positive correlations suggest that pleiotropic genes may be involved in resistance to ecto-parasites and endo-parasites in this cattle population and that cattle that have developed tolerance/resistance to ticks through natural or artificial selection can also acquire tolerance/resistance to parasite infestation. The phenotypic correlations between TKC  EPG and IBK were low for both datasets. Genetic correlations among weight traits were highly positive and significant for both datasets and ranged from 0.49 to 0.97 (Tables  and ). These estimates were in line with reports from []. The positive genetic correlations observed between birth weight and other weight traits is not advantageous since it could lead to calving difficulty (dystocia) and decrease calf survival and welfare of the cow. Tables  and  also present genetic parameters for environments with varying levels of environmental stress. For instance  HS calves born in north-east Queensland move from a benign uterine environment to a relatively protected maternal pre-weaning environment and then to a tropically stressful post-weaning environment. For a breed that has evolved in a temperate environment  this represents an extreme contrast in environmental stress. In the pre-weaning environment  the genetic correlations between IBK and the growth traits were consistently small and negative (Table )  whereas in the post-weaning environment  after removal of the maternal influence on the calves  the genetic correlations are more negative  except with BWT (uterine environment)  (Table ). Similarly  the genetic correlations between the parasite traits and the growth traits all show lower estimates for the pre-weaning dataset compared to the post-weaning dataset (Tables  and ). Estimates of the heritability of growth also differ depending on the level of environmental stress. The heritability estimates for BWT and WWT (uterine and maternal environment  respectively) are higher than  and in some cases almost double the estimates for YWT and FWT (see Table ). The finding that estimates of heritability are lower in more environmentally stressful environments has been documented previously [] and studies of Herefords from the semi-arid environment of Arizona  USA  [  ] have also found that genetic parameters vary when estimated in “good’ versus “poor” environments. In an optimal environment  identifying sires with the optimal growth “resource allocation factor” [] is straightforward but in a variable stressful environment  animal growth is more complex and must consider both inherent growth (inherent metabolic rate) and fitness (resistance to IBK and parasite infection); hence  a lower heritability for growth and modified genetic correlations in a stressful environment is expected. Although the traditional quantitative genetic approach used here has assisted us to understand the adaptation of cattle in tropical climates and their ability to deal with environmental stressors  the true value of this information is in identifying genetic architecture affecting adaptation/fitness. The ultimate goal of such studies would be to provide information about molecular markers that could be used in marker-assisted programs and lead to the implementation of selection programs for the simultaneous improvement of growth and tropical adaptation/fitness. Genetic parameter estimates for infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK)  also known as ‘pinkeye’  and its genetic and phenotypic correlations with growth and ecto-and endo-parasite traits were investigated. IBK infection is a heritable trait  although its heritability is low to moderate (0.17 ± 0.03 to 0.19 ± 0.06) for pre-weaning and post-weaning calves from Australian tropically adapted  cattle. Small to moderate negative genetic correlations between IBK and different weight measurements suggest that the animals that are genetically prone to acquire IBK infection may also be genetically prone to gain weight more slowly. The genetic correlations between IBK and TKC and between IBK and EPG counts display opposite values between pre-weaning and post-weaning datasets  suggesting differences in (maternal) environment between the two stages. However  more accurate estimates are needed; hence further data collection and pedigree recording on IBK  TKC and EPG is recommended. Nevertheless  our estimates of genetic parameters for IBK indicate that there is sufficient genetic variation in beef cattle to design selection and breeding programs for tropical adaptation of these breeds. Recording IBK cases on a routine basis and at a national level would allow inclusion of IBK resistance in the multi-trait breeding goal for the Australian beef industry  as well as in other countries  and would help address animal welfare and health issues.

A series of recent large-scale studies have revealed the true potential of ancient DNA samples to study the processes of evolution and to test models and assumptions commonly used to reconstruct patterns of evolution and to analyze population genetics and palaeoecological changes. Recent advances in DNA technologies  such as next-generation sequencing make it possible to recover DNA information from archaeological and paleontological remains allowing us to go back in time and study the genetic relationships between extinct organisms and their contemporary relatives. With the next-generation sequencing methodologies  DNA sequences can be retrieved even from samples (for example human remains) for which the technical pitfalls of classical methodologies required stringent criteria to guaranty the reliability of the results. In this paper  we review the methodologies applied to ancient DNA analysis and the perspectives that next-generation sequencing applications provide in this field. The field of ancient DNA studies began twenty-eight years ago with the extraction and sequencing of DNA material from the quagga  a South African equid () that went extinct in the 19 century [] and from an Egyptian mummy []. These studies used bacterial cloning to amplify small DNA sequences (retrieved from skin fragments of these specimens) and showed that the origin of the extracted genetic material was mainly microbial or fungal. In general  endogenous DNA was composed of very low concentrations of short and damaged fragments of multi-copy loci  such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). A few years later  with the development of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) it became possible to routinely amplify and study surviving ancient DNA molecules even if only in a single copy  resulting in a rapid increase and diversification of ancient DNA research [–]. However  due to the enormous power of PCR to amplify even a few copies of DNA sequences  modern DNA contamination has become a crucial problem. For this reason  many of the most extravagant reports on ancient DNA  including claims of DNA sequences surviving for millions of years in plants [–] and dinosaur bones []  have been disputed and actually disregarded. Studies on ancient DNA need to deal with technical problems that are specific to this field. The first difficulty is the production of sufficient quantities of authentic DNA sequences to make a study conclusive. This difficulty is a consequence of post-mortem DNA degradation processes  which can cause miscoding lesions  potentially leading to sequence errors  or physical destruction of the DNA molecule  thus increasing the risk for preferential amplification of exogenous contaminant sequences (Table<U+2009>). To deal with this issue  researchers have outlined a series of guidelines to ensure the quality of ancient DNA data and the reliability of consequent conclusions []. Over the years  these guidelines have gradually evolved into a more detailed and extensive list of requirements  resulting in the nine “gold criteria” outlined by Cooper and Poinar in “Ancient DNA: do it right or not at all” []  one of the most cited papers in the field (Additional file ). In particular  the authors have suggested that  in the absence of full compliance with all nine criteria  the reliability and authenticity of results remain uncertain. In the last few years  with the advent of new sequencing technologies  the field of ancient DNA is experiencing a new era wherein what was once impossible is now possible  as for example drafting genomes of extinct organisms such as []  or distinguishing endogenous from contaminant DNA in archaic  specimens []. In this report  we review the history of studies on ancient DNA from a methodological point of view  ranging from the most significant ones performed with the so-called “classical methodology” consisting in PCR amplification  cloning and traditional Sanger sequencing  to the more recent ones performed by next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS)  which are promising to revolutionize the field of ancient DNA. Starting from the first pioneering studies in the 1980s  classical methods to recover and analyze DNA from ancient specimens have been developed  and continuously improved  to overcome the two main technical limitations characterizing this field  e.g. the poor preservation of endogenous DNA and the presence of contaminant exogenous DNA. Basically  the traditional methodology consists in three fundamental steps: PCR amplification of several short and overlapping target fragments (60–200<U+2009>bp long) to recover larger regions. Production and sequencing of several clones for each amplified fragment. Alignment and comparison of sequences from different clones and different overlapping fragments to reconstruct the final consensus sequence of the entire region of interest. Using this protocol  Krings et al. [] have reported in 1997  the first reconstruction of a DNA sequence from an extinct hominin  . This consisted in a small fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [] that was subsequently enriched by other mtDNA sequences from the same individual []. A few years later  these results were corroborated by additional mtDNA sequences from other Neanderthal specimens distributed all over Europe [–]. Until recently  almost all the genetic studies performed on ancient specimens targeted mtDNA regions. Cells contain 100 to 10 000 copies of mtDNA that constitute a primary source of DNA in ancient specimens. In addition  the mitochondrial genome being maternally inherited and not subjected to recombination  mtDNA mutations are transmitted clonally across generations and can be used to trace maternal lineages. Because of these characteristics  mtDNA has been successfully used in several studies to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships between extant and extinct species  such as Australian marsupial wolves [  ]  New Zealand moas [  ]  American ground sloths [] endemic Hawaiian goose []  cave bears []  Balearic Islands cave goats []  giant lemurs [] and Caspian tigers []. The preservation of many individuals  all originating from a single locality  either as museum specimens previously collected by naturalists  or specimens retrieved by archaeologists at a single site  provides an opportunity to track changes in a population over time. The first example of this approach is a study on three populations of kangaroo rats in California  which were collected by zoologists in the first half of the last century. Comparison of modern populations from the same area has shown that the mitochondrial lineages are spatially stable  a situation typical of undisturbed habitats []. A more recent study conducted on mice sampled in Chicago (USA) has demonstrated that  in this population  mitochondrial lineages have been replaced over the last 150<U+2009>years  probably due to human influence []. Similar studies have traced the population history of many other species including rabbits []  pocket gophers []  black-footed ferrets []  sea otters []  grizzlies []  red squirrels []  canids []  penguins []  artic fox []  Chatham Island taikos []  woolly mammoths []  bears []  equids [  ]  Tasman booby [] and quails []. Ramakrishnan and Hadly [] have reviewed these studies and reanalyzed some datasets. They concluded that genetic samples collected from populations over large temporal and geographical scales  when analyzed using complex models and the serial coalescent approach  are critical to understand past population dynamics and provide important material to reconstruct evolutionary processes. An interesting study on late Pleistocene brown bears has radically revolutionized the current knowledge about bear population dynamics in Alaska []. Whereas present-day brown bear mitochondrial lineages are neatly distributed in different geographical areas  this study has shown that  about 35 000<U+2009>years ago  the same mitochondrial lineages all coexisted in a single area. This result has crucial implications for conservation genetics. Mitochondrial lineages that are spatially separated today are often considered to have separated a long time ago and to be carried by “subspecies” adapted to different environments. As a consequence  it is often suggested that they should be kept separated and not be allowed to mix in captivity or during the restocking of wild species. The data on ancient DNA sequences from brown bear prove that contemporary samples may not reproduce long-term patterns. In the future  it can be predicted that direct testing of the phylogeographic patterns of additional species will clarify whether or not these results reflect recent effects of random genetic drift within small populations or  whether they represent long-term separation of populations. Studies on ancient DNA have also been used to investigate the demographic history of human populations although such studies may suffer from contamination problems. One of the earliest publications in this field is a population genetics study on the Etruscans  a prehistoric Italian population []. Other studies have examined the origins of Andaman Islanders []  the genetic variations in prehistoric Iberians and Sardinians [  ]  and the genealogical discontinuities among Etruscans  Medieval and contemporary Tuscans []. Particular attention has also been paid to the investigation of the genetic relationship between local hunter-gatherers and the first farmers during the Palaeolithic-Neolithic transition in Europe [–]. Although based on reduced sample sets  these studies revealed a genetic discontinuity between these populations. Other studies on ancient DNA have aimed at tracing the genetic history of domestication. The most extensively studied species are cattle and pigs. The limited geographical range of sheep and goat wild ancestors indicates that the domestication of these species probably occurred in Anatolia and in the Fertile Crescent. On the contrary  the wild progenitors of cattle and pigs are distributed on a wider area indicating that their domestication scenario may be more complex with possible genetic contributions from local wild stocks. The first report on ancient bovine DNA concerns the mtDNA sequences of the extinct wild oxen () from Britain [  ]. Phylogenetic analysis of  ancient sequences has shown that these animals are clearly distinct from modern cattle. For this reason  they have been assigned to a different clade  named “P”  in contrast to the “T” clade corresponding to modern domestic cattle. Even if based on only a few sequences from a single mtDNA region  the data point to a Near-Eastern origin of European cattle. More recent genetic studies on aurochsen and ancient domestic cattle from different locations have suggested that the process of cattle domestication may be more complex than previously thought [–]. When analyzing mtDNA from Pleistocene Italian aurochsen  Beja-Pereira et al. [] and Mona et al. []  have found that the vast majority of the Italian sequences fall within the range of variation observed in modern cattle (“T” clade) and are genetically distinct from the “P” clade of the aurochsen from the British Isles []. In 2007  Edwards et al. have reported that only “P” type sequences are present in ancient aurochsen from North and Central Europe []  while nearly all the sequences of the first domestic cattle of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages belong to the “T” clade [  ]. These data represent good examples of how studies on ancient DNA can contribute to shed light on complex scenarios characterizing cattle domestication and diffusion processes. Indeed  populations domesticated in the Near East and introduced into Europe during the Neolithic diffusion might have intermixed in Southern European regions with local wild animals carrying mtDNA of the “T” type. In addition  a greater genetic variability has been observed in aurochsen from South Europe than in those from North and Central Europe. Previously unknown non-“T” mtDNA sequences have been discovered in some modern local Italian breeds [–]. As a consequence  European breeds could represent a more diverse and important genetic resource than previously recognized  especially in Southern regions. Two important papers by Larson et al. [  ] based on ancient mtDNA sequences of both wild and domestic pigs from different times and locations  have provided insights into pig domestication processes and Neolithic expansion in Europe  as well as in East Asia and Oceania. By analyzing several ancient pig specimens collected across West Eurasia  the authors have shown that Near Eastern pigs have been introduced by humans into Europe and that they may have traveled along at least two distinct routes (the Danubian corridor and a southern maritime route that ran through the North shore of the Mediterranean) []. Then  European wild boars were domesticated and rapidly became the predominant lineage within the European domestic swine. In the light of these results  the process of pig domestication in Europe appears fundamentally different from that in the Near East. In Europe  it may not have been a truly independent event  but rather a direct consequence of the introduction of Near Eastern domestic pigs by early farmers. Other similar studies have investigated the domestication process of chicken and horse [  ]. Since  even when preserved in ideal conditions  DNA degrades over time  the process of amplification  cloning and sequencing is usually constrained by the short length of the DNA fragments recovered and by the small amount of template DNA in the sample. Although longer sequences are more informative  in practice  with the classical methodology  only overlapping shorter sequences are available that must then be meticulously assembled together. For this reason  until 2005 it was not possible to obtain DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs (bp)  even from widely studied Pleistocene mammalian species such as mammoths  ground sloths and cave bears. With the breakthrough in ancient DNA sequencing due to the innovative multiplexing strategy of Krause et al. [] to reconstruct long DNA sequences from several shorter fragments  the complete sequence of the 16 770<U+2009>bp mitochondrial genome of the Pleistocene woolly mammoth () was reported  starting from only about 200<U+2009>mg of bone. Basically  the multiplexing strategy consists of a two-stage PCR: (1) first  multiple primer pairs are used to target subsequences within the complete DNA sequence and (2) the amplification product is divided in as many aliquots as the number of primer pairs used in the multiplex PCR and each aliquot serves as template for individual secondary PCR that separately amplify each target. For the woolly mammoth mtDNA  46 such primer pairs were chosen to amplify overlapping DNA sequences covering the entire mtDNA genome. Then  primer pairs were divided into two sets  each one comprising primers amplifying alternate non-contiguous fragments. Multiplex PCR was then performed with only as much ancient DNA template as would be normally used for short target sequencing. Even if the multiplexing approach does not save time (many secondary PCR are still required)  it certainly saves DNA material  since it can use hundreds of primer pairs in the same tube  thus overcoming typical limitations in sample amount. Modifications have been made to this classical methodology in order to explore the molecular nature of the DNA damages occurring in such specimens. One common feature of ancient DNA samples is the presence of miscoding lesions that cause the incorporation of incorrect nucleotides during DNA amplification. In 2001  Hofreiter et al. showed for the first time that most of these damage-derived errors are caused by hydrolytic deamination of cytosine into uracil leading to apparent C<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>T or G<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>A substitutions in DNA templates sequenced after PCR amplification []. To reduce the number of such misincorporations  assays involving pre-treatment of ancient DNA samples with uracil N-glycosylase have been conducted to remove uracil residues from the DNA sequence and leave abasic sites that prevent replication by the Taq polymerase during PCR. However  the use of uracil N-glycosylase has not been widely adopted in studies with ancient DNA  because the number of template molecules in such samples is often so small that the enzyme may destroy all the amplifiable templates. In 2007  Cooper et al. reported another approach  i.e. Single Primer Extension (SPEX)  which can provide detailed information about post-mortem base modifications in ancient DNA []. Unlike PCR  SPEX is an amplification methodology that uses single biotinylated primers to specifically target only one strand of the ancient DNA template at a locus of interest without imposing any predefined target length. With SPEX  primer extension continues until it is stopped by the end of the template due to fragmentation or by a polymerase-blocking lesion. After the primer extension step  all non-biotinylated DNA templates are removed by washes in the presence of streptavidin beads and the remaining first-generation copies of the ancient DNA target are then ligated to a polyC-tail and amplified by nested PCR. Comparison of data obtained with SPEX amplification and standard procedures on the same samples showed that SPEX can produce sequence data of unprecedented accuracy from ancient DNA  without introducing additional exogenous sequence artifacts. Cooper et al. [] also suggested that the C<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>U base modifications may originate from the damage-derived miscoding lesions present at significant levels in samples of ancient DNA. Despite its potential interest  after this initial report  SPEX has not been widely applied mainly because of its intrinsic laborious protocol compared to other more innovative procedures (see “Next Generation Sequencing methodology” section). Another recent implementation in the classical methodology is the use of blocking oligonucleotides that preferentially bind modern contaminant DNA and prevent its amplification  in combination with standard primers specific for the target of interest. A blocking oligonucleotide consists in modifying its 3’ end with a C3 spacer to prevent the TaqDNA polymerase from extending it without significantly changing its annealing properties to the target DNA. The C3 spacer is a standard primer modification available from most suppliers of custom oligonucleotides and consists in a short three-carbon spacer arm []. This novel PCR method has been tested by Gigli et al. on four Neanderthal samples with different contamination levels and taphonomic conditions []. Usually  Neanderthal skeletal remains are contaminated with modern human DNA derived from the handling and the washing of the specimens during excavation. Although Neanderthal and modern-human haplotypes differ  allowing the design of specific primer pairs for most of the mtDNA hypervariable region 1 (HVR1)  the human contaminants can often outnumber the endogenous DNA  thus preventing a successful retrieval of Neanderthal sequences. However  including blocking oligonucleotides  specifically designed to preferentially bind modern-human specific sequences from contaminant sources  has made it possible to significantly increase the yield of Neanderthal DNA sequences in all four samples (from 25.23<U+2009>% up to 90.18<U+2009>%) by inhibiting the hybridization of the standard primers. Even if a sample of ancient DNA  typically contains 1000 times more copies of mtDNA than nuclear DNA  the number of mtDNA copies  sufficiently well preserved to be analyzed  is very low. In fact  nuclear DNA seems less prone to degradation and damage over time  so the chance of recovering longer intact strands is actually greater for nuclear DNA than for mtDNA. In addition  DNA damages are less frequent in nuclear DNA than in mtDNA  possibly because nuclear DNA is better protected by proteins. From a quantitative point of view  DNA sequences that occur in many hundreds of copies per cell  such as DNA from mitochondria or chloroplasts in plants  are more easily retrieved from ancient specimens than are nuclear DNA sequences that occur only once per haploid genome. Therefore  phylogenies are usually reconstituted with information from only a few genetic loci  which limits phylogeny reconstruction of species that have diverged either recently or so rapidly that different parts of their genome have different phylogenies. However  this limitation can be overcome in some cases. For example  it has been possible to determine nuclear DNA sequences from several Pleistocene animals [  ]  from plants preserved in dry environments [] and from museum specimens [  ]. An interesting study on ancient cattle samples has investigated cattle domestication based on paternally transmitted Y chromosome-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) [  ]. In modern European cattle  one SNP in intron 19 of the Y-chromosomal gene  and one 2-bp insertion–deletion polymorphism in the  intron 5  distinguish two haplogroups: Y1  primarily found in Northern Europe  and Y2  mainly distributed in Southern Europe []. Detection of the Y1 haplogroup in ancient cattle and aurochs from Northern and Central Europe has been initially interpreted as proof of a hybridization event having occurred in Europe between domestic cows and aurochs bulls []. However  subsequent studies on different sample sets have failed to find the same pattern  and shown a great fluctuation of allele frequencies over time [  ]. These results suggest that the present-day frequencies of Y1 and Y2 haplogroups probably depend more on recent demographic events than on events having occurred in the first stages of cattle domestication. Even if the analysis of Y chromosome lineages is potentially useful to understand the evolutionary history of cattle  there is still no patrilinear marker capable of tagging a possible introgression of European aurochs into domestic cattle. Having access to nuclear ancient DNA might enable scientists to investigate ancient animal and human phenotypes  such as skin color and behavioral traits. Of all the important questions on Neanderthals  that of whether they were able to speak and  if so  how well  is a key issue. To address this  Krause et al. [] have analyzed the  gene  a gene intimately connected with the ability to speak in humans. They have applied the classical multiplexing approach  to characterize two SNP in the  gene and to check a number of modern human DNA contamination control positions on autosomes  sex chromosomes and mtDNA. They have found that Neanderthal and modern humans share the same polymorphisms at the  locus  which differ from those found in all other mammals  suggesting that  most probably had the ability to speak like modern humans. In addition  the reconstructed Neanderthal Y chromosome sequence falls outside the range of variation observed in modern humans  indicating that the  sequences obtained are authentic and confirming that the Neanderthal paternal contribution to the human nuclear genome is low. During the same period  Lalueza-Fox and colleagues have amplified and sequenced a fragment of the  () gene from two Neanderthal remains []. The  gene regulates pigmentation in humans and other mammals. In particular   variants with a reduced function are associated with pale skin color and red hair in humans of European origin. Lalueza-Fox et al. have shown that both Neanderthal specimens carry a mutation in the  gene that is completely absent in the 3700 samples analyzed from modern humans. Furthermore  functional analyses have revealed that this variant reduces MC1R activity to a level that alters hair and skin pigmentation in humans. These results suggest that Neanderthals varied in pigmentation levels  potentially on the same scale as observed in modern humans  and  in addition  that defective MC1R variants have evolved independently in modern humans and in Neanderthals. An interesting study by Ludwig et al. [] based on ancient samples representing different periods between the Late Pleistocene and the Middle Ages and targeting nuclear genes responsible for coat pigmentation  has shed light on the timing and place of horse domestication. This study has shown that the rapid increase in number of coat color patterns is a result of domestication and the great variation in coloration of modern domestic horses is a result of selective breeding by ancient farmers. Contamination is a serious problem in studies with ancient DNA  even more so when dealing with human ancient DNA than with animal or plant ancient DNA. Early results from human remains collected in hot climate regions  such as Egypt [] and Florida []  are now considered as probably coming from modern human contaminations. For example  a 3.4<U+2009>kb long nuclear DNA sequence reported as amplified from an Egyptian mummy is an unusually long sequence for DNA extracted from ancient remains. In addition  it is well known that high temperatures such as those occurring in Egypt do not help DNA preservation []. Several papers have reported that  despite the use of rigorous protocols [  ]  modern human DNA contamination is prevalent in amplification products from DNA extracts of ancient specimens [  –]. In fact  it has been shown that even with extensive UV and bleach treatments  it is impossible to completely remove modern human DNA from ancient bones and teeth []. This is probably due to the porosity of bone and tooth dentine  which are the main entry routes for DNA coming from sweat  skin fragments and exhaled cells. However  when teeth are well preserved and directly removed from the jaw or maxilla  they appear less prone to contamination than bone fragments. Hair is also a more reliable source for studies on human ancient DNA  since it seems to be less susceptible to contamination than bone and teeth  even if its presence is less common in ancient specimens than skeletal remains []. In a different study  Salamon et al. [] has shown that relatively well preserved DNA can be present within clusters of inter-grown bone crystals that are resistant to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) disaggregation  a strong oxidant. These authors obtained reproducible authentic DNA sequences from bone crystal aggregates of both modern and ancient animal bones  including humans. Moreover  they claim that the NaOCl treatment minimizes the risk of modern DNA contamination. Indeed  applying this treatment on fossil bones  they have demonstrated the presence of a privileged niche containing DNA in a better state of preservation than DNA extracted from the total bone. Thus  this approach could significantly increase the chances of obtaining authentic ancient DNA sequences  especially from human bones. For all these reasons  when analyzing ancient human DNA samples with the classical methodology  it is essential to collect skeletal material that has been manipulated only with disposable gloves and face-masks during excavation (Additional file )  and to select archaeological remains for which the taphonomic history is well-known. Many excavated archaeological specimens appear to contain DNA from multiple individuals [  ]  which raises the issue of how to authenticate ancient human DNA sequences  when they do not differ from DNA from potential contaminants (modern Human) such as Neanderthals [] or distinct modern human groups like the Andaman Islanders []. A good example is the analysis of Italian Cro-Magnon specimens []  which have been submitted to comprehensive authentication protocols [  ]. However  since the sequences obtained are indistinguishable from those of modern European humans  sample contamination must remain the null hypothesis. Another serious issue is the presence of modern human DNA in samples that were not expected to contain any [        –]. This has been carefully investigated in two studies on Neolithic and Upper Palaeolithic samples  respectively by Sampietro et al. [] and Caramelli et al. []. Sampietro et al. [] have characterized the mtDNA hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) in 23 Neolithic remains excavated from Granollers (Barcelona  Spain). They compared the sequences obtained with those from the DNA of the six persons involved in the excavation  the washing and subsequent anthropological and genetic studies of the specimens. They found that 17.13<U+2009>% of the 572 cloned sequences generated from ancient DNA extracted from the teeth of the Neolithic specimens could be unambiguously identified as contaminants derived from the persons involved in the project. Moreover  when checking the cloned contaminant sequences  they observed that the level of damage in the contaminant DNA molecules increased with time and demonstrated that the damage rate of the older contaminant and the endogenous DNA sequences were indistinguishable. Therefore  the commonly used argument that miscoding lesions observed in cloned ancient DNA sequences can be used to support data authenticity is misleading in scenarios where the presence of old contaminant sequences is possible. For this reason  these authors claim that genetic typing of people involved in the manipulation of ancient human specimens is critical to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of findings. In 2008  Caramelli et al. performed the genetic characterization of a Cro-Magnoid individual  Paglicci  from layer 23  whose taphonomic history was very well known []. Consequently  they were able to monitor all the possible contaminations from persons having manipulated the sample  and demonstrated that the sequence obtained from the Paglicci bones differed from those of all the people that had been in contact with the bones. In addition  since the sequence obtained for the Paglicci mtDNA HVR1 is still common in European humans and since no HVR 1 sequence similar to that of Neanderthals is present in modern Europeans  they conclude that Neanderthals probably did not contribute to the modern human mitochondrial gene pool. In 2010  Krause et al. confirmed this conclusion in a study involving more innovative techniques that will be described in the next sections []. As described in the above section  in the pre-NGS era  PCR and Sanger sequencing were the main tools available to analyze ancient DNA samples. The development of miniaturized gel electrophoresis (capillary electrophoresis) and the automation of reactions  gel loading and signal detection allowed the Sanger methodology to become the gold standard for DNA sequencing. Despite these features  Sanger sequencing has a low throughput and consequently is expensive for large-scale sequencing. Moreover  library preparation and amplification  and colony picking have a low efficiency and are time-consuming steps. With ancient DNA  these drawbacks are even more critical and the development of NGS has opened up whole new possibilities and extended the field of applications []. The new generation of NGS sequencers has made it possible to increase the number of bases sequenced per run with a concomitant decrease in sequencing costs  due to technological improvements. The most important NGS platforms used in the field of ancient DNA analyses are the 454/Roche FLX and the Illumina Genome Analyzer [–]. Both technologies share the same rationale for the production of sequences (reads)  but differ in the amplification procedure and sequencing chemistry resulting in different throughputs. In spite of the high sensitivity and productivity of NGS sequencers  their signal detection system is not sensitive enough to measure the sequencing signal originating from a single molecule. Detection systems  such as the CCD camera for both 454/Roche and Illumina  can identify a signal only if it is generated by millions of DNA molecules  thus amplification of the sequencing library is necessary. The three key steps for generating reads are: (1) library preparation  (2) library amplification and (3) sequencing. More details about these steps are described and illustrated in Additional file  [see Additional file ] and in Figures  and .  Double-stranded ancient DNA is converted in single-stranded DNA library through the ligation of specific 454 “adapters” (A and B); the emulsion PCR amplifies the library molecules on “capture beads” that are then enriched and loaded onto PicoTiterPlate (PTP) for the pyrosequencing reaction.  Double-stranded ancient DNA is converted into an Illumina library and is then amplified by “bridge amplification” onto the surface of the “flowcell”; amplified molecules are sequenced by the cycle reversible termination (CRT) methodology. For both the 454/Roche and Illumina platforms  it is necessary to prepare a library of the ancient DNA fragments ligated at both ends to specific DNA adapters for PCR amplification. After isolating the DNA from an ancient specimen  double strand DNA is polished at the 3’ and 5’ ends and is converted in blunt end DNA. The polishing step is performed using simultaneously a DNA polymerase and a polynucleotide kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation at the 5’ position. Library preparation proceeds with the ligation of the adapters to the polished and phosphorylated fragment ends. Adapters consist of short oligonucleotides of known sequence that will permit the design of complementary primers for library amplification and sequencing. 454/Roche and Illumina platforms use different amplification procedures  which are strictly related to their sequencing chemistry. In the case of the 454/Roche platform  the library is amplified in a water-in-oil emulsion PCR (emPCR). Each single DNA molecule of the library is bound to a bead that acts as PCR support  and amplified within an aqueous droplet. In the Illumina system  amplification is carried out by an isothermal bridge amplification process run on a glass slide  termed “flowcell” where molecules are amplified independently  thus generating spatially distinct clones  named “clusters”. While in the Illumina system  the same support i.e. the flowcell is used for both amplification and sequencing  in the 454/Roche system  these two steps are performed on different supports. Further details about amplification procedures are reported in Additional file  [see Additional file . Precise library quantification is a critical step for both platforms  to obtain high quality sequences []. For the Illumina system  an appropriate number of clusters must be generated during library amplification  while for the 454/Roche system only a precisely quantified library will ensure a correct calibration of DNA/beads proportions that fosters the binding of a single DNA molecule per bead and the production of an “in-range” emulsion PCR yield. The 454/Roche and Illumina platforms use protocols based on different chemistries and produce different numbers of sequenced bases per run. The strategy to generate reads in the 454/Roche system relies on pyrosequencing  based on a single nucleotide addition (SNA) technique [  ]. Pyrosequencing consists in an enzymatic cascade that is activated each time a nucleotide is added to the growing DNA chain. Each nucleotide addition generates a spot light that is measured by a CCD camera. The intensity of light emitted by the enzymatic cascade is proportional to the number of added nucleotides and is digitalized and converted in nucleotide sequence. Pyrosequencing reactions take place on a fiber glass support  named “PicoTiterPlate” (PTP)  on which DNA beads are loaded after emPCR. The updated version of the 454/Roche GS-FLX platform  Titanium Plus  reaches a read length of 800 bases and each run can generate up to 1 Gigabase of sequence. Conversely  the Illumina platform exploits a sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) strategy  in which modified nucleotides  called cyclic reversible terminators (CRT)  are inserted during the synthesis reaction. The different fluorescence emissions by each dye-labeled nucleotide  after laser excitation  are detected by a CCD camera and thus each cluster on the flowcell is associated to a raw sequence. The Illumina GAIIx platform has a sequencing yield of about 50 Gigabases per run  while the updated version HiSeq reaches 200 Gigabases per run. The Illumina platform provides sequence reads with a length ranging from 36 to about 150 bases. In a study on ancient DNA  different types of DNA target can be sequenced depending on the project goal and the available ancient material. A shotgun sequencing project is performed when isolated DNA is sequenced without any  selection. The shotgun approach has the capacity of identifying all the known species when total DNA is isolated from bone  teeth or shaft specimen. Given the nature of these sample types  the amount of endogenous target DNA can be very low  because of bacterial or fungal contamination. The shotgun approach is also used for metagenomic studies  when the goal of the sequencing project is to identify all possible known organisms present in an isolated specimen. This approach has been applied by Poinar [] and Miller [] to sequence mammoth DNA and they have confirmed the presence of a large amount of exogenous DNA. All the sequences obtained in a shotgun sequencing project are usually identified by matching to sequence databases  with a  procedure  that uses . Due to the high statistical power needed to specifically recognize the reads obtained  the shotgun approach requires a high level of sequencing depth  e.g. the total number of bases sequenced has to exceed largely the total length of the target DNA so that each DNA region is sequenced many times. Matching parameters must be carefully chosen to avoid non specific results  as described in the “Data analysis” section. Considering the cost of this approach  the currently elected sequencing platform is the Illumina Genome Analyzer system  which can generate millions of reads at a lower cost per base compared to the 454/Roche sequencer. Due to the high level of bacterial contamination in the shotgun approach  a strategy to decrease the amount of microbial DNA sequences has been proposed by Green et al. []. It consists in an enzymatic digestion of the sequencing library with a mixture of restriction enzymes capable of degrading DNA fragments with a GC composition similar to that found in bacterial genomes. Green et al. applied this treatment before library amplification and increased by about 5-fold the amount of Neanderthal DNA in sequencing libraries prepared from archeological remains. By applying this method  the same researchers have recently obtained the draft of the entire genome of two extinct hominin groups: Neanderthals and Denisovans [  ]. PCR is the most efficient procedure to selectively select a target DNA region. PCR includes a series of well-known steps that need to be optimized for each specific application. The most important step is designing primers  which must take in account the specificity needed to obtain robust results. PCR advantages and disadvantages must be considered before deciding on the rationale of an ancient DNA sequencing project. The most important advantage of a PCR approach is that  via DNA amplification  a high amount of material is obtained i.e. PCR products or amplicons  which are easily converted in an NGS library that can be sequenced. Even if the specificity of PCR is very high  a major disadvantage is the increased rate of misincorporations in the fragment ends  which are important markers for ancient DNA studies  as discussed later in this review. PCR should be used when the sequencing target is well known and the goal is to detect SNP or small variants used as markers for haplotyping  for instance to identify Neanderthal private nucleotide substitutions. This strategy has been used to identify nucleotide variants in short sequences of specific genes like those determining blood group  taste perception and brain development in Neanderthal samples [–]. In a multiplex PCR strategy  different amplicons can be mixed together in a balanced mixture and sequenced at the same time. A multiplex PCR strategy  coupled with NGS sequencing  has made it possible to characterize the entire mitochondrial genome of the Tyrolean Iceman Ötzi  one of the best conserved mummies []  and to identify the mitochondrial haplotype  K1ö  observed for the first time in this specimen. Another study comparing this sequence with modern human PCR products characterized precisely the nucleotide misincorporations in the mitochondrial DNA of this Tyrolean Iceman Ötzi []. Similarly  a PCR multiplexing strategy was used to recover the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of extinct animals  such as cave bears [] and Auroch ()  an ancestor of domestic cattle []. Sequence capture is a methodology that uses specifically designed probes to recognize and capture a target DNA  permitting both sample enrichment and recovery of information on DNA misincorporations at the 3’ and 5’ fragment ends. The first capture methodology used in the field of ancient DNA was the primer extension capture (PEC) approach  which uses biotinylated primers specifically designed to identify particular regions and to permit extension until the end of the DNA fragments [] (Figure ). Such primers have been exploited by Briggs et al. []  to capture and sequence the entire Neanderthal mitochondrial genome from whole DNA isolated from an ancient specimen and converted into a labeled NGS library. Once the biotinylated primers bind to the specific target regions contained in the library (e.g. target species mtDNA)  an extension step is performed using a DNA polymerase that synthesizes the complementary strand until the end of the DNA fragment. This extension step increases the specificity of the biotinylated primers. The specifically annealed fragments are captured by streptavidin-coated beads that bind the biotinylated-primer/target-library-fragment complexes. Then  a melting step recovers the captured fraction of the initial library  which represents a small but enriched fraction of the whole DNA isolated from the specimen. This library is finally amplified and sequenced with NGS.  Specific genomic regions are targeted by hybridization between biotinylated capture primers and NGS library sequences; the strand extension and the capture step allow the recovery of the enriched library. This procedure has a very high specificity and has in fact  improved the capacity to recover complete mtDNA from very complex samples such as Neanderthal and other hominin bone fragments [    ]  but synthesizing biotinylated primers for an entire mtDNA sequence is still an expensive step. To decrease the cost of the PEC approach  it is possible to either target only a few short regions or to substitute primer synthesis for probes generated by a cheaper procedure. As shown by Maricic et al. []  PEC probes can be generated by fragmenting and then biotinylating long products obtained by the amplification of modern mtDNA. This approach makes it possible to obtain PEC probes starting from any target region  whether mitochondrial or nuclear DNA  isolated from human or other animal samples. Another capture approach uses biotinylated probes longer than a standard primer  and thus an extension step is not needed and information on misincorporations at the ends of the fragments can be enriched and recovered. Probe enrichment methodologies are already available for modern human  mouse  dog and cattle DNA re-sequencing projects  which are applied either to study specific genomic regions genetically related to diseases or to analyze a whole exome (i.e. coding exonic DNA) [  ]. These capture methodologies are available in two forms  either in solid- or in liquid-phase. The solid-phase approach relies on probes immobilized onto an array surface []  like those used in microarray gene expression studies. Nimblegen (SeqCap arrays) and Agilent (Agilent 244<U+2009>K microarrays) have developed this kind of approach (Figures  and  respectively). Burbano and coworkers [] have used a Nimblegen modified array version for the analysis of ancient DNA. This procedure uses a microarray surface on which probes specifically designed to capture specific genomic regions are immobilized. The NGS library is then hybridized onto the array surface so that the probes capture the targeted DNA regions. After hybridization  non-specific DNA fragments are washed away  while the library DNA fragments complementary to the probes are subsequently recovered by an elution step. These fragments represent a small and selected fraction of the entire genome. The library enrichment ratio depends on the sizes of the captured genomic regions and of the entire genome. Nimblegen has also developed a commercial capture array  which can capture the whole human exome  with 2.1.10 immobilized probes  for a total of 30.10 captured bases. Considering the human genome size  this capture array allows a ~100-fold enrichment.  In solid-sequence  capture is performed by hybridization between NGS library sequences and the capture probes immobilized onto an array surface.  In solid-sequence  capture is performed by hybridization between NGS library sequences and the capture probes immobilized onto an array surface. The Agilent in liquid-phase approach i.e. SureSelect target enrichment system  uses biotinylated RNA probes  named “baits” that are subsequently captured by streptavidin-coated beads []. This procedure is similar to that of Nimblegen  but the supporting material for capture consists of beads suspended in a buffer  instead of a solid array. The in-liquid selection has a higher capture yield due to a better interaction between the library and the probes. Another in liquid-phase approach developed by CustomArray uses biotinylated probes synthesized in a customized way using  synthesis. The DNA probes are then converted into RNA probes and biotinylated to permit enrichment of the target DNA and collection. Finally  the captured enriched library is quantified and sequenced by NGS. In general  sequencing projects can be separated into “de-novo” and “re-sequencing” projects  depending on the nature of the sample analyzed and the availability of a reference sequence. In fact  since a reference sequence is required to assemble short reads of damaged DNA  ancient DNA sequencing projects are re-sequencing projects. When a new ancient species is investigated it is necessary to decide which sequence(s) to use as reference. For anthropological studies  the  genome reference sequence is used even when the sequenced ancient DNA originates from a close relative  such as Neanderthal [] or Denisovan []. In these cases  a double mapping onto the human and a close primate genome reference sequences may be required to identify the correct position of the hominin sample in the evolutionary tree. Studies on wild ancestors of modern species generally use the reference sequence of the corresponding modern species [    ]. The large number of on-going sequencing projects and the availability of sequences in public databases  make re-sequencing a widespread approach. However  de-novo sequencing differs from re-sequencing because it requires the generation of an informative and robust sequence with a higher sequencing depth. Thus  the generation of different libraries with different fragment sizes and the assembly of the reads involve the use of specific  algorithms that can reconstruct a previously unknown sequence. Re-sequenced DNA can be analyzed to identify nucleotide variations specific to a given species or to discriminate between phylogenetically-related species. For example  Neanderthal private polymorphisms in the HVR-1 mitochondrial region are used as markers to discriminate between  and Neanderthal DNA []. Sequence variations are detected by mapping reads from ancient DNA on a reference sequence using BLAST. Any nucleotide difference between the reference sequence and the ancient DNA reads is a putative private variation. Two important BLAST parameters must be considered to obtain robust results: the gap opening penalty () and the e-value (). When analyzing ancient DNA sequences  it is necessary to avoid setting too stringent matching parameters  to increase the probability of having an informative result. Moreover  sequencing errors must be taken into account when choosing matching parameters. Illumina and 454/Roche have different patterns of sequencing errors. On the one hand  Illumina sequencing is associated with a high error in base calling  which leads to a high rate of false base substitutions. These errors can be detected and corrected by sequencing at a sufficient depth (20X or more). On the other hand  the 454/Roche pyrosequencing reaction cascade accumulates insertion or deletions (INDELs) within homopolymeric regions resulting in a sequence of low quality in these regions. Thus  putative variants detected in these regions will require further validation. Given the sequencing error rates of these two NGS platforms  many sequencing projects combine the two technologies to compensate for their respective limits. Considering all the difficulties associated with sequencing ancient DNA  such as nucleotide misincorporations and NGS error rates  matching parameters G and e-values  for reads mapping should be carefully chosen. For these reasons  the parameter G that is related to the space introduced during the alignment between two sequences and represents the cost to open a gap is usually set to low values. Moreover  the e-value that is a parameter related to the reliability of the similarity between two sequences is expected to be very low for specific matches. Matching results must be filtered to discard data with non-specific matches. The origin of the reads is variable since they can originate from both ancient and modern DNA fragments present in the analyzed sample. Currently  different criteria are used to recognize and discriminate ancient from modern DNA. Ancient DNA fragments are usually short  less than 120<U+2009>bp long  but this is not sufficient to distinguish between ancient and modern DNA. Another important feature of ancient DNA is the presence of miscoding lesions at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the fragments []  where a higher frequency of base substitutions from C to T and from G to A is observed compared to that in modern DNA (approximately 35<U+2009>% in Pleistocene ancient human samples). Thus  a reduced fragment length associated with the occurrence of terminal miscoding lesions is the main feature used to distinguish ancient from modern DNA. If a high sequencing depth is available  DNA damage rate can be calculated with the “mapDamage” software []. Contamination from modern DNA requires special attention when hominin specimens are investigated. Even if the sample’s taphonomic history is well known  putative contaminations from modern human DNA can reduce the number of informative reads. The shotgun approach can discriminate between target and contaminant reads  but the cost to obtain robust results can be very high. Using a selection procedure such as sequence capture can reduce the spectrum of target sequences  while keeping information on miscoding lesions in fragments of ancient DNA. The first publication on ancient DNA sequencing using an NGS platform was entitled “Metagenomics to paleogenomics: Large-scale sequencing of mammoth DNA”  published by Poinar et al. in  at the end of 2005 []. Poinar and colleagues performed a metagenomic study on a mammoth bone sample using the first version of the 454 sequencer and produced 302 692 sequence reads with a mean length of 95<U+2009>bp  for a total of nearly 30.10 bases. After this milestone publication  many other sequencing projects of ancient DNA have been carried out based on high-throughput next-generation sequencing. In May 2006  the first nuclear DNA sequences from a Neanderthal () were reported by Pääbo []  as part of the Neanderthal Genome project that had started about two years before. Within this project  Pääbo and coworkers probed 60 Neanderthal specimens from museums to investigate the degree of DNA preservation after thousands of years. Two of the specimens analyzed provided interesting results and Pääbo’s team reported at the Biology of Genomes meeting at New York's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that they had succeeded in sequencing about 10 bpof nuclear DNA (about 0.03<U+2009>% of the genome) from a 45 000-year-old male from the Vindija cave  Croatia using pyrosequencing. Another report by James Noonan at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting in the same year  presented a preliminary analysis of 75 000 of the 10<U+2009>bp sequenced so far. These two papers [  ] on Neanderthal nuclear DNA sequences from fossil bones promise to answer questions on the relationship between extinct species  such as Neanderthals and present-day humans. Typically  one of these questions is whether the Neanderthals are the direct ancestors of modern-day humans or an evolutionary side branch that eventually died out. Although these two studies were the first to investigate  ancient DNA on a large scale  they came to very different conclusions regarding the ancestral role of Neanderthals. A year later  Wall and Kim [] reanalyzed the data from these two original studies and found that their results contradict each other. This implies that the data from at least one of the studies are probably incorrect  due to contamination by modern human DNA  which strongly compromises the final findings []. Recently  Green et al. [] sequenced a large part of the Neanderthal nuclear genome using NGS. Starting from about 400<U+2009>mg of bone powder  they generated 5.3 Gigabases of Neanderthal DNA sequences with a 1.3X genome coverage. DNA sequences matching at a significantly higher rate to primate genomes than to any other organism were further analyzed. These results revealed that Neanderthals and present-day humans shared a common ancestor about 800 000<U+2009>years ago  which diverged between 270 000 and 440 000<U+2009>years ago. This study also showed that Neanderthal DNA shares more genetic variants with present-day humans from Eurasia than from sub-Saharan Africa i.e. on average 2.5<U+2009>% (range 1–4<U+2009>%) of the genome of people outside Africa derive from Neanderthals. In addition  the authors provided a list of genomic regions and candidate genes that could have been under early positive selection pressure in modern human history  for example  those involved in cognitive abilities and cranial morphology. Along these same lines  another important study has shed new light on the evolutionary history of the  genus. In 2010  Krause et al. have described the distal manual phalanx of a juvenile hominin excavated from the Denisova cave (Altai Mountains  southern Siberia) []. The phalanx was found in layer 11  which has been dated 50 000 to 30 000<U+2009>years ago. This layer contained micro blades and body ornaments of polished stone  typical of the ‘Upper Palaeolithic industry’ and generally thought to be associated with modern humans  and also stone tools that are more characteristic of the earlier Middle Paleolithic age  such as side scrapers and Levallois blanks. A sequence capture approach [  ] combined with high-throughput sequencing [  ] was used to characterize the complete mtDNA genome from this specimen. To clarify the relationship between the Denisova individual and other hominin groups  Reich et al. have sequenced the nuclear genome of the Denisova specimen and analyzed its genomic relationship with Neanderthal and present-day human genomes []. Two independent sequencing libraries were generated from the ancient DNA extracted from this specimen  using a modified Illumina protocol. The results show that the Denisova individual belongs to a hominin group  named the “Denisovans”  which share a more recent common ancestor with Neanderthal but have a population history distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. The major outcome of this study is that this is the first time that a new population  the “Denisovans” is characterized starting from DNA. In fact  at present  except for the phalanx and a tooth retrieved during the archaeological excavation  no other physical and morphological feature of this population is known. Additional important issues have been addressed in a study on archaic hominins taking into consideration the important argument of gene flow between modern and extinct humans  as reported by Lalueza-Fox et al. []. With the advent of the NGS technology and the possibility to reconstruct the genome of extinct hominins  new perspectives to study human evolution have opened up. Malmström et al have studied the dynamics of a Scandinavia population during the Neolithic era by sequencing DNA from ancient Scandinavian human remains []. Gilbert et al. have sequenced the mtDNA of a Paleo-Eskimo human starting from a 3400 to 4500-year-old frozen hair  thus documenting human expansion into the New World's northern extremes []. The same DNA source (i.e. hair shaft) had already been used by Gilbert et al. [] to sequence the mitochondrial genome of a Siberian mammoth () using NGS. Interesting results have been reported by Rasmussen et al. who sequenced almost 80<U+2009>% of the genome of a 4000-year-old human genome from Greenland []. Besides from showing that the Saqqaq population had no or little European contribution in their genome  this sequencing project identified specific phenotypic traits starting from genomic information  providing important information about an extinct culture. Although these genomic data are obtained from a single individual  a demographic history could be reconstructed. Using NGS  it is possible to detect traces of the intermingled genetic histories of the humans involved in the Neolithic processes that led to the domestication and diffusion of a species  as shown by the sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of [  ]. Using the Roche/454 platform  Ramírez et al. [] have sequenced DNA isolated from a 6000-year-old bone sample from an extinct caprine species () from the Balearic Islands and thus shown that NGS applied to DNA from extinct animals can lead to a better understanding of adaptation. Other extinct animals  such as the New Zealand moa have been characterized by Allentoft et al. []. They have demonstrated the feasibility of studying ancient biodiversity and extinction processes using NGS. In addition  Miller et al. [] have analyzed the Tasmanian tiger ()  extinct since 1936  by sequencing DNA isolated from a museum specimen collection. With the development of new sequencing chemistries and innovative signal detection methodologies  a new generation of sequencers  named Third Generation Sequencers (TGS) have recently become available (Table<U+2009>). These novel platforms differ in sample preparations and sequencing chemistries  but all share the particular and innovative feature of direct sequencing  allowing single molecule analysis  hence bypassing PCR amplification. For studies on ancient DNA  the possibility of using very small amounts of starting DNA field is highly appreciated  since it improves detection of DNA damage and identification of contaminants and exogenous sequences. Recently  Orlando and colleagues [] have applied this new technology to perform single-molecule sequencing of DNA isolated from a Pleistocene horse bone. They used the total DNA isolated from the specimen  without any kind of sequence enrichment (i.e. sequence capture)  or PCR amplification  thus allowing an assessment of postmortem DNA damage. In spite of a very high number of sequenced bases  the level of sequence depth was too low (1X on the mitochondrial genome) to proceed further with the analysis Table<U+2009>. The second generation sequencers  such as Roche/454 and Illumina presented in this review but also SOLiD have opened new possibilities for ancient DNA sequencing by providing a very high throughput  which could not be reached previously with traditional Sanger-based platforms. In the last few years  these technologies have made it possible to characterize genomes  metagenomes and transcriptomes  thus rapidly increasing sequence information available for different organisms and applications. The three most important NGS technologies have different specific features positioning each one in a given niche market. Briefly  the Roche/454 technology provides long sequence reads  today up to 800 bases  thus greatly simplifying the genome assembly. The Illumina and SOLiD technologies  thanks to their high throughput  have drastically reduced the cost per sequenced base even if the reads produced do not exceed 100 bases. Although  to date  the SOLiD technology has not been used in studies on ancient DNA  it offers an important asset i.e. high accuracy in base calling due to its two-base encoding sequencing strategy. The throughput of the SOLiD platform  based on a sequencing by ligation (SBL) chemistry is comparable to that obtained by Illumina  but because a reference sequence is required to translate its so-called “color space” into a nucleotide sequence  its application in the field of ancient DNA has not been considered up till now. The high sensitivity and resolution power offered by the NGS technologies have considerably increased available data on ancient DNA thus greatly improving our knowledge on many interesting issues of human evolution: the history of extinct species  adaptation and domestication processes. New hypotheses and theories have been developed with the most important achievement being the robustness and reliability of sequencing data. Moreover  identification  elimination and estimation of contaminant sequences in ancient DNA samples are issues that need to be discussed and resolved. Developing new molecular biology procedures and innovative  bioinformatics approaches must be accounted for when planning a sequencing project on ancient DNA. Each feature of an ancient sample needs to be carefully evaluated to develop a specifically focused experimental design in order to optimize the sequencing power of either the NGS or TGS technology used. For this reason  when NGS is used to sequence ancient DNA  we propose to include an additional “golden criteria” to the nine summarized by Cooper and Poinar in 2000 []. It concerns the labeling of the ancient DNA sequencing library using synthetic commercial or custom-made nucleotides “TAG”. These “labels” could be project- or sample-specific in the case of shotgun or capture sequencing  to enable estimation of putative contamination of the sample after DNA isolation. Currently  enrichment protocols of DNA samples and specific bioinformatics pipelines have been successfully developed to increase data reliability. However  other steps in the procedures and analyses need to be optimized to generate a robust ancient DNA data set. NGS technologies and the development of new molecular biology strategies  such as PEC or capture “baits”  have also accelerated the change in the focus of research from the frequently investigated mtDNA (reviewed by Ho and Gilbert []) to the more informative nuclear DNA. Major insights have been gained from the multidisciplinary nature of the projects on ancient DNA  which exploit data combined from different technologies capable of generating genome-wide data []. Moreover  all the data  which have been used to study complex processes such as human evolution  domestication or demographic events  need to be confirmed by the analysis of many more samples  even if the availability of ancient well-preserved specimens is always a critical and intrinsic feature of palaeogenomic projects.

"Comparison on genomic predictions using three GBLUP methods and two single-step blending methods in the Nordic Holstein population"	"Authors: Hongding Gao  Ole F Christensen  Per Madsen  Ulrik S Nielsen  Yuan Zhang  Mogens S Lund and Guosheng Su"	"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics  Aarhus University  DK-8830  Tjele  DenmarkHongding Gao  Ole F Christensen  Per Madsen  Mogens S Lund & Guosheng Su Danish Agricultural Advisory Service  DK-8200  Aarhus N  DenmarkUlrik S Nielsen College of Animal Science and Technology  China Agricultural University  100193  Beijing  People Republic of ChinaHongding Gao & Yuan Zhang"	"No Co-Author"	"6 July 2012"	"BackgroundA single-step blending approach allows genomic prediction using information of genotyped and non-genotyped animals simultaneously. However  the combined relationship matrix in a single-step method may need to be adjusted because marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices may not be on the same scale. The same may apply when a GBLUP model includes both genomic breeding values and residual polygenic effects. The objective of this study was to compare single-step blending methods and GBLUP methods with and without adjustment of the genomic relationship matrix for genomic prediction of 16 traits in the Nordic Holstein population.MethodsThe data consisted of de-regressed proofs (DRP) for 5 214 genotyped and 9 374 non-genotyped bulls. The bulls were divided into a training and a validation population by birth date  October 1  2001. Five approaches for genomic prediction were used: 1) a simple GBLUP method  2) a GBLUP method with a polygenic effect  3) an adjusted GBLUP method with a polygenic effect  4) a single-step blending method  and 5) an adjusted single-step blending method. In the adjusted GBLUP and single-step methods  the genomic relationship matrix was adjusted for the difference of scale between the genomic and the pedigree relationship matrices. A set of weights on the pedigree relationship matrix (ranging from 0.05 to 0.40) was used to build the combined relationship matrix in the single-step blending method and the GBLUP method with a polygenetic effect.ResultsAveraged over the 16 traits  reliabilities of genomic breeding values predicted using the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect (relative weight of 0.20) were 0.3% higher than reliabilities from the simple GBLUP method (without a polygenic effect). The adjusted single-step blending and original single-step blending methods (relative weight of 0.20) had average reliabilities that were 2.1% and 1.8% higher than the simple GBLUP method  respectively.

However  the combined relationship matrix in a single-step method may need to be adjusted because marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices may not be on the same scale. The same may apply when a GBLUP model includes both genomic breeding values and residual polygenic effects. The objective of this study was to compare single-step blending methods and GBLUP methods with and without adjustment of the genomic relationship matrix for genomic prediction of 16 traits in the Nordic Holstein population. The data consisted of de-regressed proofs (DRP) for 5 214 genotyped and 9 374 non-genotyped bulls. The bulls were divided into a training and a validation population by birth date  October 1  2001. Five approaches for genomic prediction were used: 1) a simple GBLUP method  2) a GBLUP method with a polygenic effect  3) an adjusted GBLUP method with a polygenic effect  4) a single-step blending method  and 5) an adjusted single-step blending method. In the adjusted GBLUP and single-step methods  the genomic relationship matrix was adjusted for the difference of scale between the genomic and the pedigree relationship matrices. A set of weights on the pedigree relationship matrix (ranging from 0.05 to 0.40) was used to build the combined relationship matrix in the single-step blending method and the GBLUP method with a polygenetic effect. Averaged over the 16 traits  reliabilities of genomic breeding values predicted using the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect (relative weight of 0.20) were 0.3% higher than reliabilities from the simple GBLUP method (without a polygenic effect). The adjusted single-step blending and original single-step blending methods (relative weight of 0.20) had average reliabilities that were 2.1% and 1.8% higher than the simple GBLUP method  respectively. In addition  the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect led to less bias of genomic predictions than the simple GBLUP method  and both single-step blending methods yielded less bias of predictions than all GBLUP methods. The single-step blending method is an appealing approach for practical genomic prediction in dairy cattle. Genomic prediction from the single-step blending method can be improved by adjusting the scale of the genomic relationship matrix. Selection based on dense markers across the genome [] has become an important component of dairy cattle breeding programs [–]. The accuracy of genomic prediction relies on the amount of information used to derive the prediction equation. In many genomic selection programs  thousands of bulls which have been progeny tested over the last decades have been genotyped and are used as national reference populations. These have been extended by sharing data across countries to include much more information  such as the North American cooperation []  the EuroGenomics project []  and the joint Brown Swiss project []. Generally  genomic predictions are based on the data of all genotyped animals. However  in practice  not all individuals can be genotyped. To make use of as much information as possible for genetic evaluation  it is appealing to blend the genomic predicted breeding value and the traditional estimated breeding values (EBV) into genomically enhanced breeding values (GEBV) or to perform genomic prediction using all information available simultaneously. Many studies have shown that a linear model which assumes that effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are normally distributed with equal variance performs as well as variable selection models for most traits in dairy cattle [  ]. Because such BLUP models are simple and have low computational requirements  they have become popular approaches for practical genomic prediction. De-regressed proofs (DRP) [  ] are generally used as the response variable for genomic prediction since they can be easily derived from the EBV that are usually available. Several blending strategies  including multi-step and single-step approaches  have been proposed to estimate GEBV [    –]. The core of a single-step procedure is the integration of the marker-based relationship matrix into the pedigree-based relationship matrix such that information of genotyped and non-genotyped animals is used simultaneously [–]. Previous study by Su et al. [] reported that a single-step procedure resulted in more accurate GEBV than a multi-step procedure. Some studies [–  ] have reported that the combined relationship matrix in a single-step method may need to be adjusted because the marker- and pedigree-based relationship matrices may not be on the same scale  and different methods to adjust for this have been proposed [–]. These adjustments may also benefit genomic prediction using other models that integrate marker- and pedigree-based relationship matrices  such as a GBLUP model with a polygenic effect. The purpose of this study was to compare single-step blending and GBLUP methods with and without adjustment of the genomic relationship matrix for genomic prediction of 16 traits in the Nordic Holstein population. De-regressed proofs were used as response variables in both GBLUP and the single-step blending methods. Data consisted of 5 214 genotyped bulls born between 1974 and 2008 and 9 374 non-genotyped bulls born between 1950 and 2008. The bulls were divided into a training and a validation population by birth date  October 1  2001. Thus  the training data contained 3 045 genotyped and 8 822 non-genotyped bulls born before this date  and the validation data contained 2 169 genotyped bulls born after this date. Non-genotyped bulls born after October 1  2001 were not used in training or validation. For the GBLUP methods described below  the training data only included the 3 045 genotyped animals. All 16 traits (sub-indices) in the Nordic Total Merit index were assessed  including yield  conformation  fertility  and health traits. For each trait  the DRP with reliability less than 0.20 were excluded from the training and the validation data. This removed 1.3%  2.8% and 3.2% of DRP for birth index  fertility and health  respectively  and less than 0.5% for the other traits. The numbers of individuals in the training and validation datasets differed between traits (Table<U+2009>). Marker genotypes were obtained using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  SanDiego  CA). The final marker data included 48 073 SNPs for 5 214 bulls after removing SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.01 and locus average GenCall score less than 0.60. De-regressed proofs (DRP) were used as response variables for genomic prediction in all approaches. Based on EBV data of 14 588 progeny-tested bulls and pedigree data of 42 144 animals  the de-regression was carried out by applying the iterative procedure described in [  ] using the MiX99 package [] and with the heritabilities shown in Table<U+2009>  which were those used in Nordic cattle routine genetic evaluation. A detailed description of the Nordic cattle genetic evaluation and standardized procedures of EBV is given in . Three GBLUP and two single-step blending methods were used. All analyses were performed with the DMU package [  ]  for estimating both the variance components and breeding values. The basic GBLUP method [  ] used to predict direct genomic breeding values (DGV) was: where  is the data vector of DRP of genotyped bulls  µ is the overall mean   is a vector of ones   is a design matrix that allocates records to breeding values   is a vector of DGV to be estimated  and  is a vector of residuals. It was assumed that  where  is the additive genetic variance  and  is the marker-based genomic relationship matrix [  ]. Allele frequencies used to construct  were estimated from the observed genotype data. Random residuals were assumed such that  where  is the residual variance and  is a diagonal matrix with elements . The weights w account for heterogeneous residual variances due to differences in reliabilities of DRP. They were defined as   where  is the reliability of DRP. The reliability was calculated as   where EDC is effective daughter contribution  and . To avoid possible problems caused by extreme weight values  reliabilities larger than 0.98 were set to 0.98. where  is the vector of residual polygenic effects that are not captured by the SNP. Here  we used an equivalent approach. Let     where  is the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Define  and   then  and   such that  where <U+03C9> is the ratio of residual polygenic to total additive genetic variance. Thus  the above model is equivalent to It was assumed that   where  is a combined relationship matrix  . The estimates of  were defined as DGV to distinguish from the simple GBLUP and the single-step blending methods. The model was the same as the above GBLUP method with a polygenic effect but  was adjusted to be on the same scale as . Then  the combined relationship matrix was   where * is the adjusted genomic relationship matrix The adjustment of  is described below. The original single-step blending method [    ] uses information from genotyped and non-genotyped individuals simultaneously by combining the genomic relationship matrix  with the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix   using the following model: where  is the vector of DRP for both genotyped and non-genotyped bulls   is a vector of ones   is a design matrix  and  is the vector of additive genetic effects  which are the sum of the genomic and the residual polygenic effects. It was assumed that   where matrix  is the modified genetic relationship matrix that combines pedigree-based relationship information [  ]: where  is the sub-matrix of the pedigree-based relationship matrix () for genotyped animals   is the sub-matrix of  for non-genotyped animals   (or ) is the sub-matrix of  for relationships between genotyped and non-genotyped animals  and   where <U+03C9> is a weight (within the range from 0.05 to 0.40 in this study). The  matrix used in the single-step blending was the same as in the GBLUP method. The inverse of [  ] is In the adjusted single-step blending method  the  matrix was adjusted for the difference between the original genomic relationship matrix and pedigree relationship matrix ()  as proposed by previous studies [  ]. The  matrix was adjusted using two parameters a and ß []  i.e.  which were derived from the following equations: Matrix  was then used to replace  to construct the combined relationship matrix in the single-step blending method. The weights <U+03C9> ranging from 0.05 to 0.40 were used to construct  and  for the single-step blending methods and for the GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect. The reliabilities of genomic predictions were measured as squared correlations between the predicted breeding values and DRP for bulls in the validation data  divided by the average reliability of the DRP in validation data. A Hotelling-Williams t-test was used to test the difference between the validation correlations obtained from these five prediction methods [  ]. Bias of genomic predictions was measured as the regression of DRP on the genomic predictions []. Genomic predictions using the GBLUP method were improved when a polygenic effect was included (Tables<U+2009> and ). With a relative weight of 0.2 on the residual polygenic variance  the average reliability of genomic predictions for the 16 traits was 0.363  which was 0.3% points higher than the average reliability from the simple GBLUP. Moreover  the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect reduced bias of genomic predictions. Averaged over the 16 traits  the absolute deviation of the regression coefficient (DRP on genomic prediction) from 1 was 0.093 when using the GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect and 0.107 when using the simple GBLUP method. The GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect slightly reduced also bias in mean  as the intercept in the regression analysis was closer to 0  compared with the simple GBLUP. For the two GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect  adjustment of the genomic relationship matrix had no effect on predictive ability and bias. Table<U+2009> reports validation reliabilities of GEBV from the two single-step blending methods and DGV from the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect (the adjusted GBLUP method is shown as an example) for the 16 traits  with a relative weight <U+03C9><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20. The adjusted single-step blending led to the highest reliability of genomic predictions  followed by the original single-step blending  and the GBLUP method resulted in the lowest reliability. Reliabilities ranged from 0.206 to 0.503 (average 0.379) for the original single-step blending  from 0.206 to 0.503 (average 0.382) for the adjusted single-step blending  and from 0.183 to 0.481 (average 0.363) for the GBLUP method. In general  single-step blending was better than the GBLUP method and adjusted single-step blending was better than the original single-step blending  especially for production traits. On average  reliabilities of genomic breeding values predicted using the original single-step blending were 1.6 % higher than reliabilities from the adjusted GBLUP method  but 0.3% lower than reliabilities from the adjusted single-step blending. The regression coefficients (Table<U+2009>) ranged from 0.757 to 1.138 (average absolute deviation from 1 equal to 0.084) for the original single-step blending  from 0.760 to 1.148 (average absolute deviation 0.080) for the adjusted single-step blending  and from 0.752 to 1.176 (average absolute deviation 0.093) for the adjusted GBLUP method. Predictions from the single-step blending methods appeared to have less bias than predictions from GBLUP  and predictions from the adjusted single-step blending has slightly less bias than predictions from the original single-step blending method. In addition  the two single-step blending methods led to smaller absolute deviation of the intercept from 0 than the adjusted GBLUP method  indicating less bias in mean. Table<U+2009> presents differences between groups of the top 300 bulls based on predictions from the different methods. For all 16 traits  more than 9% of the top 300 bulls based on the adjusted GBLUP method differed from the top 300 bulls based on the two single-step blending methods. Differences between the two single-step blending methods were small  except for production traits  which was in agreement with the small differences in reliabilities of GEBV from the two single-step blending methods. In order to test the effect of different weighting factors <U+03C9> in forming  and   eight values of <U+03C9> between 0.05 and 0.40 were used for the two single-step blending methods and the two GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect. On average  reliabilities varied from 0.356 to 0.363 over the eight scenarios for the two GBLUP methods  from 0.372 to 0.379 for the original single-step blending  and from 0.374 to 0.382 for the adjusted single-step blending (Figure ). The highest mean reliability was obtained when using a weight of 0.15 or 0.20 for the four methods. The mean absolute deviation of the regression coefficient from 1 varied from 0.080 to 0.104 for the two GBLUP methods  from 0.074 to 0.098 for original single-step blending and from 0.072 to 0.091 for adjusted single-step blending (Figure ). Mean of absolute deviations tended to decrease with increasing weights.  GBLUP with a polygenic effect (GBLUP-AG)  adjusted GBLUP with a polygenic effect (GBLUP-AG)  original single-step blending (Single-ori)  and adjusted single-step blending (Single-adj).  GBLUP with a polygenic effect (GBLUP-AG)  adjusted GBLUP with a polygenic effect (GBLUP-AG)  original single-step blending (Single-ori)  and adjusted single-step blending (Single-adj). This study applied three GBLUP and two single-step blending methods for genomic prediction in Nordic Holsteins. Predictive abilities of the five methods were compared in terms of reliability and bias. Results indicated that both the original single-step blending and the adjusted single-step blending were more accurate than the three GBLUP methods because the two single-step blending approaches used much more information to predict breeding values. Similar results were reported by Su et al. [] for the Nordic Red population. In the current study  the size of the training dataset for the single-step blending methods was almost three times as large as that for the three GBLUP methods (Table<U+2009>) since DRP of the non-genotyped animals also provided information through a combined relationship matrix. Including pedigree information may also improve genomic predictions because the SNP may not account for all additive genetic variance. As shown in this study  including a residual polygenic effect in the GBLUP methods led to slightly higher reliability of genomic predictions. A regression coefficient of DRP on genomic predictions less than 1 indicates overestimation of the variance of genomic predictions (inflation)  while a coefficient larger than 1 indicates underestimation (deflation). The two single-step blending methods led to less bias than the three GBLUP methods  and the two GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect resulted in less bias than the simple GBLUP method without a polygenic effect. The problem of inflation of genomic predictions is critical in practice [–] as it can give an unfair advantage to juvenile over older progeny test bulls []. Aguilar et al. [] showed that this bias was reduced by weighting the  and  matrices  and Liu et al. [] found that including a polygenic effect in a GBLUP model (random regressions on SNP genotypes) led to less bias in genomic predictions. The present study showed that the weighting factor had an effect on the bias of genomic predictions for all traits in the single-step blending approaches and the GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect. A weight of 0.40 resulted in the smallest minimum absolute deviation from 1 for the regression of GEBV or DGV on DRP  averaged over the 16 traits  but a loss of reliability around 0.8%  compared to a weight of 0.20  which led to highest average reliability and an acceptable average absolute deviation of regression coefficient from 1 (Figure  ). The adjusted single-step blending method resulted in less bias than the original single-step blending for all settings of the weight factor. In a simulation study  Vitezica et al. [] also found that the single-step method was less biased and more accurate when the genomic relationship matrix was adjusted by a constant. Using chicken data  Chen et al. [] showed that unbiased evaluations can be obtained by adding a constant to the  matrix that is based on current allele frequencies and suggested that the optimal  has average of diagonal and off-diagonal elements close to those of . Forni et al. [] also showed that re-scaling the  matrix is a reasonable solution to avoid inflation in pig data. However  in the present study  the adjusted  matrix did not improve genomic predictions in the GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect. This suggests that  based on the present data  adjustment of  has little effect on genomic prediction when only genotyped animals are used  but may be important in other data where there is a large difference in scale between  and . The results from the present study indicate that increasing the weighting factor (0.40) reduces bias and that weighting factors around 0.15 to 0.20 give the highest reliability but the optimal weighting factors differed between traits. Similarly  Liu et al. [] observed that the optimal residual polygenic variance in a GBLUP model (random regressions on SNP genotypes) with a polygenic effect appears to differ among traits. Therefore  trait-specific weighting factors should be used in the single-step blending methods and the GBLUP methods with a polygenic effect. In the near future  both bulls and heifers may be pre-selected based on genomic EBV. This will lead to biased predictions of breeding values in both conventional and genomic evaluation procedures. In such situations  appropriate methods to correct the bias of predictions are required []. Christensen et al. [] compared the adjusted and original single-step blending methods on pig data. In their study  the improvement of prediction reliabilities by adjustment of  matrix is much larger  compared with the results from the current study. This may be because there was more inbreeding in the pig data  which resulted in average values of the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of  equal to 1.145 and 0.298  and estimates of ß and a equal to 0.895 and 0.298  respectively. In the present study  the averages of the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of were 1.060 and 0.085  and estimates of ß and a were 0.976 and 0.085  i.e. closer to one and zero  respectively. This means that the original  matrix was less adjusted in this study compared to the study on pig data by Christensen et al. []. The single-step blending methods can increase reliability and reduce bias of genomic predictions. The adjusted single-step blending method performed slightly better than the original single-step blending method  both with respect to reliability and bias of genomic predictions. The weighting factor used in these single-step blending methods had a small effect on reliability of genomic prediction but an important effect on bias.

We developed a software program that takes into account the genetic and reproductive biology specific to the honey bee and that can be used to constitute a genomic dataset compatible with the simulation studies necessary to optimize breeding programs. The source code together with an instruction file is freely accessible at  The honey bee is an economically important species that serves as a major pollinator of wild plants and agricultural crops. Over the past years  a decline of honey bee populations has been reported [–] mainly caused by infestation with an ecto-parasitic mite (). Selective breeding of resistant bees can help prevent losses due to the parasite  but it requires that a robust breeding program and genetic evaluation are implemented. Until now  the approach used in honey bee is a traditional breeding program based on the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) relying on pedigree data []. Recently  genomic selection strategies based on molecular marker data have emerged as a promising approach []. Marker-based selection has been widely tested in several species either with simulated datasets e.g. [  ] or with real datasets e.g. [–] but  to date  not in honey bee. Since simulation studies require molecular genetic and pedigree datasets to ascertain selection methods  our primary aim was to develop a software program capable of producing a dataset for a base population in the honey bee and which could be used to implement marker-based selection procedures. A base population is used as a starting point for simulation studies. It is composed of individuals in a pedigree for which no ancestral information is available  and is assumed to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The second goal of our software program was to provide the user with the possibility to investigate the effect of parameters like mutation rate  density of markers and number of individuals on the extent of LD in a population. Honey bee has specific genetic and reproductive characteristics  such as a high recombination rate  haplo-diploid sex determination  arrhenotoky and polyandry  which require appropriate software for modeling. The features of our software program and the modeling of population structure  genome and evolutionary processes are described below. In order to simulate a dataset according to the requirements specific to honey bee populations  it is necessary to design a software program that will allow to input: (1) number of generations  (2) number of sire queens  (3) number of dam queens  (4) number of marker loci  (5) forward and backward mutation rates  (6) minor allele frequencies and (7) number of marker loci to be selected as SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) on the basis of minor allele frequency. The MATLAB source code and an instruction file on how to use the software program can be found on its website []. A population can be structured according to the provided input. The input data include number of sire queens and dam queens (with a ratio of 10:1)  number of generations and total number of marker loci to be simulated (assumed to be bi-allelic). In order to model the haploid drones  a sire queen is defined as representing a drone-producing colony. Two matrices with a size equal to number of individuals by number of marker loci represent the genome of diploid sire queens and dam queens  respectively. The population size is kept constant in every generation according to the Fisher-Wright population model. Furthermore  all simulated generations are non-overlapping. A diploid genome  consisting of 16 linkage groups  is simulated for sire and dam queens. The length of each chromosome is simulated according to the actual length of all honey bee chromosomes. The number of marker loci () to be simulated along the genome can be provided as input. In the software program  the number of marker loci to be distributed per chromosome   (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 <U+2009>2 <U+2009>.....16)  is based on the actual proportion of SNP loci present on each honey bee chromosome and is computed using the following formula: where  is equal to the actual ratio between number of SNP loci on the  chromosome and total number of SNP loci in the honey bee genome. Positions of all the loci on all chromosomes are sampled from a uniform distribution. The number of SNP loci per chromosome and the length of all 16 chromosomes were obtained from the honey bee genome database [  ] as shown in Table . To simulate an evolutionary process  recombination and mutation are implemented during the process of gamete formation in every generation. Multiple mating is modeled in the parental generations. The processes are briefly described below. Recombination is the exchange of chromosomal segments between paternal and maternal chromosomes and is implemented as follows. The recombination probability () between two adjacent loci on a chromosome is calculated from the Haldane mapping function []  which is the most widely used mapping function. It is based on the assumption that crossovers in any given chromosomal segment follow a Poisson distribution  with no interference between crossovers. In the software program  the recombination probability is calculated using the following expression: where exp denotes the exponential function and || stands for the absolute value of the map distance between adjacent loci. The Haldane mapping function requires that distances are expressed in Morgan units  therefore  distances between adjacent loci are converted from base-pairs to Morgan using the reported recombination rate of 19 cM/Mb [  ]. Mutation is implemented in our software program to create polymorphisms. All loci in all individuals belonging to generation zero have a single allele coded as 1. We model both forward and backward mutations  allowing each locus to mutate from allele 1 to allele 2 and from allele 2 to allele 1. The required rates of forward and backward mutations can be specified in the input as mutation rates per locus per gamete per generation. The advantage of modeling a bi-directional mutation is that different values of forward and backward mutation rates can be chosen. Setting the backward mutation rate to zero will result in an infinite site model of mutation [] where each locus can only mutate once in the entire generation and mutation will result in the formation of allele 2. The infinite site model of mutation can be useful when simulating an extremely high initial marker density with a low mutation rate and larger number of generations as shown in studies by Sorrenson and Meuwissen [] and Calus et al. []  where 1 million and 300 000 marker loci were simulated for a genome of size 10 M and 3 M  respectively. Figure  describes the general mating scheme followed during the simulation. Polyandry  commonly referred to as multiple mating  is a phenomenon observed in honey bee whereby a queen mates with multiple drones (average of 10 to 20 drones). To model this situation in our software program  a dam queen and a group of 10 sire queens (a sire queen represents a drone-producing colony) are assumed as mating partners. To form groups  all sire queens are randomly permuted and thereafter divided into groups consisting of 10 sire queens.  m<U+2009>=<U+2009>total number of dam queens; since there is a 1:10 ratio between number of dams and sires  the number of sire queens is “mx10”; in every generation  all sire queens are randomly permuted and grouped; each group consists of 10 sire queens; a dam queen and a group of sire queens are the mating partners; all generations are non-overlapping and the population size is kept constant across generations. A detailed mating scheme  showing how gametes from a dam queen are combined with the drones from a group of sire queens is illustrated in Figure . A dam queen generates a total of 11 gametes  of which 10 give rise to sire queens and one a dam queen in the next generation. Since a gamete produced by a sire queen is regarded as a drone  it is assumed to occur in multiple copies. One of the 10 sire queens of a group contributes a drone  which combines with a gamete from the dam queen to produce a new dam queen for the next generation. In addition to the drone generated for the formation of a dam queen  each of the 10 sire queens of a group produces one drone  thus a group contributes a total of 11 drones. During the formation of a sire queen  all 11 drones of a group have an equal probability to be drawn as a gamete. Since drones in a set are sampled with replacement  the resulting progenies are related as super-sibs (coefficient of relatedness<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.75)  full-sibs (coefficient of relatedness<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5) or half-sibs (coefficient of relatedness<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25).  The resulting offspring consist of one dam queen and 10 sire queens; all drones are sampled with replacement which models the phenomenon of producing multiple copies of identical gametes by a drone. The software program provides statistics for allele frequency  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  minor allele frequency and LD  which allow inferences to be made about an evolving population. Allele frequency data is a requisite for any population; hence the software program creates an output with allele frequencies for all loci in the base population along with the output for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and minor allele frequency  which are the usual criteria to evaluate marker loci informativeness. Most studies based on genome-wide marker data rely on the assumption that a marker and the locus affecting the trait are in LD  therefore  in the last generation  the average LD value is calculated for selected SNP with the highest minor allele frequency. In addition  generation-wise LD values for all simulated marker loci pairs are calculated and plotted on a graph. As a measure of LD  we used [  ] which was calculated as follows: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>()()<U+2009>-<U+2009>()() and ()  ()  ()  ()  ()  ()  ()  () are observed frequencies of haplotypes AB  AB  AB  AB and of alleles A  A  B  B respectively in the population. The software program developed in this study produces the following output: (1) the position of marker loci in base-pairs on each chromosome  (2) genotypes of all simulated individuals in the last generation  which can be used as a base population in further studies  (3) average r values of LD for all simulated marker loci pair for every simulated generation as a plot as well as a text file  (4) average r value of LD for the selected SNP with the highest minor allele frequency in the last generation  (5) allele frequencies for all loci in the base generation  (6) <U+03C7> statistics for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all loci in the base generation and (7) a list of marker loci with a minor allele frequency smaller than or equal to the input value. To provide an illustration  we performed a run as example with the following input parameters: Number of generations: 2000 Number of sire and dam queens: two population sizes were simulated; the first one consisted of 500 sire and 50 dam queens and the second one of 200 sire and 20 dam queens. Total number of marker loci: 100 000 Number of marker loci to be selected as SNP: 44 000 Forward and backward mutation rates: 0.0025 Minor allele frequency: 0.05 The values of mutation rate  recombination rate  marker density and effective population size determine both the level of LD in a population and the number of generations required to reach a certain value of LD. For the dataset example  the chosen mutation rate was set at 0.0025  a value similar to that used by Meuwissen et al. []  allowing a high probability of polymorphic marker loci. Information on the level of recombination and on the effective population size () in honey bee was obtained from Beye et al. [] and Estoup et al. []  respectively. All data and result files for this example can be found at the project home page []. In this paper  we only present the output graph (Figure ) showing the establishment of LD for the simulated dataset with 220 queens. The graph shows the average LD reached in each generation and was obtained by calculating the average of LD value between all simulated pair of marker loci across the genome  not preselected on the basis of minor allele frequency.  Simulation was performed for 2000 generations with a forward and backward mutation rate of 0.0025 for 100 000 marker loci and 220 colonies (20 dam queens and 200 sire queens); with the parameter values chosen here  a stable LD is reached after random mating. In addition  we compared the expected average LD to the achieved average LD for 44 000 loci with the highest minor allele frequencies  which were chosen as SNP. The expected average LD in a population was calculated as follows []: where c is the recombination fraction between adjacent loci and  is the effective population size. Since the total size of the simulated genome was 219 629 612 base-pairs (Table ) and the approximate recombination rate was taken as 19 cM/Mb [  ]  the size of the simulated genome was 41.73 M. Thus  for a genome of 41.73 M  c was approximately 0.001 for 44 000 SNP. The honey bee population has a wide range of effective population sizes []; therefore  we simulated two scenarios  one with 220 queens and other with 550 queens  respectively. The effective population size in the honey bee was calculated using the following expression for a haplo-diploid population [  ]: where  is the number of queens (which is equal to the number of colonies since each colony is headed by a single queen) and  is the number of males. In the simulation  we assume that each queen is inseminated by 11 drones  therefore <U+2009>=<U+2009>11. Thus  with 220 and 550 colonies   was approximately 473 and 1184  respectively. With <U+2009>=<U+2009>473  the expected LD was 0.24 and the achieved LD was 0.23. Similarly  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>1184  the expected and achieved LD were equal to 0.14 and 0.11  respectively. These values show that our software program is able to model the honey bee population with good accuracy. Creating a dataset for a base population is a prerequisite for any simulation study  but it can be time consuming and it requires testing of optimum parameters. In most of the available software used to simulate populations []  base population simulation is the preliminary stage  and is done by allowing the population to evolve through a burn-in period till the population reaches equilibrium from a random or uniform initial state. In our software program  all individuals in the starting generation are assumed to be unrelated. To establish LD  random mating is performed for the required number of generations and the final generation  which is in mutation-drift equilibrium  is taken as the base population. In genomic selection studies  a base population is the common starting point from which a population evolves further according to specific study requirements. To the best of our knowledge  this is the first software program that deals with evolutionary aspects in honey bee. It aims at providing an impetus to simulation studies in honey bee. It is an important initiative and we are developing strategies to simulate other honey bee datasets that could be used to implement genomic selection and furthermore to extend the study with a real genotyping dataset obtained from the SNP assay developed for honey bee []. The code is written in MATLAB but can be easily adapted to the open source version Octave. Our software program can construct a base population in LD by simulating a random mating honey bee population given some input population parameters. The statistics relevant to a population such as allele frequency  r value for LD and data for marker sorting according to minor allele frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are provided in output files. The software program is relevant for research requiring a simulated molecular genetic honey bee dataset such as studies aiming at optimizing honey bee breeding programs.

An algorithm that imputes alleles or allele probabilities for all animals in the pedigree and for all genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) provides a framework to combine all pedigree  genomic  and phenotypic information into a single-stage genomic evaluation. An algorithm was developed for imputation of genotypes in pedigreed populations that allows imputation for completely ungenotyped animals and for low-density genotyped animals  accommodates a wide variety of pedigree structures for genotyped animals  imputes unmapped SNP  and works for large datasets. The method involves simple phasing rules  long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation and segregation analysis. Imputation accuracy was high and computational cost was feasible for datasets with pedigrees of up to 25 000 animals. The resulting single-stage genomic evaluation increased the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values compared to a scenario in which phenotypes on relatives that were not genotyped were ignored. The developed imputation algorithm and software and the resulting single-stage genomic evaluation method provide powerful new ways to exploit imputation and to obtain more accurate genetic evaluations. Genome-wide association studies and genetic evaluation systems using genomic information require large numbers of individuals that are both intensively phenotyped and densely genotyped for SNP across the genome to give reliable results. Dense SNP genotyping of the required number of individuals is still expensive. Therefore  research effort has focused on developing methods and strategies to impute genotypes from low-density platforms that are cheaper and easier to obtain. These imputation methods can be divided into two main categories  those that use linkage disequilibrium information (e.g. fastPHASE []; MaCH []; Beagle []; IMPUTE2 []) and those that use pedigree and linkage information e.g. [–]. Methods that use linkage disequilibrium information are suboptimal because they require at least some genotypes on each individual for which imputation is to be carried out. Some of the methods that use pedigree and linkage information are also less than optimal because they require all immediate ancestors to be densely genotyped. An optimal imputation strategy for practical application in breeding programs must (i) allow both ungenotyped and low-density genotyped animals to be imputed  (ii) be flexible with regard to which animals within the pedigree have high-density genotypes  (iii) use information from close and distant relatives and from close and distant SNP loci  (iv) function well in small and large datasets of moderately related individuals and (v) accurately impute genotypes for all animals in the pedigree for all SNP  including unmapped SNP. Single-stage genomic evaluations use all available pedigree  genomic  and phenotypic information in a single analysis to estimate breeding values. This can be achieved by using a relationship matrix that combines both pedigree and genomic information () Misztal et al. []). From an imputation perspective  SSMi has at least three potential problems. First  in its original definition  it combines two relationship matrices (pedigree and genomic) that have two different base populations definitions  although solutions for this have been proposed recently [  ]. Second  it can be thought of as a linear imputation method e.g. [] that ignores the particulate nature of allelic inheritance. Third  while it can give different SNP different weights in the prediction equation []  the implementation is usually by ‘GBLUP’ - genomic best linear unbiased prediction []  which does not use variable selection (of SNP effects)  such as method BayesB []. An imputation method that imputes genotypes for all animals in the pedigree for all SNP provides an alternative framework for single-stage genomic evaluations that avoids these problems. The first objective of this study was to develop a robust imputation method for pedigreed populations. The method involves simple phasing and imputation rules  long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation [  ] as implemented in AlphaPhase1.1 []  and segregation analysis []. It uses information from close and distant relatives and from close and distant SNP loci to impute genotypes for individuals for which genotype information may or may not be available  and for individuals which have close or distant relatives densely genotyped. A software package called AlphaImpute that implements the method has been made available. The second objective was to develop a single-stage genomic evaluation method ( standing for single-stage AlphaImpute) that is based on using the imputation method presented here to combine all pedigree  genomic  and phenotypic information and compare it to a method that ignores phenotypes for ungenotyped animals and to SSMi. The performance of AlphaImpute in terms of both accuracy and speed was evaluated using a dataset consisting of closely related pigs from a commercial breeding line and a multiple breed dairy cattle dataset and compared to IMPUTE2 []  a widely used software package. The performance of SSAI was evaluated within the pig dataset using the empirical accuracy of the resulting estimated breeding values. It was compared to SSMi for the complete data  and with an analysis that did not use phenotypes on ungenotyped animals. AlphaImpute combines simple phasing and imputation rules  long-range phasing  haplotype libraries  and segregation analysis to impute genotypes of all animals in a pedigree for all genotyped SNP. The program imputes alleles  when it has information to do this  and probabilities based on the algorithm of Kerr and Kinghorn []  when the information is incomplete using single locus information. Imputed genotypes are constructed as the sum of the alleles or allele probabilities. AlphaImpute proceeds by first separating out a set of animals that are genotyped at high-density. These animals have their SNP phased using long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation  generating haplotype libraries in the process []. Allele probabilities [] are calculated for all SNP for all animals in the pedigree and alleles are imputed when these probabilities are >0.99. This can be thought of as single-locus phasing. Once the single-locus phasing and the long-range phasing are completed  the haplotypes identified in the long-range phasing are matched to alleles phased by single-locus phasing. This matching step begins with parental and other ancestral haplotypes by processing the data from the oldest to the youngest individual in the pedigree. The second part of the matching step involves processing the haplotype libraries to see if the haplotypes that an animal carries exist in the library in animals that are not identified as ancestors within the available pedigree information. The haplotype libraries are updated with any new haplotypes that are identified during this process. These steps are iterated a number of times (user defined). Finally  using the updated dataset  which now includes a large number of imputed SNP  allele probabilities are re-calculated for all SNP for all animals in the pedigree. The complete algorithm is outlined in the Appendix. The performance of AlphaImpute was tested using two real datasets  a pig and a bovine dataset that had genotype information spread sparsely across multiple generations. In these datasets  some animals had multiple generations of high-density genotyped ancestors available  while for others only some or none of the ancestors had high-density genotypes. The pig dataset (courtesy of PIC) involved a pedigree comprising 6 473 individuals  of which 3 534 were genotyped on the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. Genotype information for chromosome 1 was used and after routine editing of the genotype data  4 221 SNP with known genome locations remained. This population came from a single PIC breeding line and consequently the individuals were moderately to highly related to each other. The dairy cattle dataset (courtesy of LIC) involved a pedigree comprising 24 017 individuals  of which 5 057 were genotyped on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. Genotype information for chromosome 1 was used and after routine editing of the genotype data  2 297 SNP with known genome locations remained. This population was multiple-breed in nature  containing Holsteins  Jerseys  and crossbreds. In the pig dataset  most female and male ancestors were genotyped at high-density while in the cattle dataset only male ancestors were genotyped at high-density in most cases. In both datasets no other genotyping was used other than the low-density genotyping of the testing individuals. The genotyped animals were divided into training and testing sets. The training set was genotyped at high-density (for all SNP)  while the testing sets had different proportions of their SNP masked and then imputed. In the pig dataset  the masked proportions were 99% ()  95% ()  90% ()  and 85% (). In the cattle dataset  the masked proportions were 99% ()  95% ()  90% ()  and 85% (). These densities were roughly equivalent to 500  2 500  5 000 and 7 500 genome-wide low-density SNP arrays. The SNP on the low-density platforms were chosen by identifying evenly spaced 5 SNP windows across the chromosome and then choosing the SNP with the highest minor allele frequency from each window. For the pig data  the testing set comprised the 509 most recently born animals that were genotyped  which reflects a scenario where candidates for selection are genotyped at low density. For the cattle data  the testing set comprised 626 randomly selected individuals across generations that had both parents known in the pedigree but not necessarily genotyped. The accuracy of imputation of unmapped SNP was tested using the same data structures by running the program with a qualifier that does not invoke the long-range phasing and haplotype imputation steps. Therefore the only imputation carried out was based on simple single locus phasing and imputation rules and the segregation analysis procedures of Kerr and Kinghorn []. This study used pre-existing data sets that were recorded independently of this study  therefore no ethical approval was required. The performance of AlphaImpute was compared to that of the software IMPUTE2 (Howie et al. []; Department of Statistics  University of Oxford  UK). IMPUTE2 was used with its default settings  and an effective population size of 1 000 was assumed. IMPUTE2 uses linkage disequilibrium information to perform imputation  requires each individual to be imputed to have some SNP genotypes and does not use pedigree information. Therefore  IMPUTE2 does not impute genotypes for ungenotyped animals in the pedigree. IMPUTE2 is a hidden-Markov model based pedigree-free imputation approach with methodological similarities to Beagle  MaCH  and fastPHASE  which have been compared to each other in several studies [    ]. Generally speaking  they give similar results but Marchini and Howie [] showed a slight advantage for IMPUTE2. Accuracy of imputation was measured as the correlation between true genotype with imputed genotype or genotype probability for reasons outlined in []. AlphaImpute can also impute phased alleles or provide allele probabilities for animals in the pedigree that have low-density genotypes or no genotypes. The proportion of paternal or maternal phased alleles that was called without ambiguity (i.e. alleles rather than allele probabilities were called because haplotypes could be resolved unambiguously) was also explored. For this purpose  animals in the testing set were divided into six categories depending on their pattern of relationship to their most recent densely genotyped ancestors. The categories were: both parents genotyped (); sire and maternal grandsire (); dam and paternal grandsire (); sire only (); dam only (); and other relatives (). The numbers of animals in each category are given in Table  for the pig dataset and Table  for the cattle dataset. Single-stage genomic evaluations use all available pedigree  genomic  and phenotypic information in a single analysis to estimate breeding values []. SSAI uses AlphaImpute to generate imputed or observed genotypes for all animals in a pedigree for all genotyped SNP. These genotypes can be fitted in a genomic prediction model via GBLUP [] or a Bayesian model such as BayesB []. This facilitates the inclusion of the phenotypes of all animals in the pedigree in the breeding value estimation model  including those of animals that are not genotyped. The performance of SSAI was evaluated in the pig dataset using three different growth and composition traits with heritabilities ranging from 0.38 to 0.62. This data was from the same pedigree as described previously but used SNP on all chromosomes rather than just chromosome 1. After routine editing of SNP  52 843 SNP remained  of which 43 949 SNP were mapped to the 18 autosomal chromosomes and 8 894 SNP were unmapped. Unlike in the imputation scenarios described in the previous section  for the testing of SSAI  genotyped animals were only genotyped at high-density. The data were divided into a training and a validation set. The validation set comprised the same 509 genotyped animals from the most recent generation of the pedigree that were used for testing the imputation accuracy as described previously. These validation animals also had progeny test EBV () and accuracies from single-trait BLUP evaluations. The models for estimating ptEBV used the full PIC pedigree and all data included in a typical production run for each trait but no genomic information and also the phenotypes on the validation animals or their progeny were excluded. The mean accuracy of the ptEBV for the validation animals for each trait is given in Table . Two different training sets were used. In scenario 1 ()  only the phenotypes of the 3 025 genotyped animals that were not part of the validation population were used to train the prediction equation. In scenario 2 ()  the phenotypes of the 3 025 genotyped animals that were not part of the validation population and the phenotypes of the 2 939 other animals in the pedigree that were not genotyped were used to train the prediction equation. Not all animals in the training population had phenotypes for all traits and the numbers of phenotypes included in the analysis for SC1 and SC2 for each trait are given in Table . In order to evaluate the performance of SSAI  genomic estimated breeding values (gEBV) were estimated for SC1 using the Bayesian model BayesBFast [] implemented in AlphaBayes []. For SC2  gEBV were estimated using SSAI and SSMi. For SC2  SSAI was applied by first using AlphaImpute to generate imputed genotypes and gEBV were then estimated by BayesBFast. AlphaBayes was chosen because it can include real numbers in its design matrix for the SNP. This is important because  when there is insufficient information to fully impute an allele (i.e. call the allele as a 0 or a 1) in the resulting genotypes  the sum of the allele probabilities generated by AlphaImpute are real numbers between 0 and 2  rather than the more usual 0  1  or 2 integers used for coding genotypes. An alternative Bayesian genomic selection software package that rounds probabilities to integers was also tested and did not perform as well. For SC2  SSMi was implemented as described by Aguilar et al. []  using BLUPF90. Genotypes imputed with AlphaImpute had very high accuracy across all categories of animals in both datasets and accuracies were greater than with IMPUTE2 (Tables  and ). The higher accuracy of AlphaImpute over IMPUTE2 increased with reducing density of the low-density panels. For both AlphaImpute and IMPUTE2  the correlation between true and imputed genotypes increased with increasing relatedness of the animal to be imputed with its most recent genotyped ancestors and as its genotype density increased. Animals that had both parents genotyped had imputation accuracies of 0.98  0.99  1.00  1.00 for Pig99  Pig95  Pig90  and Pig85 for AlphaImpute  corresponding to accuracies of 0.77  0.92  0.96  and 0.96 for IMPUTE2. Animals that had both parents genotyped had accuracies of 0.97  0.99  0.99  and 1.00 respectively for Cat99  Cat95  Cat90  and Cat85 for AlphaImpute and of 0.64  0.92  0.94  and 0.95 for IMPUTE2. Sires and grandsires play an important role in commercial breeding programs and it may be economically feasible to use a genotyping strategy that involves genotyping these animals at high-density and candidates for selection at low-density. For the pig population  the SireMGS category of animals had imputation accuracies of 0.93  0.98  0.99  and 0.99 for Pig99  Pig95  Pig90  and Pig85 for AlphaImpute and of 0.80  0.92  0.94  and 0.96 for IMPUTE2. For the cattle population  the SireMGS category of animals had accuracies of imputation of 0.87  0.97  0.98  and 0.98 for Cat99  Cat95  Cat90  and Cat85 for AlphaImpute  and 0.60  0.91  0.95  and 0.96 for IMPUTE2. The distribution of imputation accuracies was skewed  with most animals having very high accuracy and a small number of individuals with much lower accuracy. The distribution of imputation accuracy is shown in Figure  for the Pig99 and Pig95 scenarios. For Pig99  14% of the animals had an imputation accuracy lower than 0.80 but it was never lower than 0.60. Imputation accuracy was very high for all animals that had both parents genotyped (Figure ). Problems tended to arise for animals with no close ancestors genotyped (i.e. “Other”)  especially for Pig99 (Figure ).                                                          Animals in the testing set were divided into six categories depending on their pattern of relationship to their most recent densely genotyped ancestors; the categories were: both parents genotyped (BothParents); sire and maternal grandsire (SireMGS); dam and paternal grandsire (DamPGS); sire only (Sire); dam only (Dam); and other relatives (Other). The relationship between imputation accuracy and the minimum % paternal or maternal alleles called without ambiguity is shown in Figure . Animals with less than 90% of their alleles called without ambiguity tended to have a lower accuracy  suggesting that a threshold could be used to give a warning about the quality of imputation for animals that are likely to have large numbers of errors or that have low relationships to animals with high-density genotypes and  hence  little information for imputation. Figures  and  show the distribution of the % alleles called without ambiguity. This % was in line with expectations given the category that an animal belonged to. For example  for individuals for which only dams were genotyped (category )  the % of maternal alleles imputed was high.  () Paternal Pig99  () Maternal Pig99  () Paternal Pig95  () Maternal Pig95.  () Paternal Pig99  () Maternal Pig99  () Paternal Pig95  () Maternal Pig95.  () Paternal Pig99  () Maternal Pig99  () Paternal Pig95  () Maternal Pig95. Animals in the testing set were divided into six categories depending on their pattern of relationship to their most recent densely genotyped ancestors; the categories were: both parents genotyped (BothParents); sire and maternal grandsire (SireMGS); dam and paternal grandsire (DamPGS); sire only (Sire); dam only (Dam); and other relatives (Other). Imputation accuracy for unmapped SNP was lower than for mapped SNP  with accuracies ranging from 0.73 to 0.83 for the pig dataset (Table ) and 0.82 to 0.85 for the dairy cattle dataset (Table ). Within each dataset  the trend for increasing imputation accuracy with increasing levels of genotyping of immediate ancestors (i.e. parents and grandparents) that was observed for mapped SNP  was also observed for unmapped SNP. Imputation of unmapped SNP is based on single-locus phasing and imputation and segregation analysis and therefore gives an indication as to the power of this component for the purposes of imputation in comparison to the other components  which make explicit use of haplotypes. AlphaImpute has a number of options to increase its computational efficiency. When using the basic option  which performs long-range phasing and then does the imputation  it took 18 hours to carry out the imputation for the whole genome (i.e. the genotyped SNP on all 18 autosomes and the unmapped SNP) for the pig dataset on a Linux server with 16 processors and 96<U+2009>GB of RAM (the RAM was not needed because memory requirements are not large). Applying the update option that uses previously phased data and therefore does not require the long-range phasing step to be re-run  decreased the computation time to six hours. The use of additional phenotype information on ungenotyped relatives in the pedigree resulted in gEBV with higher accuracy than ignoring this information (Table ). For trait 2 and trait 3  the accuracy of SC2-SSAI was 0.51 and 0.60  while for SC1 it was 0.39. For trait 1  there was no difference in the accuracy of gEBV. However  the accuracy was already high (0.51) for this trait. There was little overall difference in the accuracy of gEBV estimated from SC2-SSAI and SC2-SSMi. The computational time required for SSAI was greater than for SSMi because SSMi did not require AlphaImpute to be run. AlphaImpute is a flexible tool that imputes genotypes and alleles accurately and quickly for datasets with large pedigrees and large numbers of genotyped markers. When pedigree information is available  it is more robust to data structure in terms of density of the low-density genotyping platform and relationships among animals than the widely used software IMPUTE2. The performance of IMPUTE2 dramatically dropped off as the complexity of imputation increased (i.e. lower relationships to high density animals  lower density genotyping). In this study  imputation by AlphaImpute was very accurate for two datasets that had very different features. The pig dataset comprised a group of highly related animals from a single line  whereas the cattle dataset was multiple-breed in nature but with groups of highly related animals within each breed. The pig dataset had many more females than males genotyped  while in the cattle dataset  most of the genotyped animals were male. In the pig dataset  the animals to be imputed came from the most recent generation but in the cattle dataset they were selected at random from across the pedigree. AlphaImpute has also been used in several commercial datasets in multiple species (data not shown). Almost without exception it gives results that are at least as good as the results presented in this study. The computational time required for some of these other datasets illustrates the computational cost for a wide variety of scenarios. Imputing a whole genome in a poultry pedigree of 18 000 birds took similar amounts of time (Andreas Kranis  personal communication) to that required for the pig dataset in this study (circa 18 hours for the full algorithm). Imputing using the full algorithm on a small dataset of 1500 animals took two hours  while the update option reduced this to 15 minutes. Imputing one chromosome for a pedigree of 300 000 animals was not feasible (Jarmilla Johnston  personal communication) and may require parallelizing the imputation steps. The numbers of animals  the depth of the pedigree  and the relationships between genotyped animals affect computation time. Most imputation methods include two steps  a phasing step that involves resolving the haplotypes of high-density genotyped animals  and an imputation step that involves identifying which combination of these haplotypes match the low-density genotyped animals or ungenotyped animals that have allele probabilities. The phasing step is the most difficult component. AlphaImpute uses the long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation capacity of AlphaPhase1.1 [] to phase genotypes. This approach allows great flexibility in the pedigree structure among high-density genotyped animals. Multiple generations of high-density genotyped animals within constrained pedigree structures  such as having both parents being genotyped and large half sib family groups e.g. []  are not needed. The high-density genotyped animals can be scattered across a pedigree  or all be from the same generation or have no recent pedigree links. Unmapped SNP are imputed using the algorithm of Kerr and Kinghorn [] on a single-locus basis without using haplotype information. To tackle the problem of imputation  AlphaImpute combines long-range phasing  haplotype library imputation  simple phasing and imputation rules  and segregation analysis. It accesses and updates all this information by iterating across each gamete by accessing haplotypes of varying length and varying starting and ending positions  and passes down the pedigree  and through the haplotype libraries  eliminating ancestral or other haplotypes to accumulate evidence about the alleles that an individual carries at each SNP. It iterates this whole process a number of times before finally using segregation analysis [] to re-calculate probabilities for alleles that are still missing. In a previous attempt at imputation [  ]  all genotype probabilities (i.e. without a truncation at >0.99) were used to give a score for the match of each pair of haplotypes to the single-locus phasing information. This approach was impaired by the large number of haplotype pairs available and the resulting very high selection intensity for choosing the best-fitting haplotype pair with many haplotype combinations that have similar scores by random chance. Hence this approach was not used here. AlphaImpute provides phased alleles or allele probabilities for all genotyped SNP for all animals in the pedigree and resolves parent of origin of all alleles along each chromosome. Therefore  it can be used as an accurate haplotyping program when pedigree information is available. This allows interesting applications  such as modeling identity by descent probabilities for estimation of gEBV and QTL detection  or models where parent of origin is relevant  such as models with imprinting or crossbreeding effects []. AlphaImpute was designed for routine use in commercial breeding programs that carry out imputation as often as weekly. In these circumstances  the data flow may be such that large numbers of new low-density genotyped animals are added weekly while new high-density genotyped animals may only be added every few weeks or months. The program has an update option for such a situation. This update option involves only phasing the high-density animals whenever significant numbers of new high-density genotyped animals are added. This dramatically reduces the computation time for the weekly imputation runs. Further options to increase flexibility of use include an ability to read in phased alleles from other haplotyping software (e.g. half-sib family haplotyping software []) under the condition that the parental origin of each phased allele is known  and to select a subset of the high-density genotyped individuals to have their haplotypes resolved by long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation. For example  this subset could be the key sires in a pedigree or it could be a subset of animals that could not have their phase resolved by half-sib family haplotype phasing. Single-stage genomic evaluations [] are appealing because they use all available pedigree  genomic  and phenotypic data  and may avoid bias that could be introduced by two-stage genomic selection strategies []. Both SSAI and SSMi increased the accuracy of the gEBV compared to the base scenario SC1 but SSAI did not outperform SSMi. SSAI uses a single base for all animals in the pedigree  which is determined by the allele frequencies in the data. In contrast  with SSMi the base is not necessarily the same for genotyped and pedigreed animals (although alternatives have been proposed [  ] based on ideas of Powell et al. []). For the data analyzed here  the differences between these base populations may not have been large enough to result in dramatic differences in performance. The other difference between the methods was that SSMi used GBLUP  assuming equal variance at all SNP  whereas SSAI used a Bayesian method (BayesB) that allows for unequal variances for each SNP. BayesB has shown little benefit over GBLUP models if the traits are more polygenic in nature e.g. []. Finally  with millions of genotyped animals  SSMi may become computationally infeasible because it requires full inversion of two very dense matrices for the genotyped animals. SSAI does not require explicit inversion of any matrices and use of parallelized computation may make it a feasible method for datasets with millions of genotyped or imputed animals. Other solutions for single-stage methodology avoid the need for inversion are under development e.g. [Legarra A  Ducrocq V: Computational strategies for national integration of phenotypic  genomic and pedigree data in a single-step BLUP  submitted]. One weakness of SSAI may be that the genotypes imputed will not be very different from two times the allele frequency (i.e. no information for imputation) for animals that are very distantly related to animals that are genotyped  or when only a small proportion of the animals in a dataset have genotype information. Given the prevalence of genotyping candidates for selection in breeding programs incorporating genomics  these distantly related and ungenotyped animals would contribute little information to the estimated breeding value of candidates for selection. However  if their phenotypes are useful to increase contemporary group sizes or provide contrasts with which breeding values can be estimated  an optimal solution may be to use a joint SSAI/SSMi approach. The SSMi approach automatically accounts for the uncertainty in imputation  which increases with decreasing relationship between genotyped individuals and individuals that are to be imputed [  ]. Thus  there is a trade off between the more accurate imputation with SSAI and the more appropriate way of accounting for imputation error in SSMi. Both AlphaImpute and AlphaBayes were written in Fortran 95 and are available for research purposes from . A method and software package for phasing and imputation was developed for pedigreed populations and resulted in much better accuracies of imputed genotypes than IMPUTE2. The proposed method is fast  accurate  is robust to the pedigree structure of the genotyped animals  and can scale to large datasets. The data produced by the algorithm can be used directly in a single-stage genomic evaluation that combines all pedigree  genotypes and phenotypes in a single analysis. There are three primary steps in AlphaImpute  (1) segregation analysis to calculate allele probabilities for each locus of each animal in the pedigree  (2) long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation to phase all high-density genotyped individuals and create a haplotype library for each genomic region for the dataset  and  (3) impute missing alleles by matching the allelic probabilities to haplotypes in the haplotype library. This algorithm is designed to work for biallelic SNP. SNP genotypes are coded as 0  1  2  or 3  where 0 is a homozygote  1 heterozygote  2 the alternative homozygote  and 3 is a missing genotype. SNP alleles are coded as 0 or 1.  Using the algorithm of Kerr and Kinghorn (1996)  calculate allele probabilities for each locus of each individual in the pedigree  using all pedigree and genotype information (both high and low density).  Using the LRPHLI algorithm of Hickey et al. (2011) as implemented in AlphaPhase1.1  phase the individuals genotyped at high density a number of times and place the identified haplotypes in a library. LRPHLI divides chromosomes into cores of specified length (e.g. 100 SNP). By running LRPHLI a number of times  overlaps between cores are created and each locus is phased as part of different cores. This facilitates the identification of phasing error.  Impute missing alleles by matching alleles imputed at  to haplotypes phased at . This involves several sub-steps. These can be divided into major and minor sub-steps. Each sub-step is sequentially passed through; after each major sub-step  each minor sub-step is sequentially passed through. The description of  will begin with a description of the minor sub-steps  followed by a description of the major sub-steps.   Fill in the allele of an offspring of a parent that has both its alleles filled in and has a resulting genotype that is homozygous.   If the genotype at a locus for an individual is known and one of its alleles has been determined  then impute the missing allele as the complement of the genotype and the known phased allele.   If one of the parental alleles is known and the other missing  then fill in the missing allele in the parent if at least one of its offspring is known to carry an allele that does not match the known allele in the parent. (e.g. if a sire has a 0 as one of its alleles and the other allele is missing but one of its offspring carries a 1 in the gamete received from the sire  then we can determine that the sire’s missing allele is 1).   Any individual that has a missing genotype but has both alleles known  has its genotype filled in as the sum of the two alleles.   Alleles with probabilities greater than 0.99 of being 0 or 1 are imputed.   If a base animal has high-density genotype information  it is filled in by arbitrarily assigning one of its haplotypes for one of its cores as coming from its paternal gamete and the other haplotype as coming from its maternal gamete. Haplotypes at other cores are appended to the central haplotypes where overlapping information can be used to determine which haplotype at an adjacent partially overlapping core matches the arbitrarily labeled paternal (maternal) haplotype.   For each core of each round of the LRPHLI algorithm  all haplotypes that have been found and stored in the haplotype library are initially considered to be candidates for the true haplotype that an individual carries on its gametes. Within the core  all alleles that are known are compared to corresponding alleles in each of the haplotypes in the library. Haplotypes that have a number of disagreements greater than a small error threshold have their candidacy rejected. At the end of this loop  the surviving candidate haplotypes are checked for locations that have unanimous agreement about a particular allele. For alleles with complete agreement  a count of the suggested allele is incremented. Alleles are imputed if  at the end of passing across each core and each round of the LRPHLI algorithm  the count of whether the alleles are 0 or 1 is above a threshold in one direction and below a threshold in the other. This helps to prevent the use of phasing errors that originate from LRPHLI.   This is similar to  with the exception that the process is restricted to individuals that have parents with high-density genotype information and the candidate haplotypes for each individual’s gametes are restricted to the two haplotypes that have been identified for each of its parents by the LRPHLI algorithm. Errors in phasing are accounted for in the same way as in .   This is similar to  with the exception that the process is restricted to individuals that have high-density genotype information and the candidate haplotypes are restricted to the two haplotypes that have been identified for the individual by the LRPHLI algorithm. Effectively  it determines the parental origin of each of these haplotypes. Errors in phasing are accounted for in the same way as in .   This step is similar to  with the exception that haplotype libraries are internally built using the information that has been previously imputed. Several different core lengths are used to define the length of the haplotypes and to ensure that errors can be accounted for in the same way as in .   This step is similar to  with the exception that it is attempted for all animals in the pedigree on the basis that their parents may now have imputed high-density information. In the same way as   several core lengths are used to define the length of the haplotypes and to ensure that errors can be accounted for in the same way as in .   Each gamete of an individual is examined from the beginning to the end and from the end to the beginning of the chromosome. In each direction  at loci where both the individual and its parent are heterozygous and have phase information resolved  this information is used to determine which of the parental gametes the individual received. Loci for which this cannot be determined but which are between two loci that (a) can be determined and (b) come from the same parental gamete  are assumed to come from this gamete (i.e. no double recombination event in between). Alleles are imputed in the individual when analysis in both directions of the chromosome has identified the same inherited gamete and when the parent is phased for this locus in the suggested gamete  subject to the restrictions that the number of recombination events for the individuals is less than a threshold and that the region in which two recombination events occurred exceeds a threshold length.  is iterated a number of times with increasingly relaxed restrictions. After each iteration  the minor sub-steps are also carried out.  . Using the imputed genotype information  the allele probabilities and genotype probabilities are recalculated as in . Alleles that are still missing are imputed as the recalculated allele probability. Missing genotypes are imputed from the allelic probabilities when both alleles are still missing  in advance of the recalculation of allele probabilities  or from the imputed allele and the allele probability when only one allele was not imputed. Steps are also included to divide the data into the high and low density sets of animals  to edit the SNP data  check for Mendelian inconsistencies  and identify base parents.

We have also demonstrated that these quail strains are a useful model to study cholesterol metabolism and transport in relation with atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a complex pathological process that is affected by both environmental and genetic factors; it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized societies [  ]. Although surgical and medical treatments have progressed  current therapies that slow the formation of atherosclerotic plaques are not totally successful []. Therefore  it is necessary to continue investigating the fundamental mechanisms that cause atherosclerosis to develop more effective forms of treatment e.g. []. Japanese quail () was first used as a research model for atherosclerosis in the early 1960s []  and since then  numerous studies have demonstrated the value of this model to obtain information on the development of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in man. One reason why the Japanese quail is a good model to study atherosclerosis is that it can develop “complex” vascular lesions (focal haemorrhage  calcification and fibrosis) that are very similar to lesions in man [–]. Divergent selection of Japanese quail for susceptibility and resistance to atherosclerotic plaque formation induced by dietary cholesterol have resulted in two strains i.e. atherosclerosis-susceptible (SUS) and atherosclerosis-resistant (RES) strains that are valuable models. The female Japanese quail does not develop atherosclerotic plaques even when exposed to a 0.5% w/w cholesterol diet []. Before selection  8% of the males from a random-bred foundation population developed atherosclerosis when fed a high cholesterol diet (0.5% w/w) []. After divergent selection during four generations  80% of the SUS males as compared to only 4% of the RES males developed atherosclerosis []. However  apart from the characterization of certain physiological differences between these two strains  no molecular characterization of the phenotypic differences has been carried out. Previous studies [  ] have shown that after cholesterol feeding  plasma cholesterol levels remain high for a significantly longer time in the SUS than in the RES males. In addition  SUS males have fatty livers and higher amounts of liver cholesterol than RES males. Shih et al. [] hypothesized that the RES individuals were more resistant because “they metabolized and excreted cholesterol faster than the SUS”. Therefore  in our study  we have compared the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport in the liver of SUS and RES males. The mevalonate pathway (or HMG-CoA reductase pathway) is an important component of the endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [] in the liver. During the process of converting mevalonate to cholesterol and other sterol isoprenoids  many important enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR or HMG-CoA reductase)  squalene synthase (FDFT1)  squalene expoxidase (SQLE)  mevalonate kinase (MVK)  phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK) and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) are involved in regulating the overall process []. We examined the individual expression of the following genes      and  by quantifying their mRNA levels in liver cells of SUS and RES males. ABCG5 and ABCG8  from the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family  are cholesterol excretion transporters []. Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) is the major protein component of HDL in plasma and is believed to have a protective effect against atherosclerosis by participating in the reverse transport of hepatic cholesterol from tissues to the bile for excretion [–]. Therefore  we also included the genes of these three proteins in our study. The SUS and RES quail stains were acquired by the University of British Columbia (UBC) Quail Genetic Resource Centre from the North Carolina State University in 1989. Since then  they have undergone further divergent selection for susceptibility and resistance to atherosclerotic plaque formation induced by dietary cholesterol (0.5%w/w) (KM Cheng  unpublished data). After hatching  both SUS (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>50) and RES (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>50) males were fed a semi-synthetic diet (Table ) prepared by the feed mill at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Station at Agassiz  British Columbia  according to the NRC nutrient requirement standards recommended for quail (). At six weeks of age  13 birds (6 SUS and 7 RES) were euthanized and liver tissues were collected. The remaining birds were divided into two dietary treatment groups  fed either a regular synthetic diet or a synthetic diet containing cholesterol (0.5% w/w) (Table ) for another six weeks (Table ). At twelve weeks of age  24 birds from each dietary treatment group were euthanized and liver tissue samples were collected for further analysis. This research was carried out with the approval of the UBC Animal Care Committee  Certificate # A06-1473. The birds were euthanized by decapitation. Livers were then quickly removed  dissected and stored in RNAlater reagent (Qiagen  Valencia  CA  USA) at -20°C until use. Total RNA from liver cells was extracted using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen  Valencia  CA  USA). Concentration and purity were checked by spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ <U+0406><U+0406><U+0406> RT (200 units/µl) (Invitrogen Corporation  Carlsbad  CA  USA) at 50°C using Oligo (dT) primers (Fermentas Inc.  Glen Burnie  MD  USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each 38 µl reaction volume contained 5 µg of total RNA  1 µl Oligo (dT) primers (100 mM)  2 µl dNTP (10 mM) (Fermentas Inc.  Glen Burnie  MD  USA)  8 µl 5x first strand buffer  4 µl DTT (0.1 M) and 2 µl SuperScript™ <U+0406><U+0406><U+0406> RT. One µl of RiboLock™ RNase Inhibitor (40 U/µl) (Fermentas Inc.  Glen Burnie  MD  USA) was added to each reaction mixture in order to inhibit RNA degradation during reverse transcription. The first-strand cDNA was stored at -20° C for future real-time PCR. Primer pairs for each gene selected were designed using either Japanese quail () or chicken () sequence information from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI  ) GenBank database. The  () gene was used as an internal control []. Real-time PCR primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0.0 (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA) and were ordered from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies  Coralville  IA  USA). Primer information is shown in Table . An aliquot of the purified first strand cDNA templates was used to prepare the standard curve cDNA template mixture (calibrated sample)  while the remainder was diluted to half the concentration for the real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA). Each sample was run in duplicate. The PCR was carried out in a reaction volume of 22 µl  containing 2 µl cDNA template (diluted 1:1 in water)  0.4 µl forward primer (10 µM)  0.4 µl reverse primer (10 µM) (Integrated DNA technologies  Coralville  IA) and 10 µl SYBR Green universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA)  and water was added to a final volume of 22 µl. The following PCR conditions were applied: 50° C for 2 min  95° C for 10 min  and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95° C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60° C for 1 min. Fluorescence measurements were recorded using SYBR as the reporter dye and the results were normalized to the endogenous control  . A standard curve was produced for all primers using serial dilutions of cDNA (2x  1x  1/2x  1/4x and 1/8x). The 2x mixture was prepared with the first-strand cDNA products (which had twice the concentration of template cDNA). Raw data analyses were done with the 7000 System Software (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA). Expression levels were quantified by comparing the results of each real-time PCR to the standard curve produced by serial dilutions. Normalized mRNA levels were then calculated as the ratio of the measured amount of target gene mRNA to the amount of  mRNA. Plasma samples (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>56; including samples from birds used for the real-time PCR analysis) from 6-week old (6 SUS/control and 7 RES/control) and 12-week old (16 SUS/control  20 SUS/cholesterol  7 RES/control  6 RES/cholesterol) SUS and RES males fed both dietary treatments were sent to the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at St. Paul’s Hospital (Vancouver  BC) and assayed for total cholesterol  HDL  and triglycerides using enzymatic methods on an ADVIA 1650 Chemistry System. HDL was assessed by the direct method without precipitation of apolipoprotein B [–]. LDL values were determined by Friedewald’s formula  using measured values for total cholesterol  HDL and triglycerides [  ]. Least squares analysis of variance was performed using JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute  North Carolina  2008). The statistical model for mRNA levels was: where Y is the measure for the l individual of the i strain  j diet from k age group; S indicates whether the bird was RES or SUS; A represents the two age groups i.e. 6-week or 12-week old; D indicates whether the bird was on a regular diet or a cholesterol diet; (SD) and (SA) are interaction terms; and E is the error term. The data were log-transformed before analysis. The results were reported as the least square mean values for each dataset<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error of means (SEM) and the level of statistical significance was defined at P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. Tukey’s HSD was used for mean separation. For plasma lipid parameters  the following model was used: The mRNA levels of the seven candidate genes were also regressed on the plasma lipid parameters with multiple regression analysis (JMP 8.0). The effects of strain and diet on the mRNA expression of the seven genes examined are shown in Table . Because none of the 6-week old birds were fed the cholesterol-enhanced diet  we could examine the effects of strain and age on gene expression only for the birds fed the regular diet (Table ). The expression of  was significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) higher in RES (1.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 HMGCR/GAPDH) than in SUS birds (0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 HMGCR/GAPDH)  regardless of dietary treatment and age (Table ). No significant interaction effect was detected. The expression of  was significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.04) higher in RES (0.89<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 FDFT1/GAPDH) than in SUS birds (0.56<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 FDFT1/GAPDH)  regardless of dietary treatment and age (Table ). No significant interaction effect was detected. The expression of  was significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02) higher in RES than in SUS individuals when the birds were fed the regular diet (Table )  and its expression in both strains was significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) suppressed when the birds were fed the cholesterol diet (Table ). However  the strain x diet interaction was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.51). There were no strain differences (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35) in the expression of  when the birds were fed the control diet (Table ). When challenged by the cholesterol diet  its expression was significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.04) higher in RES (1.012<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 DHCR7/GAPDH) than in SUS birds (0.673<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 DHCR7/GAPDH) (Table ). However  the strain x diet interaction was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6). Six-week old birds (1.36<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.18 DHCR7/GAPDH) had a significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) higher  expression than 12-week old birds (0.88<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.10 DHCR7/GAPDH) (Table ). There was a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) diet x strain interaction in  gene expression. When fed the regular diet  expression of  was significantly higher in RES than in SUS birds. When challenged with the cholesterol diet  the difference in expression level in the two strains became non-significant (Table ). There was a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0005) strain x age interaction for birds on the regular diet (Table ); the expression of  significantly increased with age in RES birds but not in SUS birds. The expression of  was significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02) higher in RES (1.50<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.14 ABCG8/GAPDH) than in SUS birds (0.97<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.15 ABCG8/GAPDH) (Table ). Birds fed the cholesterol diet (1.59<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.17 ABCG8/GAPDH) had significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.002) higher  expression than birds on the control diet (0.88<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.12 ABCG8/GAPDH) (Table ). Twelve-week old birds (1.38<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 ABCG8/GAPDH) on regular diet had a significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.004) higher  expression than 6-week old birds (0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.19 ABCG8/GAPDH) on the same diet (Table ). There was no significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.46) strain effect on the expression of . Both RES and SUS birds fed the cholesterol diet (1.40<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06 APOA1/GAPDH) had a significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) higher expression compared to birds fed the regular diet (0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.05 APOA1/GAPDH) (Table ). Twelve-week old birds (1.12<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 APOA1/GAPDH) on regular diet had a significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) higher  expression than 6-week old birds (0.54<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 APOA1/GAPDH) on the same diet (Table ). There was a significant strain x diet interaction for plasma total cholesterol (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.013) and LDL (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) levels. Plasma total cholesterol and LDL levels in SUS and RES birds fed the regular diet were not different but they were significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) higher when the birds were fed the cholesterol diet  with levels in SUS birds significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) higher than those in RES birds (Tables  and ). There was a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02) strain x diet interaction in plasma triglyceride levels. Plasma triglyceride levels in SUS and RES birds fed the regular diet were not different. When the birds were fed the cholesterol diet  plasma triglyceride levels increased significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) in SUS but not in the RES birds (Table ). There was a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.028) strain x diet interaction in plasma HDL levels. Plasma HDL levels were significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) higher in SUS than in RES birds when they were on the regular diet. Plasma HDL levels did not change significantly when the birds were fed the cholesterol diet; however  the difference between the SUS and RES birds became non-significant (Table ). These small changes in the HDL level did not affect the LDL/HDL ratio (see Table  and Table ). Because regulation of gene expression may differ between the two strains  they were analysed separately (Table ).  expression regressed (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36) significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.009) on plasma triglyceride level in the SUS but not in the RES birds (Table   Figure A and C). In RES birds   expression tended (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.06; r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.24) to regress on LDL (Table   Figure D) and regressed significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.04; r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.28) on the LDL/HDL ratio (Figure ).   In part A: r<U+2009>=<U+2009>+0.36; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.009.   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.28; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.04. In the SUS birds   expression regressed (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.48) significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.008) and positively on plasma LDL level (Table   Figure )  whereas  and  expression regressed significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.04 and P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02  respectively) and negatively on plasma triglyceride level (Table   Figures A and A).   r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.48; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.008.   In part A: r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.23; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.04.   In part A: r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.29; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02. No other significant regression of gene expression on plasma lipid levels was found in the RES birds. However  given the fact that only a few individuals showed high levels of plasma lipid  a linear relation between gene expression and plasma lipid levels may not be valid. Examination of the regression plots revealed that in both the SUS and RES birds   and  expressions were completely or drastically suppressed when plasma triglycerides or LDL reached a threshold level (Figures  and ).  expression appears to follow the same pattern (Figure ).                                                                                 The RES and SUS quail strains have been developed through divergent selective breeding from the same foundation population []  and thus should be genetically similar except for the changes induced by selection. Previously  it has been reported that one of the observable differences between RES and SUS individuals is that after being fed on a cholesterol-enhanced diet  plasma cholesterol levels remain elevated in SUS individuals significantly longer than in RES individuals []. Since the liver plays a key role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis by acting as the main site for lipid metabolism and bile salt formation  we have focused our study on this organ and more specifically on the expression in liver of several cholesterol biosynthesis and transporting genes. Although gene expression is a phenotype and not a genotype  it probably reflects more directly genotypic changes than morphological or physiological phenotypes.  expression was significantly higher in the liver of RES as compared to SUS individuals under all dietary conditions  while  expression was higher only under some dietary conditions. Evidence from both animal models and research on man supports the important role of these two ABC transporters in the regulation of the excretion of sterols from the liver via bile to prevent the accumulation of dietary sterols []. In human  mutations in either of these genes cause sitosterolemia  a disorder that is characterized by intestinal hyper-absorption of all sterols and impaired ability to excrete sterols into bile. Patients develop tendon and tuberous xanthomas  accelerated atherosclerosis  and premature coronary artery disease [–]. Sitosterolemia is caused by an abnormal expression pattern of the ABC transporters (heterodimers of sterolin-1 and sterolin-2)  which function as gatekeepers for dietary sterol uptake and excretion []. A point mutation in exon 8 of the  gene causes premature termination of translation resulting in a truncated and non-functional sterolin-1 protein. It has also been reported that several mutations in  result in a truncated non-functional protein [  ]. Besides  another point mutation in the human  gene enhancing the ABCG5/8 pathway has been shown to protect against atherosclerosis by increasing cholesterol elimination in the bile and reducing plasma cholesterol levels []. Furthermore  a study on the mouse has shown that over-expression of  and  decreases diet-induced atherosclerosis  in association with reduced liver and plasma cholesterol levels []. Another study of a partially inbred strain of opossums () with low levels of  and  expression was associated with an elevation in diet-induced VLDL and LDL cholesterol []. In our study  the lower  and  expression in the SUS individuals may be at least partially responsible for the greater susceptibility of this strain to diet-induced atherosclerosis []. In the RES birds   expression remained high regardless of dietary treatment  whereas in the SUS birds  an increased level of  expression could be induced by a cholesterol-enhanced diet. Selection for atherosclerosis susceptibility may have altered the regulation of the  gene in the RES strain. Studies on mice have provided evidence for the direct control of    and  mRNA expression by the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway. Indeed  in mice fed with a cholesterol-enhanced diet     and  mRNA expressions were up-regulated [  ]. Liver X receptors and retinoid X receptors (RXR) form RXR/LXR heterodimer transcription factors that act as intracellular sterol sensors []. Accordingly  selection for atherosclerosis resistance may not have altered the expression of  but rather the expression of some of these receptor genes [    ] thus permitting expression of  to remain in an up-regulated state in the RES individuals. It would be interesting to examine the expression of the  and  genes in the two quail strains under similar and different dietary conditions. While we have measured the levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides  we have not determined their intracellular levels. The  gene is regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway via negative feedback [–]. When intracellular cholesterol levels are high  the  gene is down-regulated []. With fewer receptors  the liver takes up the LDL from blood less efficiently  and as a result  plasma LDL levels increase. It is possible that selection has altered the expression of the  gene in the SUS and RES strains. SUS individuals are less efficient in removing excess cholesterol from the liver  thus they may have a down-regulated expression of the  gene resulting in a higher level of dietary cholesterol remaining in circulation. Therefore  it would be relevant to examine the expression of the  gene in the two quail strains fed with different diets. The expression of three genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis     and   was found lower in SUS than in RES birds  regardless of diet and age. As a counteraction effect to the selective pressure for susceptibility to atherosclerosis  natural selection may have caused a permanent down-regulation of these genes in the SUS individuals to decrease endogenous cholesterol synthesis to maintain homeostasis. Apparently  this mechanism to maintain homeostasis became ineffective when the birds are fed a diet containing an extremely high level of cholesterol. These mevalonate pathway genes are also regulated by the intracellular cholesterol via the SREBP pathway []. For example   has been shown to be regulated by sterol and non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate in a negative feedback loop [    ]. Similar to    and  are transcriptionally regulated via the SREBP pathway []. We have also found that the expression level of some of these genes regressed negatively on plasma LDL and triglyceride levels. A very high level of plasma cholesterol is associated with suppressed or strongly reduced expression of   and . Although they may not be the primary rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis []  suppression of their expression may also be a protective action to turn off the endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Thus  it is reasonable to hypothesize that the high intracellular cholesterol levels in the liver cells of the SUS birds may be related to the sub-normal functioning of the transporter genes  and . The down-regulation of the mevalonate pathway genes may be an ineffective attempt to normalize intracellular cholesterol levels in the liver cells of the SUS birds. Cholesterol metabolism and transport are regulated by a complicated gene system. The number of genes that we have sampled in this study remains small and from a single tissue  thus we cannot draw any conclusion on how this gene system works or how this gene system has been affected by selective breeding. However  the SUS strain responded to selection in a short time (i.e. four generations) and then reached a plateau  which is an indication that only a few genes have been altered. Our results do provide some explanation for the plasma cholesterol levels remaining high for a significantly longer time in the SUS males than in the RES males. With the progress in micro-array technology and transcriptome pyrosequencing []  this quail model will be useful to study the ramification effects of a few genes in the complicated gene system that affects atherosclerosis.

However  little is known about the perspectives of such a selection strategy in beef cattle. A two-step approach was applied to study the genetic heterogeneity of residual variance of weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling weight in a Nellore beef cattle population. First  an animal model was fitted to the data and second  the influence of additive and environmental effects on the residual variance of these traits was investigated with different models  in which the log squared estimated residuals for each phenotypic record were analyzed using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to assess the reliability of variance component estimates from the second step and the accuracy of estimated breeding values for residual variation. The results suggest that both genetic and environmental factors have an effect on the residual variance of weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling in Nellore beef cattle and that uniformity of these traits could be improved by selecting for lower residual variance  when considering a large amount of information to predict genetic merit for this criterion. Simulations suggested that using the two-step approach would lead to biased estimates of variance components  such that more adequate methods are needed to study the genetic heterogeneity of residual variance in beef cattle. In most linear mixed models used in animal breeding  it is usually assumed that residual variance is constant across genotypes. However  recent studies have provided statistical support for the hypothesis that residual variance (s²) is partly under genetic control  highlighting its importance in livestock e.g. [–]. Comprehensive reviews on this topic have been reported in [] and []. Mackay and Lyman [] have found strong experimental evidence of genetic heterogeneity of residual variance in bristle number between isofemale lines of Drosophila. More recently  divergent selection experiments for birth weight [] and litter size [] in rabbits confirmed that residual variance is genetically controlled. Such genetic differences in residual variance between individuals could be exploited to obtain more homogeneous products and/or more robust animals by selecting for lower residual variance. Although uniformity is an important issue in beef production  few studies have explored the advantages of introducing this as a selection criterion in beef cattle breeding programs. A primary concern of beef producers is to improve uniformity of production traits such as carcass weight  fat deposition and carcass composition because the price paid to producers is based on these criteria. Another interesting issue would be to increase the proportion of animals within a desired range for growth-related traits such as birth weight and mature weight. Genetic heterogeneity of residual variance has been investigated using structural models that can estimate genetic effects on the mean and the residual variance in a single step [–]. A free software is also available to implement such models under a Bayesian framework []. However  computing time and estimability problems may hamper the use of this approach in some cases. Rowe et al. [] employed an alternative two-step procedure to study the genetic heterogeneity of residual variance of body weight in broilers. In the first step  body weight was analyzed with allowance for differences in residual variance among sire families  and in the second step  the resulting estimates of residual variance were analyzed by least squares methods. Another approach consists in analyzing the log squared of the estimated residuals of observations  ln(ê²) [      ]. Mulder et al. [] reported a method to analyze the log squared estimated residuals that is capable of estimating the genetic variance of residual variance  which gives the flexibility to account for genetic and environmental effects at the level of each record  by assuming ln(ê²) as an estimator of the residual variance  and can be implemented in standard REML packages. Given the standard structure of beef cattle data with a relatively large number of progeny per sire and a few sibs per dam  analysis of the log squared estimated residuals should be suitable to investigate the influence of environmental and additive effects on residual variance in large populations of beef cattle. Neves et al. [] used this approach in a exploratory work to study the genetic variability of residual variance of fifteen traits in Nellore beef cattle  but the adequacy of this method to such data structure still requires further investigation. As suggested by Gutierrez et al. []  this approach could be particularly interesting in an initial phase of investigation  avoiding the computational time necessary to fit high-dimensional structural models with extremely large datasets []. In addition  a simulation study using the unbalanced structure of a real beef cattle population may provide additional arguments in favor of the adequacy of this approach to study the genetic variability of residual variance of beef cattle traits. Thus  the objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the influence of additive and environmental effects on residual variance of two traits related to body weight in a large Nellore beef cattle population using a two-step approach and (2) to apply a Monte Carlo simulation of the second step  to assess the reliability of variance component estimation and the accuracy of estimated breeding values for residual variation. We used data from the Aliança Nelore database  comprising records from 382 Nellore herds raised with pasture systems in Brazil and Paraguay  collected from 1996 to 2009. Weight gain from birth to weaning (GBW  in kg) and long-yearling weight (YW  measured at about 550 days of age  in kg) were chosen as traits for this study. Homogeneity in GBW is an important criterion because animals with too low weights at weaning are not desired and animals with very large weights tend to have poorer performances in the subsequent period of food restriction (dry season). Likewise  more uniformity in YW would be valuable to avoid the penalties that are applied for carcass weights outside the optimum range. Mulder et al. [] investigated the genetic heterogeneity in residual variance of body weight in broiler chickens and fitted each sex separately  because variances in males and females differed greatly. In the present study  although the coefficients of variation were similar for both sexes  phenotypic variances were about 29% higher in males for GBW and 67% higher for YW. Since one of our objectives was to investigate the need for sex-specific analyses  heterogeneity of environmental variance was analyzed separately for each sex and the results were compared with those from a single analysis of records from both sexes. For both traits  contemporary groups (CG) were defined based on concatenations of herd  year  and season of birth  sex  date of measurement  and management group. Genetic connectedness among CG was verified using the AMC software []. Briefly  this program evaluates connectedness among CG on the basis of total direct genetic links between them due to common sires  common sires and dams  or any common ancestor  in a way that genetic links are weighted by the corresponding additive relationships. A minimum of ten direct genetic links was required to include a CG in the set of connected groups that were included in the estimation of the variance components. To reduce the impact of outliers on the estimates of variance components  only records within the range of the trait mean ± 3.5 SD were considered. In all analyses  only records for animals reared in CG with a minimum of 25 animals and sired by bulls with at least 50 progenies were considered in both steps (described in the next sections). Information on the number of levels of fixed effects (CG)  number of sires  number of dams and average progeny size of sires after data editing is presented in Table . Univariate animal models were fitted using the ASREML-R package []  in order to estimate variance components and to obtain solutions for fixed and random effects relevant to each trait. In addition to CG  other identifiable environmental effects that significantly affected the traits in this study were considered as fixed effects. For the analysis of GBW  animal age  birth date within birth season and age of dam at calving (according to the calf’s sex) were taken in account by fitting appropriate covariates. Animal age (linear and quadratic effects) was included in the analysis of YW. In matrix notation  the model used to analyze GBW can be represented as: in which: <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of observations; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of direct additive genetic effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of maternal additive genetic effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of maternal permanent environmental effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of residual random errors associated with observations.      and  are incidence matrices that associate      and  to   respectively. The assumptions of this model are: where: <U+2009>=<U+2009>matrix of genetic covariances between direct and maternal effects  <U+2009>=<U+2009>numerator relationship matrix  s²<U+2009>=<U+2009>maternal permanent environmental variance  <U+2009>=<U+2009>identity matrix of order equal to the number of dams  <U+2009>=<U+2009>identity matrix of order equal to the number of observations  <U+2009>=<U+2009>residual (co) variance matrix. It was assumed that   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>variance of direct additive genetic effects  <U+2009>=<U+2009>variance of maternal additive genetic effects  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>covariance between maternal and direct additive genetic effects. Since only a few dams had more than one offspring of each sex with information on GBW  the maternal permanent environmental effect was not included when the information of each sex was considered separately because the data structure would not allow adequate estimation of this parameter. Also due to the data structure   was set to zero in all analyses (most dams had no data for their own performance and a large number of sires had no maternal grandprogeny records). In order to estimate the effect of allowing for heterogeneous residual variances in the first step  a first set of analyses was carried out by assuming a homoscedastic model (HOM). Then  an equivalent set of analyses was carried out  allowing for different residual variances for each sire family (model HET). Therefore  matrix  of equation  is a diagonal matrix  in which the elements are either equal to s² (model HOM) or equal to s² (model HET)  where s² is the residual variance specific to the progeny of the j sire. The model used to analyze the YW trait included only direct additive effects and residuals as random effects. This model was chosen because including both types of maternal effects described in equation () did not improve model fitting (evaluated by the statistics Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)). Thus  variance components for GBW and YW were estimated by considering different sources of data (i.e. data from males  females or both sexes) and different assumptions on residual variance in the first step (i.e. HOM or HET model). In addition  10-fold cross-validation was performed to investigate the predictive ability of the HOM and HET models for each analyzed dataset. In this case  each dataset was randomly partitioned into 10 disjoint subsets  each with approximately one tenth of the records. In each case  nine of the subsets were used for model fitting (training set)  after which the observations in the remaining subset were predicted (testing set) and the mean squared error (MSE) of prediction was calculated. At the end of this process  the average of the MSE was calculated  with the estimates of MSE obtained separately for each testing set. Solutions obtained in the first step were used to estimate the residual (ê) for each observation. For each trait  log squared estimated residuals  ln(ê²)  were used as a measure of the residual variance  as discussed previously. In order to investigate the influence of fixed effects (CG) and additive genetic effects on the residual variance of GBW and YW  different models were fitted to the log squared estimated residuals in ASREML-R. The full model of the second step can be represented by: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of individual log squared estimated residuals for the trait analyzed; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of direct additive genetic effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of maternal additive genetic effects  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of residual random errors associated with the log squared estimated residuals. Assumptions of model (2) were: where: <U+2009>=<U+2009>matrix of genetic covariances  <U+2009>=<U+2009>numerator relationship matrix  <U+2009>=<U+2009>identity matrix of order equal to the number of observations  <U+2009>=<U+2009>residual variance (s²<U+03F5>). It was assumed that   where  is the variance due to direct additive genetic effects and  is the variance due to maternal additive genetic effects on the log squared estimated residuals. As in the first step  maternal effects only improved model fitting for GBW (according to AIC and BIC) and thus were not considered in the case of YW. Results from model (2) and reduced models were compared to evaluate the importance of including direct additive genetic effects and maternal additive effects in the analyses of the log squared estimated residuals. A likelihood-ratio test was applied to assess the significance of considering additive genetic effects at the level of residual variance. The statistics BIC and AIC were also calculated  in order to penalize models with a larger number of parameters. Two parameters  namely evolvability of residual variance (Ev) and heritability of residual variance (h²) were calculated in order to measure the strength of genetic variation on residual variance and also to compare our results with those of previous studies. Because the additive variance estimates (s²) from the second step were expressed on an exponential scale  they were transformed as proposed by [] into estimates on the scale of residual variance (i.e. )  which were used to compute Ev. Evolvability was proposed by Houle [] to quantify the possibility of changing the mean of a trait by selection. In the present context  Ev reflects the opportunity to change the average residual variance by selection. Ev was calculated as an additive coefficient of variation (Ev<U+2009>=<U+2009>). Parameter s² is an estimate of the residual variance and was equal to the REML estimate of residual variance for the HOM model and the average of residual variance among sire families for the HET model. The heritability of residual variance (h²) was derived by [] as a regression coefficient of breeding values for residual variance () on squared phenotypes and it has been used as a central parameter in calculation of the accuracy of predicted breeding values for residual variance (r). Here  h²v was calculated as reported in []  while the heritability of ln(ê²) and its standard error (s.e.) were directly estimated on a log scale and were used to approximate the standard error of h². The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between estimated breeding values (EBV) of sires for the mean and for log squared estimated residuals was calculated to provide a rough indication of the genetic association between these criteria  since direct estimation of this parameter is not feasible with the two-step approach. Because this estimate is dependent on the accuracy of EBV  only sires with more than 50 progeny were used  in order to reduce this source of bias. The data structure of the population described previously was used to simulate trait Y. Twenty replicates were simulated for each scenario described below. We considered animals of both sexes with information on YW (Table ). For individuals with records  trait Y  expressed in kg  was simulated as follows: where  is the fixed effect simulated for the i CG   is the breeding value of animal j for the mean of Y and the last term replicates random residual effects according to the exponential model described by SanCristóbal-Gaudy et al. []. At the level of the log of residual variance  we simulated a fixed effect due to the i CG ()  the breeding value of j animal () and  is independent and identically distributed as N (0;1). With the aim of mimicking the real effects of CG on the mean and the residual variance of Y  CG effects b were drawn from a uniform distribution defined by U(300;400) and values for b were drawn from a uniform distribution U(5.40;5.80). For the founder animals   and  were simulated from a    in which   with s<U+2009>=<U+2009>200 and  equal to 0.01  0.09 or 0.25. The covariance between direct additive genetic effects on the mean and the residual variance ( was simulated such that three scenarios for the additive genetic correlation between the mean and the residual variance of Y could be investigated (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.50; 0 or 0.50). For subsequent generations  breeding values of non-founder animals were simulated as the average of the breeding values of the sire and dam plus a random Mendelian sampling term. Accordingly  the expected value of the environmental variance (s²) is equal to exp()*exp(s²/2). Thus  Y was simulated to resemble a trait with heritability around 0.40  a mean equal to 350 kg and a phenotypic variance of about 480 kg² (because the value simulated for  affects the expectation of s² and the values for heritability and phenotypic variance vary depending on  ). According to formulas in []  the parameters simulated at the level of the log residual variance  when converted to the scale of the residual variance  result in Ev equal to about 10%  30% and 50%  depending on the value simulated for  (0.01 0.09 or 0.25  respectively) . The two-step approach described in the previous section was used to analyze each replicate of the simulated data. In the first step  an animal model was fitted  including CG as fixed effect  considering two scenarios for residual variance HOM or HET. In the second step  models with the same definition as equation () were employed  except that maternal additive effects were not included. Estimates of  according to each model were compared with corresponding true values. The accuracy of prediction of breeding values for log squared estimated residuals was assessed with the Pearson’s correlation between estimated and true breeding values  by considering only sires  only dams and all animals in the pedigree. In order to investigate the adequacy of the methods proposed here with a more balanced dataset  the same simulation parameters as described in the previous section were used to simulate five generations of an artificial population with 25 000 records. The base population consisted in 5 000 dams and 100 sires. At each generation  sires (dams) had 50 (1) offspring and records were distributed across 100 CG  such that each CG included the progeny of five sires  each with 10 sons. The simulation process considered a 20% replacement rate for both sexes per generation  assuming random mating and no selection. Data were analyzed and results were compared in the same way as described in the previous section. Summary statistics of data for GBW and YW are presented in Table . The values for skewness and kurtosis indicate an approximate normal distribution of data for GBW and a slightly positively skewed distribution in the case of YW (Table )  for both males and females. Although the estimates of variance components were very similar for models HOM and HET for both GBW and YW  model HET had a better fit according to AIC  while model HOM provided a better fit according to BIC (Table ). As a general rule  model HOM had slightly lower average MSE than model HET  which indicates that model HOM has a higher predictive ability. The only exception was for GBW in the dataset with female records  for which model HET performed slightly better in terms of predictive ability. When each sex was analyzed separately  estimates of direct heritability (h²) were higher for males than for females (about 12% and 33% for GBW and YW  respectively) for both models HOM and HET. Higher estimates of average residual variance and genetic additive (direct and maternal) variance were also obtained for males than for females  possibly because of scale effects. When the data on males and females were considered jointly  the estimates of h² (s.e.) were similar for models HOM and HET  i.e. about 0.12 (0.02) and 0.41 (0.03) for GBW and YW  respectively. If the residuals from the first step are normally distributed  their squares will follow a <U+03C7>² distribution []. For both GBW and YW  the distributions of the log squared residuals were close to the log of a chi-squared variable  (skewness about -1.5 and excess kurtosis about 1.0)  regardless of whether model HET or HOM was fitted in the first step (data not shown)  and whether female or male records were considered. Estimates of variance components and related parameters obtained from the second step are presented in Table   as well as the results for information criteria. When a heteroscedastic model was fitted in the first step (HET)  results of likelihood-ratio tests indicated that fitting additive genetic effects at the level of the (log) residual variance significantly improved model fitting (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  compared to a situation in which only fixed effects were considered  for both GBW and YW and regardless of the source of information (males  females  or both). The same conclusion holds when such models are compared using information criteria (AIC and BIC  Table ). Conversely  the influence of additive genetic effects on residual variance was weaker when model HOM was fitted in the first step. Information criteria did not favor the model with additive effects on residual variance for YW  regardless of the source of information (males  females  or both)  while these criteria only favored the model with additive genetic effects on the residual variation of GBW when records of both males and females were analyzed jointly (GBW/B  Table ). For both traits  estimates of additive variance for the log squared estimated residuals from model HET were at least 12-fold larger than comparable estimates from model HOM (Table ). In addition  estimates of  obtained after fitting model HOM in the first step were very close to zero and  given the magnitude of their standard errors  they did not provide reasonable evidence of additive variance on ln(ê²). For all traits  regardless of the animal’s sex  a 95% confidence interval for  did not include zero when the first step accounted for differences between sire families in residual variance. In the case of GBW  taking into account both direct and maternal additive effects improved the model fitting in the second step. When model HOM was fitted in the first step  estimates of the maternal additive effect for ln(ê²) were between 40% and 80% larger than those obtained when model HET was fitted in the first step. Under model HET   estimates were at least two-fold higher in males than in females. For a same trait  the  estimated for females was close to that obtained when records of both sexes were analyzed jointly (Table ). Estimates of Ev were less than 13% in all situations when model HOM was fitted in the first step but were as high as 65% and 78% for GBW and YW  respectively  when only the data from males were considered and model HET was fitted in the first step. Interestingly  for both GBW and YW  Ev estimates were around 43% in situations when only records of females were considered and also when records of both sexes were combined (Table ). Values of the heritability of residual variance (h²) were always less than 0.5% under model HOM  while they ranged from 3 to 6% when model HET was fitted. Again  h² estimates were higher in males than in females  for both GBW and YW. The approximated standard error of h² was small when model HET was fitted in the first step (data not shown)  such that the 95% confidence interval did not include zero. In general  the Pearson’s correlation between the sire’s EBV for the mean and for the log squared estimated residuals was positive and low (below 0.40). The only exception was for YW in males  for which the estimated correlation was very close to zero (Table ). For both sets of simulations (using observed or simulated pedigrees)  the estimated variance components for the mean of the simulated trait were in reasonable agreement with the simulated (true) values  such that the absolute values of the relative bias for estimates of additive variance and residual variance were at most 3.7% and 1.7%  respectively (data not shown). Also  there was no evidence that fitting model HET instead of model HOM in the first step resulted in estimates of residual variance closer to the simulated values  for all scenarios of additive variance  residual variance and correlation between mean and residual variance. In the simulations using the observed pedigree and for all scenarios  estimates of additive variance obtained in the second step were biased. If model HOM was fitted in the first step  the estimates of  were biased downwards (between 35%–60% lower than the true values) (Table ) and if model HET was fitted in the first step  they were biased upwards  although the amount of relative bias was larger for model HET  in all scenarios. With a more balanced design (simulated pedigree)  the amount of bias in estimates from the second step was similar to that obtained in the simulations using the observed pedigree (Table ). The only major difference was found for model HOM and if the true value of  was equal to 0.01. In this case   was underestimated in the simulation using the observed pedigree  while it was overestimated in the simulation using the simulated pedigree. For both sets of simulations  when heterogeneous residual variances among sire families were accounted for in the first step  the higher the simulated values for   the lower the amount of relative bias  which was not observed for model HOM (Table ). It should be noted that when a small value was simulated for  (i.e. 0.01)  this parameter was overestimated almost 20-fold (30-fold) under model HET compared to the true value in the case of simulations using the observed (simulated) pedigree. Similarly  the higher the values simulated for   the closer the agreement between the true additive genetic correlation between mean and residual variance and the estimates based on Pearson’s correlation between estimated breeding values for these criteria (rˆ)  regardless of the assumptions about residual variance in the first step. In the simulations using the observed pedigree  average accuracies of predicted breeding values for the log squared estimated residuals were in reasonable agreement with the expected values calculated according to formulas in []  given the amount of information available and the values simulated for the heritability of residual variance (h²). In general  meaningful values (above 0.50) were observed only for accuracies averaged across all sires when  was greater than 0.09 (Table ). Regardless of the value simulated for the correlation between mean and residual variance  the highest average accuracy was about 0.30 when considering the EBV of all animals and around 0.15 when considering only dams  which was for the scenario in which  was equal to 0.25. The values obtained in the simulation using the simulated pedigree were very similar to those obtained in the simulation using the observed pedigree and are therefore not presented. In general  comparing the accuracies obtained when model HET versus HOM was fitted in the first step shows that allowing for heterogeneous residual variances in the first step resulted in higher accuracies of predicted EBV for ln(ê²) for sires (between 8% and 20% higher) (Table ). Parameters associated with additive genetic effects on GBW and YW means obtained after the first step of this study are consistent with results of previous studies reporting low to moderate estimates of heritability for direct and maternal effects on pre-weaning growth traits [  ]  and moderate to high values for YW [  ] in Nellore cattle. When analyses were carried out separately for each sex  heritability estimates were higher in males  for both GBW and YW (notably in the case of YW). Conversely  heritability estimates were higher in females for yearling weight gain in Holstein cattle []  body weight in broiler chickens [  ]  and slaughter weight in pigs [] and such discrepancies deserve further investigation. Results from the second step showed stronger evidence for genetic heterogeneity of residual variance if heterogeneous residual variances were allowed for in the first step  although more extensive comparisons could not be made based on restricted likelihood  e.g. comparison of models that assume different combinations of fixed effects on residual variance. Similar to results reported by []  it is not clear whether fitting a model with heterogeneous residual variances among sire families in the first step provides a better fit  for both GBW and YW. Although AIC favored model HET  support for the HET model was weaker than for the HOM model when a more severe penalty for complexity (BIC) was applied. In addition  model HOM had a slightly higher predictive ability. This lack of agreement between AIC and BIC could indicate that residual variances are estimated with low precision  rather than weak evidence for genetic heterogeneity of residual variance []. Based on this argument  imposing a minimum progeny size for sires to be considered in the analysis seemed a natural choice. However  given the typical data structure of beef cattle populations  imposing this type of restriction would make it more difficult to obtain a representative sample of sire families  especially if additional restrictions with respect to the time period in which data are collected are made. Genetic parameters for residual variance in this same population were estimated in an exploratory study []  in which model HOM was fitted for 15 traits considering records on both sexes and most estimates of Ev were between 15 and 25%. In the present study  estimates of Ev for comparable models were lower (about 13% and 9% for GBW and YW  respectively)  which may be explained by the fact that the records considered cover a shorter period of time than in []. Despite this  results of both studies suggest that genetic additive effects act on the residual variance  while there is reasonable evidence of both genetic and environmental heterogeneity of residual variance for traits related to body weight in other livestock species  such as broilers [    ]  rabbits [] and pigs []. The estimated Ev under model HET were more consistent with previous estimates for body weight in other species [  ]  while model HOM provided lower estimates. In broilers  [] and [] applied approaches similar to those in this study and reported Ev estimates ranging between 35 and 55%  depending on the animal’s sex  while [] reported coefficients around 30%  but with a different approach. In pigs  estimates of Ev were about 34% for body weight at slaughter [] and in rabbits  about 25% for birth weight []. The low h²v estimates obtained for both GBW and YW are in agreement with value ranges reported in previous studies [  ]  which means that a large amount of information is needed to predict accurately the EBV for residual variance. Nevertheless  given the magnitude of the estimated Ev for weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling weight  when model HET was fitted in the first step  a meaningful response to selection on EBV for residual variance of these traits would be expected in the case of large sire families. Results from other studies also indicate that selection on EBV for residual variance can improve uniformity. In broilers  [] predicted reductions up to 20–30% in residual variance of body weight after one generation when selecting only on this criterion. Empirical evidence for this approach comes from the divergent selection experiment reported by Garreau et al. []  in which  after four generations of selection there was a difference of 27.3% between lines in within-litter variance of birth weight in rabbits. Considerable differences between males and females were observed in genetic parameters for residual variation. Similar results were also reported by []  which suggested that residual variance has a different genetic basis in each sex  such that using sex-specific variance ratios could be valuable to estimate breeding values. It was expected that  when data of both sexes were analyzed jointly  the estimates for Ev and h²v would be intermediate between those obtained for each sex  however in the present study  the resulting estimates were very close to those obtained for females under model HET. Although this question deserves further investigation  using a well-designed dataset  implementing sex-specific analyses is not possible in situations in which the number of progeny of each sex is small and the data structure does not permit adequate estimation of effects at the level of residual variance. For instance  due to the restrictions imposed on the size of contemporary groups and progeny groups  a substantial amount of data could not be considered in sex-specific analyses (about 10% and 27% of the records available for GBW and YW  respectively). An important issue in selection for residual variance is the genetic association between mean and residual variance (r). Since direct estimation of r was not feasible under the current approach  the correlation between sire EBV for mean and residual variance (rˆ) was used as an indicator of the direction of this association  as also applied by []. Simulations suggested that the correlation between breeding values for mean and log squared estimated residuals is consistent with the sign of the true correlation  but the quality of this estimate as an approximation of r depended on the magnitude of the genetic variance of residual variance. As a general rule  estimates of r were moderate and positive for both GBW and YW. While some studies have reported negative genetic correlations between mean and residual variance [      ]  other authors have obtained positive values for this correlation [  ] for traits related to body weight in different species. The two-step approach applied in the present study made it possible to estimate the genetic variance of residual variance in a relatively large population  but the simulations suggested that the investigated models provide biased estimates of genetic parameters for residual variance. The similar pattern of bias found for simulations with simulated and observed pedigrees suggests that this bias may be caused much more by the nature of the two-step approach than by data structure. As a general rule  model HOM resulted in underestimated genetic variance of residual variance  while it was overestimated when the first step accounted for heterogeneous residual variances among sire families (model HET). Thus  it is expected that true values for genetic variance of residual variance of GBW and YW are somewhat intermediate between those obtained under models HOM and HET. Although the amount of bias was higher when model HET rather than model HOM was fitted in the first step  the accuracies of prediction were also higher for model HET. These findings must be interpreted with caution since the environmental noise simulated at the level of the residual variance was only due to a fixed effect (CG)  which is probably a situation more favorable to prediction of breeding values for residual variance than in the case of real data. An important issue when analyzing field data in a study on genetic heterogeneity of residual variance is that  if the data is not carefully collected for this purpose  it can lead to severe confounding between environmental and genetic effects  which are much more difficult to disentangle than when the focus is on analysis of the mean of a trait [  ]. We hypothesized that this type of confounding could be more marked in the case of GBW  because this trait is more influenced by maternal effects. Although more sophisticated procedures are probably needed to provide stronger support for the existence of genetic variance of residual variance of beef cattle traits  we found Ev estimates of comparable magnitude for both traits studied. Yang et al. [] verified that estimates of genetic effects on the residual variance  and also the genetic correlation between mean and variance  r  are dependent of the scale on which the data are analyzed under a structural model. However  it is not clear to which extent scale effects influence inferences under the two-step approach. Also  Yang et al. [] highlighted the importance of confirming that normality assumptions are met when genetic heterogeneity of residual variance is studied. One of the major problems of the two-step approach is that  when residuals are normally distributed  their squares approach a chi-square distribution []. Thus  even after log transformation  the distributions of the response variable in the second step are negatively skewed and leptokurtic  which violate the normality assumptions of the linear mixed model and probably explain part of the bias identified for estimates of genetic variance of residual variance in the simulations. As pointed out in Wilson and Hilferty []  it is expected that using a cube-root rather than a log transformation of squared residuals produces a response variable with a distribution that is closer to normal. Results of a preliminary simulation suggested that accuracies of sire EBV for residual variance would be higher and variance components will be less biased when using cube-root transformed squared residuals as response in the second step  especially when model HOM is fitted in the first step (data not shown). Future studies could be aimed at comparing these procedures more precisely. The two-step approach provided some evidence of useful genetic variability on the residual variance of GBW and YW  but important drawbacks were identified. Thus it would be interesting to apply more sophisticated procedures in order to obtain more precise estimates of variance components of residual variance in beef cattle. In this context  structural models implemented in a Bayesian framework are especially appealing  while REML approaches [  ] are expected to be suitable to study the genetic heterogeneity of residual variance in large populations. In the present study  attempts to fit the double hierarchical generalized linear model proposed by [] did not converge. Also  direct estimation of r and an extension of heteroscedastic models to multi-trait analyses could be the subject of future research in order to optimize selection for both average performance and increased uniformity in beef cattle. Results suggest that both genetic and environmental effects influence residual variance of weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling in Nellore beef cattle and that uniformity of these traits could be improved by selecting for lower residual variance  when considering a large amount of information to predict genetic merit for this criterion. Stronger statistical support for the action of genetic effects on residual variances was obtained when the model for the mean of each trait accounted for heterogeneous residual variances among sire families. More adequate methods are needed to study the genetic heterogeneity of residual variance in beef cattle.

The results show that it is possible to estimate  genome-wide and region-wise genomic (co)variances of mastitis resistance traits in dairy cattle using multivariate genomic models. Livestock provide a great source of data to investigate genome-wide effects on various phenotypic characteristics such as infectious diseases. There are several reasons for this  including: (1) vast amounts of phenotypic measures (milk yield in dairy cattle  litter size in pigs  daily gain in broilers etc.) are systematically recorded in modern livestock production and in Danish dairy cattle  for example  phenotypic information on a variety of traits  including clinical disease  is stored together with pedigrees in one central database; (2) important environmental factors  such as herd membership  affecting various phenotypes are recorded and animals within such groups receive rather homogeneous treatments; (3) low effective population sizes are frequent in livestock (e.g. compared with humans)  which makes it easier to predict genetic merit and (4) recently  routine genotyping using dense SNP marker panels (e.g. >50<U+2009>K) for thousands of animals has been initiated in several livestock species. In the Nordic countries (Denmark  Finland  Norway  and Sweden)  treatment of udder infections (mastitis) in dairy cattle is systematically recorded by veterinarians or farmers. However  estimates of heritability of mastitis incidence are low (i.e. 0.1 on the underlying continuous scale or 0.03 on the observable scale; [] and []  respectively). The disease can be caused by a large number of microbial pathogens []  which differ in pathogenesis and reservoir. Several studies have shown that the mammary immune response differs between pathogens [  ] suggesting that it is regulated by different genes and that mastitis caused by different pathogens should be considered as different traits. This is supported by our previous study [] in which pedigree-based analyses were conducted to estimate genetic correlations between mastitis caused by different pathogens. The genetic correlations between mastitis caused by five common mastitis pathogens     coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS)    and   ranged from 0.45 to 0.77  which implies that the mammary immune system  or the physical defense system  or both  act in a pathogen-specific manner. However  the existence of positive genetic correlations also implies the presence of pleiotropic effects or linked quantitative trait loci (QTL). Several studies have reported different heritability estimates for pathogen-specific mastitis traits [–]  indicating that they may differ between traits  although some of these differences may also be due to differences in data structure and in the method used to estimate genetic parameters. Genomic data are now used to infer either (1) whole-genome effects for the purpose of  e.g.  estimation of breeding values to select superior breeding animals or for prediction of future phenotypes such as disease risks  or (2) effects of single genes or markers  to guide the development of human or veterinary drugs through improved knowledge on the biological basis of traits. Approach (1) typically involves ‘whole genome’ models that model all SNP simultaneously  whereas approach (2) involves Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)  in which  typically  each SNP is tested individually using univariate association tests. Here  we suggest a compromise between these two approaches by employing whole-genome models in which variances and covariances are partitioned by chromosome segments. We hypothesize that this approach will capture a large portion of the genetic variance  while also providing further biological understanding of the traits in question. Investigating the effects of chromosome segments of variable size (e.g. regions of neighboring SNP  haplotypes  gene-networks  chromosomes) and correlations among segment effects on different traits may provide interesting insights into the genetic and biological architecture of disease traits such as mastitis incidence. Statistical methods for genomic analyses typically employ fixed prior parameters  which make them less suited to estimate genomic (co)variances. Models that use a genomic relationship matrix  e.g. []  could be used to estimate (co)variances using REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) but studying (co)variances per chromosome or for several chromosome segments would be computationally prohibitive. For instance  a bivariate analysis in dairy cattle with 30 chromosomes would involve 30 genomic relationship matrices and the simultaneous estimation of 90 variance-covariance components. Using multivariate genomic selection methodology [] for mastitis traits  it is possible to build a (co)variance matrix of allele substitution effects. In this study  we used a Bayesian SNP-based genomic model  which was extended to estimate hyperparameters of the prior distribution of allele substitution effects from the data. Thereby  the method makes it possible to estimate genomic (co)variances while remaining computationally feasible. Results can be used to reveal genomic regions associated with only one pathogen (pathogen-specific effects)  associated with two or more pathogens (group-specific effects)  or associated with all the pathogens (general effects). The estimated (co)variances between the allele substitution effects can also be used to compute various genetic parameters such as heritabilities and correlations; these can be computed region-wise (e.g. per chromosome) or genome-wide. The objectives of this work were to (1) present a multivariate model for genome-wide and region-wise association studies  (2) perform simultaneous estimation of genomic effects (allele substitution effects) for mastitis resistance using more than one trait  and (3) estimate covariances between traits across the chromosomes and across regions of various sizes. The data comprised records of mastitis treatments and pathogen information (results of bacteriological culturing of milk samples) from Danish Holstein cows that calved for the first time between January 1998 and January 2009 (collection period). The data were extracted from the Danish National Cattle Database. Mastitis is a difficult trait to analyze due to its low heritability and a potential bias in the treatment of cows; thus  data were edited as described in []. Briefly  data from cows that had calved after March 2008 (300<U+2009>days before the end of the collection period) were removed from the dataset to reduce the bias due to censoring. In addition  the following criteria were required for a herd to be included in the dataset: age at first calving between 19 and 36<U+2009>months for a cow to be included in the data set  participating herds with at least 30 first calvings in a given year of the collection period  and active participation in disease recording []. Information on mastitis treatments was merged with pathogen data if the recorded date of a pathogen was three days before to four days after a case of mastitis was recorded on the same cow. Only the data from daughters of genotyped bulls were included in the present study and each bull was required to have at least five daughters calving during the collection period  resulting in a dataset of 200 149 daughters of 1 844 genotyped sires. General mastitis was defined as a binary trait for the period from15 days before to 300<U+2009>days after first calving  i.e. a pheno type of “1” was assigned if a cow was treated for mastitis during this period and “0” otherwise. Only the first observed mastitis treatment for each cow was included. The five most common pathogens in Danish dairy herds  i.e.   CNS      and   were chosen to represent the pathogen-specific mastitis traits (also binary). The pathogen-specific traits were defined only for treatments with pathogen information. In contrast  the trait “general mastitis” contained all recorded (according to trait definition) treatments of mastitis  i.e. both treatments with and without pathogen information. For computational reasons  it was necessary to summarize information per sire (meta-analysis) due to the small number of sires and the large number of offspring per sire  and availability of SNP information on the sires only. Thus  PM of the mastitis traits were estimated as daughter yield deviations  as described by []. However  in the present study  a sire model was used to estimate both PM and EBV; thus PM were defined as a trait corrected for all known environmental effects and averaged over records so that they consisted of additive genetic and residual effects. For the mastitis traits  a threshold-liability model [] was applied to estimate PM. The threshold model assumes the presence of an underlying continuous random variable called liability  . The relationship between the observed binary variable   and the unobservable  is where  is a fixed threshold and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and 0 correspond to the presence or absence of mastitis for observation   respectively. It was assumed that  is normally distributed with a mean vector  and covariance matrix . Because  and  are undetermined  they were arbitrarily set equal to <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and  = 1 such that The probability () that observation  is scored as “1” given the model parameter vector   is where F(.) is the standard normal cumulative distribution. The following sire model was used to describe liability to mastitis: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>liability to mastitis of daughter  of sire  calving in year-month class  at calving age class  and in herd-year-season class ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>“fixed” effect of year-month of calving (123 classes); <U+2009>=<U+2009>“fixed” effect of calving age (17 classes); <U+2009>=<U+2009>random effect of herd-year-season (season<U+2009>=<U+2009>year divided into quarters; 22 918 levels); <U+2009>=<U+2009>transmitting ability of sire  (8 547 levels); <U+2009>=<U+2009>“fixed” regression coefficient of  on the length of the period at risk; <U+2009>=<U+2009>period at risk for daughter  of sire   defined as the number of days from 15<U+2009>days before calving to the date of culling or to the end of the risk period; it was assumed that all cows with mastitis had a completed risk period; <U+2009>=<U+2009>residual<U+2009>~<U+2009>(0 1) and independent. In matrix notation  the model for the mastitis traits can be expressed as: where  is a <U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector of the underlying liabilities of mastitis   is the number of records for each trait   is a vector of “fixed” effects as described previously   is a vector of random herd-year-season effects   is a vector of random sire effects  and  is a vector of random residual effects.    and  are corresponding incidence matrices. A full Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [] via Gibbs sampling implemented in the DMU package [] was used to fit the models and sample posterior PM. The PM were on the liability scale and were estimated from the model above as   where TD is the trait of daughter  on the liability scale and adjusted for all effects other than additive genetic effects and residuals and  is the number of daughters of bull . Independent improper uniform priors were assigned to each element of . Herd and sire effects were assigned uninformative normal prior distributions and   respectively  where  is an identity matrix   is the additive relationship matrix  and  and  are the herd and sire variances  respectively. Independent scaled inverse chi-square distributions were used for the unknown variance components ( and )  with settings so that these prior distributions were flat. Inferences were based on 600 000 samples; the first 100 000 samples were disregarded as burn-in  and every 10 sample was saved for post-Gibbs analyses. Convergence of the Gibbs chains for each model parameter was ensured using a standardized time series method of batch means [  ]. Subsequently  genetic variances of the estimated PM were estimated using a standard linear animal model with pedigree information and REML. The PM were weighted based on the standard errors of prediction (SEP) of the posterior PM samples. From the estimated variances  heritabilities for each trait PM were computed for later comparisons with estimated genomic variances. Standard errors of prediction of the posterior PM samples were calculated to construct weights for each trait included in the genomic model to adjust for heterogeneous variances of the sire records. The weights were computed as 1/SEP and scaled to achieve an average weight of 1. The scale factor used in the present study was the average weight per trait of the 1 844 genotyped bulls. By scaling the weights to an average of 1  the computed residual variances will be directly comparable with the genomic (co)variances. The bulls selected for this study were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA). The raw marker data were edited using the following criteria: (1) a locus was removed from the analyses if the minor allele frequency was less than 5%  if the proportion of animals genotyped for this locus was less than 95%  if the average GenCall score at the locus was less than 60%  and if the proportion of missing marker genotypes was larger than 10%; (2) an individual was deleted if the call rate (i.e. the overall call rate of a sample is equal to the number of SNP receiving an AA  AB  or BB genotype call divided by the total number of SNP on the chip) had a score below 0.85. After editing  1 844 bulls had daughters with mastitis and pathogen data  and 37 862 SNP were available and used in the analyses. Genomic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian model in which SNP effects  within a trait  were assumed to originate from the same normal distribution. This represents the gBLUP method [] implemented with Bayesian methodology [] and a random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain MCMC samples for variance components []. The difference between the method described in [] and the present method is that the variances are also treated as unknown model parameters in the Bayesian model  so that variances and SNP effects are jointly estimated in a single model. This allows for estimation of individual SNP effects  which allows the model to be more easily scaled up to a multi-trait analysis. Weighted residuals were used in the model and latent variables were used to model the covariances between traits within each SNP and between residuals. The bivariate model specification was: where PM and PM are vectors with PM for the two traits on a common list of individuals   and  are the PM means of each trait   are vectors of coded genotypes of the individual for <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  …   SNPs   is the random regression coefficient modeling the effect for SNP  on trait   is a diagonal matrix with 1/SEP as diagonal elements   is a vector of latent effects that models the correlated part of the residuals (note the use of the same vector  for both traits)   and  are scale factors for the effect of the latent vector  on each trait  which can be interpreted as the elements of the first eigenvector of the residual variance-covariance matrix (see below)  and  and  are the uncorrelated parts of the model residuals. The genotype coding in  was done as 2-2  2-1  and 2 for homozygotes for the first allele  heterozygotes  and homozygotes for the second allele. This is similar to []  except that  is the frequency of the first allele. Such coding standardizes the means of the genotype covariates to zero  assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotype frequencies  and the regression of such a genotype coding on the PM represents the allele substitution effect for substituting the first coded with the second coded allele. Covariances between the SNP effects were also modeled using a latent variable  but this was specified as a hierarchy in the Bayesian model. In this multi-trait model  the effects of a SNP on the two traits were correlated; therefore the variance of marker and residual effects were  and   respectively. Note that the elements of () were assumed the same across the genome. The distributional assumptions of the model parameters were: with the constraint that ||<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  where <U+2009>=<U+2009>(  )  ||<U+2009>=<U+2009>1  where <U+2009>=<U+2009>( )  and where () denotes a normal distribution with mean and variance parameter  () denotes a uniform distribution on the given interval. The modeled residual variance-covariance structure can be shown to be: where the first part corresponds to a special form of the spectral decomposition of the variance-covariance matrix   such that it can be shown that <U+2009>=<U+2009>(  ) is the first eigenvector of    is the second eigenvalue of   and  estimates the difference between the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue. In the same way  the vectors of SNP effects    are correlated through the use of common latent vectors    and the variance-covariance structure for SNP effects can be shown to have a covariance of  and variances  and . Again  ( ) can be interpreted as the first eigenvector of the variance-covariance matrix   as the second eigenvalue  and  as the difference between the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue. The MCMC estimation for this model was straightforward for         because these parameters have conditional normal distributions that are independent between traits and therefore can be updated in a “single trait manner”. Also  and  have conditional normal distributions and were updated as a regression on the vector . They were scaled to unity norm after sampling to apply the constraint on ||. The same inverse scaling was applied to the latent vector   because  and  are multiplicative in the model. Applying the same scaling to both  and  is arbitrary but forces the model to uniquely explain all the variance through  and makes parameters identifiable. The vector of latent residual effects    works across traits but its conditional distribution is also normal and derived by unifying the two trait equations into a single equation: where  Model fit was assessed by visual inspection of model residuals plotted against the reliability of the estimated breeding values (EBV) for the six traits and significance of the slope of regression line from zero was tested using a t-test. Reliability of EBV was calculated as: Posterior statistics for any function of the model parameters can be easily obtained when such a function is computed on the primary MCMC samples of the model parameters. This was applied to compute direct genomic breeding values (DGV) of individuals and genomic and residual (co)variances per chromosome and parameters derived thereof. For all these estimates  posterior means and posterior standard deviations were obtained. The genomic parameters were based on the constructed DGV of individuals which automatically take into account the covariance generated between SNP due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Markov chain Monte Carlo samples of individual genomic values for trait 1 () and trait 2 () were constructed from the MCMC samples of allele effects for the two traits ( ) as  and . Using markers only in specified intervals (e.g. per chromosome or specified blocks of SNP within a chromosome)  MCMC samples of individual DGV per interval  and  for interval  were constructed. From the MCMC samples of individual DGV  MCMC samples of genomic variances and covariances were subsequently constructed by computing     and  which was done for the whole-genome DGV and for the interval-wise DGV. Furthermore  MCMC samples of genomic correlations    were computed  and finally MCMC samples of the genomic proportions of the total variance (GPV) were computed. From these constructed MCMC samples  posterior statistics such as the posterior means and posterior standard deviations were collected. Inferences were based on 40 000 samples with a burn-in of 5 000 samples. Every 50 sample was saved and used for post-MCMC analysis. Convergence of the Markov chains was ensured by visual inspection of trace plots and plots of autocorrelations between lags for each model parameter. The number of daughters with data from individual bulls and the low heritabilities of the traits both affected the reliability of the EBV and the posterior standard deviations of the PM. For example  80% of the bulls had between 5 and 50 daughters with phenotypic information. This resulted in average reliabilities of EBV of 0.30  0.36  0.32  0.30  and 0.38 for mastitis caused by   CNS      and   respectively. The heritability of general mastitis was higher than that of the pathogen-specific mastitis traits  resulting in a higher average reliability  i.e. 0.57. Accuracy of the PM was assessed by studying their posterior standard deviations (SD). Figure  shows that the SD for general mastitis was larger when the number of daughters was low. Similar results were observed for the pathogen-specific mastitis traits (not shown).  Standard deviations for bulls with more than 2 000 daughters with data are not shown. Model fit was assessed by plotting model residuals (observed PM-DGV) against different variables. In Figure   examples of plots of residuals against reliability of EBV are shown for general mastitis and mastitis caused by . The slope of the regression line was significantly different from zero (t-test; <U+2009><<U+2009>.0.05) for all traits except  mastitis. For  mastitis  the estimation errors of the DGV clearly increased when reliabilities of the EBV reached values below 0.5. This trend was observed for all the pathogen-specific mastitis traits. For general mastitis  which had higher heritability and EBV reliabilities estimation errors of the DGV increased when EBV reliabilities were below 0.7.   Observed progeny means minus predicted direct genomic values. The average of the posterior means of GPV from the pair-wise analyses of the mastitis traits differed among traits (Table ). Among the pathogen-specific mastitis traits  the largest value was found for CNS  followed by       and . Analysis of a trait in different pair-wise trait combinations  resulted in similar GPV for the trait. As expected  the GPV of general mastitis was higher than that of pathogen-specific mastitis traits  except when compared to mastitis caused by CNS. Table   shows the pedigree-based heritabilities of the trait PM for comparison. Pedigree-based heritabilities were all smaller than the GPV but had the same ranking across traits. Genomic correlations (Table ) among the investigated traits were moderate to high (0.22 to 0.72). Genomic correlations among the pathogen-specific traits (0.22 to 0.51) were lower than genomic correlations between general mastitis and the pathogen-specific mastitis traits (0.55 to 0.72) because of their part-whole relationship  i.e. pathogen-specific cases of mastitis are part of the general mastitis cases. All chromosomes explained significant amounts of genetic variance for each trait  except chromosome X (BTA30)  which explained substantially less variance than would be expected based on its size. For example  the variance explained by chromosome X was 93% lower than expected for general mastitis. For the other chromosomes  the trend is that chromosome-wise GPV (Figure ) increases with chromosome size ( 4.0; [])  i.e. larger chromosomes tend to explained more genomic variance. This pattern was seen for all traits.  Bars reaching above the line indicate that the chromosome explains more variance than expected based on its size; GPV as bars and relative genome size as line; pathogen-specific traits    and general mastitis  . Some chromosomes deviated from the general trend and explained more variance than would be expected according to their relative size  i.e. they may contain relatively more QTL or QTL with larger effects on the trait and such chromosomes differed across traits; chromosomes with relatively large GPV were BTA6  13  14  16  19  and 26 for  mastitis; BTA1  11  14  17  19  and 20 for CNS; BTA6  11  13  14  16  19  and 21 for ; BTA3  14  17  19  20 and 25 for ; and BTA6  13  14  18  19  25 and 27 for . Additional chromosomes with less pronounced effects  but still above their expected value  were observed for most of the pathogen-specific traits. Chromosomes showing a large variance for general mastitis were BTA3  5  6  14  and 19. Only BTA19 had higher GPV than expected according to size for all traits. For all chromosomes  covariances between traits were positive (results not shown)  resulting in overall positive genomic correlations between the traits  given the default prior assumptions for the latent vector  . For all trait pairs  there was a high proportion of chromosomes with larger covariances than expected  which may indicate the presence of pleiotropic QTL. In addition  in several cases a limited number of chromosomes accounted for a major part of the total covariance  e.g. BTA3  6  10  11  13  14  16  19  21 and 29 for the covariance between  and  (Figure ).     Bars reaching above the line indicate that a chromosome explains more genomic covariance than expected based on its size; negative covariances were not observed; covariances as bars and relative genome size as line. In Figure   three examples are shown to illustrate the differences in chromosome-wise genomic correlations between pair-wise trait combinations with . Differences between chromosomes were still noticeable but were far less pronounced compared with the chromosome-wise genomic covariances. Similar to the chromosome-wise GPV  some chromosomes had larger genomic correlations than expected based on the genome-wide genomic correlation. This could indicate the presence of pleiotropic QTL  e.g. BTA16 and 19 for the combination of  and . In contrast to the genomic covariances  the genomic correlations did not depend on chromosome size but were similar across chromosomes.  AUR: ; COL: ; UBE: ; MAS: general mastitis; horizontal lines indicate genome-wide genomic correlations. BTA19 was further investigated as this chromosome showed a clear effect on all traits. Profiles of genomic variances across this chromosome were created by computing posterior variances in half-overlapping blocks of 100 SNP for each trait. This means that one computation was done for blocks with SNP 1–100  101–200 etc.  and a second computation was done for blocks with SNP 1–50  51–150 etc. and then the values of overlapping blocks were averaged to smooth out blocks of 50 SNP. In general  the genomic variance on BTA19 (Figure ) was spread across the entire chromosome  except at the chromosome ends  with regions of larger variance than average. The variance patterns differed between traits but a common peak was observed around 35<U+2009>Mb for the pathogen-specific traits except . This peak was most pronounced for CNS and . Also  a peak was observed around 10<U+2009>Mb for  and . No clear peaks were observed for general mastitis  possibly because of the composition of this trait.                                                      Establishing the profiles of genomic correlations for BTA19 as described above  revealed the pleiotropic regions along the chromosome. Figure  shows such profiles for the genomic correlations between  and the other traits. The magnitude of the genomic correlations differed between trait combinations  with the largest genomic correlations obtained between  and general mastitis because of their part-whole relationship. The genomic correlation between pathogen-specific traits was highest for  and CNS  likely because both are staphylococci. The genomic correlation between  and  was also high  while that between  and  was the lowest  followed by the correlation between  and . The positions and widths of the pleiotropic regions differed between trait combinations. For example  a very narrow region around 35<U+2009>Mb was observed for the genomic correlation between  and  while it was much wider around 30<U+2009>Mb for the genomic correlation between  and .    AUR: ; COL: ; DYS:   UBE: ; MAS: general mastitis. The estimated values for GPV express the proportion of the total variance (additive genetic variance<U+2009>+<U+2009>residual variance) of the PM that is explained by the markers and can therefore be related to the heritabilities of the PM. However  because the PM are mean phenotypes  the explained variance in PM is increased relative to heritabilities of individual phenotypes. The GPV estimates were 80% to 87% of the pedigree based estimates of heritability but almost perfectly lined up with each other. Variances explained by markers can be expected to be lower than pedigree-based variances because the markers used may not be in complete LD with the causal polymorphisms []. The ranking of the GPV across traits was slightly different from the ranking of heritabilities reported in []  in which the heritability was lowest for mastitis caused by  followed by    CNS   and general mastitis. In our study  the rankings of  and  and CNS and  were shifted around. Heritability of general mastitis was up to three times higher than that of pathogen-specific mastitis in [] while in our case when considering the mean GPV  the highest average GPV was obtained for mastitis caused by CNS. Posterior means of GPV for a trait differed little between the pair-wise analyses of the traits. This indicates that the model is robust and performs well for this parameter. However  it is not clear why we see the difference in ranking between the GPV and traditionally estimated heritabilities. This could be related to data issues such as disease incidences or reliabilities of the PM. The posterior means of the genome-wise genomic correlations were all lower than the traditionally estimated genetic correlations based on pedigree [    ]. Also  the ranking of the genomic correlations among the pathogen-specific mastitis traits was different compared with the pedigree-based results reported in []. The genomic correlations between general mastitis and the pathogen-specific mastitis traits were expected to be higher than among the pathogen-specific mastitis traits because of part-whole relationships. We did find higher values for correlations involving general mastitis but compared to []  who reported values close to unity (0.87 to 0.94) based on a linear pedigree-based sire model  the values found in the present study were much lower. We have no clear explanation for why the genomic correlations are different from the pedigree-based estimates. If all the genomic variance is captured but not all the covariance  this will lead to a lower genomic correlation and vice versa. The overall covariance could be affected by the priors used in the model  which assumed a common covariance across the genome. Genomic proportions of the total variance were also estimated per chromosome for all traits. Generally  the magnitude of the GPV was increased with size of the chromosomes. However  some chromosomes had slightly higher GPV than average compared to their size and for other chromosomes  the GPV was a little lower than expected based on size. The dependency on chromosome size can partly be explained by the number of markers on each chromosome. The model assumes a priori the same variances for all SNP  which is in line with the standard assumption in gBLUP []. Thus  larger chromosomes  which harbor more SNP  will a priori explain more variance than smaller chromosomes. In contrast to using a mixture prior for the SNP effects  a common prior will equalize the SNP effects across the genome and is less suitable to detect small differences in SNP effects. Based on the results presented here  higher than expected (based on size) chromosome-wise GPV may indicate the presence of QTL on the chromosome. Chromosomes that explained most variance may also harbor the most important QTL (major genes) affecting the trait. Clear differences in the GPV profiles were observed between the six traits. However  working at the chromosome level is likely not detailed enough to detect clear pathogen-specific regions since no clear distinctions between traits were detected regarding chromosomes which explain more variance than expected  except for BTA19  which had a relatively high GPV for all traits  including general mastitis. This may indicate that this chromosome harbors QTL with a general effect on mastitis resistance. Information about QTL in the present study could be better compared to traditional QTL methods. In contrast to multi-trait implementations of traditional QTL mapping based on linkage e.g. [–]  we used a 50<U+2009>K SNP panel and a simpler association model to perform mapping  which was possible because the marker map is dense. We also modeled all markers simultaneously to circumvent problems with false positive results and double counting of effects from correlated SNP  which was necessary to accumulate whole-genome effects. And finally  we had more animals with genotypes. Thus  our genomic model collected the effects of smaller QTL that may not be detectable by traditional QTL methods. Also  the results shown here were GPV for whole chromosomes  and a single QTL with a large effect in a chromosome may not show clearly in the total chromosome GPV. Possibly  several large QTL may have to be present in a chromosome to show a marked effect on the total chromosome GPV. In general  the genomic model used here was rather basic  as both a common variance and covariance for SNP effects were applied. It is possible to extend the model to take in account different (co)variances per chromosome or of other defined genomic regions. This would be necessary to more accurately predict effects of QTL affecting one or more traits. Also  there are different ways of defining genomic regions  which is an area that needs further investigation. Below  we discuss how for example this could be done in a rather simple way. The most interesting feature of our multi-trait genomic model is the ability to estimate covariances between defined genomic regions for each trait  which would be more difficult with other approaches. For example  with traditional BLUP estimation  it would be necessary to build 30 genomic relationship matrices and to simultaneously estimate 90 covariance components. Dividing each chromosome into several segments would further increase these numbers and the memory requirements for computation. For the present SNP-based model  the model is run once and relevant parameters are inferred from the MCMC samples. As with the genomic variances  the traditional gBLUP model [] was extended to a REML version to estimate the covariances from data. One can criticize the prior assumption that SNP contribute equal covariance as being somewhat simplistic but it is a common model used in genomic selection. Our main reason to implement this REML approach in a Bayesian context is that it makes it possible to partition covariances into genome segments. In the posterior distributions of the Bayesian model  deviations appear from the prior expectation of common covariance. We can show this by computing covariances by groups of SNP. Here  the effect of the common prior distribution is that chromosome and genome-segment covariances will be regressed towards the estimated common overall covariance  while deviations in the posterior estimates will be informative to show where the genome contributes more or less covariance. Interesting chromosomes are indicated by covariances above the average covariance of the genome or chromosome. Chromosomes showing large effects were in some cases much clearer based on covariances than based on GPV. Similar to the chromosome GPV  a clear relationship with chromosome size was also observed for the chromosome covariances. All chromosome covariances among the pathogen-specific mastitis traits were positive. This indicates that genes that control mammary response towards one pathogen (e.g. release of immune factors a.o.) to a certain degree also control response towards other pathogens. However  it is difficult to interpret the absolute differences between the chromosome covariances because our model pulls these estimates towards a common average. In reality  the chromosome covariances will be more different than shown here  but it would be difficult to estimate variances and covariances for 30 chromosomes in a fully unconstrained way. Information about chromosome-wise covariances can be useful when a QTL has been found and knowledge about potential effects on other traits is required. One could argue that chromosome covariances between traits vary more when the pathogens are more distantly related or show different infection patterns. For example  the chromosome covariances between  and  differed much more (higher covariance than expected on more chromosomes) from their expected values (based on chromosome size) than the covariances between  and  or covariances between general mastitis and the pathogen-specific mastitis traits. Also  the use of a common prior resulted in lower genome-wide genomic correlations  which quantify the relatedness between two traits. It is not clear whether our method can be used to identify chromosomes that harbor pleiotropic QTL using the current settings. According to Figure   the chromosome-wise genomic correlations plots may provide better information than genomic covariances about chromosomes that harbor pleiotropic QTL. Results for the / combination suggest that BTA16 and 19 are the only chromosomes that harbor QTL affecting mastitis caused by each of these pathogens. However  BTA16 and 19 also seem to be clear candidates for harboring pleiotropic QTL affecting both .  and . Finally  at least five chromosomes (BTA5  14  16  19  and 28) are likely to harbor QTL that affect resistance towards  and general mastitis. A QTL that affects specific mastitis must also affect general mastitis  but it may not be detected  e.g. the specific mastitis may only contribute little to general mastitis. More likely  the QTL detected for general mastitis are QTL affecting the more prevalent and multiple mastitis cases. One way to overcome the problem of averaging out QTL for the purpose of QTL mapping may be by splitting the chromosomes up into smaller regions  for example based on neighboring SNP that are in LD with each other. Then  the defined region consists of SNP that are more likely to cluster around potential QTL and the effect is not distorted by many SNP with very small or zero effects. In the present study  this was done in a simple way by computing genomic (co)variances in half-overlapping intervals of 100 SNP on BTA19 because this chromosome was the only chromosome with a clear effect on all traits. This method revealed different variance profiles between the traits. No clear peaks were detected because of the use of a common prior which  as explained above  equals out the variance across the defined regions. The peaks were more pronounced. The use of a mixed prior distribution for the SNP effect may be more appropriate to detect QTL regions. However  to date this method only works well for single-trait analyses and must be further investigated. The LD between SNP is accounted for when genomic (co)variances are calculated. This means that the total genomic variance may differ from the sum of region-wise or chromosome-wise variance  because the latter would ignore covariance between the parts. In our analysis  these sums of chromosome and region variances were smaller than the total genome-wide variance  indicating presence of negative covariances between the parts. The results from the present study show that it is possible to study  genome- and region-wise genomic (co)variances of mastitis resistance traits in dairy cattle using a multivariate genomic model. It was found that larger chromosomes explained more genomic variance than smaller chromosomes due the larger chromosomes having more SNP. Some chromosomes explained more variance than expected according to chromosome size. This could indicate that these chromosomes harbor QTL affecting the traits. Clear differences in variance profiles among the investigated traits were observed  indicating that the mammary response to infections differs between pathogens. All chromosomes explained positive covariances between the traits as a result of the model assumptions. As with the genomic variance  some chromosomes explained more covariance than expected according to their size. This could indicate the presence of pleiotropic QTL. With this methodology and PM as phenotypes  the estimated genomic correlations between the traits were found to be lower than genetic correlations estimated by traditional methods based on pedigree  which indicates that these values are not necessarily comparable. In our model  a rather simple approach was applied to model SNP effects  i.e. a common variance and covariance for the SNP effects. However  the results provide an opportunity to develop this model with different model assumptions  e.g. mixture priors for the SNP effect  which could allow the model to more accurately accommodate differences in (co)variances across the genome.

Network analysis made it possible to highlight the influence of exchanges on genetic structure and to complete or replace molecular information in establishing a conservation program. Local livestock breeds play an important role in providing food products and environmental services and are part of the cultural heritage. In 2006  179 of 1409  i.e. the total number of sheep breeds in the world were listed as “endangered” or “critical” and 417 other breeds had an unknown status []. In Belgium  ten local sheep breeds are included in the 2006 list  of which six are listed as “endangered” and four as “non endangered”. Ex situ conservation through cryobanking has been preferred to other conservation strategies (ex situ in vivo and in situ conservation) because of its lower cost and its additional benefits such as the use of cryosamples in case of an epidemic. The order of priority for the integration of the ten local Belgian sheep breeds in a cryobank has been established according to economical (population size and specific characteristics)  environmental (geographical distribution and landscape management) and cultural (age  geographical origin  etc.) criteria. Three of these sheep breeds have been chosen for the conservation program: the Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse (ESM)  the Mouton Laitier Belge (MLB) and the Ardennais Roux (AR) breeds. Characterization of the intra-breed genetic diversity is a key element to select donor animals in view of ex situ conservation in a cryopreservation program. For the Belgian sheep breeds  little information is available on the pedigrees  which may result in poor evaluation of the intra-breed genetic diversity []. Therefore  other methods based on genetic data (microsatellites) or on information about farmers’ practices and preferences have been used. Although assessing genetic diversity between sheep breeds with microsatellite data is common practice [–]  few studies have investigated the intra-breed genetic diversity in livestock breeds [–]. The observed genetic diversity in a breed can be explained by ancestral diversity  geographical isolation  natural selection  but it is mostly dependent on farmers’ practices like selection and animal exchanges. So far  the influence of such parameters has been investigated only in very specific contexts and the relationship between gene flow and genetic structure has been mainly studied at the between-breed level [  ]. Serrano et al[] have highlighted the influence of animal exchanges in the Spanish Guadarrama goat breed  which explain the high level of subdivision observed with microsatellite analyses. In a study on the genetic diversity of the Lipizzan horse  Achman et al[] have demonstrated a strong relationship between the population structure identified with microsatellite data and the gene flow evaluated with pedigree information. In a goat population of the Vietnamese province of Ha Giang  Berthouly et al[] have measured the connectivity between farmers using least-cost path analysis in which distances between populations are expressed by differences in terms of altitude  ethnic group frequencies and probability of animal exchanges by farmers. A significant positive correlation between genetic distances and least-cost path distances was highlighted  indicating that the genetic structure is influenced by the farmer’s connectivity. Taking into account the farmer’s connectivity seems to be a relevant approach to understand the genetic structure of a population. Tools such as network techniques can be useful to describe exchange practices. Network analysis has been used in veterinary epidemiology studies to analyze the impact of animal movements between herds on how diseases spread through a population [  ]. In wild species  network techniques have been used to depict the interactions between individuals []  which have been further combined with molecular methods []. More recently  McDonald [] has used both network metrics and molecular methods to investigate how social interactions are related to the genetic pattern of a population of manakin birds in Costa Rica. The correlation between the degree of separation between individuals  measured by the shortest paths between pairs of individuals in a social network of 156 manakins  and their relatedness coefficient was evaluated. To our knowledge  network techniques have not been applied to study the genetic diversity of livestock. In this study  we have investigated the intra-breed diversity at the herd level by combining two approaches: genetic markers (microsatellites) and animal exchanges between farmers. For each breed  we have correlated the genetic differentiation between herds and the network of animal exchanges between herds. Thus  this study is aimed at: (i) determining the finest genetic structure of each breed by identifying genetic groups within breeds; (ii) determining whether the network of animal exchanges between herds is linked to genetic differentiation. The results are then used to identify which individuals should be sampled to provide a good representation of the genetic diversity in the cryobank. The Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse (ESM) and the Ardennais Roux (AR) sheep breeds are both bred for meat production and for the management of natural reserves. The Mouton Laitier Belge (MLB) is bred for milk production. The lower number of rams available in the MLB breed and the absence of any selection program have led some breeders to carry out outcross breeding with other breeds such as Zealand or Dutch and German Friesian breeds. For each of the three studied breeds  a first list of breeders was provided by the breeder’s associations. Other breeders were identified during farm investigations. Five hundred and fourteen sheep belonging to 53 herds and born in 84 different herds (sampled herds in Table ) were included in the study. They were between 4<U+2009>months and 11<U+2009>years old. Not all the herds could be sampled but selection of the herds sampled was done to ensure a good representation of the breed’s diversity. A combination of the following criteria was used: number of animals  number of animal exchanges with other herds  historical importance and geographical position of the herd. The number of sampled animals within a herd ranged from 2 to 15 with an average of 9. In each of the 53 sampled herds  animals with different origins were chosen. Care was taken not to sample related animals (no full sibs for example) and to favor animals born in different herds according to available pedigree data. Most of the adult rams of the chosen herds were sampled. In order to identify possible crossbreeding in the MLB herds  reference samples were taken from Zealand  Dutch and German Friesian sheep. For the three breeds  samples were taken in “source herds”  which according to information collected during interviews of the breeders and specialists of the history of these breeds  have strongly contributed to the expansion and/or preservation of the pure breed. All the “source herds”  except one  exist since more than 25<U+2009>years. The number of sampled “source herds” for ESM  MLB and AR breeds is 3  3 and 2  respectively. Experimental procedures in animals were performed in accordance to the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the Université catholique de Louvain. Blood samples were collected and DNA was extracted. Individuals were genotyped with 19 microsatellite markers (see Additional file ) from a panel recommended by the FAO []. DNA extraction  microsatellite amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and genotyping were performed by the laboratory LABOGENA (Jouy-en-Josas  France)  using a capillary sequencer (3730 DNA Analyzer; Applied Biosystems  California  USA). Information about primer sequences  allele ranges and multiplex are available from the FAO web site []. For the three breeds and for each marker  number of alleles  observed and expected heterozygosity and Fis index were estimated using  version 4.05.2 software [].  version 3.4 [] was used to perform exact tests for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) [] for each locus  using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (100 batches  5000 iterations per batch  a dememorization number of 10 000). Unbiased estimates of the exact probabilities (P-values) were computed  and the multiple-test significance was corrected using the Bonferoni procedure [].  software [] was used to identify the presence of null alleles. For each breed  allelic richness was calculated using  software version 2.9.3 []. Global genetic differentiation was calculated by Wright’s F-statistic Fst  evaluated with  version 4.05.2 software [] among the three breeds and over herds in which the sampled animals were born for each breed. Estimations of standard deviation of Fst were obtained by jack-knifing over the loci. The genetic structure of each breed was investigated using a clustering method based on a Bayesian approach implemented in the  software []  with the admixture and correlated allele frequency model []. In each breed  the genetic structure was studied for number of hypothetical clusters from one to ten (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>1–10)  with 10 runs for each K value with 10 iterations following a burn-in period of 10. No prior information about the origin of the animals was taken into account for this analysis. Membership coefficient  of the individual’s genomes to each hypothetical cluster and averaged  for each herd and each cluster were estimated. The most probable cluster number was identified using the method proposed by Evanno et al[]. The herds were classified into genetic groups. All the herds with a membership coefficient  to the same hypothetical cluster were assigned to the same genetic group. If none of the  values were higher than 0.7  the herd was unassigned. Graphical representation of the  results was done with the  software []. In Figure 1  representing the genetic structure of the breeds  herds separated by black vertical lines  are classified into their genetic group according to the decreasing value of the higher. For each group of each breed  allelic richness  observed and expected heterozygosity  Fis indexes and exact tests for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were calculated with the same software and methods as mentioned above. In addition Fst over genetic groups were evaluated for each breed. Finally  the Reynolds’ genetic distances [] between each pair of herds with at least five genotyped animals were computed with the  version 4.05.2 software [] for each breed. This measure of genetic distances is the most appropriate in this study because this distance is directly linked to the drift effect on the population structure  which is the main process shaping the structure of populations with short divergence times as in this study []. Investigations were carried out on the breeders for each breed. We identified animal exchanges between 20  46 and 95 herds  respectively for the ESM  MLB and AR populations. For each breed  an adjacency matrix was constructed in which for each pair of herds  and   the  entry of the matrix is 1 if there are one or more animal exchanges between them and 0 if there are none. From this matrix  a visual representation of the network can be obtained  where herds are represented as vertices and the exchanges as edges. For the calculation of network metrics  the direction of the exchanges was not taken into account (undirected networks). Since genetic distances between herds depend on the animal exchanges between the herds  networks of animal exchanges for the three breeds were compared by evaluating the average degree () of the network of each breed. The average degree measures the number of exchanges between herds relatively to the number of herds and is expressed as  where  is the number of vertices and   the number of edges []. The average degree was calculated for the network of animal exchanges of each breed with all herds with identified exchanges  the first time  and only with herds with at least five genotyped individuals  the second time. Genetic structure was expected to be partially explained by animal exchanges between herds. To verify this assumption  a Mantel test [] was performed to evaluate the correlation between the matrix of genetic distances and the exchanges-based matrix called “shortest path length matrix” []. This latter was obtained from the network of animal exchanges for each breed. The matrix was built in the following way: evaluation of all possible pathways (succession of edges) between two herds for each pair of herds; identification of the shortest path(s) between each pair of herds. The value of the distance between each pair of herds in the matrix corresponds to the number of edges separating the two herds along the shortest path(s). The shortest path lengths were calculated with the  package from the  statistical program []. All the herds with at least five genotyped animals and information about exchanges were taken into account except isolated networks of herds without exchanges with other herds to avoid infinite distances. Shortest path lengths and Reynolds’ genetic distances were calculated for each pair of herds with at least five sampled individuals  i.e. 8 ESM  17 AR and 17 MLB herds. The Mantel tests were performed with the  software [] to evaluate the correlation between Reynolds’ distances and shortest path lengths. The obtained P-value is based on 10 permutations. The numbers of herds and adult individuals for the ESM and MLB breeds surveyed cover most of the populations (nine breeders out of 69 could not be contacted). Since not all the 205 breeders known for the AR breed could be contacted  interviews were restricted to 58 breeders  i.e. all breeders with more than twenty sheep registered in the flock-book (Table ). Null alleles were suspected only for the  marker in the AR breed. Thus  this marker was not taken into account for the joint analysis of the three breeds (Table ) and for the intra-breed analysis  it was used only for the MLB and ESM breeds. Observed heterozygosities were 0.52  0.64 and 0.63 and expected heterozygosities were 0.53  0.65 and 0.66  respectively for the ESM  MLB and AR breeds. The average number of alleles was 6.72  7.50 and 8.39 and the allelic richness was 6.50  6.90 and 8.09 respectively for ESM  MLB and AR. The average genetic differentiation (Fst) among the three breeds was 0.16. The overall Fst value of pair-wise comparisons among the herds was highest for the ESM population (0.17)  indicating a genetic differentiation between herds higher than in the MLB (0.11) and AR (0.10) populations. The high Fst values within each breed suggested that the level of genetic differentiation was high among herds and motivated further investigation. According to the criterion proposed by Evanno et al[]  the most probable number of clusters was two for the ESM and MLB populations (see Additional file ). Nevertheless  results with three clusters (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3) were preferred since they provide a finer picture of the structure of the population than with K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 (Figure ). Results based on two clusters are presented in the Additional file  (see Additional file ).  Each color represents a cluster; numbers in brackets: number of assigned herds in the genetic groups; numbers below the figures: herds with at least five sampled animals and source herds (*); G1  G2 and G3: genetic groups; GF: German Friesian; DF: Dutch Friesian; Z: Zealand; UA: unassigned individuals. In the ESM breed  the G3 group comprised two source herds originating from the splitting of a single ancient herd. The last herds (represented by “UA” in Figure ) could not be classified in any of the three identified groups. In the MLB breed  the first group (G1) included two source herds. The next 10 MLB herds (“UA” in Figure ) were not classified in any of the identified groups and included unassigned individuals. The last herds represented in blue in Figure  were not classified in any of the MLB groups but included animals from herds of Zealand (Z) and Friesian breeds (GF and DF). Two herds with sheep registered in the flock-book of the breed clustered with the Zealand and Friesian herds because in both herds  Friesian rams (GF for herd #68 and DF for herd #1) were used for reproduction. Thus  these herds were not considered as herds of the breed. Moreover two unassigned herds (#4 and #17) include crossbred MLB sheep with Zealand sheep which explains the genetic similarity of some of their genotyped sheep with Zealand sheep. In the AR breed  according to the criterion proposed by Evanno et al[]  the most probable K value was three (see Additional file ). One source herd was classified in the G1 group  and another in the G3 group. The last 16 herds were not classified in any of the three identified groups and included the unassigned individuals. Genetic differentiation between groups was more than two times greater for ESM (Table ) comparatively to the two other breeds. For the ESM breed  allelic richness was lower in the G2 and G3 groups than in the G1 group. For the two other breeds  allelic richness was similar in each genetic group. No significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed. The mean Reynolds’ distances between herds with at least five genotyped animals were respectively 0.21  0.12 and 0.11 for ESM  MLB and AR (Table ). As indicated by the higher Reynolds’ distance  genetic drift was more important for ESM by comparison with the two other breeds. This is due to the smaller population size of this breed (Table ) and the lower connectivity between herds. The average degree gives an evaluation of the connectivity between the herds. In our case  this network metric measures how many exchanges have occurred between herds relatively to the number of herds. Exchange networks for the three breeds are presented in Additional files    and  (see Additional files     ). All the interviewed breeders and the breeders they quoted  and not only the breeders sampled for the genetic analyses  were represented to provide a general view of the structure of the exchanges for the studied populations. The average degrees of the exchange networks between the eight ESM herds  the 17 MLB and the 17 AR herds with at least five genotyped animals were respectively 3.00  3.29 and 3.76. Although the number of herds is smaller for the ESM breed  comparison with the two other breeds was possible because the value of the average degree of the ESM network did not change drastically with the number of herds in the network (see Additional file ). Regardless of the number of herds in the network of exchanges (all herds with identified exchanges (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) or only herds with at least five sampled animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8))  the average degree was always smaller for ESM (non significant differences). As indicated in Table   the average Reynolds’ distance over pairs of herds in the network of the ESM breed is higher than the average distances observed for the two other breeds for which the average degree is higher. As expected  a higher genetic distance is a consequence of a lower connectivity between herds. It was expected that animals from herds in which breeders exchange animals would be more genetically similar than animals from herds in which no exchanges are carried out. To test this hypothesis  the correlation between genetic distances and distances based on animal exchanges was evaluated by a Mantel test. This correlation test needed two matrices of distances between each pair of herds. For each pair of herds with at least five genotyped animals  distances based on exchanges were evaluated by the shortest path length between them and Reynolds’ genetic distances were calculated. Significant correlations between these two distances were detected for the three breeds (Table ). The observed correlations for the MLB and AR breeds were lower than those for the ESM breed. In the ESM breed  the highest genetic distances were observed between herd #10 of the G1 group and the three herds of G3. None of these three herds has had exchanges with herd #10 (Figure ). If these three points were removed  the correlation was still higher in the ESM breed (0.83). : ESM; : MLB; : AR. Connectivity differences assessed by the average degree of networks could explain the correlation differences between breeds. Even if two pairs of herds in two different networks have the same shortest path length  differences in genetic distances between them could be observed if the average degrees of the two networks differ. To verify this assumption  the first step consisted in calculating the average degree of networks with pairs of herds separated by the same shortest path length. Indeed the average degree depends on the ratio between the number of exchanges and the number of herds involved in these exchanges  which can vary according to the value of the shortest path length. As expected  networks with the lowest average degree (ESM) comprised pairs of herds with the highest average Reynolds’ distances (Figure  and Table ). This can be explained by the smaller number of shortest paths between pairs of herds in these networks for the shortest path length values of 2 and 3 (Figure  and Table ). Moreover  when the shortest path length value increased  the average degree decreased and the mean Reynolds’ genetic distance strongly increased in the ESM breed while the values of the same parameters did not vary very much in the MLB and AR breeds. This is due to a higher connectivity of the herds in these two breeds (assessed by a higher average degree) comparatively to the ESM breed  resulting in a lower genetic differentiation. This can explain the higher correlation between the Reynolds’ distances and the shortest paths lengths in the ESM breed compared with the two other breeds.  Exchange networks are represented for each shortest path length (SPL) value and each breed; blue vertices: herds from the complete network with the corresponding SPL value; relation between Reynolds’ distance and average degree: only the herds with at least five genotyped animals are represented; black horizontal line: median; limits of boxes: 25th and 75th percentiles; maximum limits of whiskers: 1.5 * interquartile range from the box.  The relation is showed for each shortest path length (SPL) value; for an explanation of the graphs  cf. legend of Figure . In addition to the correlation analysis  a graphical method is proposed (see details in Additional file ) to compare two types of networks: networks drawn from Reynolds’ distances information and the exchange networks drawn from information on animals’ exchanges between each pair of herds with at least five genotyped individuals. Since genetic and network distances were correlated  they were combined to identify herds and animals of the three breeds that could be integrated in a cryopreservation program. Fifty-eight of 65 potential donors could be genetically characterized and were classified according to a priority order for their integration in the cryobank (Figure ). Firstly  36 genotyped animals representative of each group in each breed were selected (32 assigned to the genetic groups and four unassigned  i.e. genotyped animals without any membership coefficient () to the hypothetical clusters higher than 0.7). Secondly  20 non-genotyped animals with genotyped related animals and for which information on the animal exchanges from the original herd with the other herds was available were genetically characterized (17 putatively assigned to the genetic groups and 3 unassigned) using the genotypic information on their dam and sire (17) or on their grandparents (3). Thirdly  two animals were putatively assigned to the genetic groups based only on the information about networks of exchanges (see details in Additional file ).                                                      The genetic diversity and the population structure of each breed were determined by molecular analysis and significant correlations between genetic distances and distances based on animal exchanges between herds were found for each breed. The genetic diversity was studied at different levels: between the breeds (inter-breed diversity) and within the breeds (intra-breed diversity). This latter was firstly evaluated by determining the heterozygosity and the allelic richness. Secondly  the intra-breed diversity was analysed by evaluating the genetic differentiation between herds (inter-herd diversity) and between the genetic groups of herds (inter-group diversity) highlighted with Bayesian clustering in each breed. The observed and expected genetic heterozygosities are smaller than the average values detected in other studies of European sheep breeds [–  ]. The observed smaller heterozygosity for the ESM breed (0.52)  comparable to the Altamurana Italian breed (0.58) [] and the Weisses Bergschaf Alpine breed (0.58) []  could be the result of the smaller population size and a higher level of genetic drift. The allelic richness detected in the three breeds is similar (ESM and MLB) or higher (AR) than the average value obtained by Peter et al[] in a study on the genetic diversity of 57 European and Middle-Eastern sheep breeds (6.42). Sixteen of the 31 loci used by Peter et al[] were in common with our study. Genetic differentiation within the ESM  MLB and AR breeds  respectively 0.17  0.11 and 0.10  was higher than those obtained by Berthouly et al[] and Serrano et al[] in their intra-breed study of the genetic diversity of goat populations  but the number of common markers is smaller (Table ). Moreover  the intra-breed diversity is higher than the inter-breed diversity if we compare with the genetic differentiation observed between 11 Austrian sheep breeds []  57 European and Middle-Eastern sheep breeds []  nine Alpine sheep breeds []  five Italian sheep breeds [] and five Spanish sheep breeds []. This high differentiation  particularly for the ESM breed  could be explained by a strong founder effect  genetic drift and differences in the choice of individuals made by breeders. This high differentiation allowed us to identify genetic groups of herds with similar sheep in each studied breed using clustering methods. Fst values between genetic groups of the MLB and AR breeds are smaller than Fst values between herds  indicating that intra-group variation is higher than intra-herd variation. In the ESM breed  intra-herd variation is higher than intra-group variation. In comparison with the value of 0.12 observed by Guastella et al[] among nine clusters identified in the Nero Siciliano pig population  differentiation between groups is higher for the ESM breed and smaller for the MLB and AR breeds. Information from the breeders allowed us to explain the observed substructure. Indeed  the genetic homogeneity between herds of the same group can be related to a common origin of the animals or to exchanges between herds. Moreover  suspected events of crossbreeding were confirmed for the MLB breed in which crossbred animals belong to unassigned herds or herds classified in a single group with the Friesian and Zealand sheep. The lower connectivity assessed by the smaller average degree detected in the ESM breed indicates that on average an ESM breeder exchanges animals with fewer breeders than the MLB and AR breeders. This implies a lower gene flow between herds in the ESM breed  which can explain the higher average Reynolds’ distance between herds and a higher inbreeding. For a comparison  Ortiz et al[] observed an average degree of 2.44 in the network of movements of sheep between 653 holders during the initial phases of the foot and mouth disease in the UK  which is lower than what we observed  i.e. 3.00  3.29 and 3.76 respectively for the ESM  MLB and AR breeds. The number of exchanged animals between each pair of herds could not be taken into consideration because this information was not available for each herd. Ortiz et al[] did not take into account the number of exchanged animals. Nevertheless  this information is undoubtedly an important factor to consider when trying to explain genetic differentiation. Despite their interest  the indicators which we used are insufficient to quantitatively determine the gene flow between herds since the information is heterogeneous and refers to an appraisal of the immediate status of exchanges. Moreover  a gene flow approach requires a weighting of the exchanges in terms of animal numbers. The impact of farmers’ practices and more specifically of the animal exchanges on the genetic differentiation was confirmed by the significant correlations observed between genetic distances and distances based on the animal exchanges between herds  for the three breeds. This is in accordance with the study of Berthouly et al[]. The higher correlation between Reynolds’ distances and shortest path lengths between each pair of herds detected for the ESM breed compared with the MLB and AR breeds cannot be explained by missing information on herds and exchanges because we had access to all the available information about exchanges for the herds with genotyped animals. The smaller average degree () observed for the ESM breed could explain the higher correlation. A higher  means that more exchanges occurred between herds  implying more connectivity between them. Thus  two herds in a network with a higher  are in general linked by a bigger number of shortest paths between them than in a network with a lower   for the same value of the shortest path length for the two networks. This can explain the lower Reynolds’ distances observed in the AR and MLB breeds in comparison with the ESM breed  for the networks of herds with a shortest path length value of 3 and 4. The lower increase of Reynolds’ distances in relation with the shortest path length for the MLB and AR breeds is due to a higher connectivity between herds (higher ) in these two breeds. This could explain the higher correlation between Reynolds’ distances and shortest paths lengths observed in ESM. Our results show that information about animal exchanges can be used in combination with molecular data. These two types of information were used to characterize and identify herds and animals of the three Belgian sheep breeds to be integrated in a cryopreservation program. Firstly  this fine-scale study of the intra-breed diversity at the herd level allowed us to identify genetic groups and to select genotyped animals  representative of each group in each breed. Secondly  when molecular information was partial (only for relatives) or missing  information about animal exchanges was useful to assign the donor to the identified genetic groups using cluster analysis (presumed assignment). The relevance of molecular data to guide the choice of donors is higher than the relevance of network data because the network information is determined at the herd level only  is based on interviews and thus is heterogeneous in quality and depicts exchanges for a shorter span of time than the molecular information. Nevertheless  this approach was preferred to a method based on a random choice of donors when genetic information is missing and because it is neither time nor money consuming. The use of network techniques was very useful to depict animal exchanges between herds and to evaluate their level of relationship due to animal exchanges. This was necessary to calculate the correlation between genetic distances and distances based on exchanges. Moreover  differences in connectivity of the herds (in terms of animal exchanges) between breeds in relation with the level of genetic differentiation could also be highlighted with these techniques. However  until now and to our knowledge  no other study has used the networks’ techniques in combination with the analysis of genetic diversity in livestock science. Such techniques could be applied to study the diversity of livestock breeds when other information like molecular  pedigree or phenotypical data is unavailable or not reliable. Many network descriptors are available and could be useful for genetic diversity studies [  ]. Since the farmer’s connectivity depends on topography and social structure in addition to the exchange networks []  such elements have to be taken into account to understand the genetic structure if important differences exist in the area of study. Moreover  network information can be valuable when molecular information is unavailable or incomplete to establish a conservation program (in situ or ex situ). A methodology to choose donors for a cryobank that are representative of the genetic diversity of a given breed based on results from both genetic and the network analyses was developed. Such an approach could be used to establish conservation programs for endangered breeds.

Furthermore  in some cases  satisfactory results can be achieved even with less ideal data structures  i.e.  for selectively genotyped data and for traits for which the genetic variance is largely under the control of a few major genes. Estimation of genetic variance using genomic identity-by-descent relationships is especially useful for studies aiming at estimating additive genetic variance of highly fecund species  using data from small populations with limited pedigree information and/or few available parents  i.e.  parents originating from non-pedigreed or even wild populations. Estimates of additive genetic variance are commonly based on data from large pedigreed populations incorporating all known relationship information. Additive genetic relationships can be defined as twice the identity-by-descent (IBD) probability of two randomly drawn alleles  which can be estimated from pedigree data. The advantages of these pedigree-based analyses are that they do not require any knowledge about the genetic architecture of the traits and that the additive relationships are easily inferred from a known pedigree. However  these methods also have some major limitations. First  such analyses ignore relationships beyond those included in the known pedigree. Second  the assumed relationships are expected relationships (based on expected sharing of IBD alleles) rather than actual relationships. In fact  the pedigree relationship is exact only under an infinitesimal model []  i.e.  assuming that the additive genetic effects of the quantitative traits are controlled by an infinite number of unlinked loci. Under a more realistic finite-locus model (and assuming that some of the loci are linked)  the actual relationships will be distributed around the expectation  with variable relationships among full-sibs and other relatives []. By assuming (incorrectly) homogeneous relationships among the same type of relatives (e.g.  sibs)  in pedigree-based analyses  the genetic (co)variance components are estimated based on between-family variation only  since the Mendelian sampling deviations of non-parents cannot be separated from the residual (or permanent environmental) effects on the same animals []. Estimation of genetic variance based on pedigree relationships is further complicated by the fact that common environmental effects may be important for some relatives  especially full-sibs (e.g.  maternal environment  rearing environment  litter effects  etc.)  which means that the genetic variance must be estimated from covariances among phenotypes of more distant relatives (e.g.  half sibs  cousins  etc.). Due to linkage between loci within the same chromosome  parents tend to pass on long segments of DNA to their offspring. Hence  the \"effective\" number of segregating loci within a full-sib family will be much lower than the corresponding number for the whole population  even for species with a larger genome. For example  recent reports have indicated that the effective number of segregating loci among full-sib pairs in humans is only about 80 [  ]. When the effective number of segregating loci is low  the actual relationships among full-sibs vary substantially among sib-pairs. Visscher et al. [] have estimated that actual relationships among human full-sibs vary from 0.37 to 0.62  and used these relationships to quantify the additive genetic variation of human height based on within-family segregation only  i.e.  free from non-genetic factors. In this study  the heritability values were based on more than 3000 sib pairs. With such a large dataset  including numerous families  the main challenge is not to estimate between-family variation  but rather to separate genetic effects from other effects that act on a family level. Visscher et al. [] pointed out that one limitation of their method was that it required large datasets with densely genotyped individuals. Indeed  for a sib-pair design (twin study)  a large number of full-sib pairs would be needed. However  for livestock  aquaculture species and laboratory animals  population structures are usually very different from those in humans  with much larger progeny groups of either full- or half sibs (or both). Therefore  the aim of the current study was to test whether genetic variance could be accurately estimated with relatively small datasets and a limited number of families  using a population structure typical of a high fecundity species (e.g.  insects  crustaceans  fish or poultry)  and whether the results could also be generalized to species in which only one of the sexes (usually males) has a large reproductive potential (e.g.  mammalian livestock). The IBD relationships were simulated so that they closely resembled the relationships estimated with real data for humans  and thus they were typical of species with relatively large genomes. Variation in IBD sharing was simulated using a model with 80 \"effective loci\" ( ) within a family (equivalent to human genome size). Effective loci are defined as the number of independently segregating \"loci\" that would yield the same standard deviation of the proportion of genome shared among full-sibs as observed in real genomic data from human sib pairs []. Hence  an \"effective locus allele\" is not a specific mutation  but is equivalent to a long haplotype block passed on from parent to offspring. For simplicity  it was assumed that different families were unrelated and that inbreeding was zero. For an \"effective locus\"   the IBD relationship of two full-sibs was therefore defined as 0 if none of the paternal and maternal \"alleles\" (haplotype blocks) were IBD  0.5 if either their paternal or maternal \"alleles\" were IBD and 1 if both their paternal and maternal \"alleles\" were IBD. The actual relationship between two full-sibs was then defined as the average relationship across all \"effective loci\" (i.e.  representing the whole genome). An example of the distribution of actual relationships in a large simulated full-sib family is shown in Figure . Since all relationships among full-sibs are based on the inheritance of a limited number of \"effective loci\" ( = 80)  the actual relationship matrix cannot be of full rank for large size families  which introduces numerical problems in data simulation and analysis. Therefore  the relationship matrix was forced to be positive definite by adding a small positive value (10) to each diagonal element (sufficiently small to have a neglible effect on the genetic (co)variance structure).   . Nine data structures were generated  using various numbers of full-sib families (1-10) and individuals (200-1000) with data (Table ). Furthermore  three scenarios were defined (Table )  all assuming moderate heritability  but differing with respect to the distribution of genetic variance; either equally distributed over genomic regions (Scenarios 1 and 2) or located in a single region (\"one effective locus\") only (Scenario 3). Furthermore  Scenario 1 included common environmental family effects in addition to additive genetic effects  while Scenarios 2 and 3 assumed that common environmental effects were absent. All combinations of structures and scenarios were run in 50 replicates and the results were averaged over replicates. However  for single-family structures  in which all animals are necessarily within the same family environment  there was no practical difference between Scenarios 1 and 2 (the environmental family effect will be included in the overall mean). Hence  1200 different datasets were generated and analyzed. Phenotypes were generated using the following model: where  is the overall mean   is the actual IBD relationship matrix   is an identity matrix of appropriate size  the -matrices are appropriate incidence matrices and  and  are the additive genetic  common environmental and residual variances  respectively. For Scenarios 1 and 2   was set up over all \"effective loci\"  while for Scenario 3  only the first \"effective locus\" was used to calculate . The breeding values in  were then generated as: where  is a lower triangular Cholesky decomposition of   and  is a vector of standard normal deviates of length  (number of animals in the dataset). This assumes that (1) genetic variance is evenly distributed across the genome  and (2) gene effects are normally distributed  or that the aggregated effect of many genes  i.e.  the breeding values  are approximately normally distributed  even when individual gene effects are not (due to the central limit theorem). It is also assumes that the different founder alleles at an \"effective locus\" have unique allelic effects  because an \"effective locus\" contains many genes and thus contains a unique combination of alleles at these genes. All datasets were generated using the MATLAB software . The data sets were analyzed with the general linear model where  includes fixed effects of each family  or in absence of common environmental family effects  the overall mean only. If fitted  common environmental family effects were included as fixed effects due to the fact that the number of families included was very small (and the number of observations per family large) and thus the associated variance was difficult to estimate. In this model  the additive genetic effects were assumed:  where  was calculated over all genomic regions  i.e. it was assumed that the inheritance of the DNA segments from parents to offspring could be accurately traced using marker information  and genetic variance was evenly distributed over genome segments (irrespective of the simulation scenario). The genomic IBD animal model is equivalent to a genome-wide gametic model  i.e.  a model in which the original gametes received from the sire and dam and their associated actual relationships are reconstructed using genomic data []. The relationship between two individuals in the animal model is twice the average of the four gametic relationships (coancestry) for the two individuals  and the animal genetic variance is twice the gametic variance. This is the classical animal model  assuming  where  is the numerator relationship matrix (inferred from the pedigree). Furthermore  since the classical model uses only between-family variation to estimate additive genetic effect variance  environmental effects common to full-sibs could not be included in the model for this simple data structure (irrespective of whether they were present or not). For both models  variance components were estimated with restricted maximum likelihood methodology using the ASREML software package []. The genomic IBD model assumes that all animals are genotyped with a sufficiently dense marker map covering the entire genome. However  in some studies  selective genotyping of phenotypically extreme (high/low) animals within each family may be used to save costs. This may be a useful approach for QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) detection  but our aim was to evaluate whether such data could be used to estimate quantitative genetic variation as well. In these analyses  we assumed a single family with 200  500 or 1000 full-sibs  and for which only individuals with phenotypes deviating more than one residual standard deviation from the mean were genotyped. However  because including only the genotyped (phenotypically extreme) animals in the analysis would probably yield overestimated variance components  the non-genotyped animals were also included in the analysis. For the analyses  genomic IBD relationships among genotyped individuals were combined with pedigree relationships of non-genotyped individuals in a common relationship matrix [  ]. The estimated heritabilities (across-replicate means and standard deviations) for the different structures under Scenarios 1 and 2 are presented in Figures  and   respectively. For the classical pedigree-based analyses  the data structure did not make it possible to separate permanent environmental effects common to full-sibs from genetic effects  since both factors are estimated from between-family variation only (and no other relatives than full-sibs were present). Hence  the estimated heritability in the classical model was biased by the common environmental component  resulting generally in over-estimated genetic variance. Furthermore  when the number of families included in the dataset was low  the estimates also varied substantially from replicate to replicate. For the one-family designs  no between-family variation existed  and therefore  by definition  genetic variance could not be estimated with a classical pedigree-based model. However  for all the designs  the genomic IBD model was able to estimate genetic variance  due to the fact that the model inferred genetic variance from within-family variation  and multiple families were therefore not needed. Moreover  even with multiple families  the heritability estimates were unbiased and much more accurate than with the classical model. Furthermore  precision of the heritability estimate in the IBD model increased with increasing family sizes and were most precise for single-family designs (i.e.  largest family size for a given number of observations). For the latter design  heritabilities were estimated with moderate to high precision even with the smallest datasets (200 animals). . The dotted line represents the true input heritability. . The dotted line represents the true input heritability. When assuming no common environmental variance (Scenario 2)  the pedigree-based analyses were also unbiased but they were less precise than the genomic IBD analyses (Figure ). As expected  if common environmental effects were not included in the data  the precision of the estimated heritability was improved  in particular for the smallest datasets using the classical model  while the precision of the IBD model was unaffected for the largest datasets (1000 individuals). The differences between the two models were most pronounced with larger datasets with a few families. For the IBD genomic model  within-family variation dominated estimation of genetic variance  and thus reducing family sizes to give room for more families led to more imprecise estimates of genetic variance. For selectively genotyped data  the genomic IBD model was also able to estimate the genetic variance based on a single large ( = 1000) family. However  single-family estimates based on smaller samples (200 or 500) tended to be overestimated  and the precision of the estimates were reduced compared to that with full genotyping (Figure ). . The dotted line represents the true input heritability. If all the genetic variance was located in only one \"effective locus\"  and no common environmental variance existed (Scenario 3)  estimation of heritability was still unbiased for both the genomic IBD and the pedigree-based (more than one family) methods (Figure ). With larger datasets (500-1000 individuals)  the genomic IBD method was more precise  but the two methods were equally imprecise for the smallest datasets  and  in contrast with the earlier results  the single-family design yielded highly imprecise results with the genomic IBD model. . The dotted line represents the true input heritability. This study shows that tracing genomic IBD relationships using genomic information has clear advantages  not only for prediction of individual breeding values [] but also for estimation of genetic (co)variance components. Both the current and earlier studies have shown that genetic variance can be estimated based on within-family variation. In contrast  estimation of genetic variance in a classical genetic analysis is based only on between-family variation. Hence  for the latter  it is imperative that genetic and non-genetic family effects are properly separated by the model  which puts major limitations on the usefulness of family data  e.g.  resemblance among full-sibs may also be due to similarities in the environment. Furthermore  for an accurate estimation of genetic variance in a classical model  many families must be included in the study and selection of data should be avoided. However  by using actual IBD sharing among sibs instead of expected relationships  genetic variation can be quantified solely from within-family variation []  which also facilitates proper separation of genetic and non-genetic family effects (as the latter do not affect within-family variation). The current study shows that with the genomic IBD approach  genetic variance can be accurately inferred from a single family  and for a given number of observations  including more families gives less accurate results (even in the absence of common environmental effects). For a classical analysis (and in absence of common environmental effects)  Falconer and Mackay [] showed that the optimal family size for a specific number of observations under a full-sib design was  = 2/. However  using the genomic IBD approach  this formula is no longer valid. For a genomic IBD analysis  including only a single large family will maximize the precision of the predicted Mendelian sampling deviations of all family members  and there is also no need to separate genetic and environmental family effects. Furthermore  the number of families is necessarily lower than the number of individuals  and prediction of Mendelian sampling deviations is therefore more informative than prediction of family means with respect to genetic variance. Estimation of genetic variance from family means (classical model) is also sensitive to selection of data (both within and among families)  and failure to account for this is expected to give downward biased estimates of the genetic variance. In populations undergoing artificial selection  parents of the phenotyped animals are usually selected  and unbiased genetic analysis requires that the selection history is properly included in the data  i.e.  the analysis should involve data on multiple generations  which is not always available. However  selection among parents will have little impact on the within-family genetic variance (in absence of inbreeding). Since the genomic IBD model uses mainly within-family variation  it is expected to be more robust to selection among parents. Even with selective genotyping  the genomic IBD model could estimate genetic variance relatively precisely for large families ( = 1000)  although there was a tendency towards overestimated heritability values and less precise results for smaller family sizes. This may be explained by the fact that only the phenotypically most extreme individuals are genotyped and only these are informative with respect to partitioning of residual and Mendelian sampling variances. The current study assumes that inheritance of the haplotype blocks from parents to offspring is known. In real data  this is never the case but we may observe genome-wide marker genotypes and this information can be used to trace inheritance of the haplotype blocks. Furthermore  since the number of recombinations per gamete is limited  sharing of haplotype blocks within a family can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy  even with sparsely distributed genome-wide markers []. Reconstructing paternal and maternal haplotype blocks is equivalent to reconstructing the original gametes received from the sire and dam  making the genomic IBD animal model and a genomic IBD gametic model equivalent. In species with a low reproductive potential  the proposed single-family mating design is of little relevance  since large full-sib groups cannot be produced. However  some species have a high reproductive potential among males  while the reproduction of females is often limited (e.g.  in mammalian livestock). For such species  a sire gametic model may be more relevant. In such a model  the sires' gametes are reconstructed and the actual relationships between them estimated. Genetic variance can then be estimated from variation among the sires' gametes (half the within-family genetic variance)  rather than variation among individuals (sires' and dams' gametes). In this model  genetic variation due to the dams' gametes will be included in the random residual term and genetic variance may be estimated from samples of offspring (e.g.  daughters of dairy bulls). The proposed method can also be generalized to IBD tracing in more complex pedigrees  i.e.  beyond a single generation  allowing information from various types of relatives to be exploited by linkage analysis e.g.  []. More distant relatives are generally less related but their relationships are also expected to deviate more from their expected values []. Hence  distant relatives may provide additional value to estimate genetic variance  especially for populations with smaller full- and half-sib groups. However  tracing haplotype blocks over multiple generations will be more challenging (shorter DNA blocks due to more recombination) and will require denser marker maps for accurate tracing compared with the one-generation (sib) approach. The proposed method will underestimate the total genetic variance in cases where a fraction of the genome is not covered by the markers  i.e.  if some of the \"effective loci\" are not accounted for in the  matrix. For instance  if a fraction  of the genome is not covered by markers  the total variance will also be underestimated by a fraction  when the single full-sib family design is used. When the design contains several families  the between-family variances are quite accurately predicted  even if part of the genome is not covered by markers  which will recover some of the underestimation. The underestimation may be completely recovered by including a polygenic effect in the model  which has a covariance structure equal to the pedigree-based relationship matrix  requiring several families of data. Scenarios 1 and 2 in the current study assumed that genetic variance is evenly distributed over genomic regions  as assumed in the genomic BLUP (GBLUP) model []. The main difference between the GBLUP model and the genomic IBD model is that the first model uses identity-by-state (IBS) relationships  while the latter uses IBD relationships (based on marker alleles traced back to a common ancestor). The assumption that genetic variance is distributed evenly across genomic regions has been shown to be an appropriate approximation for a number of traits [  ]. However  there are also examples of the opposite assumption  e.g.  genetic variation in resistance against infectious pancreas necrosis in Atlantic salmon seems largely controlled by a single major QTL [  ]. For the latter type of traits  some of the underlying assumptions of both the pedigree-based and genomic IBD models are violated. First  within-family genetic variance will vary greatly among families  depending on the actual parental genotypes (\"effective alleles\") for the genomic region that primarily affects the trait (although it will still on average be ); in the example on Atlantic salmon  the within-family genetic variance will depend on whether or not the parents segregate for the major QTL. Second  IBD relationships in the most important linkage group(s) will dominate genetic covariance between relatives  not the overall genomic or expected (pedigree-based) IBD relationships. Still  even for such data  the genomic IBD model could estimate genetic variance more accurately than the classical pedigree-based analysis. Hence  although the genomic IBD relationships are not necessarily representative of the genetic covariance structure among sibs in this situation  they are still more informative than the pedigree-based relationships. In this setting  the differences between the classic pedigree and genomic IBD models increased with the size of the dataset (no practical difference with 200 individuals but a substantial difference with 1000 individuals). However  estimation of genetic variance within a single family was  as expected  highly prone to sampling effects. In Scenario 3  the real number of different breeding values represented within a single full-sib family is actually limited to four (two \"effective alleles\" per parent)  which explains the large between-replicate deviations in the estimated heritability. Thus  in real data  for which the underlying genetics of the trait is generally unknown  it is recommended to use more than one family for quantitative genetic analysis  even when applying the genomic IBD approach. The proposed genomic IBD method is particularly relevant for quantitative genetic studies aiming at estimating additive genetic variance of highly fecund species  using data on populations with limited pedigree information and/or few available parents. For example  genetic variance may be estimated based on a few full-sib-families with parents sampled from the wild or from non-pedigreed domesticated populations. In principle  the genomic IBD model (or equivalent gametic model) requires only a single large family for proper and accurate estimation of heritability for quantitative traits. In contrast  classical pedigree-based estimation requires the establishment of a sizeable pedigreed population consisting of numerous full- and (preferably) half-sib families to produce estimates with acceptable accuracy. Furthermore  the proposed genomic IBD model is expected to be less affected by selection among parents and will facilitate the separation of genetic and non-genetic family effects (e.g.  effects of common rearing).

However  heritability of cortisol response to stress is low in European sea bass and since it is known to vary greatly among species  further studies are necessary to understand the reasons for these differences. Farming of European sea bass ( Moronidae  Teleostei)  represents about 100 000 tons produced per year [] and attracts extensive interest as a major fish species for establishing breeding programmes to improve production traits. In fish  the most studied production traits in terms of heritability are body weight or growth  stress or disease resistance [–]. In this work  our aim was to set up European sea bass families by assigning parentage and heritability for three traits i.e. cortisol response to stress  body weight and standard body length to the progeny derived from the batch of a single spawning day. The methodology used for producing  phenotyping and genotyping the F1 population has been described by Massault et al []. In summary  the broodstock consisted of 34 females  22 males and one individual of undetermined sex originating from wild and caged fish. From this broodstock  2000 offspring were raised for 254 days under standard farm conditions and then distributed into four tanks of 45 m  each with a net covering the inner surface. After this period of acclimatization  a confinement stress was applied  which consisted in slowly pulling the inner net of each tank so that the fish were confined in a volume of approximately 0.2 m. After 4 h of confinement  the net was lifted and emptied into a tank of icy water  a process which stuns the fish within 3 min. Each group of 500 fish was numbered serially  bled  weighed and digitally photographed within 140 min after stunning  either in the morning (11 am) or afternoon (3 pm). Blood plasma was stored at -20°C for cortisol analysis and red blood cells stored in absolute ethanol for genetic analysis. Cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay and microsatellite genotyping was carried out with three multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [See Additional file . All pedigree genotypes from the 11 larger families (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>922) were checked for Mendelian errors before estimating heritabilities and correlations. Parentage assignment was implemented using three software packages [i.e.  CERVUS v.3.0; []  PAPA v.2.0; []  VITASSIGN v.1.0; []] in order to constitute families with the highest possible certainty. The genotyping error rate was set to 1%. The assignment was tested for power and performance and locus-specific polymorphism information content (PIC) values were calculated. Heritabilities and phenotypic correlations were calculated using phenotypic data collected on 930 animals. Eight animals were removed because of missing phenotypes. Thus  the dataset used to estimate heritability values comprised 922 animals  with missing values in some variables (see Table ). Heritabilities were estimated using ASReml fitting an animal model. Several fixed effects were tested (sample set  day  tube number and assay number in cortisol assays) to check if they influenced the trait in question. With the exception of cortisol  the model was  represents the phenotypic trait   the trait mean   the additive genetic effect and  the environmental effect. Only sample set was found to have an effect on cortisol and therefore  was added as fixed effect to the model. Phenotypic correlations were calculated with the software  v.10. The 1151 progeny and 56 parents were genotyped at 29 microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus varied between two and 10 and PIC values varied between 0.124 and 0.767 [see Additional file ]. A power analysis was conducted with the rarefaction method and showed that 10 loci were sufficient for a reliable assignment (details not shown). A core group of five families contributed 71.5% to the progeny  six families made a measurable contribution and 80 families only a very small contribution. This is a highly skewed family representation of at least 748 dam x sire combinations with a low effective breeding size  which might affect the estimates through the unwanted genetic drift (or limited Mendelian sampling) caused by the skewed representation. For the heritability and correlation analyses  922 offspring were used from which two females (5.9%) and 10 males (45.5%) contributed the most [see Additional file ]. Our study shows that within a single breeding day  the majority of the progeny can be produced with the contribution of just two females and 10 males  which amounts to an effective population size (Ne) of 6.7 while there were 43 participating breeders and a total number of initial individuals of 57 (Ne/N<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.12). Thus  artificial insemination provides the best guarantee to set up experimental crosses since during natural spawning the number of families with significant contribution can be small. Basic descriptive statistics for the phenotypes are shown in Table . Mean cortisol levels were constant over the time of blood collection as indicated by the horizontal regression lines in Figure  (range of coefficients of linear regression per tank -0.153 to 0.109; r<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.10).  Tanks 1  2 and 3 represent groups of fish analyzed from different tanks (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1687); please note that the Y-axis is on a log scale; the slopes of the three curves range between -0.15 and 0.11 (7.64<U+2009>×<U+2009>10<U+2009><<U+2009>r<U+2009><<U+2009>2.11<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). Heritability values for growth traits ranged from 0.54<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.21 for BW to 0.65<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.22 for SL (Table ). Such heritability estimates support the large proportion of phenotypic variation explained by the QTL detected in Massault et al. [] and the reasons are discussed therein. For response to stress  the heritability of CORT was 0.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.06. However  as noted above  the family structure is clearly suboptimal to estimate heritabilities as evidenced by the high standard errors of the estimates []. As expected  the phenotypic correlation between BW and SL was high (0.94)  whereas CORT was not phenotypically correlated to either growth trait. The genetic correlation between SL and BW was high (0.94) and that between CORT and SL or BW was negative (-0.55 and -0.60  respectively). These estimates confirm data from previous studies in European seabass []  rainbow trout [] and Nile tilapia []. The value for body weight heritability obtained in our study also agrees with estimates previously reported in European sea bass  which range from medium heritabilities (0.2 in []  0.38-0.44 in [] and 0.39 in [  ]) to high heritabilities when taking into account different environments (0.31-0.60 in []). Generally  body length and body weight have moderate to high heritability values in teleost fishes: 0.6 in Coho salmon  []  0.12-0.47 in brown trout  []  0.09-0.44 in carp  [  ]  0.38-0.79 in Nile tilapia  [  ]  0.64 (± 0.12) in cod  []  0.38<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.07 in gilthead seabream  []. To our knowledge  studies on the heritability of cortisol response to stress in fish have been limited to salmonids [–] and cyprinids []  which limits generalizations. In addition  lines with high and low cortisol response to stress have been selected in rainbow trout []. However  the heritability of cortisol response to stress appears to be variable even among related species: 0.27-0.50 in rainbow trout  [    ] and 0.60 in carp []  but only 0.05 in Atlantic salmon [  ]. These discrepancies can be partly explained by the differences in species and methodologies used to determine the cortisol response. It should be noted that the time-dependence of cortisol response to stress is a key element and a potential source of error. However  the methodology used in our study seems reliable since no apparent drift in cortisol levels with time was observed after applying the confinement stress (Figure ). A comparative study on stunning methods used in different fish farms for European sea bass reported mean levels of cortisol response similar to that obtained here  corresponding to a 5-fold increase in cortisol compared to resting values when using ice []. In a pilot study on gilthead seabream using the same methodology  a significant change in cortisol levels of a control group not subjected to stress was observed  but there was no significant additional effect of ice-water on a group subjected to confinement stress (A. Canario  unpublished observations). Thus  the methodology adopted here for European sea bass is appropriate and even 2 h after stunning  the levels of cortisol obtained are due to the response to confinement stress and should reflect individual variation. In conclusion  in European sea bass  the growth traits measured have a moderate to high heritability but the cortisol level  as an indicator of response to stress  has a low heritability. Whether this low heritability derives from an artefact or an unbalanced family structure or whether it has a true biological base needs further clarification.

The  () gene encodes a protein of unknown function in an unknown pathway. The abbreviation  originates from a study in mice with a fused toes () phenotype and other abnormalities resulting from a 1.6 Mb deleted region on mouse chromosome 8 that includes this gene. It has been suggested that mouse  could be involved in programmed cell death  limb development  craniofacial development and the control of left-right asymmetry [–].  mRNA is expressed in all murine tissues examined  with the highest signal detected in the brain and more specifically in the hypothalamus  which plays a key role in the control of energy balance []. The human  gene is more than 400 kb long and is located on human chromosome 16q12.2 . Sequence analysis has shown that the encoded protein  FTO  shares amino-acid motifs with the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases  which are involved in various processes  including DNA repair  fatty acid metabolism and posttranslational modifications [  ]. Wu et al. [] have reported that FTO is a transcriptional co-activator  which facilitates transcription from unmethylated and methylation-inhibited gene promoters and enhances C/EBPs binding to DNA  and that it may play a role in the regulation of adiposity. Studies on obesity-associated genes in humans [–] have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in  intron 1 that are associated with obesity. Additional studies have confirmed these results e.g. [  ] but not for all ethnic groups (see reviews [  ]). The porcine  gene has been mapped to the p arm of chromosome 6 or SSC6 (SSC for ) by radiation hybrid mapping and linkage analysis [–]. Whilst the porcine  gene is annotated in the Sscrofa9 draft genome assembly (see: )  unfortunately this sequence is missing from the assembly Sscrofa10.2 on which the pig genome sequence paper will be based ([]; A. L. Archibald  personal communication; ). Several polymorphisms have been detected in porcine [    ] and used in association analyses with selected growth and fat-related traits. Fan et al. [] have reported the existence of two SNP in this gene  one in intron 1 and one in exon 3 (a synonymous mutation) that are significantly associated ( < 0.01) with average daily gain on test and total lipid percentage in muscle  respectively  in a Berkshire × Yorkshire F population. Fontanesi et al. [] have identified another polymorphism in intron 4 associated with intermuscular fat deposition in the Duroc breed and with feed conversion rate in Italian Large White pigs. These results have been confirmed in subsequent analyses on Italian Duroc ( < 0.01) and commercial pig populations ( < 0.05; []). Finally  a significant association ( < 0.05) has been found between an SNP located in the 5' flanking region of  and intramuscular fat content in the Jinhua × Pietrain F reference population []. Our study was primarily aimed at investigating the association between an SNP in porcine  exon 3 and growth  carcass and fat-related traits in Meishan × Pietrain F and commercial pig populations. We also estimated the proportions of variance of four linked genes on SSC6 (     and ) on selected traits in the Meishan × Pietrain F population using single- and multi-locus models. In pig  the  (ryanodine receptor 1) gene has a role in stress resistance and also affects carcass and meat quality traits. Homozygotes carrying the  allele (stress sensitive) have heavier  shorter and leaner carcasses than homozygotes carrying the  allele (stress resistant). Allele  has a near additive effect on lean content  killing-out percentage and carcass length []. The protein encoded by the  (hormone-sensitive lipase) gene catalyzes the intracellular hydrolysis of triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters  and is involved in regulating body fat  steroidogenesis and insulin secretion. Population and genetic studies in humans have suggested that genetic variability in  could be involved in lipid metabolism and risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes []. The  gene encodes a multifunctional peptide that controls proliferation  differentiation and other functions in many cell types. Rosmond et al. [] and Long et al. [] have reported associations between an SNP in  and variation in obesity phenotype  suggesting a possible effect of the gene on obesity. DNA sampled from unrelated animals of eight pig breeds (Czech Large White  28; Czech Landrace  38; Czech Meat Pig  15; Pietrain  23; Black Pied Prestice  17; Hampshire  9; Duroc  30; Meishan  22) and wild boar (10) was used to estimate the frequencies of  alleles. Linkage mapping was performed on the Hohenheim Meishan × Pietrain three-generation pedigree [] using the CRI-MAP software  version 2.4 []. An association analysis between  genotypes and production traits was performed on two populations: () F animals from the Hohenheim Meishan × Pietrain pedigree (described in detail by []  and () commercial pigs  mostly originating from crosses (Table ). Briefly  the Meishan × Pietrain pedigree was obtained from one Meishan boar and eight Pietrain sows as founder animals and consisted of 22 F animals (three boars and 19 sows) and 316 F animals raised in uniform environmental conditions at an experimental station at the University of Hohenheim (Germany). Pigs were slaughtered at 210 days of age (SD ± 7.3 days) and had an average live weight of 96.1 kg. One hundred and forty-eight traits were recorded including eight growth and fattening traits  11 fat deposition traits  eight muscling traits  14 meat quality and stress resistance traits  and many other specific traits (muscle fibres  metabolites and protein content of the muscle  enzyme activities  fat cell number and volume  etc.). The 469 commercial pigs were maintained in air-conditioned stables of the Test Station in Ploskov of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague under standard conditions. At the start of the test  pigs had a live weight of 25-30 kg and were slaughtered at a target weight of 113 kg (SD ± 10.5). They were fed a commercial diet (wheat  barley  soybean meal and a premix of supplements of essential elements)  and dosed feed. The following performance traits were recorded: average back fat depth (calculated from back fat depth 1 i.e. above the first thoracic vertebra  back fat depth 2 i.e. above the last thoracic vertebra  back fat depth 3 i.e. above the first lumbar vertebra); intramuscular fat in  (.) and fat content of belly 2 (for information on belly 2  see []; the method used a gravimetric determination according to the Czech norm ISO 1443); fat and muscle depth and lean meat (measured with Fat-O-Meter); feed conversion. The average daily gain during the test was calculated as the ratio between live weight gained from the beginning to the end of the test and corresponding days. Due to practical and organizational reasons  individual performances were not recorded for all the animals  which explain the difference in numbers of pigs analysed for the different traits. All pigs were slaughtered according to protocols for certified European (Germany) or national (Czech Republic) slaughterhouses under the control of an independent veterinarian. To identify polymorphisms in the porcine  gene  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed based on the porcine cDNA  sequence corresponding to exon 3 of human  [Ensembl:ENSG00000140718]. The SNP reported in  intron 4 by [] was also genotyped in commercial pig breeds and crosses. Using single- and multi-locus models  the proportions of variance of three linked genes (   and ) were estimated in the Meishan × Pietrain pedigree. Additional file  contains information on PCR-RFLP conditions for    and  [see Additional file ].  PCR products obtained from wild boar  Pietrain and Meishan DNA were sequenced (ABI PRISM 3130 Sequencer; Applied Biosystem  Foster City  CA  USA) and the sequences were deposited in the public database [EMBL: FM244719 - FM244721]. Associations between  SNP FM244720:g.400C>G and quantitative traits were analysed with SAS (SAS Inst. Inc.  Cary  NC) using SAS 8.2 Version and the results of the Type III sum of squares calculation for the Meishan × Pietrain pedigree  and the GLM procedure (Type IV) of SAS 9.1 for the commercial populations. () For the statistical evaluation of the Meishan × Pietrain F family  the following model A was used: where Y = value of a trait for animal m; µ = estimated mean value of a trait; FTO = the effect of genotype class for  ( m m   m m   m p   m p   p p) with  m m being: homozygotes with both alleles  of grandmaternal origin;  m m: heterozygotes with alleles   both of grandmaternal origin;  m p: heterozygotes with alleles  inherited from both grandparents;  m p: homozygotes with alleles  inherited from both grandparents;  p p: homozygotes with both alleles  of grandpaternal origin (the genotype classes for  were created using the procedure Chrompic from the CRI-MAP package []. The maternal and paternal phase information for all animals is marked with signs for grandmaternal or grandpaternal origin for all loci included in the map calculation); month = the effect of two-month class created from slaughter date (j = 1-6); sex (k = 1  2); litterno = litter number (l = 1  2); b = linear regression value; s_age = age at slaughter of animal m; S_age = estimated average of the age at slaughter; e = random residual. Models including different genes (  as well as    and  - for more information  see []) with their genotype classes in the initial model (starting model including all non genetic independent variables) were tested stepwise to find the highest proportion of variance reduction (VR). In cases for which inclusion of another locus in the model did not result in any increase of VR (%)  only a single-locus model was retained (e.g. for meat area on .). Genes that showed no significant association remained in a combined model if their contribution to the total VR reached about 2%. () For analyses on commercial pigs  the model included the  genotype with/or without the  genotype  a crossbred combination  gender and type of diet as fixed factors  and average of age at slaughter as a regression coefficient. The statistical model B was: where: Y = value of a trait for animal n; µ = estimated mean value of a trait; FTO = the effect of  genotype (i = 1  2  3); RYR = the effect of  genotype (j = 1  2); cross = the effect of crossbred combination (k = 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8); sex (l = 1  2); diet = the effect of diet (m = 1  2); b = linear regression value; s_age = age at slaughter of animal n; S_age = estimated average of age at slaughter; e = random residual. * means that the association analysis of animals with genotype  at gene  did not include the effect of gene  and ** means that the separate association analysis of crossbred combination PNx(CZLxCZLW) did not include the effects of other crossbred combinations. The differences between genotype classes were assessed by -test. Sequence analyses identified two SNP  FM244721:g.307C>T and FM244720:g400C>G that were detected by PCR - restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using conditions presented in Additional file  [see Additional file ]. Both SNP are synonymous mutations localized in exon 3. SNP g.400C>G is identical to SNP c.594C>G as reported by Fan et al. []. Pigs of different breeds were analysed for SNP FM244720:g.400C>G (as well as for intron 4 SNP AM931150:g.276T G []) and allele frequencies are presented in Table . Linkage analysis in the Hohenheim Meishan × Pietrain family placed the  gene into the previously constructed chromosome 6 linkage map [] and the most probable order (Kosambi cM; sex averaged) was:  - 24.5 -  - 33.7 -  - 16.4 - - 6.4 -  - 15.7 -  - 1.9 -  - 0.9 -  - 1.2 -  - 1.4 -  - 3.4 -  - 15.8 -  - 3.6 -  - 14.2 -  - 9.8 -  - 16.3 -  - 50.1 -  - 20.0 - . This assignment agrees with earlier mapping results [–  ] and the  locus is most probably situated in the proximal part of the p arm since microsatellites  and  have been mapped in this region [  ]. In both the Sscrofa9 and Sscrofa10.2 draft assemblies of the pig genome  the order is  -  -  -  -   which is consistent with that of the human orthologs on chromosome 19. In contrast  the order of  and  is reversed in our linkage map. This inconsistency could be due to the short distance between the two genes (~50 kb) and the difficulty of discriminating between alternative orders by linkage analysis with limited numbers of informative meioses. However  the order of tightly linked loci has no influence on the results of genotype effects in single- and multi-locus analyses. The  g.400C>G genotypes were  in the grandsire (Meishan) and    and  in the granddams (Pietrain breed)  respectively. The genotype of the three F boars was  with alleles  and  inherited respectively from the Pietrain and Meishan grandparents. Since the genes  and  are linked (separated by ~22 cM) and since  is known to affect several carcass traits  it had to be considered as well. The grandsire's genotype at  was  and all eight granddams were  homozygotes []. The genotypes at  of the grandparents and parents of the F animals combined with the  flanking phase information made it possible to identify the grandparental origin of alleles in the F animals. The results of the association analysis for the genotype classes according to the grandparental alleles' origin are presented in Table . The genotype at  was not included as a co-factor in these analyses. If it was included as another factor in the model  the differences between estimates in the one-locus and two-locus models remained (data not shown). We consider that the recombination frequency (0.17) observed between  and  in this population makes it possible to detect specific associations between  and the traits analysed  mostly or totally independent from . In Table  attention should be paid to the  genotype classes  m p and  m p. In both cases  allele  p is of grandpaternal origin  and the two classes differ by  m and  m alleles originating from granddams (Pietrain). Table  shows that many fat-related traits (abdominal fat weight  back fat depth on . average back fat depth  shoulder fat depth  fat depth at 10th rib  loin fat depth and fat area on .) as well as feed consumption in the two classes differ significantly  with higher values for genotype  m p (i.e. with the  allele coming from Pietrain). The values for fat-related traits in this class are also significantly higher than those in classes  m m and  m m (i.e. with both alleles of grandmaternal origin). The high positive effects in the  m p class most probably represent a heterosis effect  often overdominant in comparison with other classes. However  it may not necessarily be the effect of the  genotype itself  since extensive linkage disequilibrium in this population means that in the F generation extensive haplotypes are inherited intact from the Pietrain and Meishan grandparents in the observed chromosome region  and thus other linked genes may be responsible for the heterosis effect on the fat traits. The heterosis effect was apparent when allele  m (or an allele in linkage disequilibrium with this) was present. However  the chromosome segments from both breeds led to heterosis  but if both  alleles (i.e. chromosome segments) come from the Pietrain breed (genotype  m m)  no heterosis occurred. This effect may be the result of the genetic background of the founders and consequently F pigs  and may be different in other populations. Proportions of trait variance associated with the  gene and three distally located genes (   and )  in single- and multi-locus models for several traits are summarised in Additional file  [see Additional file ]. Three genes (   and ) show strong associations in single- and multi-locus models. The covariance components (interaction effects) of  and  are often very low and indicate that combining both loci does not increase the declared variance proportion. These genes are also similarly associated with some traits  e.g. fat cuts  lean cuts and meat quality traits. The most significant variance proportion is observed for  in combination with    and  in the multi-locus model for back fat depth  whereas for meat area on .  and the metabolic trait G6P in fat tissue  it is highest in the single- and multi-locus models  respectively.  shows the most significant gene effects on weight of ham relative to half carcass weight in both model types. Commercial crossbred pigs were evaluated in two analyses: (i) with the crossbred combination PNx(CZLxCZLW) alone and (ii) with the combined populations (Table ). All animals were genotyped for SNP g.400C>G and SNP g.276T>G (see Additional file ). There was complete linkage disequilibrium between the two loci  giving two haplotypes: - and -. We used SNP g.400C>G for the analysis. All three  SNP g.400C>G genotypes were observed. Using model (B) with the genotype at  included   SNP g.400C>G was significantly associated with average back fat depth ( < 0.0001)  fat in the belly 2 ( = 0.002)  muscle depth ( = 0.02) and average daily gain ( = 0.02). The highest values for fat traits were observed in animals with genotype  and for muscle depth in those with genotype  (Table ). If only the genotype  at  was used in the  association analysis  the results were very similar (data not shown). For intramuscular fat in ham  the number of pigs analysed was rather low (Table )  so the results are inconclusive. All three  SNP g.400C>G genotypes were also observed in the combined commercial pig populations. Using model (B)  significant associations were found between the  SNP and average daily gain ( = 0.02)  average back fat depth ( = 0.02)  muscling traits (lean cuts   = 0.013; muscle depth   = 0.007) and feed conversion ( = 0.003). In this case too  higher values for back fat depth and fat depth were observed in animals with genotype  and . For the muscling traits  genotype  was the most favourable (Table ). Significant associations were also found for fat in the belly 2 and intramuscular fat in the . Values for average daily gain and feed conversion were higher in pigs with genotype  (Table ). If only the  genotype at  was used in the  association analysis  the results were similar (data not shown). Clearly  the quantitative traits studied here are under polygenic control. Tests for associations with a single gene can reveal both the effects on genetic variance of the genotypes at the gene of interest and at the genes in linkage disequilibrium with the gene of interest  only if the animals in the population analysed have similar genetic backgrounds (e.g. pure bred populations) and are subject to standardized environmental influences. These requirements are not always met  mainly for economic reasons. In our experiment  we used the commercial crossbred population PNx(CZLxCZLW) separately  in which the heterogeneity in genetic background is not so high as in the population composed of several crossbreds. However  in both this crossbred population and in the joint population composed of several crossbreds  the  SNP g.400C>G genotypes  and  were significantly associated with high values for average back fat depth. A similar situation was observed for associations between genotype  and high values for muscle depth. Effect of genetic background can be observed on F pigs from the Meishan × Pietrain family  in which the highest effects on fat-related traits  apparently overdominance  are detected in heterozygotes with allele  inherited from the Pietrain and allele  inherited from the Meishan breed. Since extended Pietrain and Meishan haplotype blocks are inherited intact in the F pigs  it was important to include in the models the genotypes of linked genes  which are known to have effects on the traits of interest  especially . We examined the proportion of genetic variance explained by  and the linked loci. In this case too  highly significant associations between  polymorphisms and back fat depth  and also meat area on . and G6P were observed. It is hypothesized that other loci on different chromosomes may also be significantly involved in the determination of each trait  as additional proportions of genetic variance (examples are given in []). Previous association analyses between pig  genotypes and fatness and growth rate traits have been performed with SNP from various regions of the gene [      ]. Although different populations were used and different traits were recorded  in all cases  genotypes at some of the SNP were associated mostly with fatness traits. In addition  this study revealed a significant effect of SNP g.400C>G (which is the same as SNP c.594C>G of Fan et al. []) on average back fat depth  with genotypes  and  having higher effects. Associations between the intronic SNP (g.276T>G) and back fat thickness have been reported for Italian Duroc and commercial pig populations [] and agree with our results on commercial populations. Allele  (and ) is associated with higher values for fat deposition  while allele  (and ) with higher values for meat traits. However  Fan et al. [] and Du et al. [] did not find any association between polymorphisms in exon 3 and the 5' untranslated region of porcine   respectively  and average back fat thickness in the Berkshire × Yorkshire F population. Zhang et al. [] have reported an association between an SNP in the 5' flanking region of  and intramuscular fat  but not with average back fat thickness  leaf fat and average daily gain in the Jinhua × Pietrain F population. There is no evidence that any of the mutations identified in the pig  gene cause the observed variation in the traits of interest. However  some of these appear to be in linkage disequilibrium with loci influencing fatness traits. Additional research is required to identify causative mutations in the chromosomal region within and flanking the  gene. In addition to association studies involving the  gene in pig  several genome scans have identified QTL on chromosome 6 in the region harbouring the  gene with effects on fatness traits (see ). However  additional genes linked to  such as  may be involved in the phenotypic variation of these traits. For example  Mohrmann et al. []  using F pigs from crosses between two commercial pig lines  found QTL located close to  for several fatness traits (side fat thickness at the 13/14th rib  external shoulder fat weight  belly weight and loin fat depth) even when adjusting for  genotypes. Paszek et al. [] detected several fatness QTL (for leaf fat  fat thickness at the 10th rib and average fat thickness) on SSC6  in the interval between markers  -  in F pigs of Meishan × Yorkshire breeds  and Óvilo et al. [] have reported a QTL for back fat thickness at the 1st rib in the interval between  and  in an Iberian × Landrace intercross. In addition to the  gene  there are several other candidate genes of interest (       and ) linked to the  locus [  ]  which may exert effects on the production traits  as shown in Additional file  [see Additional file ]. SNP FM244720:g.400C>G in pig  gene was analysed for associations with carcass and growth traits.  genotypes differ in their effects on several fat deposition traits and some carcass traits  both in Meishan × Pietrain F family and in commercial pig populations. In the commercial populations  genotypes  and  were associated with a higher average back fat depth  while genotype  was associated with a higher value for some muscling traits. In F pigs of a Meishan × Pietrain family  heterozygotes with allele  from the Pietrain sows and allele  from the Meishan boar had significantly higher values for fat-related traits in comparison with homozygotes  (from Pietrain) and  (from Meishan). The significance of the  polymorphism for these traits was further supported by the single- and multi-locus models. Results from different association studies between  polymorphisms and production traits indicate that this gene (and its flanking regions) has a major role in the variation of fatness traits. Further research will be needed to identify candidate/causative mutations in this chromosomal region. van der Hoeven F  Schimmang T  Volkmann A  Mattei M-G  Kyewski B  Rüther U: Programmed cell death is affected in the novel mouse mutant  ().

Use of logistic regression of allele frequency on phenotype makes it possible to estimate SNP effects on quantitative traits from pooled DNA samples. With pooled DNA samples  genotyping costs are reduced  and in cases where trait records are abundant this approach is promising to obtain SNP associations for marker-assisted selection. Genotyping with dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays is now common for studies on humans  laboratory animals  wild animals and livestock. In all cases  power increases with increasing numbers of genotyped individuals. Recent studies on quantitative traits in humans and livestock suggest that  for many traits  genetic variation is mainly due to a large number of regions in the genome  each having a small effect [  ]. This has led to the conclusion that much larger numbers of individuals need to be genotyped than was assumed previously. With the progress in technology  throughput and number of SNP on the genotyping assays have increased. The price of genotyping each SNP has come down by orders of magnitude but the price per individual assay has remained relatively constant. Consequently  for studies for which many phenotype records are available at a low cost  it is interesting to reduce the number of assays required by genotyping pooled samples of DNA. Research on the statistical analysis of data from pooled DNA experiments has included sources and effects of errors in allele frequency estimates  e.g. [–]  experimental design  e.g. [  ]  and methods for inferring phase and haplotype frequencies [  ]. To date  studies using DNA pooling reported in the literature concern mostly disease traits for which the phenotype is binary (diseased  not diseased) or quantitative traits that are effectively converted to binary traits by selective DNA pooling of samples from extreme performing individuals [–]. Marker effects on the quantitative trait can be estimated from the allele frequencies in the selected DNA pools []. In this paper  we propose and demonstrate a more general method to analyze pooled DNA samples when the phenotype is a quantitative trait with a continuous distribution. The effect of an SNP on a quantitative trait is measured in the units of the trait. For quantitative traits and with DNA assayed on individuals  it is usual to regress phenotype on genotype and to estimate the effect of each haploid copy of the SNP allele. As with selective genotyping []  this method produces biased estimates of SNP effects when data originates from pooled DNA. The method proposed and demonstrated here  uses logistic regression of genotype on phenotype as proposed by Henshall and Goddard. The effect of the SNP genotype on the phenotype is calculated as a function of the effect estimated in the logistic regression. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the method using a simulated dataset and show that estimates are subject to little bias. The method is also applied to a livestock dataset with genetic and environmental stratification  with a model that includes the relationship between sample pools (as suggested by Sham et al. [])  estimated from all SNP  as a covariate. Each SNP was analyzed independently to estimate SNP effects and significance levels. Conceptually  for a single SNP  a pooled sample of DNA consists of multiple haploid copies of each of the two SNP alleles  and associated with each haploid copy is a contribution to the overall pooled phenotypes. Our aim was to estimate the effect of the ratio of SNP alleles in the pooled DNA on the pool of phenotypes. Each individual contributes two haploid DNA alleles to the pool and  assuming an additive model for SNP effects  half of its phenotype to the pool of phenotypes for each haploid DNA copy. The variance of the haploid phenotypes is half the variance of the diploid phenotypes (since the diploid phenotypes are the sum of two random haploid phenotypes). If the effects associated with the diploid SNP genotypes are (-a  0  +a)  and if we assume a normally distributed error with diploid variance s  then the distribution of the haploid phenotypes is a mixture of two normal probability density functions   and    with means µ - a/2 and µ - a/2  and variance s/2  where µ is one half the diploid population mean. Let Y be a vector of haploid phenotypes  and let Z be a random variable that takes the value 1 if haploid DNA copy  contains the SNP allele associated with effect + a/2  and the value 0 if haploid DNA copy  contains the SNP allele associated with effect -a/2  and let p be the probability that Z = 1. Then  using the same derivation as Henshall and Goddard [] This can be written as where  = 2a/s and  = -2aµ/s. Both  and  can be estimated using standard logistic regression software  and the estimate of  is an estimate of the effect of the phenotype on . Our ultimate goal is an estimate of   the effect of a SNP allele on the phenotype  and we obtain this by noting that s = s + 2(1-)  where s is the diploid phenotypic variance and  is the frequency of one of the SNP alleles. Solving for a in terms of  and  gives When  = 0.5  this formula is very similar to that of Henshall and Goddard []. Including allele frequency  was not necessary in their analyses of paternal half-sib data  since within large families  the allele frequency of the paternally derived allele is always close to 0.5. In practice  a more general model  is used  where X is an incidence matrix containing covariates or stratification levels applying to the individual animals contributing to each pool  ß is the vector of effects estimated for these covariates and factors  and e is a random error term. Standard software packages for logistic regression also provide an estimate of the significance of the effect of the phenotype on the SNP allele frequencies. We used this value as our estimate of the significance of the effect of the SNP allele on the phenotype. All analyses were conducted in R [] using the glm() function  with a binomial distribution for the error and a logit link function. In logistic regression  the dependent variable is a formulation of counts of the two alternative outcomes at each level of the explanatory variable. In pooled data  these counts are unobserved so they are derived by multiplying the estimated allele frequency for the pool by the number of individuals in the pool. The explanatory variable in the logistic regression is one half the vector of mean phenotypes for each pool. We evaluated two methods for the inclusion of the effect of contemporary group in the model: i.e. (1) pre-adjusting each individual's phenotype for contemporary group and (2) simultaneously fitting contemporary group and phenotype by including contemporary group as a factor in the incidence matrix X. For comparison  we tested the logistic regression method on genotype data from individuals as well as on genotype data from pools  and also estimated effects and significance for  by regressing individual phenotypes on genotypes (i.e. without pooling)  using the model   where  is a vector of genotypes for individuals and e is an error term. For this regression we used the R lm() function. Just as with individual samples  a potential problem in estimating SNP effects from pooled DNA is the presence of hidden population stratification []. To account for this  we used all the SNP to estimate a genomic correlation matrix for the pooled samples using the first of the three methods reported by VanRaden []  except that instead of integer valued genotypes for individuals  real valued allele frequency estimates for pools were used with appropriate scaling. Then  the principal components of the genomic correlation matrix were used to account for stratification [  ] by fitting the most important eigenvectors from the principal components analysis as covariates in the model when estimating the effect of a SNP and its significance. Since our aim is to compare the analysis of pooled samples with the analysis of individual samples  rather than to examine the effect of population stratification  we took the simple approach of always fitting the first five eigenvectors regardless of their significance. The eigenvectors were fitted along with contemporary groups  and we tested both pre-adjusting the data for both contemporary group and eigenvectors  and fitting the eigenvectors and contemporary groups concurrently with the SNP. Eigenvectors were not nested within a contemporary group  since our aim was to adjust equally for population stratification regardless of the level of genetic diversity within a contemporary group. We simulated data on a population of 3000 individuals. No relationships between individuals were assumed and phenotypes consisted of the effect of a single SNP and an error term with variance s  which incorporates components due to environmental variation and all genetic effects other than the SNP under consideration. We repeated the simulation 1000 times  each time sampling and analyzing a single SNP. For each replicate  we sampled a population-wide frequency for the first SNP allele () from a uniform (0.01  0.99) distribution and a population-wide SNP effect a from a uniform (0.0  0.5) distribution. Diploid SNP genotypes were then sampled for each individual  and genotypic effects of 0  a or 2a were assigned to individuals with zero  one or two copies of the first SNP allele  respectively. Phenotypes comprised the genotypic effect plus a random error term  with a new error term for each individual sampled from a normal distribution with mean = 0 and variance s = 1.0. Individuals were ranked on phenotype and assigned to pools based on rank. To explore the effect of the number of pools  we used 2 pools for n = 1:m  with m chosen such that 2 was less than 3000  i.e. the number of individuals in the population. We calculated the mean phenotype and SNP allele frequency for each pool  with either no error simulated in the frequency estimates  or with an error component added to each allele frequency estimate. The error component was sampled from a normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.05. Since frequencies are only meaningful when between 0 and 1  if adding the error resulted in an allele frequency that was less than 0 or greater than 1  frequencies were set to 0 or 1  respectively. Records were available on 1041 female cattle born over three years and originating from two genetically diverse breeds  pure bred Brahman () and Tropical composite (predominantly ). Tropical composite cattle are widely used in northern Australia  with founder genetics from a variety of breeds  including British  (e.g. Shorthorn  Hereford)  but sometimes also Sanga (African ) and Brahman (). We analyzed hip height (adjusted for age)  measured in cm at around three years of age. Hip height is known to have a high heritability  for example Vargas et al. [] estimated a heritability of 0.65 in Brahman cattle. Contemporary groups were a concatenation of measurement date  farm of origin and cohort  i.e.  the interaction of these effects. All contemporary groups contained individuals of only one breed  so there was no need to explicitly include breed when assembling the groups. This resulted in 56 different groups  with 76 animals in the largest contemporary group and one animal in the smallest contemporary group. Groups with less than 16 animals were discarded  leaving 940 animals in 29 contemporary groups. We ranked animals on hip height phenotype within a contemporary group  and then allocated them to pools on the basis of rank within contemporary group  with approximately the same number of individuals in each pool. The smallest number of pools considered was 134 pools of six  seven or eight animals  since this made it possible to have two pools of eight animals for the smallest contemporary groups. To explore the effect of the number of pools  we also considered 268 pools of three or four animals  and 536 pools of one or two animals. Two additional analyses were conducted for comparison. First  pre-adjusting phenotypes for contemporary group and then ranking across contemporary group before allocating individuals to pools that took no account of contemporary group (and therefore breed) and second  using the 29 contemporary groups described above  but instead of pooling  using the genotype and phenotype of one randomly selected individual from each pool. Individual genotypes for the BovineSNP50 Array [] were available on each individual [  ]. Pooled genotypes were generated  as the frequencies of alleles in animals in the pool. No random error term was added to the pool genotypes. For analyses that estimated SNP and contemporary group effects simultaneously  we checked the within contemporary group allele frequency for each SNP and excluded contemporary groups with minor allele frequencies less than 0.01 for that SNP. Essentially  this removes contemporary groups in which one SNP allele is fixed. The within contemporary group minor allele frequency for pooled data was estimated as the mean of the allele frequencies of the pools  weighted by the number of individuals in each pool. For analyses on data pre-adjusted for contemporary groups  we either included all contemporary groups for all SNP or excluded contemporary groups with minor allele frequencies less than 0.01 for the SNP under analysis. For pooled data  we evaluated the logistic regression (LR) of genotype on phenotype using the significance of estimated SNP effects (expressed as minus log(p-value)  abbreviated here by MLP) and the magnitude of the estimated SNP effect a  estimated using equation (). In each case  the comparison is done with the MLP or a obtained using least squares (LS) regression of phenotype on genotype with SNP data from all individuals. For clarity in the presentation of results  generally we do not explicitly state the method (LR or LS). Where the data are referred to as \"pooled\" it is implicit that the analysis method is LR  even when the number of pools is equal to the number of individuals (since LR was also used on individual data). Where the data are referred to as \"individual\" it is implicit that the analysis method is LS. Selected comparisons are presented graphically  by plotting the MLP or a from pooled data against the MLP or a from individual data  for the 1000 replicates  in the case of simulated data  and for 1000 randomly selected SNP and all SNP with a significance value less than 1.0E-4  in the case of the cattle hip height data. For the simulated data  summary statistics from various pooling scenarios are shown in Table . Both the coefficient of determination (R) and the slope from a regression of MLP or a estimated from pooled data on the MLP or a estimated from individual data are presented. For the estimates obtained when no error in estimated allele frequency was simulated (Figure )  the estimate of a obtained from pooled data is plotted against the estimate of a from individual data. R values obtained with 128 or more pools are practically identical to those with 3000 pools (i.e. individual samples  no pooling). Thus  only results for individual samples and for 64  16 and four pools are shown graphically. With individual samples  the effect estimated using LR is smaller than the effect estimated using LS  indicating that the methods produce different estimates even when given the same (un-pooled) data. Most of the plotted points for 64 pools are masked by  or very close to those from individual samples (the order of plotting was from the smallest to the largest number of pools). As the number of pools decreases  the R falls but the slope of the regression remains fairly constant. Figure  shows the MLP associated with the estimates of a in Figure . For highly significant replicates  estimates from pooled data are less significant than those from individual data. Again  plotted points for 64 pools are masked by or very close to those for individual data. When the number of pools is reduced below 64  the significance of estimates from pooled data is reduced  as shown by the reduced slope of the regression in Table . . Estimated effects (A and C) and minus the log p-value (MLP  B and D) for 1000 replicates of a simulated SNP and simulated trait phenotypes; no genotyping error was simulated; effects or significance levels estimated using least squares regression of individual phenotype on individual genotype are on the X-axis  effects or significance levels estimated using logistic regression of pooled genotype on phenotype data are on the Y-axis; in (C and D)  only SNP with p-values greater than 1E-5 are shown. The high R between results from pooled samples and individual samples is partly due to the wide range of SNP effects simulated in the data (from 0.0 to 0.5 phenotypic standard deviations). Figures  and  present the same data as Figures  and   but focus on replicates with MLP less than 5.0 (p-value > 1E-05)  for which there is most uncertainty about whether SNP effects are real or simply due to chance. For these replicates  estimates of a and significance levels for 64 pools are almost identical to those from individual data (R for a and MLP 0.998 and 0.999 respectively  regression slope equal to 0.998 for both a and MLP). This means that the estimated effect and significance level for an SNP will be almost exactly the same regardless of whether all 3000 individuals are genotyped or 64 pooled samples of DNA are genotyped. Even with four pools only  SNP that are significant with individual samples will be identified as significant (R = 0.9)  and with 16 pools the precision will be sufficient for most purposes (R = 0.98). These are best-case results  since no error in estimating allele frequency for the pools was simulated. As expected  introducing an error with a standard deviation of 0.05 (a 5% error) reduces the correspondence between the LR and LS results (Table ). This is particularly the case for fewer pools and when effect sizes are small (MLP < 5). Minor allele frequency (MAF) affected results more for pooled samples than for individual data  probably because pooling reduces the number of genotype observations in each contemporary group. Consequently  results are presented for SNP with a population-wide MAF > 0.20  MAF > 0.05 and MAF > 0.01. To summarize results  we present the R from the regression of the results from pooled data on the results from individual data. The results from individual data were obtained using concurrent estimation of contemporary group  population stratification and SNP effects  with data from contemporary groups excluded when the within-group MAF was less than 0.01. This model is more complicated to set up because which individuals are included in the analysis varies between SNP  but we judged that this model would be less affected by any confounding of contemporary group and SNP allele frequency. Results for selected analyses are presented in Table . They show that the R are lower than for the simulated data  and fall rapidly as the number of pools is reduced. In most cases  there is little difference between the R for both breeds analyzed together and for each breed analyzed separately. The R obtained from pre-adjusted data are generally similar to those obtained from concurrent estimation  except when SNP with a MAF < 0.05 are included. For both concurrent estimation and pre-adjusted data  estimates of a from pooled data in Brahman with a MAF > 0.01 (i.e.  including SNP with a MAF < 0.05) have a very low correlation with estimates from individual data. Further analysis of the results revealed that this is due to a small number of SNP with a low MAF and with very large effects when estimated using LS on individual data  so the slope of the regression of a estimated from pooled data on a estimated from individual data is close to zero. Beef cattle hip height data  940 individuals  BovineSNP50 Array; coefficients of determination (R) between parameters (effect (a) and minus the log p-value (MLP)) estimated using a logistic regression (genotype on phenotype  individual or pooled data) and least squares regression (phenotype on genotype  individual data); SNP effects were either estimated concurrently with contemporary group and population stratification effects  or estimated on data pre-adjusted for those effects; in all rows except for the last  pooling was within contemporary group; results are presented for SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.20  0.05 and 0.01  for combined breed analyses and within breed analyses To further illustrate the relationships that appear in the top three rows of Table  (MAF > 0.20 and concurrent fitting of contemporary groups  population stratification and SNP effects)  estimated effects and significance levels are plotted in Figure . The correspondence between the methods is not as good as for the simulated data  especially when the number of pools is below 536. The ranking of estimated SNP effects or significance levels differs between pooled data and individual data. In particular  the most significant SNP are more significant with individual data or more pools  than with fewer pools  suggesting that pooling causes a loss of sensitivity. . Beef cattle hip height  estimated effects (A  C and E  in cm) and minus the log p-value (MLP  B  D and F) for 1000 randomly chosen SNP and for those with p-values less than 1E-4; effects or significance levels estimated using least squares regression of individual phenotype on genotype are on the X-axis  effects or significance levels estimated using logistic regression of pooled genotype on phenotype data are on the Y-axis; effects were estimated across breeds (A and B)  within the Tropical composite breed (C and D) and within the Brahman breed (E and F). Results obtained by analyzing a dataset with the phenotype and genotype of one randomly chosen individual from each pool are also presented in Table . When less than 100% of individuals are analyzed  for the same number of DNA assays  results from pooled data are far more correlated with results from individual data than are results from a subset of individuals. We evaluated an alternative approach to the analyses described above  by pre-adjusting the phenotypes for contemporary groups  and then allocating animals to pools across breeds and contemporary groups. Clearly  this is not appropriate for such data because of the presence of two genetically divergent breeds; however a comparison of models is interesting since in some data  the existence of a genetic effect such as breed may not be known to the researcher. Even without pooling (i.e.  940 individual phenotypes and genotypes) and only including SNP with a MAF > 0.20  estimates were worse under this model than when pre-adjustment was performed after pooling (Table  R of 0.91 and 0.99  respectively for MLP). For 940 individuals  these models differ only in the order in which fixed effects are fitted: the eigenvectors from the principal component analysis are identical. With less than 940 pools the eigenvectors from the principal components analysis differ according to whether pooling is performed before or after adjustment  and results for adjustment for contemporary groups before pooling are worse than for pooling within contemporary groups. To explore the effectiveness of using principal components to adjust for population stratification in pooled DNA samples  the first and second eigenvectors are plotted in Figure . Regardless of the number of pools  there is a clear separation between the Tropical composite and the Brahman populations. In Figure   the second and third eigenvectors for Tropical composite cattle are plotted. Clusters of pools were defined in an ad hoc manner for 134 pools (panel D). Then  when pools were split into 268  536 or 940 pools  the new pools retain the color of the \"parent\" pool. Pools in the most distinct cluster (in pink) for 134 pools remain together regardless of the number of pools  but all become somewhat overlaid  and for 940 pools (panel A)  there is little power to discriminate between pink  grey  yellow and half of the blue pools. For different numbers of pools  the principal components may explain different aspects of the variation. In Figure   the second and fourth eigenvectors are plotted with pools having the colors derived for the second and third eigenvectors  as in Figure . For 940 pools (panel A)  the pink pools form a cluster characterized by high values for the fourth principal component and it is this cluster that is well characterized by the second and third principal components for 134 pools. .

For cattle from the Tropical composite breed  plots of eigenvalues for the third principal component over eigenvalues for the second principal component from a genomic correlation matrix estimated using individual genotypes () or genotype data from 536 ()  268 () or 134 () pools; pools in (D) (134 pools) were colored on the basis of an ad hoc clustering  and when these pools were split to create 268 and 536 pools  or 940 individuals  pools retain the color of their \"parent\" pool. . For cattle from the Tropical composite breed  plots of eigenvalues for the fourth principal component over eigenvalues for the second principal component from a genomic relationship matrix estimated using individual genotypes () or genotype data from 536 ()  268 () or 134 () pools; pools have the same color as in Figure 4. This study demonstrates that if SNP allele frequencies can be accurately measured in pooled samples of DNA  then SNP effects can be estimated for quantitative traits. Furthermore  in the datasets tested  these estimates are similar to those estimated when all individuals are genotyped. As the number of pools assayed increases  the estimates become more similar to those from individual genotype samples. With individual samples  the logistic regression of genotype on phenotype does not give identical results to least squares regression of phenotype on genotype. Thus  as the number of pools increases  estimates from logistic regression converge to a different value to that from least squares regression of phenotype on genotype. This is most notable for SNP of very large effect  where estimates from logistic regression are more conservative than those from LS. When no error in estimating pool allele frequencies is included  as for the simulated datasets used in this study  logistic regression with 128 pools per contemporary group produce almost identical estimates to those obtained using logistic regression with individual samples. There is no advantage in genotyping more than 128 pools per population  unless all individuals are genotyped and a regression of phenotype on genotype is performed. However  when an error (SD = 0.05) in estimating pool allele frequencies is introduced  the results are not nearly as good  and it is clear that controlling error will be very important in assembling pools and genotyping the pooled samples. With the beef cattle hip height data  as the total number of pools increases  and therefore also as the number of pools per contemporary group increases  the results converge toward those for 940 pools (i.e. LR on individual data)  suggesting that the strategy of pooling within contemporary groups and fitting contemporary group in the model is effective. This is important  as it may also be the most efficient way to organize an experiment. For example  it makes it possible to increase the size of an existing study by including estimated allele frequencies from pooled samples from additional contemporary groups  rather than having to pool the new samples with samples that have already been genotyped in the existing study. Furthermore  pre-adjusting the data for contemporary group and pooling based on adjusted phenotypes did not perform well in our study. In most cases  it made little difference whether phenotypes were pre-adjusted for contemporary group and stratification effects (after pooling) or whether estimation was done simultaneously. The only exception was for SNP with a small MAF and even then it was not the pre-adjustment itself that caused the difference  but the inclusion of data from contemporary groups in which only one SNP allele was present. A weakness of our analysis of the beef cattle data is that SNP allele frequencies for pools are estimated from individually assayed DNA samples  instead of from assays of pooled DNA. As such  our results are upper bounds for the performance of methods with pools  achievable only if the allocation of DNA to pools and subsequent assay introduces no error. However  our approach allowed us to consider a greater range of pooling strategies. The motivation for assaying pooled samples of DNA rather than individual samples is to reduce costs. However  pooling DNA places restrictions on the experimental design and on the parameters that can be estimated  as discussed by Craig et al. [] and others. For binary traits  it is difficult to include continuous covariates in the model. This is less of a problem with quantitative traits  as the individual phenotypes can be pre-adjusted for covariates  possibly using estimates from a larger dataset. The existence of population stratification has also been noted as a problem for pooled DNA analyses but in this study we successfully included information on the relationships between pools of individuals in the model. This is appropriate for the hip height data  since it is likely that some phenotypic similarities between pools are due to relatively close relationships. Many SNP that are not necessarily close to causal mutations may be in strong linkage disequilibrium with causal mutations due to recent common ancestry. The eigenvectors estimated using principal component analysis of the genomic correlation matrix show clear relationships to those from DNA from individuals (Figures    and ). An alternative to fitting these eigenvectors in the model would be to fit the correlation matrix itself as a random effect in the logistic regression estimation model. With pooled DNA  only the effects of haploid SNP alleles can be estimated  so the estimates cannot be used in models with dominance or epigenetic (imprinting) effects. If SNP are sufficiently dense and all possible haplotypes are known in advance  then haplotype frequencies for pools can be estimated  as suggested by Barratt et al. []. The method described here assumes two haploid SNP alleles  which makes it unsuitable for SNP haplotypes  where more than two alleles are usually present. However  if the number of SNP in the haplotype is greater than the number of haplotype alleles in the population  then haplotype allele frequencies will be more accurately estimated than single SNP allele frequencies. These haplotype allele frequencies are easily collapsed down into estimates of SNP allele frequencies  suitable for use with the methodology proposed here. For livestock quantitative traits  individual SNP effects are often small and an estimate of the breeding value or sum of the SNP effects for an animal is required. Methods currently used to estimate breeding values using high-density SNP genotype data apply distributional constraints to the estimated SNP effects to avoid over-fitting []. Some modifications to these methods will be required for pooled DNA  for which the genetic merit of selection candidates with individual DNA assays will be predicted from phenotyped individuals with pooled DNA. While the modifications are conceptually straightforward  they may pose computational problems. Analyses using the Gibbs sampler such as BayesA or BayesB [] are already computationally demanding for large datasets  and fitting a logistic regression model requires more computer time than fitting least squares regression. However  with pooled DNA there are fewer observations to fit and it remains to be seen whether this reduction in data size will compensate for the increase in computational complexity. Our use of the genomic correlation matrix to correct for population stratification relates to another approach that is used to estimate genomic breeding values in livestock: the use of the genomic correlation matrix in place of a pedigree derived relationship matrix [–]. Under this model  there is no need to estimate the effects of individual SNP and this is probably a more computationally tractable approach for pooled data also. With pooled DNA samples  an estimate of the effect of an SNP on a quantitative phenotype can be estimated using a logistic regression of the pooled allele frequencies on the pooled mean phenotypes. For a simulated dataset with 3000 individuals and no error in estimating allele frequencies for pooled samples  there was little benefit in having more than 128 pools  unless all individuals were genotyped. With the livestock data  consisting of 940 individuals from two breeds distributed over 29 contemporary groups  having more pools was always an advantage. However  for a fixed number of assays  pooled samples produced far better results than one random individual assayed from each pool. Models that include the relationship between pools derived from a genomic correlation matrix can be used to account for hidden population stratification. Pooling across contemporary groups based on adjusted phenotypes with relationships between pools included in the model was for our data inferior to pooling within contemporary groups. This suggests that choosing the model and understanding and correctly fitting contemporary group structure are important in studies with pooled DNA data.

Such consequences could be alleviated by appropriately designing and optimizing breeding schemes i.e. by improving selection and mating procedures. We studied the effect of mating designs  random  minimum coancestry and minimum covariance of ancestral contributions on rate of inbreeding and genetic gain for schemes with different information sources  i.e. sib test or own performance records  different genetic evaluation methods  i.e. BLUP or genomic selection  and different family structures  i.e. factorial or pair-wise.

However  with a factorial family structure  differences in rates of inbreeding due mating designs were minor. Moreover  non-random mating had only a small effect in breeding schemes that used genomic evaluation  regardless of the information source. It was concluded that minimum coancestry remains an efficient mating design when BLUP is used for genetic evaluation or when the size of the population is small  whereas the effect of non-random mating is smaller in schemes using genomic evaluation. Selection and parent mating patterns are the two major components of a breeding program and must be optimised with respect to genetic gain (<U+0394>G) and rate of inbreeding (<U+0394>F). In the literature  several selection and mating designs have been reported that aim at reaching a high <U+0394>G and/or low <U+0394>F [  ]  since a high <U+0394>F represents a risk for the long-term success of breeding programs. While there is a consensus on selection procedures [  ]  many mating designs have been developed  mostly aimed at avoiding the mating of parents that are more related than average [  –]. Factorial mating consists in producing half sibs from male and female parents at the expense of full sibs  while preserving offspring numbers per parent []; with minimum coancestry mating (MC)  relationships between mating pairs are minimized to minimize progeny inbreeding []; with compensatory mating  parents with a small number of selected sibs are preferably mated to those with a large number of selected sibs []. More recently  Henryon [] considered mating animals by minimizing the covariance between ancestral contributions (MCAC)  which allows the impact of future changes in ancestral contributions to be less mutually dependent and favours the selection of animals with optimum contributions from their ancestors. All these mating schemes have shown some benefits in increased genetic gain and/or reduced inbreeding but comparisons reported in the literature have not concluded on any clearly superior mating design  partly because only a limited number of mating designs were considered in each of the comparisons. All studies mentioned above have used evaluation methodologies that rely on phenotype alone or combined with pedigree to provide best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) estimated breeding values (EBV). Recently  the concept of genomic evaluation has been introduced in animal breeding []  in which the prediction of the total genetic value of selection candidates is based on dense genotyping data and estimates of SNP effects  which are calculated from a genotyped and phenotyped training set of individuals from the population under selection. One of the reported benefits of this approach is that the accuracy of EBV increases thanks to an improved prediction of the Mendelian sampling term. The consequence is a potential reduction of <U+0394>F in selection schemes [] because it reduces the emphasis put on family information and increases that on the individual's own merit. Hence  it is time to re-examine the benefits of non-random mating given the methodological developments in genomic selection (GS). Therefore  this study aims to assess the interaction between genetic evaluation methodology and non-random mating designs and their impact on <U+0394>F and <U+0394>G. It compares the impacts of pair-wise versus factorial family structures and performance-testing versus sib-testing  which differ in their information source  the candidate and sibs of the candidate  respectively. Such structure and testing designs are common variants in aquaculture breeding schemes. We simulated a Fisher-Wright population with an effective population size of 1000 and 4000 generations to construct a base generation G0 for use in subsequent selection. The population had a diploid genome with a total length of 10 Morgan with 10 chromosomes  each 1 Morgan long. SNP mutations were introduced in all generations used to generate G0 at a rate of 10 per base pair per meiosis  assuming 1 000 000 base pairs per cM. Parent to offspring transmission of SNP followed Mendelian inheritance. A period of 4 000 generations has been shown to be sufficient to achieve mutation-drift equilibrium []. In each of the 4 000 generations  n = 500 males and n = 500 females were produced by random selection (with replacement) of a male and a female parent. The same procedure was repeated 100 times to create 100 replicates. In G0  200 male and 200 female candidates were randomly sampled  i.e. n = n = 200  and  if appropriate  another sample of identical size was randomly chosen as test sibs. From G0 until G12  n sires and n dams were selected and mated according to the procedures described below. Each mating produced 2n offspring per mating pair  equally divided between males and females  where n = n = 25 (or 50)  with 2n = 2  8 or 16 depending on the family structure (see below). The total number of candidates in each generation G1 to G12 was 400  equally divided between males and females  with an additional 400 if required for sib testing. In aquaculture breeding programs  the fixed cost of conducting a test is an important resource constraint  rather than the variable cost of producing additional sibs for testing  if testing is necessary. In G0  a random sample of 1 000 SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 were considered as quantitative trait loci (QTL). Allelic values were assigned to the QTL by independent sampling of effects from the Laplace distribution. The QTL effects were assumed to be additive and effects were standardized such that the total genetic variance (variance of breeding values) was 10. Phenotypes were also created assuming a heritability of 0.4 or 1. If the heritability was 1  the phenotype was equal to the true breeding value but if it was 0.4  an environmental deviation was drawn independently from N(0  15) and added to the true breeding value for G0 to G12. Our objective was to track  = 5 000 markers from G0 onwards and since more SNP were generated than needed SNP with the highest MAF were selected from those not selected as QTL. We studied the effect of selection and mating on <U+0394>F and <U+0394>G with either a performance test of the candidates (CAND) or a sib test (SIB). In the CAND schemes  the candidates were directly recorded for the trait under selection. In the SIB schemes  the full sib families were divided into two sets  i.e. one set was recorded for the trait and one set provided the candidates for selection. This is the case if the trait is for instance a disease challenge or a meat quality assessment resulting in the death of the tested individuals. Selection among the candidates was performed by truncation selection of n sires and n dams based on the EBV provided by genetic evaluation. Two types of genetic evaluation were considered: (1) BLUP  based on pedigree and phenotypes; and (2) GS using a set of 5 000 SNP  which were assumed to have been genotyped on all individuals of a given generation. BLUP evaluations were done according to the standard methodology of Henderson []. Genomic evaluation followed the GS-BLUP model [] for n phenotypes with  SNP loci: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is the standardized number of a reference allele (allele \"1\") for animal  and SNP  as assessed by SNP i.e. where  is the frequency of allele \"1\" at SNP j   is the number of alleles \"1\" genotyped for animal i at SNP   is the effect of allele \"1\" at locus j  and  is the vector of random errors assumed to be drawn from N. The elements x form the incidence matrix . The SNP effects were estimated as From the above mixed model equation  is the vector of estimated effects at the marker loci  and . The variance of each marker effect was assumed to be . Finally  the genomic EBV (  ) for selection candidate i was estimated as Two family structures were studied: (1) The first was a pair-wise family structure (PAIR)  where identical numbers of sires and dams  i.e. n = n = 25 (or 50)  were selected every generation and each sire was only mated to one dam  to produce 25 (or 50) full-sib families. Each full-sib family had 2n = 16 (or 8) offspring  with an equal sex ratio. Thus  a total of 400 candidates were produced every generation. For the SIB schemes  the 2n offspring were doubled to produce test sibs (2) The second structure was a factorial family structure (FAC)  where identical numbers of sires and dams  i.e. n = n = 25 (or 50)  were selected every generation and mated so that each sire was mated with 8 (or 4) dams and each dam was mated with 8 (or 4) sires  producing 200 full-sib families  with 2n = 2  with 25 (or 50) paternal half- sib families and 25 (or 50) maternal half-sib families. Three mating designs were studied: (1) Random mating (RAND)  in which selected sires and dams were paired by random sampling without replacement from the candidates (2) Minimum coancestry mating (MC)  where the sets of male and female mating pairs were chosen in order to minimize the average coancestry between the mates  as calculated from the pedigree. Randomly-chosen parents were swapped until a decrease in coancestry was observed  at which point the swapped parents were retained  as in []. This was repeated until no more improvement was achieved. (3) Minimized covariance of ancestral contributions mating (MCAC)  in which contributions of each ancestor to each candidate were calculated and the covariance between the contributions for the proposed set of male and female mating pairs was minimised []. Starting from the random mating design  parents were randomly chosen and swapped until the MCAC mating criterion improved and then the swapped parents were retained. The process was stopped when no further improvement of MCAC was achieved. The three mating designs (RAND  MC and MCAC) were tested for all combinations of evaluations (BLUP or GS)  family structures (PAIR or FAC)  information sources (CAND or SIB)  and h (0.4 or 1). This amounts to a total of 48 comparisons. An additional comparison was made considering an increased number of parents (n and n). For each scheme  <U+0394>G and <U+0394>F were calculated. <U+0394>F was computed as the negative of the slope of the regression of ln(1-F) on t for F-F where F is the level of inbreeding at generation t  <U+0394>G was computed as the difference in genetic level between G12 and G6 divided by 6. The use of generations 6 to 12 made it possible to reach a near-Bulmer equilibrium and to stabilize the degree of assortative mating. Each simulation was replicated 100 times and the replicates were averaged. Standard errors of the mean were calculated from the variance between replicates. Tables    and  present rates of inbreeding (<U+0394>F) and genetic gain (<U+0394>G) generated under different evaluation methods (GS or BLUP)  information sources (CAND or SIB)  family structures (FAC or PAIR)  and mating designs (RAND  MC and MCAC) for discrete generations with an initial heritability of 0.4 or 1. Figure  shows a summary of the results. . RAND or random mating (<U+25A1>)  MC or minimum coancestry () and MCAC or minimizing covariance of ancestral contributions mating () mating designs with black color for the BLUP/SIB scheme: where n = 25 and n = 25 parents were selected on BLUP EBV using sib information; with grey color for the GS/SIB schemes: where n = 25 and n = 25 parents were selected on GW EBV using sib information; the family structure of the breeding schemes was either factorial (FAC) or pair wise (PAIR)  h = 0.4. The effect of the genetic evaluation method was obtained by comparing the <U+0394>F and <U+0394>G generated under GS/CAND and BLUP/CAND  GS/SIB and GS/CAND schemes (Table ) using the RAND mating design. For PAIR family structures  a 0.016 (40%) reduction in <U+0394>F and a 0.096 (14%) increase in <U+0394>G were observed when candidate records were used for GS evaluation compared to BLUP evaluation. There was a 0.063 (70%) reduction in <U+0394>F and a 0.291 (60%) increase in <U+0394>G when sibs of the candidates were recorded for genetic evaluation (Table ). For FAC family structures  a 0.004 (9%) reduction in <U+0394>F and a 0.098 (13%) increase in <U+0394>G were observed when the candidates were recorded and a 0.017 (51%) reduction in <U+0394>F and a 0.216 (37%) increase in <U+0394>G when sibs of the candidates were recorded (Table ). The pattern was similar when the intensity of selection and heritability were increased (Results not shown). Similar results were reported in [  ]  in which sib records were used for BLUP and GS evaluation. The effect of information sources for schemes with BLUP and GS evaluation is presented in Table . The results show that non-random mating designs reduced <U+0394>F by a greater factor for schemes with SIB information than for those with CAND information. For example  MC had a lower <U+0394>F than RAND under the BLUP/CAND (0.021 i.e. 52% higher) and the BLUP/SIB (0.055 i.e. 61%) schemes. Similarly  MCAC had a lower <U+0394>F than RAND under the BLUP/CAND (0.007 i.e. 17%) and the BLUP/SIB (0.025 i.e. 28%) schemes. Hence  these results show that a larger reduction in <U+0394>F was generated by MC mating compared to MCAC mating. <U+0394>G was always higher in schemes with CAND information compared to schemes with SIB information and MC and MCAC had a higher <U+0394>G than RAND. For example  MC had a higher <U+0394>G than RAND for the BLUP/CAND (0.057 i.e. 6%) and the BLUP/SIB (0.062 i.e. 13%) schemes; MCAC also had a higher <U+0394>G than RAND for the BLUP/CAND (0.057 i.e. 8%) and the BLUP/SIB (0.044 i.e. 10%) schemes. The differences in <U+0394>F between schemes with GS evaluation were smaller than those with BLUP evaluation  irrespective of the information source. As shown in Table   MC and MCAC had a lower <U+0394>F than RAND for the GS/CAND (respectively  0.009 i.e. 38% and 0.001 i.e. 2%) and the GS/SIB schemes (respectively  0.011 i.e. 42% and 0.002 i.e. 6%). MC and MCAC generated somewhat higher <U+0394>G than RAND: 0.033 i.e. 4% for the GS/CAND scheme and 0.025 i.e. 3% for the GS/SIB scheme. <U+0394>G was always higher in the schemes with CAND information than in schemes with SIB information. However  compared to the <U+0394>G generated by RAND  higher rates of <U+0394>G were observed by MC and MCAC  especially in the schemes with SIB information. These results show that mating designs such as MC and MCAC can generate higher <U+0394>G when BLUP evaluation uses sib information compared to candidate information. In general  compared to schemes with BLUP evaluation the effect of information source (CAND or SIB) was smaller in schemes with GS evaluation (Table ). The impact of family structure (PAIR or FAC) on <U+0394>F and <U+0394>G was assessed by comparing schemes with BLUP evaluation in Table . The effect of MC and MCAC on <U+0394>F was larger in the schemes with a PAIR family structure than in those with a FAC family structure. For instance  under the BLUP/SIB scheme  MC and MCAC had a lower <U+0394>F (respectively  0.055 i.e. 61% 0.025 i.e. 28%) than RAND in schemes with a PAIR structure; whereas  in schemes with a FAC structure  MC and RAND had a similar <U+0394>F and MCAC had a lower <U+0394>F (0.002 i.e. 6%). Likewise  MC and MCAC had a higher <U+0394>G than RAND in schemes with a PAIR structure (respectively  0.062 i.e. 13% and 0.44 i.e. 10%) but in schemes with a FAC structure  MC had a higher <U+0394>G than RAND (0.008 i.e. 1%) and MCAC had a similar <U+0394>G. The impact of family structure on <U+0394>F for schemes with GS evaluation was evaluated by comparing schemes with GS evaluation in Table . In non-random mating designs  <U+0394>F was lower for schemes with a FAC structure than for schemes with a PAIR structure. For instance  comparisons for the GS/SIB schemes shows that MC and MCAC led to a lower <U+0394>F than RAND in the schemes with a PAIR structure (respectively  0.011 i.e. 42% and 0.002 i.e. 6%) and with a FAC structure (respectively  0.001 i.e. 7% and 0.001 i.e. 4%). Similarly  comparisons for the GS/SIB schemes show that MC and MCAC had a higher <U+0394>G than RAND in the scheme with a PAIR structure (respectively  0.026 i.e. 3% and 0.025 i.e. 3%) but in the scheme with a FAC structure  MC had a higher <U+0394>G (0.004 i.e. 1%)  while MCAC had a lower <U+0394>G (0.012 i.e. 2%). Similar contrasts were observed for the BLUP/CAND and the GS/CAND schemes. Thus  these results show that the mating designs consistently reduced <U+0394>F and increased <U+0394>G more for schemes with a PAIR structure than for schemes with a FAC structure. In addition  for schemes with a PAIR structure  the effect of mating design was higher with BLUP evaluation than with GS evaluation. Also  the effect of mating designs decreased when the selection intensity decreased (see Tables    and ). The results indicate that increasing heritability generally slightly decreased <U+0394>F but substantially increased <U+0394>G for both family structures. For example  when heritability was increased from 0.4 to 1 for the BLUP/SIB schemes with a PAIR family structure  RAND  MC and MCAC had a lower <U+0394>F (respectively  0.070 i.e. 78%  0.022 i.e. 62% and 0.044 i.e. 68%) and a higher <U+0394>G (respectively  0.425 i.e. 92%  0.463 i.e. 89% and 0.441 i.e. 88%) (Tables  and ). The same comparisons with a FAC family structure are shown in Tables  and . Similarly  for the GS/SIB schemes  when heritability was increased from 0.4 to 1  RAND  MC and MCAC had a lower <U+0394>F (respectively  0.008 i.e. 29%  0.002 i.e. 14% and 0.005 i.e. 19%) and a higher <U+0394>G (respectively  0.143 i.e. 19%  0.151 i.e. 19% and 0.14 i.e. 18%) (Tables  and ). Similar results were obtained for the BLUP/CAND and the GS/CAND schemes (Results not shown). Heritability had a similar effect on <U+0394>F and <U+0394>G when the intensity of selection was increased (Results not shown). Overall  increases in <U+0394>G due to increasing heritability were larger for schemes with a PAIR structure than for schemes with a FAC structure. This study was designed mainly for aquaculture breeding schemes. However  the conclusions can be extrapolated to any domesticated species. We examined the effect of non-random mating when genetic evaluation  information source  family structure and heritability varied. The approach maintained a constant intensity among candidates with truncation selection and examined differences in <U+0394>F and <U+0394>G. The primary findings were that non-random mating designs had less impact on schemes with GS evaluation than on schemes with BLUP evaluation  and that this impact was greater for schemes with a PAIR structure than for schemes with a FAC structure and also greater for schemes with SIB information than for schemes with CAND information (Figure ). We also compared MC with MCAC  a novel method proposed by Henryon []  but found that differences between these mating designs were small  with the balance of evidence pointing to MC as being more effective. Among the different scenarios  the greatest effects of non-random mating  both for MC and MCAC  were a reduction of <U+0394>F rather than an increase of <U+0394>G. Selection intensity () was held constant  with truncation selection  and in such schemes the primary selective advantage is the individual's breeding value or its components (the EBV and prediction error) []. In such a system  <U+0394>F increases with []  thus one can expect that if <U+0394>F instead of  had been held constant across schemes  then substantial benefits in <U+0394>G would have emerged for the schemes with a low <U+0394>F. This is because  would need to be reduced in schemes with a greater <U+0394>F  and thus <U+0394>G would decrease as it is directly proportional to . This dependence of <U+0394>F on  explains why more than two-fold increases in <U+0394>F were observed when the number of parents per sex was halved (cf. Tables   ). If the comparisons were performed with optimum contribution selection []  then a broadly similar outcome may be anticipated  although some differences may occur as the selective advantage with optimum contributions is the estimated Mendelian sampling term [] distinct from truncation selection where the selective advantage is the individual's breeding value or its components []. The outcomes of two of the dimensions of this study  GS versus BLUP and CAND versus SIB are driven by the increased accuracy of estimation of Mendelian sampling terms. Increased accuracy of Mendelian sampling terms in truncation selection reduces <U+0394>F primarily by reducing the importance of inherited selective advantages that are conferred by parents to offspring  as parental EBV have less weight in the selection decisions made on candidates. In the context of genomic evaluation and BLUP  the additional accuracy and impact on <U+0394>F have been highlighted by Daetwyler []. The use of sib-testing is an extreme example  whereby all information for selection among the candidates is derived from their sibs; this sib information helps to increase the accuracy of the EBV of the sire and the dam  and through them the candidate  but provides no direct information on the candidate's Mendelian sampling term. Hence the benefit in <U+0394>F from using Cand versus SIB is smaller since the candidate's own performance does allow an estimate of the Mendelian term. A heritability equal to 1 was included in this study to explore the impact of increased evaluation accuracy in schemes with SIB information. In schemes with CAND information  h = 1 is the same as mass selection for both BLUP and GS and the impact of non-random mating on mass selection has been explored by Caballero []. For schemes with SIB information  the contrast between BLUP and GS is strongest when h = 1  since with BLUP the lack of information on Mendelian sampling terms of candidates remains  but with GS the accuracy of Mendelian sampling term estimates is expected to be high. This impact was observed  with substantial increases in <U+0394>G  and with the greatest reductions in <U+0394>F occurring in schemes using genomic evaluations rather than BLUP  for which the reductions in <U+0394>F were relatively small. In the schemes using genomic selection  the number of animals tested in genomic evaluation was not large enough to achieve an accuracy of 1. However  it is plausible that such accuracy could be achieved in the future. In this case  the outcome would be different from those simulated in this study as there would be no need for the SIB testing  and then both CAND and SIB testing would proceed as if it was mass selection by truncation on a recorded phenotype with h = 1. In this case  there would still be potential to reduce <U+0394>F for the same <U+0394>G by using a FAC family structure  by using MC and other non-random mating schemes  and by using optimal contribution selection []. Schemes with a FAC structure are mating designs that do not depend on non-randomness  neither in relation to pedigree nor EBV. Such schemes consistently generated lower <U+0394>F compared to schemes with a PAIR structure (Table ). These results are in agreement with almost all previous studies [  ] where lower <U+0394>F were generated in schemes with a FAC structure compared to schemes with a hierarchal family structure  and extend this result to schemes using genomic evaluation. One published exception to this finding of a benefit from a FAC family structure was in aquaculture []  when restrictions were placed on family tanks (i.e. full-sib families) but the results of that study are ambiguous and need further clarification. The benefit of FAC family structures has been shown to result from the reduced variance in selective advantages by reducing the component of variance due to mates []. This is achieved by 'averaging' mate effects over a greater number of individuals. This is in contrast to PAIR family structures  where the selective advantages of the mates are completely confounded. Future selection decisions should reduce the deviation of long-term contributions of the ancestors from their optimal contributions. Relative to RAND mating  non-random mating designs substantially reduced <U+0394>F in schemes with a PAIR structure  but the differences were minor in the schemes with a FAC structure  most likely due to the improved structure already conferred by FAC. MC and MCAC both aim at improving family structure for selection but use different approaches: MCAC chooses mates to minimize the covariance of ancestral contributions  whereas MC minimizes the expected variance of contributions of the ancestors for a randomly chosen offspring. The latter is because the sum of squared contributions of the ancestors weighted by their within-family variance equals the diagonal of the relationship matrix  i.e. 1 + F of the offspring. Thus minimizing F by MC mating is approximately equivalent to minimising the sum of squares of contributions  and thus the variance of the contributions of an individual  since the mean contribution is not affected by the mating scheme. The justification for MCAC is that lower covariance among ancestral contributions allows future selection to shift individual contributions towards optimum values [  ]  with less cost in inbreeding per unit change. In contrast  the smaller variance among ancestral contributions that is targeted by MC helps to minimize their changes when some offspring are selected. With the simulated schemes  the results suggest that minimizing the variance of contributions per offspring is more effective than minimizing the sum of covariances of ancestral contributions over all of the offspring. This could justify the use of MC instead of MCAC. This study examined the benefits of non-random mating in simulated schemes with different scenarios. The conclusion is that non-random mating is more beneficial when the evaluation is based upon sib test records than candidate records. Changing the family structure from pair-wise to factorial was always beneficial in reducing rates of inbreeding but reduced the benefits from non-random mating per se. In this study  non-random mating was shown to be more beneficial with BLUP evaluation than with genomic selection.

Acknowledging the dynamic behavior of mastitis during lactation and taking into account that there is more than one binary response variable to consider  can enhance the genetic evaluation of mastitis.MethodsGenetic evaluation of mastitis was carried out by modeling the dynamic nature of somatic cell count (SCC) within the lactation. The SCC patterns were captured by modeling transition probabilities between assumed states of mastitis and non-mastitis. A widely dispersed SCC pattern generates high transition probabilities between states and vice versa. This method can model transitions to and from states of infection simultaneously  i.e. both the mastitis liability and the recovery process are considered.

Acknowledging the dynamic behavior of mastitis during lactation and taking into account that there is more than one binary response variable to consider  can enhance the genetic evaluation of mastitis. Genetic evaluation of mastitis was carried out by modeling the dynamic nature of somatic cell count (SCC) within the lactation. The SCC patterns were captured by modeling transition probabilities between assumed states of mastitis and non-mastitis. A widely dispersed SCC pattern generates high transition probabilities between states and vice versa. This method can model transitions to and from states of infection simultaneously  i.e. both the mastitis liability and the recovery process are considered. A multilevel discrete time survival model was applied to estimate breeding values on simulated data with different dataset sizes  mastitis frequencies  and genetic correlations. Correlations between estimated and simulated breeding values showed that the estimated accuracies for mastitis liability were similar to those from previously tested methods that used data of confirmed mastitis cases  while our results were based on SCC as an indicator of mastitis. In addition  unlike the other methods  our method also generates breeding values for the recovery process. The developed method provides an effective tool for the genetic evaluation of mastitis when considering the whole disease course and will contribute to improving the genetic evaluation of udder health. Mastitis is a common disease in dairy cattle with severe economic consequences []. It has been shown that susceptibility to the disease varies between breeds and individuals  with heritabilities ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 [  ]. Genetic evaluation of the disease is an important issue and a wide range of methods is available. Methods can be divided into cross-sectional or longitudinal approaches. Cross-sectional methods consider each lactation as a static process  whereas longitudinal methods model changes in disease states during the lactation. The variables mostly used in mastitis analyses are recorded cases of clinical mastitis (CM) or somatic cell counts (SCC). Routine recording of CM is not performed in most countries and SCC can be used as a proxy in the genetic evaluation  due to its high genetic correlation with CM [–]. Cross-sectional analyses of recorded cases of CM consider either CM as a binary variable  distinguishing between absence of cases and occurrence of at least one case during lactation  or the lactation average SCC. A shortcoming of these methods is that they ignore the dynamic nature of mastitis  e.g.  multiple cases of mastitis or the longitudinal SCC pattern. The dynamic nature of mastitis is taken into account to various extents in longitudinal approaches  for example by counting the number of CM cases during a lactation using a Poisson model [] or by modeling presence or absence of CM in pre-specified lactation intervals using a longitudinal threshold liability model  which gives as many heritability estimates as intervals [  ]. Other longitudinal methods include time in lactation either as a variable in the model  e.g.  time to first case in a survival analysis []  or as an explanatory variable in a random regression model  making heritability a function of time [–]. In [–]  SCC was analyzed longitudinally  using different patterns based on deviations from the typical SCC curve  to investigate how these patterns might be related to pathogen-specific cases of CM. Traits derived from lactation SCC data have also been used to capture longitudinal features such as mastitis intensity through the number of peaks (consecutive SCC test days above a certain level)  recovery pace through peak lengths  and lactation fluctuation by the standard deviation of SCC [–]. In longitudinal studies  the degree at which the dynamic nature of mastitis is accommodated varies  but research in this field is moving to more sophisticated methods in which the longitudinal approach is one aspect that is stressed. Results from such studies show that considering the longitudinal aspect improves the genetic evaluation of CM. We present an alternative longitudinal approach in which genetic evaluation of mastitis is performed based on changes in SCC during lactation. These changes are captured by modeling transition probabilities between assumed states of mastitis and non-mastitis. The method simultaneously models the transition probability of developing mastitis and the probability of recovering from an infection. The former has been the focus of many studies but the infection recovery process has been little investigated. In our approach  we model both aspects to capture as much genetic information as possible from the SCC lactation pattern. We assumed that during lactation a cow can move between two possible states: mastitis and non-mastitis  referred to as diseased (D) and healthy (H) states. A pre-specified SCC level marks the boundary between the states. The boundary  varies along the lactation according to a multiple  of an average lactation curve  for primiparous cows  according to where  is time in lactation  starting at calving.  was modeled by a spline function  parameterized according to data in the Jälla research herd  University of Agricultural Sciences  Uppsala  Sweden []. Two different values of  were used ( and ). The probability of moving from a healthy to a diseased state for cow  is denoted  and the probability of moving from a diseased to a healthy state  . The transition probabilities for cow  may be summarized in a transition matrix    which gives the probabilities of changing states or remaining in the current state. A transition between two particular states is repeatable  i.e. a cow can be in a specific state more than once during a given lactation. An episode is defined as the duration of each state; after a transition  a new episode begins  leading to multiple episodes within the lactation. The transition probabilities reflect the SCC fluctuations. A widely dispersed pattern  i.e. with many fluctuations between high and low SCC levels  will generate higher values of  and  (high transition probabilities between states) and lower values of  and  (low probabilities of remaining in a current state)  compared to values for an individual with a SCC pattern similar to the average lactation curve. A desired structure of the transition matrix would be to have high values of  and  (obviously together with low values of  and )  which reflect an individual who rarely develops mastitis but if it does  has a quick recovery. When modeling survival data with repeated events  such as repeated mastitis cases during lactation  multilevel models are effective and powerful tools []. In these models  repeated transitions are viewed as an extra level in a higher level hierarchical structure. Here  we use a three-level structure  in which episodes are nested within cows  and herds and sires are cross-classified on the highest level. Data for mastitis and SCC are most often interval-censored  i.e. the actual time for a transition between states is unknown. When data is collected retrospectively  a state change is only known to have occurred at some point between two data collection times. Although the underlying process is continuous  the structure of the data calls for a model that recognizes its discrete nature. Therefore  a continuous time survival model such as the Cox proportional hazards model [] was rejected in favor of a multilevel discrete time survival model. Statistical descriptions and evaluations of multilevel survival models with repeated events can be found in [–]. By restructuring and expanding the dataset  the multilevel binary response model can be fitted using logistic regression  as in our study  or using other standard methods for discrete response data. The transition probability  is the discrete equivalent of the continuous time hazard function and is defined as the probability that a transition occurs at some time between any two measurements for cow   daughter of sire   and member of herd . The model for the transition probability of moving from a healthy to a diseased state    is expressed as: where  = 1 if a transition occurred in time interval  and otherwise = 0. A more complete description of the binary variable  and the definition of  are given in the \"Data expansion\" section. Variables  and  are random sire and herd effects and  is the random residual effect. The transition probability of recovery   i.e. the probability of moving from a diseased to healthy state  is modeled in a corresponding way  with random effects    and  The two transitions probabilities are expressed conditional on the current state. In a given interval  a cow can only change states in one direction (or stay in the same state). As shown by Allison [] and Browne et al. []  the likelihood function for a discrete time multilevel model is equivalent to the likelihood for the regression analysis of a dichotomous dependent variable. Therefore  the multilevel discrete time model can be fitted using standard software packages for logistic regression  where the response variable is the binary indicator of the occurrence of an event  or . The choice of inference of the model is open to both a classical or a Bayesian estimation approach  however  the modular nature of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms in Bayesian inference make them an attractive choice to estimate discrete time repeated events []. In addition  it has been shown that Bayesian estimates are less biased than maximum likelihood estimates for random-effect logistic regression models []. In this paper  Bayesian estimates were obtained with the multilevel software program MLwiN  which is developed by the Centre of Multilevel Modeling  University of Bristol []. This software offers the choice of classical or Bayesian estimation and has many features and options to fit multilevel models  including parameter expansion  which is discussed in the next section. The MCMC approach in MLwiN consists of iterative Metropolis-Hastings (MH) and Gibbs sampler steps to successively update the model parameters. Gibbs sampling is used for variances and univariate-update random-walk Metropolis sampling with Gaussian proposal distributions for fixed effects and residuals. For a complete description of the MCMC steps and conditional densities  see [  ]. Vague priors were used. The variances of the random effects had an inverse Gamma prior with small parameters and a uniform prior was used for the fixed intercepts (): Estimates of parameters in the HD direction were based on 10 000 iterations with a burn in of 500  whereas estimates in the DH direction were based on 100 000 iterations with a burn in of 5000. The strongly reduced dataset for DH estimations called for longer iteration chains to obtain convergence and to estimate variances with the same accuracies as the HD estimates. As previously mentioned  MCMC methods can reduce estimation bias in the discrete time survival model. However  data expansion results in very large datasets for which the MCMC algorithm can be slow and generate chains that exhibit poor mixing. This was apparent for the MCMC algorithms of    especially for estimation of parameters in the DH direction. One of the main causes of poor mixing in the MCMC algorithm is correlated model parameters. When correlations exist between random effects and their variances  and the variances are close to zero  the MCMC chain can get stuck close to zero  both for the variance and its random effect. Parameter expansion is a reparameterization method  which reformulates the statistical model by replacing certain parameters with others that are not correlated and therefore generate MCMC chains with much better mixing than the original chains [    ]. The reparameterization is done in such a way that it is possible to recover the original parameters in the model. The method is a built-in option in MLwiN and is used in the estimations reported in this paper  resulting in much better mixing and therefore faster convergence and less need for long iteration chains. The process used to generate data on mastitis was an extension of the simulations by Carlén et al. [] and Schneider et al. []. These studies generated data on milk production  interval between calving and first ovulation  conception and mastitis liability. Mastitis history data were simulated as a binary trait until the first case of mastitis or the end of the lactation. For this study  we extended the program to include repeated cases of mastitis and also SCC data connected to every binary response. Weekly SCC values were simulated for 12 datasets that consisted of all possible combinations of two population sizes  two mastitis frequencies and three genetic correlations between mastitis and recovery liabilities. Five replicates were used for each population structure. Two population sizes were used i.e. 24 000 and 60 000 first-parity cows. The cows were the daughters of 400 unrelated sires distributed over 1200 herds  with a fixed herd size of 20 or 50  resulting in average daughter group sizes of 60 and 150  respectively. The larger population size is similar in structure to the situation in Sweden  where the average size of herds participating in official milk recording varied between 50 and 60 in the past five years []  and the number of daughters per young bull tested for mastitis resistance ranged from 150 to 200 []. Without prior knowledge about the possible genetic correlation between mastitis and recovery liabilities  three correlations were simulated: -0.2  0  and 0.2. Furthermore  two mastitis incidence scenarios were used (Table ). Scenario one was chosen to reflect previous estimates of the incidence of mastitis in field data of Swedish first-parity cows [    ]  where a case of mastitis was defined as a veterinary-treated clinical mastitis. The recurrence rate of CM was based on data from the research herd of the Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics  Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences []. The second scenario was not justified by previous studies but was chosen to take into consideration the possible higher frequencies of mastitis in multiparous cows and the fact that not all cases of mastitis may be veterinary-treated. It is also of theoretical interest to investigate the difference in performance of the method for different frequencies since it may be useful for other repeated disease data with higher frequencies. For both scenarios  the average probability of recovery from one week to the next  was 0.65 (equal to the rate in the Jälla research herd []). If a cow develops mastitis in a given week  the probability that it is still infected the following week is 0.35  0.35 = 0.123 for two weeks later  0.35 = 0.043 for three weeks later  etc.. Mastitis history data were simulated as a binary trait with underlying normally distributed mastitis and recovery liabilities. The mastitis and recovery liabilities for each cow were modeled by a herd effect  the animal's breeding value  and an environmental value. Breeding values for the cows were simulated by adding half the breeding value of the sire  half the breeding value of the dam and a Mendelian sampling term. The environmental value corresponds to a permanent cow effect  which means that the liability value represents a mean liability over lactation. A weekly random variable was added to allow the mastitis liability to vary from week to week. Before the weekly variations were added  the variance in the liabilities (~(0  0.8)) was chosen to give a mastitis heritability of 0.1  which is in line with what is normally found in cross-sectional linear models (on the underlying scale) [    ]. Together with the weekly random component (~(0  0.6))  variances added up to a phenotypic variance of 1. The additive genetic variance was 0.036  which resulted in a simulated heritability of 0.036 for the weekly data (0.039 if the herd variance of 0.072 is excluded from the phenotypic variance). The recovery liabilities were simulated in the same way and with the same parameters. For cases in which mastitis did not develop in the previous week  the mastitis liability of the current week generated the next binary outcome. If the resulting mastitis liability was above a defined threshold which corresponded to the targeted mastitis frequency  the cow developed mastitis. If mastitis did develop in the previous week  the current recovery liability decided the next week's binary outcome. If the recovery liability was above the threshold of -0.4 (corresponding to the relative recovery frequency of 0.65)  the cow was free from the infection  and if not  the cow remained infected for (at least) another week. The binary CM data was then used to simulate SCC observations: values for uninfected test days (days when the cow's SCC level is measured) were simulated as random deviations ( = 0.64 according to previous studies []) from a baseline curve and test days with mastitis infections as random deviations from a function with instant SCC increase  followed by a successive decline down to the baseline level. The baseline curve was modeled by a three-phase linear spline function parameterized according to []. Another spline function expressed the immediate increase of SCC from the baseline at the time of infection and the successive decline down to the baseline level during the following weeks. This spline function was created according to findings by De Haas et al. [] by generalizing the effects of   and  on SCC. Before applying the method to the data  the sequence of SCC lactation data was converted into a sequence of binary responses  which indicated whether a transition had occurred within each time interval. Cow  sire  and herd indicators were repeated as many times as there were binary responses in the lactation. Furthermore  a time indicator was added  to number the time intervals repeatedly until a transition. After a transition  the counter started over again and ran until the next transition or the end of the lactation. There was no restriction on the cows having the same number of measurements or the same interval between measurements. In theory  a cow only needs two consecutive measurements although  in practice  very short series carry little information. Long intervals between measurements can also lead to information loss due to missed transitions. However  evaluation concerns the performance of the sires  not that of the individual cows  thus longer intervals between measurements can to some extent be compensated by more daughters per sire. The :th SCC value (in order within a lactation) for cow   daughter of sire   and member of herd  is denoted y  = 1 ...   where  is the number of measurements for cow  within the same lactation. The discrete variable  should not be confused with  which is a continuous variable for time in lactation  starting at calving. The binary response  states whether the :th order SCC value for cow  is below (H) or above (D) the boundary stated in (1) and is formally expressed as where  is the time since calving for the :th order response of cow . Two new datasets were created out of the binary sequence  = 1 ...   . The first dataset was used to analyze mastitis liability and contained transitions from healthy to diseased states. The second dataset contained transitions from diseased to healthy states and was used to analyze the recovery process. The first dataset was much larger than the second because it included all cows  while the second contained only cows that had developed mastitis at least once. Transitions between states were recorded as a binary variable    which states whether or not a transition took place between two consecutive measurements   and  + 1. For each cow and lactation  two binary series were created according to for H to D transitions and for D to H transitions (t = 1 ...   -1). For example  a sequence of  = [0010001110100]  containing 13 measurements and three cases of classified mastitis (one which lasted over three measurements) for cow   generated  and   together with two time indicators  and . The time indicators numbered the intervals until a transition occurred (i.e. the elements in  until a 1 appears) or till the end of the sequence is reached. Since a cow could change states more than once during a lactation  the time indicators could start over several times. For the HD transitions  the counter started at 1 at the first measurement that is classified as healthy (most often the very first one) counting until a transition to a diseased state occurs. The counter started over again when or if the cow returned to a healthy state. For transitions in the other direction  the counter started when the cow developed the first case of classified mastitis and stopped when it returned to a healthy state. If the cow returned to a diseased state  the counter started over again. A cow without a case of classified mastitis did therefore not generate any data for transitions in the D to H direction. At the same time  the duration of a diseased state was usually much shorter than that of a healthy state. This resulted in a strongly reduced data-set for D to H transitions in comparison to the data in the H to D direction. To complement  and     three more sequences     and  were created  which contained indicators for cow  sire and herd. Each sequence was just a replicate of the same indicator duplicated as many times as the length of  and   . The expanded data material for the HD direction contained        and  for all cows  while the data in the DH direction contained         and  for all cows that had at least one case of classified mastitis. The transition probabilities in (2) can be expressed in terms of  . The probability of developing mastitis for cow  can be expressed as and was the same for cow  throughout the entire lactation  i.e. for all values of   (t = 1 ...   -1). The probability to recover was consequently expressed as Breeding values were estimated in separate analyses for the two transitions directions (HD and DH). Correlations between true breeding values (TBV) and estimated breeding values (EBV)  i.e. accuracy of selection  for both HD  and DH  directions  were calculated for all combinations of population sizes  mastitis frequencies  and genetic correlations ( ). In addition  correlations between EBV in the HD and DH directions were calculated for the same combinations in order to check if the negative  neutral and positive genetic correlations between mastitis and recovery liabilities in the simulated data are reproduced by the method. As shown in Table  a larger daughter group size  higher mastitis frequency and a higher boundary level generated higher accuracies of EBV ( and ). For mastitis liability  the method generated correlations between TBV and EBV that ranged from 0.53 to 0.83. For recovery liabilities  it was clear that the severely reduced dataset affected the estimates unfavorably. Because of the large number of cows without mastitis  the datasets were reduced to sizes between 1/6 and 2/5 of the original data. Despite this  the method managed to generate rather high accuracies even in the DH direction (0.25 to 0.62). There were no major differences in the correlations between TBV and EBV when comparing them for the different simulated values of the genetic correlations between mastitis and recovery liabilities ( = -0.2  0.2  and 0) (Table ). Whether or not the different values of  in the simulated data are reproduced in the calculated correlation between EBV in the HD and DH direction are reported in Table . Calculated correlations were rather scattered but with a pattern showing that the method manages to acknowledge the positive and zero simulated values of  by generating calculated correlations of approximately the same magnitude as  . However  the negative values of  in the simulated data are not reproduced in the calculated correlations between the EBV in the two directions. Instead  these estimated correlations have values around zero. Mastitis has been the focus of several research projects and is considered in breeding programs in many countries (e.g.  []). However  in the genetic evaluation of udder health  only the mastitis liabilities are taken into account  leaving aside the recovery process. Our main objective was to evaluate a new method that simultaneously models transitions to and from states of mastitis considering both the mastitis liability and the recovery process. For example  the method can distinguish between two cows  each with mastitis once during lactation but one showing fast recovery and the other suffering from a protracted infection. Naturally  our aim is to have as few mastitis infections as possible. However  mastitis is unavoidable and a relatively frequent problem among dairy cows. Thus  the capacity for fast recovery is also of interest. The multilevel discrete time survival model is well suited to analyze the repeated nature of mastitis data. Green et al. [] used a similar model to investigate how cow  farm and management factors during the dry period influence the incidence of clinical mastitis after calving. However  in their study  only the first case of mastitis was considered  leaving out repeated events in the analysis. The method's ability to take repeated mastitis cases within the same lactation into account was shown in our study through higher correlations between TBV and EBV for higher mastitis frequencies. Besides the extra genetic information that can be captured by considering repeated cases  it has another beneficial aspect. A higher mastitis frequency reduces the proportion of falsely classified cases  which in turn gives more accurate EBVs. For example  a 10% mastitis misclassification rate among a group of 100 cows with 10 real cases leads to nine falsely classified individuals (10% of the 90 that do not have mastitis). This means 47% (9 of 19) of the mastitis classifications are false. The same misclassification rate among an equally large group  but with 30 real cases  results in seven falsely classified individuals (10% of the 70 that do not have mastitis). In this case  19% (7 of 37) of the mastitis classifications are false. A higher classification error percentage for lower mastitis frequencies also appears if the misclassification goes in the other direction  i.e. mastitis cases are falsely classified as non-mastitis. Misclassifications are unavoidable when SCC is used as an indicator of mastitis. If the boundary between H and D is too low  high random fluctuations around \"normal\" SCC levels will lead to falsely classified cases of mastitis. There is a trade-off between classifying normal but elevated SCC values as infected if the level is too low and missing possible infections if the level is too high. The results in Table  show that the higher boundary level gives higher correlations between EBV and TBV. This is especially apparent for DH transitions  for which the reduced data was more sensitive to misclassifications than the complete data. Boundaries higher than  were also tested (not reported here) but did not give an increase in accuracies. On the contrary  if the levels are too high  the results deteriorate. In this simplified simulation study  the setting of the boundaries (and its consequences) are of course easier to determine than in a real-life dataset. However  the SCC response to a mastitis case was based on real-life observations and the boundaries should therefore be reasonably correct to use also in real-life data. The simulated data in this study was used previously to evaluate linear models (LM)  threshold models (TM) and survival analysis (SA) []. Confirmed cases of mastitis were modeled either as a binary variable (separating absence of mastitis and 1 or more cases during lactation) or as time to first case. Correlations between TBV and EBV in that study were 0.53-0.60 and 0.70-0.76 for 60 and 150 daughters  respectively. The mastitis lactation percentage coincides with scenario 1 in this paper  i.e. the lower mastitis frequency. The corresponding correlations for scenario 1 of the transition method are 0.55-0.59 and 0.75-0.77 (Table )  showing that the results for the transition method are well in line with those in []. Considering that the transition method analyzes SCC values as an indicator of mastitis  while the previous methods analyzed confirmed mastitis cases  the results are even more promising. When the mastitis frequency was higher  the transition method generated even higher correlations  i.e. up to 0.7 for 60 daughters and 0.84 for 150 daughters. A higher mastitis frequency leads to a larger number of lactations with more than one case. More individuals with repeated events makes the transition method even more favorable compared to the other three methods. These results show good prospects for second and higher lactations. An additional advantage of the transition method is the information generated on the recovery process. These results are not comparable to the LM  TM  and SA methods  because of their one-way approach. However  survival analysis could be used in a similar manner as the transition method. By analyzing the time between infection and recovery  the results could be compared with the recovery results from the transition method. Nevertheless  traditional survival analysis does not take repeated cases into account  neither in the DH nor in the HD direction  which means that a cow can only develop mastitis once and recover once. However  there are a few attempts to analyze repeated cases  where one suggestion is the survival score model []. A positive genetic correlation between mastitis and recovery liabilities has two characteristics: cows that easily develop an infection also recover easily (Profile 1)  while cows with high disease resistance have a longer recovery time (Profile 2). Cows with Profile 1 have a better chance to generate accurate EBV for their sires than cows with Profile 2 because cows with Profile 1 show their true capacity of moving between states without getting stuck in one of the two states. Cows with a high resistance to the disease  cannot show there aptitude for recovery  simply because they rarely develop mastitis. They are \"stuck\" in the healthy state. A negative genetic correlation between mastitis and recovery liabilities is reflected by having cows with low mastitis resistance and long recovery time (Profile 3) and cows with high disease resistance and quick recovery (Profile 4). The inertia factor is even more apparent for data with a negative genetic correlation between mastitis and recovery liabilities  because it is then present for data of both characteristics i.e. Profile 3 and 4. Cows with Profile 3 do not show their inclination for repeated events because they easily get stuck in a diseased state. Among the cows in Profile 4  their inclination for fast recovery will not be evident because these cows hardly develop mastitis. The inertia factor is probably the major reason why the zero and positive genetic correlations are correctly estimated by the method while the negative genetic correlations are not. Mastitis and recovery liabilities could be estimated jointly in a bivariate model with a prior on the correlation between the two liabilities. In this study  we decided against this for practical reasons and because of the few transitions that occur for the same cow (0.28 (0.95) mastitis cases per lactation)  together with the inertia factor  could easily make the estimates of the correlations very imprecise. Even for the high frequency scenario  half of the cows had no mastitis and it is impossible (or at least very model dependent) to determine what the recovery rate is for cows that do not develop mastitis. Genetic correlation between mastitis and recovery liability could be estimated more accurately with multiple lactations per cow and/or from covariances on a sire level. Whether a genetic correlation exists between mastitis and recovery liability is yet to be investigated but the inertia factor should be recognized in such studies. One should remember that the method used to generate the simulated data is not logistic-normal but uses a probit model. In spite of this  the logit analysis gave estimates close to the values used in data generation. This indicates that our method is not very sensitive to model specification errors. Use of a probit model for analysis is simpler than the logit model  in the sense that is does not require a MH step in the Gibbs sampler. However  the logistic model is less sensitive to outliers for explanatory variables. In practice  the generating mechanism behind the data is unknown  making it difficult to specify the correct model for data analysis. However  the two models usually give very similar results []. Different possibilities for developing and improving the method could be investigated. One possibility is to develop the method by adding a new state representing subclinical mastitis cases. We would then model transition probabilities between three possible states. The method could also be used to analyze repeated confirmed mastitis cases instead of SCC  excluding the need to classify cows based on SCC. However  complete data of confirmed or veterinary-treated cases are rather rare in field data but sometimes a combination of the two data types is available. The method could accommodate all available data in the genetic evaluation by combining SCC data with incomplete mastitis data. Generalizing the model to allow for time-dependent transition probabilities is another possibility which could be done by including a lactation stage effect in the analysis of the transitions. Mastitis classification may be improved by going from a strict limit between states to a more flexible and realistic classification. Mixture models have been used successfully to classify mastitis types  e.g. [  ]  but not in combination with the transition probability model. Multivariate mixture models give the possibility to classify mastitis on the basis of more than one variable and to model overlapping groups  which may improve classification even further. Associations between pathogen-specific mastitis and SCC pattern have been demonstrated [  ]. Different patterns distinguish between long or short increase in SCC and also between lactations with or without recovery. Transition probabilities could be used to describe characteristic patterns of SCC and to identify pathogen-specific mastitis. The transition probability method may also be suitable for a wide range of other diseases for which individuals fall in and out of two or more states and the states are either confirmed or classified by one or more classification variables. This paper presents and evaluates a novel longitudinal model for genetic evaluation of mastitis. The model captures the dynamic nature of the disease by modeling mastitis liability and by including the recovery process and repeated cases into the analysis. Although a more complete evaluation of the method is necessary  especially on field data  the results point towards a significant gain when broadening the genetic evaluation of udder health to include the whole disease course.

A recently recognized source of genomic structural variation called Copy Number Variation (CNV)  is gaining interest in genomic studies. It is defined as a DNA segment that is 1 or more kb long and is present at a variable copy number in comparison with a reference genome []. CNV are shown to be functionally active in humans. They are responsible for phenotypic changes by altering gene dosage  disturbing coding sequences and perturbing long-range gene regulation []. With the discovery of CNV in the cattle genome [–] and their potential to cause variation in economically important traits  capturing the effects of CNV and other complex genotypes on phenotype becomes an important factor in the prediction of genetic values. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a simple deletion CNV can be predicted from dense SNP genotyping data using a multiple regression approach  which  if successful  implies that genetic variation due to this deletion CNV can be predicted in an automated manner by dense SNP genotyping. To this end  we report the linkage disequilibrium (LD) of a bi-allelic deletion type of CNV (the locus varying in copy number  2 = normal and 1 = deletion) with surrounding SNP to determine whether SNP can predict this simple CNV. A model to predict CNV from surrounding SNP is developed and its accuracy is tested by cross-validation. Prediction of CNV with high accuracy would eliminate the need for explicit detection and genotyping of simple CNV. Our approach is general and can be extended to more complex CNV  but estimation of the prediction accuracy of more complex CNV is outside the scope of this paper. The SNP and CNV genotypes for dairy cattle were provided by the Milk Genomics Project conducted at Wageningen University  The Netherlands. In the project  2 000 Holstein Friesian cows (belonging to five large sire families with about 200 daughters and 50 small sire families with about 20 daughters) were genotyped for 50 000 SNP on the Illumina Infinium platform []  using a custom array described by Charlier et al. []. The 2 844 SNP genotypes on bovine chromosome 6 with a median interval of 18 kb were used for CNV detection. Two algorithms  PennCNV (2008 Nov19 version) [] and cnvPartition (v1.2.0  a plug in of Bead studio version 3; Illumina Inc.) [] were used with default settings for the detection of CNV. In total  476 samples showed CNV regions with PennCNV and 245 samples with cnvPartition. A bi-allelic deletion type CNV was detected on bovine chromosome 6 around 53 megabases (Mb) by both algorithms and was validated by significant evidence for Mendelian inheritance in 17 sire families. This common deletion CNV locus (a CNV region  CNVR []) was found to vary in copy number; two copies (normal) and one copy (deletion) and spanned 233 kb in the 53 Mb region. The CNV detection algorithms showed ambiguity in mapping the breakpoints of this CNV; the same deletions were detected with different boundaries both within and across families (Figure ). We used the results from PennCNV for our study since it showed better compliance with the test of Mendelian inheritance. The boundaries of the variant detected in the majority of the animals (163) were considered to be the true boundaries of the CNV (53 481 069-53 719 948 bp in terms of map positions on bovine chromosome 6 on BTAU4 []). This CNVR was considered a validated deletion CNV to test our hypothesis. . The red bars show the SNP boundaries of the deletion with their position (bp); the number of animals detected with the variants is given at the top of the red bars and the vertical lines indicate the position of the SNP relative to the map of BTAU4 []. Samples with missing genotypes were excluded from the analysis. This resulted in a dataset of CNV and SNP genotypes for 1 682 individuals  of which 263 carried the deletion. The dataset can be accessed in Additional file . Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out on the CNV using adjacent flanking SNP markers. Model (1) was run with different numbers of surrounding SNP markers (m = 10  20  30....100; with an equal number of markers to the left and right of the CNV): where  = n × 1 response vector of CNV genotypes  for n = 1 682 animals  coded as 1 for deletion and 2 for normal copy number; µ = overall mean;  = vector of n ones;  = n × m matrix  with genotypes of n = 1 682 animals for m SNP markers;  = m × 1 vector of SNP effects on copy number; and  = vector of random residuals. The SNP carrying the \"A\" allele were encoded as the number of \"A\" alleles (AA = 2  AT/AC/AG = 1 and TT/CC/GG = 0). For one CG SNP  the number of \"C\" alleles was used for coding (CC = 2  CG = 1 and GG = 0). Model (1) was fitted using the SAS software []. The SNP were selected so that half of them were upstream and half were downstream from the CNV  starting adjacent to the CNV with 10 SNP and then further away up to 50 SNP on each side. Distances of SNP from the CNV borders are shown in Figure . The fraction of variation in copy number explained by the model was quantified by the coefficient of determination (R) and the model accuracy (AM) was calculated as the square root of R. . The red bar is the CNV region (53 481 069-53 719 948 bp) and the blue bar represents the region encompassing the SNP in different models; the distance of the farthest SNP from the CNV boundary (the region covered by the SNP) is given in kb above the blue bar. Ten-fold cross-validation was carried out to test the predictive accuracy of the model []. The data was randomly split into ten non-overlapping sample subsets. The data from nine subsets were used to fit the model with 10  20  30....100 SNP. The estimated SNP effects were then used to predict the copy number in the remaining 10th sub-set  which was excluded from the model fitting. This procedure was repeated for each of the 10 subsets  so that a prediction for every record was obtained once whilst it was excluded from the estimation model. The correlation between the predicted and observed copy number was calculated for each sample as a measure of accuracy (accuracy estimated by cross-validation; ACV) and was used to obtain the prediction accuracies with different numbers of SNP fitted in the model. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot for the SNP and CNV was generated using HaploView () []. The CNV was encoded as an SNP  as described elsewhere []; AT for deletion and TT for no deletion in the input file. The LD plot was also used to identify a \"disconnected SNP\" (dSNP  S173; see next section) that fell outside the tightly linked haplotype blocks  as defined by HaploView. To compare the prediction accuracy of the CNV by surrounding SNP with that of a certain single SNP  an SNP was predicted using the same model. Since the majority of the SNP were in tight LD blocks with r ~ 1  SNP genotypes for the dSNP S173 were included in the \"\" vector and models (1) were fitted in SAS. The R of the dSNP prediction models were compared with those of the CNV prediction models. HaploView was used to assess the LD pattern (Figure  and ) of the CNV with nearby SNP. Many SNP adjacent to the CNV region showed a D' of 1. However  no single SNP appeared to tag the CNV perfectly (r = 1). Among the SNP with a D' value of 1  S135 (115 kb downstream the CNV boundary) showed the highest r value of 0.13. The majority of the SNP showed tight LD with adjacent SNP (r = D' = 1) (red triangles in Figure ). . Key: when LOD < 2  D' < 1 is white and D' = 1 is blue; when LOD > 2  D' < 1 is given in shades of pink/red and D' = 1 is given in bright red; the pair-wise D' values are given in the boxes.  Linkage disequilibrium plot (from HaploView) based on r for the SNP surrounding the CNV. Key: r2 = 0 is given in white  0 < r2 < 1 is given in shades of grey and r2 = 1 is given in black. The CNV and SNP data on 1 682 animals were analyzed using model (1). This model used 10 to 100 SNP flanking the CNV. The fraction of the variance explained by the model (R) increased with the number of SNP in the model (Figure ). A low R of 0.107 was obtained for the model with ten SNP but this increased gradually to 0.609 for a model with 40 SNP. A large increase in R (0.27) was observed when the number of included SNP increased from 40 to 50. With 50 SNP  the model explained 88.1% of the variation in copy number. . Including even more SNP resulted in little increase in the value of R  which reached a maximum value of 0.914 with 100 SNP. Since the curve was very flat between 50 and 100 SNP  we expect limited further increases in R by extending the SNP panel beyond 100 SNP. Cross-validation was carried out to assess the performance of the model by predicting CNV genotypes for samples that were excluded when fitting the model. The prediction accuracy estimated by cross-validation (ACV) was plotted against the model accuracy (AM)  i.e. the accuracy of the predicted results by the model in Figure . The ACV closely followed the accuracy predicted by the model  AM  for different numbers of SNP and increased with an increasing number of SNP but was slightly lower compared to the accuracy predicted by the model. It reached a value of 0.93 with a 50 SNP model. Increasing the number of SNP in the model further  showed very little increase in ACV  which reached a maximum value of 0.94 for 100 SNP. Figure  also shows that the small increase in prediction accuracy  when increasing from 50 to 100 SNP  was even smaller for ACV than for AM. . A disconnected SNP (dSNP  S173) that fell just between two tightly linked haplotype blocks (Figure ) was compared to the CNV for its predictability. The SNP was predicted from 10 to 100 flanking SNP. The R for the dSNP prediction model with different numbers of SNP is compared to that of the CNV in Figure . The models with 40 or less markers performed better for dSNP prediction than for CNV prediction. With 40 markers in the model  an R of 0.81 was obtained for dSNP prediction compared to that of 0.61 for the CNV prediction model. However  with 50 SNP  a higher R was obtained for the CNV prediction model (0.88) than for the dSNP prediction model (0.84). Thereafter  the R for the dSNP prediction model closely followed the CNV prediction model  reaching a value of 0.92 for 100 SNP within 1 000 kb on each side of the CNV (Figure ). . Key: when LOD < 2  D' < 1 is white and D' = 1 is blue; when LOD > 2  D' < 1 is given in shades of pink/red and D' = 1 is given in bright red; the pair-wise D' values are given in the boxes. In this study  we have investigated the prediction of a CNV from surrounding SNP typed on a custom Illumina Infinium 50 k BeadChip  using a multiple regression model. Although the investigated CNV was discovered using specific CNV detection algorithms  we used it as a model for other  currently unknown CNV. We have assessed the accuracy with which an unknown CNV genotype can be predicted by predicting a common deletion CNV genotype using the surrounding SNP. The investigated CNV was a rather common large deletion CNV of 233 kb. We did not find any SNP in perfect LD (r = 1)  contrary to previous studies that reported strong LD for deletions with nearby SNP [  ]. However  it was possible to predict the CNV with a high accuracy (0.94) by combining information from 50 or more flanking SNP in a multiple regression model. This accuracy was confirmed by cross-validation. If this result proves to be general  it can be concluded that the presence of a bi-allelic deletion type CNV and  in case it has causative effects  its related phenotypic effects  may be estimated by dense SNP genotyping with a high accuracy. The in silico CNV detection algorithms used in the present study showed ambiguity in mapping the breakpoints (Figure ). Seventy-seven of the CNV (out of 263 samples harboring a CNV in the 53 Mb region) started at position 53 535 915 on chromosome 6 (~54 kb downstream relative to the most common variant) and 14 CNV started at position 53 605 836  almost ~124 kb downstream (Figure ). Thus  it is possible that there are multiple distinct CNV in this region. Similarly  there is an alternative CNV endpoint 5 kb upstream of the common CNV endpoint. This uncertainty in breakpoints might explain why we failed to find a SNP in perfect LD with the deletion region  although the CNV genotype calls seemed accurate since they showed Mendelian inheritance. Confirming the nature of the deletion and fine-mapping the CNV boundaries may help to detect better tag SNP for this region. Perhaps a more likely reason for the relatively low LD between the CNVR and its surrounding SNP is the relatively large distance between the CNVR and the closest SNP  which may be general for CNV due to the often low SNP coverage in CNV regions (as shown in Figure ). The first SNP downstream from the CNV was 39 kb away  whereas upstream  the first SNP was 145 kb away  which is far greater than the median SNP to SNP distance of 18 kb. Studies [  ] that report SNP in strong LD with CNV use a denser SNP map and obtain perfect LD for nearby SNP. Thus  with the next generation SNP chips (containing ~700 k SNP)  we expect to predict the CNV more accurately with fewer SNP. However  it is difficult to reliably detect SNP in CNV regions because of the genomic complexity that is generally found in the deleted or duplicated regions and the resulting low reliability of the reference sequence. The accuracy of the model  as estimated by cross-validation  was high. The cross-validation accuracies were only slightly lower than those predicted by the statistical model. Thus  given a sufficiently big training data set  the model proved to be reliable for future predictions of deletion type CNV from SNP data. A small increase in accuracy was observed for CNV prediction  when increasing from 50 to 100 SNP (Figure ). The increase was much smaller for cross-validation accuracy than predicted by the model. Thus  the increase in R (and AM) when increasing from 50 to 100 SNP is to a large extent due to over-fitting of the data by the model  and hardly results in a real increase in R beyond 50 SNP. This suggests that the LD might be decreasing at distances >500 kb since the 50 SNP used in the model were within 500 kb from the CNV (Figure ). This is consistent with a previous study that reported LD in eight breeds of cattle [] and showed that the LD between pair-wise loci drops to background LD level at a distance of 500 kb. We compared the predictability of the CNV with that of a 'disconnected' SNP (dSNP)  S173. When using information from 40 or less flanking SNP  the SNP was predicted more accurately than the CNV. When including more SNP  the two models showed a similar R pattern. Hence  it may be concluded that the predictability of a simple bi-allelic CNV follows the predictability of a dSNP when information from many (>50) SNP is used. This and the fact that the accuracies of the predictions of the CNV and S173 are almost identical with >50 SNP  suggest that both the CNV and dSNP may be on an extended haplotype that is predicted by the SNP with an accuracy of 0.94. In this study  we have shown that a simple deletion CNV can be predicted with a high accuracy from neighboring SNP using a multiple regression approach. This suggests that dense SNP panels can capture the effects of this type of CNV. However  our study was limited to one large common deletion type CNV that was detected using CNV detection algorithms from SNP data  and a 50 K SNP chip that was solely targeted at SNP genotyping and generally has a poor coverage of CNV regions (as shown in Figure ). Thus  although our approach is general  further studies are needed to investigate whether similar accuracies can be attained for other  more complex types of CNV. Genomic selection relies on dense markers that jointly are in sufficiently high LD with (unknown) QTL  so that the effect of the QTL is accurately predicted by the sum of the SNP effects. This situation resembles very much our prediction of the CNV  in cases where the CNV causes quantitative trait genetic variation  and its position is not known. With a CNV of unknown position  we could not have selected the 100 nearest SNP  and we would have had to rely on all ~50 000 genome-wide markers to predict the CNV. Thus  in this case  the number of SNP effects would greatly exceed the number of records  which is known as the k>>n problem in statistics. Genomic selection deals with this problem by using informative prior distributions for the SNP effects. The accuracy of 0.94 found here is thus an upper bound for the accuracy of prediction of breeding values for a quantitative trait by the genomic selection approach  when the quantitative trait that is affected by the current CNV  possibly along with other CNV can be predicted with similar accuracy  and environmental effects. The prediction accuracy of 0.94 is an upper bound  because the k>>n problem may not be completely resolved by the prior distribution of SNP effects and the environmental effects reduce the accuracy of the estimates of the SNP effects relative to those in our study. Both these problems can be overcome by increasing the number of records  in which case the accuracy of genomic selection will approach this upper bound. A similar maximum accuracy of genomic selection was suggested by the result of Daetwyler []. With recent studies providing further evidence that CNV are associated with complex diseases in humans  designing genotyping chips with CNV probes may be important to increase the accuracy from the current ~90% towards 100% and thus to capture all genetic variation.

This study will contribute to identify the causative gene and mutation underlying this QTL. Ear size and erectness are important conformation characteristics of pig breeds. Moreover  ear defects have been observed in different species [  ]. For example  in humans  congenital underdevelopment of the external ear or microtia  affects about 1 in 6000 children in Europe and the USA  and 1 in 4000 in Japan and China []. Pig can be used as an animal model to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the development of the external ear. However  few genetic analyses have been carried out to study ear development in pigs and to our knowledge  only three studies have reported data on the mapping of QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) for pig ear traits. In 2004  Guo . (in Chinese) [] showed the existence of a QTL for ear erectness on pig chromosome 6 or SSC6 (SSC for ) in a commercial population. In 2007  Wei .[] identified two significant QTL with a major effect on ear size on SSC5 and SSC7 in a Large White × Meishan F resource population. Another study involving a White Duroc × Erhualian F intercross also detected two major QTL for ear size on the same chromosomes  which explained more than 45% and 17% of the phenotypic variance  respectively []. Although the genetic positions of the QTL were different (51 cM vs. 70 cM on SSC5 and 70 cM vs. 58 cM on SSC7)  the 95% confidence interval of both QTL overlapped partly in the two studies. More recently  a missense mutation on  was identified as the causative mutation for the QTL on SSC7  which influences ear size by mediating down-regulation of ß-catenin and its target gene expression []. Concerning the QTL on SSC5  the confidence interval was too large (11 cM) for positional cloning analysis and the genetic basis of the QTL remains unexplored. Thus  the study reported here  aimed at investigating the causative gene for ear size on SSC5 by refining the QTL region using higher-density markers on this chromosome and at analyzing in further detail  the association between the three candidate genes located in the refined region with ear size in the White Duroc × Erhualian F resource population and three synthetic commercial lines. The results will contribute to the final characterization of the causative gene or mutation responsible for this QTL. The White Duroc × Erhualian F resource population and phenotypic measurements have been described in detail in Ma .[]. Briefly  the F resource population was obtained by mating two White Duroc sires with small and erect ears to 17 Erhualian dams with large and floppy ears to produce F animals and then by random crossing between nine F1 boars and 59 F1 sows (avoiding sister-brother mating) to produce a total of 1912 F animals. Among the F2 individuals  1029 were phenotyped by measuring separately the size of both left and right ears after slaughter at 240 days of age as described in our previous report []. Three synthetic commercial lines including Sutai (Duroc × Erhualian  n = 173)  Sujiang (Duroc × Jiangquhai  n = 105) and Suzhong (Landrace × Erhualian  n = 78) were used in association tests to confirm the association between candidate genes and ear size. Both Erhualian and Jiangquhai indigenous breeds have large ears. Measurement of ear size was done according to the method described by Ren .[]  which differs from that of Ma .[]. Briefly  the ears of each animal were fixed and photographed with a ruler placed on the surface of the ear as an internal size reference. The surface of each ear was calculated using the Leica Qwin software. All experimental animal procedures were conducted according to the guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals established by the Ministry of Agriculture of China. Genomic DNA was extracted from ear and spleen tissues according to the routine phenol/chloroform extraction method and diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng/µL. To increase marker density in the QTL candidate region  microsatellite markers were selected from the - interval on the USDA-MARC SSC5 linkage map [] or by mining genomic sequence data of the QTL region (Sscrofa 9.2) using the SSRHunter program []. Four informative microsatellite markers  namely      and   were genotyped in all F  F and 1029 F animals as described previously []. All the primers were designed using the online software Primer3 [] and primer sequences  annealing temperatures  amplicon lengths and number of alleles are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Orthologous regions between the human genome and the refined QTL region were detected using the pig-human comparative map in the pig QTL database []. Annotated genes present in the orthologous regions were identified with the UCSC genome browser [] and their functions obtained from the NCBI database [] or GeneCards [].    and  were selected from the refined QTL region as genes with related functions.  encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) transcription factors family  and a previous study has indicated that it plays a role in chondrogenesis [  ]. Moreover  mutations in the genes encoding homeobox transcription factors are responsible for the defective development of outer ears [].  encodes a protein that belongs to the non-histone chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) protein family. - fusion protein promotes chondrogenesis by up-regulating cartilage-specific collagen gene expression through the N-terminal DNA binding domains []. The presence of HMGA proteins increases the proliferative activity of chondrocytes cultured  []. More interestingly  -deficient mice develop smaller ears [] and in dogs   may be involved in differences in the size and type of ears [].  is a member of the parathyroid hormone family which regulates endochondral bone development through regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during early bone growth []. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway interacts differentially with the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP)  which acts as a control of chondrocyte hypertrophy and final maturation []. Cartilage is the major component of ear tissue and genes influencing chondrocyte proliferation have been shown to affect ear size []. Thus  based on both the physiological roles of    and  in chondrogenesis and cartilage formation and their expression in ear tissues  we consider that they are important candidate genes for ear size. RT-PCR was performed to check expression profiles of  and  in ear tissue with the ß-actin gene as an internal control. Ear tissues were sampled from two Erhualian piglets at two days of age  immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and finally conserved at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted with the Nucleospin RNA kit (QIAGEN  Hilden  Germany) following instructions in the manual. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA according to the protocol of Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (QIAGEN  Hilden  Germany). Primers were designed to amplify regions across the intron/exon boundaries to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Details on primers are in Additional file : Table S2. RT-PCR was performed in a 15 µL reaction volume with a touchdown PCR protocol. Genomic DNA of four randomly selected F boars was used to identify SNP in the candidate genes. All the exons and part of the introns were amplified and sequenced with the primers listed in Additional file : Table S3. PCR amplification was carried out with a PE9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystem Inc.  Drive Foster City  USA). After purification with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen  Hilden  Germany)  PCR products were bidirectionally sequenced on an ABI 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer (ABI  Foster City  USA). The sequences of each amplicon were analyzed with SeqMan in the DNAStar software package. Informative SNP (i.e. with an allele frequency = 25% in four boars) were chosen for further genotyping using the SNaPshot kit (Applied Biosystem Inc.  Drive Foster City  USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers for PCR and SNaPshot extension assays are listed in Additional file : Table S4. After purification and denaturation at 95°C for 5 min  the SNaPshot reaction mixture was separated on an ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer for data collection. The SNP genotypes were recorded and analyzed using the GeneScan version 4.0. The linkage map of SSC5 was re-constructed by CRIMAP 2.4 []. The physical positions of the seven SNP on SSC5 were determined by the SOAP2 tool based on the reference genome assembly of Sscrofa 10.2 []. QTL analyses were carried out with QTL Express []. The statistical model was similar to the initial QTL mapping model []. Briefly  batch and sex were treated as fixed effects  and carcass weight as a covariate. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was determined using a bootstrap method through 2000 iterations []. A multiple QTL model was used to exclude the effects of previously detected QTL on other chromosomes by treating them as fixed effects. The significance threshold was determined with 1000 permutation tests []. Because of the extensive between-breed linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the F resource populations  standard association test  marker-assisted association test and F-drop test were performed to analyze the association between the candidate genes and the ear size in the current F resource population as described in Zhao .[]. Briefly  the following models were used: Model 1:  Model 2:  Model 3:  Model 4:  where  is the observation for ear size;  is the overall mean for ear size;  is the fixed effect of the i batch (i = 1  2  3  4  5  6);  is the fixed effect of the j sex (j = 1  2);  is the fixed effect of the k genotype of  (k = 1  2  3);  is the g genotype effect of the candidate gene (g = 1  2  3);  is the regression coefficient for carcass weight;  is the covariate of the carcass weight; a and d are unknown additive and dominance effects of average QTL alleles by breed origin from the two F breeds  respectively  and C and C are the additive and dominance coefficients  as computed from marker information []; and  is the residual. The standard association test was based on an F ratio of residual sums of squares (RSS) for models 1 and 3. An F ratio reaching or exceeding the significant threshold means that the candidate gene is in LD with the QTL or is the QTL. The marker-assisted association test for candidate genes was based on an F ratio of RSS for models 4 and 2. In this case  if the F ratio reaches or exceeds the significant threshold  then the candidate gene locus can account for most of the phenotype variance effect and it is in LD with the quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) or is the QTN []. The marker-assisted association test removed the impact of between-breed LD. The F-drop test was based on fitting the models 4 and 3. If a candidate gene that is in LD with the QTL is included as a fixed effect  it is expected to absorb part of the between-breed QTL effect  and the F-ratio for the QTL is expected to drop. All the tests were carried out with GridQTL version 2.0.0 []. The haplotype phases were inferred using AlphaPhase []. The phenotypes were corrected for sex  batch  carcass weight and additive infinitesimal effects using Qxpak 5 []. The residuals were regressed on the number of copies of each haplotype allele separately across all the individuals through the GLM function in R. The  values were corrected for the number of haplotypes (Bonferroni correction). The phenotypic variance explained by all the haplotypes was estimated by the ANOVA function in R. The association of  JF748727: g.2836 A > G with ear size in three synthetic commercial lines was evaluated by the GLM procedure of SAS 9.0 (SAS® Institute Inc. Cary  NC). The stratification effect of the population was excluded in the analysis. To refine the linkage map of the region previously reported on SSC5  four additional microsatellite markers ( and ) were identified and genotyped on F  F and 1029 F pigs. Thus  the complete linkage map with distances between markers in cM is the following: . This new round of QTL mapping reduced the confidence interval of the initial 11 cM QTL region between markers  and  to an 8.7 cM interval between markers  and . One thousand permutation tests were carried out and the bootstrap histograms are shown in Figure . The most likely position of the QTL is located in a 8.7 cM region (between positions 55.6 cM and 64.3 cM). Three genes with related functions i.e.    and  are located within this refined QTL interval. RT-PCR showed that the three genes are expressed in ear tissue (Additional file : Figure S1). . The left Y-axis indicates the F-value in QTL fine-mapping and the right Y-axis shows the number of iterations in bootstrapping. We detected 19 SNP and four indels in the  gene (accession number: JF748727  Additional file : Table S3). None of these polymorphisms were located in the coding region. We found 28 polymorphisms including 27 SNP and one indel in the  gene (accession number: JF748729  Additional file : Table S3) and among all these polymorphisms  only one synonymous SNP was detected in exon 2. A total of 20 SNP and one indel were identified in the  gene including one missense mutation in exon 2 (accession number: JF748728  Additional file : Table S3). Although a number of mutations were identified in the three candidate genes  most of them were identified in only one animal and thus were not informative and not useful for association tests on the F resource population. Finally  only seven SNP for which the minor allele frequency was > 25% were chosen for further genotyping across the entire White Duroc × Erhualian intercross. The physical positions of the seven SNP on the reference genome assembly 10.2 were 32.483 Mb  32.486 Mb  32.497 Mb  46.968 Mb  51.430 Mb  51.431 Mb and 51.480 Mb  respectively and were all situated within the interval between SSC5P3 (18.299 Mb) and SW2003 (54.594 Mb). Among the seven SNP  three included within the  gene are located near the SW1904 marker (33.850 Mb)  which is in the middle of the QTL. Standard association test  marker-assisted association test and F-drop test were carried out to evaluate the association between the seven informative SNP and ear size in the F resource population. In the standard association test  all the SNP were in strong association with ear size (< 0.01  Table ).  g.2836 A > G showed the strongest association with ear surface. Allele [G] present in Erhualian pigs is associated with an increase in ear size  while allele [A] is responsible for a smaller ear surface i.e. 32.84 ± 5.46 cm (Table ). In the marker-assisted association test  apart from the SNP  g.12328 T > G that did not achieve a  < 0.05 significance level  the SNP analyzed for the three candidate genes were significantly associated with ear size ( < 0.05  Table ). Similar to the standard association test   g.2836 A > G was most strongly associated with ear size ( = 1.92E-05). The results of the F-drop test are shown in Figure . When the genotypes of  g.2836 A > G were included as a fixed effect in the QTL analysis  the F value dropped from 134.14 to 3.19. F values of the other SNP were below 90%. . The Y-axis shows F-values and the X-axis indicates the SNP order; F (QTL): F value in QTL mapping (F-values of the model 3)  F (drop): F value when the candidate SNP was included as a fixed effect in QTL mapping (values of the F-ratios between models 4 and 3)  and  haplotypes were constructed and their associations with ear size were also analyzed in this study. Overall  the phenotypic variance explained by  haplotypes reached 19.47% ( = 1.31E-31  Table 2). Haplotypes [GCA] and [GTG] were associated with an increase in ear size. Five  haplotypes showed a significant association with ear size. Animals with haplotype [TCT]  [TCG] or [CCT] showed larger phenotypic values than those with haplotype [TTT] or [TTG] (Table ). However  the phenotypic variance explained by  haplotypes was lower than that of the QTL or  haplotypes (12.82%   = 2.48E-22). Given that the strongest association between  g.2836 A > G and ear size was identified in the White Duroc × Erhualian F resource population  this SNP was further genotyped in 356 adult pigs from the synthetic commercial lines of Sutai  Sujiang and Suzhong. The results showed that it was significantly associated with ear size in Sutai pigs ( < 0.05)  but not in Sujiang and Suzhong pigs (Table ) and allele [G] was responsible for an increase in ear size. Identification of causative genes underlying QTL in domestic animals is still a major challenge because confidence intervals of QTL are typically too large for positional cloning of the underlying gene []. In this study  we refined the interval containing the QTL responsible for ear size on SSC5 from an 11 cM interval to an 8.7 cM region. However  the confidence interval of the refined QTL is still large. The linkage disequilibrium-based haplotype-sharing approach has been shown to be effective in fine mapping of QTL in domestic animals [  ]. Unfortunately  in our study QTL genotypes could be deduced for only three of the nine F boars by the marker-assisted segregation analysis (data not shown) and no obvious shared haplotype was observed  which hampered further mapping of the QTL. In this study  the refined QTL region corresponds to two orthologous regions on human chromosome 12 (65.70-75.07 Mb and 19.80-33.72 Mb)  in which three candidate genes with related functions i.e.    and  were identified. The standard association test  marker-assisted association test and F-drop test were used to test the association between these candidate genes and ear size in the F resource population in which extensive linkage disequilibrium exists [].  g.2836 A > G showed the strongest association with ear size both in standard association test and marker-assisted association test. Allele [G] originating from Erhualian pigs was responsible for the increase in ear size  which is consistent with the breed's characteristic large and floppy ears. With the F-drop test  F value dropped by more than 97% only if the  g.2836 A > G genotype was included as a fixed effect. The phenotypic variance explained by the  haplotypes was a little higher than that by the QTL (19.47% vs.17.14%). This could be due to the elimination in the association tests of the effect of the causative mutation in  involved in the other major QTL for ear size on SSC7. However  the phenotypic variance explained by  haplotypes is much lower than that by the QTL (12.82% vs. 17.14%). Furthermore  the statistical models used in this study can be applied to determine which candidate gene is closest to the QTL. If  is more strongly associated with the QTL than  and   the residual sum of the squares of  (RSS ()) in model 3 is expected to be smaller than that of RSS () and RSS () []. We found that the ratios of RSS ()/RSS () and RSS ()/RSS () were < 1 (0.79 and 0.78  respectively). These results suggest that  is the gene closest to the QTL. The significant association between  g.2836 A > G and ear size was confirmed in the synthetic commercial line examined in this study. The founder animals of this line and the White Duroc × Erhualian F resource population originate from the same pig breeds  i.e. Duroc and Erhualian pigs. However  no significant association was detected in the Sujiang and Suzhong pig populations  which is most likely due to: 1) the different genetic background of the populations; 2) this SNP is only in LD with the causative mutation. Because recombination exists between the SNP and the causative mutation in the Suzhong and Sujiang populations  no significant association can be detected. More interestingly  an across-breed genome-wide association study (GWAS) in dogs showed that the SNP most strongly associated with dropping ears and ear size is located 98 kb apart from each other between the  and  genes []. In addition  an association between  and ear type has been described in dogs [] and -deficient mice are known to have small ears []. Combined with the results obtained in this study  we suggest that  is the closest gene to the QTL or the marker for ear size on SSC5 in pigs. More refined mapping of the QTL is needed to demonstrate that  is responsible for ear size in pig. We have fine-mapped a QTL affecting ear size on SSC5 to an 8.7-cM region. Candidate gene analyses suggest that  is the closest gene with a potential functional effect to the QTL or marker for ear size on SSC5. These results will contribute to the identification of the causative mutation for this QTL.

In Austria  324 Turopolje pigs originating from six Croatian founder animals are registered. Multiple bottlenecks have occurred in this population  one major one rather recently and several more older and moderate ones. In addition  it has been subdivided into three subpopulations  one in Austria and two in Croatia  with restricted gene flow. These specificities explain the delicate situation of this endangered Croatian lard-type pig breed.MethodsIn order to identify candidate breeding animals or gene pools for future conservation breeding programs  we studied the genetic diversity and population structure of this breed using microsatellite data from 197 individuals belonging to five different breeds.ResultsThe genetic diversity of the Turopolje pig is dramatically low with observed heterozygosities values ranging from 0.38 to 0.57. Split into three populations since 1994  two genetic clusters could be identified: one highly conserved Croatian gene pool in Turopoljski Lug and the\"Posavina\" gene pool mainly present in the Austrian population. The second Croatian subpopulation in Lonjsko Polje in the Posavina region shows a constant gene flow from the Turopoljski Lug animals.ConclusionsOne practical conclusion is that it is necessary to develop a \"Posavina\" boar line to preserve the \"Posavina\" gene pool and constitute a corresponding population in Croatia. Animals of the highly inbred herd in Turopoljski Lug should not be crossed with animals of other populations since they represent a specific phenotype-genotype combination. However to increase the genetic diversity of this herd  a program to optimize its sex ratio should be carried out  as was done in the Austrian population where the level of heterozygosity has remained moderate despite its heavy bottleneck in 1994."

Many studies on the diversity of various pig breeds have been reported in the literature in recent years. As early as the 1990's  several research groups have worked on harmonizing data from these various genetic studies in multiple pig populations from Europe and China (PiGMaP []  PigBioDiv1 and 2 [–]). For instance  the PigBioDiv projects include  among other data  around 50 European and 50 Chinese pig populations and a set of 50 microsatellite markers to study the pig genetic diversity in the main breeding and production areas. The major objective of these projects was to demonstrate how relevant analyses in overlapping countries can be carried out to study genetic diversity. Other approaches have also opened up new prospects in this field of research. In 2010  Boitard et al. [] have reported a large-scale analysis on the genetic diversity and population structure of French and Spanish pig breeds based on 5791 animals from 22 commercial populations. Besides from assigning individuals to populations  this work also investigated how the relatedness between individuals and the differences in sampling times affected statistical analyses. Larson et al. [  ] have studied the domestication process of European and Asian wild boar and domestic pigs based on mitochondrial D-loop sequence analyses in a wide range of pig breeds. These authors detected two separate haplotype groups in Europe: a Central European (D1) group and a Mediterranean group  which fits with previous reports on pig domestication [  ]. The Balkan pig breeds such as the Turopolje and Mangalica breeds are generally assumed to originate from the Mediterranean type  but to date neither their genetic diversity nor their evolutionary status in the haplotype networks have been analysed. In this study  our aim was to illustrate the diversity and genetic relationships of local pig breeds originating from Croatia  Serbia  Hungary and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian Turopolje breed has undergone a complicated recent breed history. In 1991  the last Turopolje pigs of the Posavina region in Croatia were collected to establish a nucleus herd for further conservation programs. However  in the autumn of the same year the Yugoslavian wars started and put a stop to this project initiated by the SAVE Foundation and EURONATURE. Six animals were rescued and placed in the Zagreb zoo. Four of these animals  together with two boars imported from the Posavina region in 2001  constituted the founder population for the Turopolje breed in Austria  which comprises at present 324 herdbook animals. A recently conducted pedigree analysis showed the high levels of inbreeding (F = 12%  mean pedigree depth of four generations) and the poor variability of the Austrian gene pool [  ]. After the end of the Croatian war in 1994  the SAVE Foundation and the Croatian state started to work on the project again within the context of the Lonjsko Polje National park. In order to build up a new nucleus herd of the Croatian pig breed  additional breeding animals from the Turopolje nucleus herd in Turopoljski Lug near Zagreb were used. This herd represents the second genetic resource for this local and autochthonous Croatian breed and has an uninterrupted breeding history dating back to the 19 century. At present  this subpopulation comprises 90 breeding animals and over the last 60 years  it has not undergone any immigration of pigs from other origins []. Because in the Austrian population the level of inbreeding is very high  our aim was to genetically characterize sub-populations and individuals from the Croatian pig breed in Turopoljski Lug  which could be used for future breeding programs in Austria. We studied the genetic diversity within the three Turopolje populations and their genetic relationships. In order to take into consideration  the influence that the instable demographic and political situation during and after the Croatian war may have had on the breeding of Turopolje pigs in the Save delta  we included animals from other local pig breeds localized next to this area i.e. the Black Slavonian or Fajferica  a local lard-type breed of the eastern part of Croatia  the Bosnian mountain pig  a local mixed population on the Bosnian side of the Save river and Austrian and Serbian Mangalica pigs  which originate from the border region of Serbia and Croatia (Figure ). . Turopolje TL = Turopolje herd in Turopoljski Lug  Turopolje LP = Turopolje herd in the national park Lonjsko Polje  Turopolje AUT = Austrian Turopolje population  Black Slavonian population  Mangalica SER = Serbian Mangalica population from the national park Zasavica  Bosnian mountain pig = Bosnian mountain pig in the district of Modrica  Mangalica AUT = Austrian Mangalica population  Pietrain = Austrian Pietrain Hair samples were collected on field trips in Croatia  Serbia and Bosnia Herzegovina in 2009 and 2010. Samples of extracted DNA for parentage controls were also used  which included all unrelated Austrian pig individuals and part of the Croatian individuals sampled in 2003 and five Turopolje pigs sampled in 1998. A total of 177 pigs were sampled i.e. 93 Turopolje pigs (29 from the herd in Turopoljski Lug (TL)  39 from the herd of the Lonjsko Polje national park (LP) and 25 from the Turopolje population of Austria (AUT)  41 Black Slavonian pigs  23 Mangalica pigs from the Austrian (AUT) herdbook (mainly imported animals from Hungary)  11 Serbian Black Mangalica pigs from the national Zasavica park (SER)  and nine pigs from a valley in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Republika Srpska. Since the small-sized Bosnian samples may cause distortion in the phylogenetic studies  they were excluded but the Bosnian mountain pigs were retained for the analysis of gene diversity and population structure. Samples of 20 unrelated Austrian Pietrain pigs were also included  as outgroup individuals since this breed is quite distant from the lard-type breeds of the Balkan countries both in terms of production traits mean values and genetic units. Finally  the DNA from 197 animals from eight populations and five breeds was used. The experimental data in this paper were obtained according to the legislative regulations regarding experimentals research on animals in Austria  Croatia  Serbia and Bosnia i Herzegovina. All animals were genotyped for 25 microsatellite markers belonging to the panel recommended by the ISAG-FAO Advisory Committee for genetic distance studies []. Twelve of these microsatellites are currently used for parentage controls in Austria for the Turopolje and Mangalica breeds. However  microsatellites S005  S0090 and SW24 were discarded because of the poor reproducibility of their allele determination. PCR-amplified microsatellite markers were analysed with an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer and Genescan. In some cases  the quality of the extracted DNA was to low for further analyses due to inadequate storage or transport i.e. samples from four Austrian Turopolje  six Austrian Mangalicas  three Austrian Pietrain  two Croatian Turopolje and one Croatian Black Slavonian pigs had to be excluded from the analysis. Thus 181 animals were finally included in the statistical analysis. Allele frequency  number of alleles  observed heterozygosity (HO) and gene diversity (HE) were calculated across different loci and populations using the GENETIX 4.05.2 software package []. Mean number of alleles (MNA) and rarefacted mean numbers of alleles (RMNA) were calculated using MOLKIN 2.0 []. Tests for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were performed across all loci by GENEPOP 3.4 [] applying the exact test with default settings of the Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. Wright's F was calculated according to Weir and Cockerham [] using GENETIX 4.05.2 []. To account for bottlenecks in the populations  the software package BOTTLENECK 1.2.02. [] was applied with a two-phased model of mutation (TPM)  consisting of 95% of strict one-step mutation steps (SMM) and 5% of multi-step changes (IAM). Allele frequency distribution (mode shift indicator) was used to illustrate the bottlenecks which were tested simultaneously by the Wilcoxon test []. Molecular genetic relationships among populations were derived using Wright's F [] and the Reynolds distance []. Individual relationships were calculated using Cavalli-Sforza's D distance []. Among the many genetic distance measures available  the Reynolds distance is considered to be the best to analyze populations that have recently diverged and neighbour joining (NJ) is the preferred technique for tree building when the populations under study differ in their effective population size [  ]. All genetic distances were calculated using the software package POPULATIONS 1.2.28 []. The stability of each node for the population level distances was evaluated with 1000 bootstraps samples. A principal component analysis of the individual D matrix was performed using the SAS software []. Population subdivisions and genetic differentiation can be tested by several clustering procedures. However  the algorithm of Pritchard et al. []  implemented in the software STRUCTURE 2.1 has become a frequently used application in genetic diversity studies. The program can estimate \"hidden structures» i.e. the number of different clusters (K partitions) obtained without using any prior information about individual membership (population and/or breed). Moreover  for each individual  the program is able to determine the proportion of genes originating from the K potential clusters. Based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method  the STRUCTURE algorithm uses a model-based approach  under the hypothesis that the loci are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and in linkage equilibrium within clusters  to define the natural logarithm of the probability that a given genotype belongs to the assumed K clusters. The program was run 10 times for each K  starting from K = 2 to K = 11. The results presented in this study are based on 10 iterations following a burn-in period of 10 iterations  applying an admixture model  correlated frequencies model and the parameter of individual admixture alpha set to the same values for all clusters and with a uniform prior. The resulting individual genotype membership coefficients were displayed using DISTRUCT []. The total number of alleles found for the 22 microsatellite markers analyzed on the eight pig populations amounted to 171 with a mean number of alleles per locus of 7.7  ranging between five and 11 alleles. The observed heterozygosity level ranged from 0.15 for loci  and  to 0.83 for loci  and . A significant deviation from HWE was observed for loci  and  and although the existence of null alleles for these three loci was not demonstrated  they were excluded from further analyses (compare additional file ). Data on the genetic diversity within the eight pig populations studied are presented in Table . Observed heterozygosity and gene diversity ranged from 0.38 and 0.37 (Turopolje TL) to 0.64 and 0.66 (Pietrain)  respectively. Allele richness was lowest in the Turopolje TL breed (MNA = 3.29) and highest in the Black Slavonian breed (MNA = 5.37). However  since the mean number of alleles is influenced by sample size  it was adjusted for sample size (22 genes)  but allele richness remained lowest in the Turopolje TL breed (RMNA = 2.31) while it was highest in the Pietrain breed (4.15). The results are based on 19 microsatellite loci from 181 animals; sample size (N)  observed heterozygosity (HO)  gene diversity (HE)  mean number of alleles (MNA)  the rarefacted mean number of alleles on a sample with 22 genes (RMNA)  Wright's Fand 95% confidence interval of F  * indicates a significant difference of F smaller than zero (p < 0.05) Negative F coefficients  with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.20 to -0.04  were estimated for the Serbian Mangalica and Turopolje TL breeds  suggesting an excess of heterozygotes due to non-random mating. In all other populations F values were not significantly different from zero. Overall  low average diversity values (heterozygosity and allele richness) were observed in all three Turopolje populations (Turopolje TL  Turopolje LP  Turopolje AUT) illustrating the risk status of this breed. Applying the Wilcoxon sign-rank test [] for gene diversity excess or gene diversity deficit  a significant genetic bottleneck was revealed only for the Austrian Turopolje population ( = 0.013  two sided test  = 0.027). The largest differentiation expressed by F values was observed between the Turopolje TL and Turopolje AUT populations (F = 0.26). Lower differentiation levels ranging from F = 0.05 to F = 0.09  were observed between the Black Slavonian and Mangalica breeds (AUT and SER)  Bosnian mountain  and the Austrian Turopolje pig populations and between the Turopolje TL Turopolje LP populations (for further information see additional files  and ). Genetic distances between populations are shown in Figure   where the Turopolje TL population occupies the most distant position within the dendrogram. . Unrooted neighbor joining tree for seven populations (excluding Bosnian mountain pig) from four different breeds based on the Reynold's distance Individual clustering is presented in the neighbour joining tree based on the D distance in Figure . The three Turopolje populations form a monophyletic cluster concordant with their recent breed history. On the same branch  a Black Slavonian (I) cluster is identified representing the herd of a single breeder near Vinkovci (HR). Both Mangalica populations are monophyletic whereas a paraphyletic cluster is observed for the Black Slavonian population (III) representing a herd of another breeder in Durici (HR). the Austrian populations  we identified three animals  one Turopolje and two Mangalicas  clustering with the Pietrain breed. . Dendrogram of 172 individuals from four different pig breeds (seven populations) derived from the D using neighbor joining clustering. Color bars correspond to the population: grey = Turopolje Lonjsko Polje  blue = Turopolje Austria  purple = Turopolje Turopoljski Lug  light blue = Black Slavonian I  green = Black Slavonian II  yellow = Black Slavonian III  red = Pietrain Austria  orange = Mangalica Austria and Serbia To measure the population structure and degree of admixture  we applied the STRUCTURE algorithm. All runs from K = 2 to K = 9 showed a pattern allowing a meaningful interpretation. However  the highest log likelihood score was obtained for K = 9. The log likelihood values for K = 7  forming a semi-plateau  showed little variability among 10 independent runs (compare additional file ). Thus  the status K = 7 corresponds to the picture of breed formation  whereas the status K = 9 represents a higher resolution of the actual state of the composition of the local Croatian breeds (Figure ). The population of the Lonjsko Polje national park is assigned to a separate gene pool and the Black Slavonian breed is split into three different pools represented by at least three different breeding herds. The Bosnian mountain population forms a separate pool and the Mangalica populations cluster together probably because of a common genetic background since the Hungarian imports played an important role in both populations. The same three animals (two Mangalica individuals and one Austrian Turopolje) as observed in Figure   carried a Pietrain genotype. . The clustering was obtained from STRUCTURE  for a model with admixture and correlated allele frequencies between groups; each pig is represented by a single vertical line broken into K colour segments  with lengths proportional to the estimated membership of the inferred cluster; only graphical presentations with the best fits towards data (K = 7 and K = 9) are shown; BIH = Bosnian Mountain pig; Mangalica AUT = Austrian Mangalica population; Mangalica SER = Serbian Mangalica The genetic diversity within the different Balkan pig breeds studied is low compared to that of conventional breeds playing a key role in global meat production. Numerous studies have reported observed heterozygosity values for different populations of the Landrace  Large White  Pietrain and Duroc breeds with values ranging from 0.67 to 0.50 [  –  ]. The economically less important local European breeds often show reduced census and effective population sizes [  ]. Therefore their diversity measured by genetic markers is significantly decreased and ranges from HO = 0.35 to HO = 0.58 [  ]. The population history of commercial European pig breeds such as Large White or Landrace is characterized by several events of introgression through Asian genotypes during the 19th century. This larger and heterogeneous founder gene pool as well as controlled breeding programs and the increase of population sizes throughout the 20 century may be responsible for the higher level of diversity within these breeds. The populations of Balkan pig breeds analyzed in this study show lower levels of heterozygosity  except the Bosnian mountain pig  where phenotypically crossbred individuals could be identified. Considering only the Turopolje breed  it is clear that the nucleus herd in Turopoljski Lug lacks genetic variability (HO = 0.38; MNA = 3.29; RMNA = 2.31)  although its F value is significantly lower than zero  suggesting that there are more heterozygous animals than expected. This contradiction may be explained by the breeding history of this population. The nucleus herd is managed by a farmers' collective and at present  although the population is split into two herds  the breeders are using only one or in the past two boars for reproduction. This mating strategy results in genetic and phenotypic uniformity and high levels of inbreeding within the boar lines. The merging of such boar lines is comparable to cross-breeding  which is documented here by the negative F value. Situations in the Austrian Turopolje herd with high heterozygosity values reaching 0.48 and in the nucleus herd in Turopoljski Lug differ completely. This is due to of the fact that a narrow sex ratio (2.7 females per male) has been maintained during the last 17 years. The Turopolje herd of the national park Lonjsko Polje  genealogically a metapopulation of Turopolje TL and Turopolje AUT  shows the highest levels of genetic diversity (HO = 0.57)  which is the consequence of using Turopoljski Lug animals since 1994. Generally the Balkan pig populations are well differentiated as demonstrated by the mean F value of 0.24  which is comparable to the results reported by SanCristobal et al. [] (mean F = 0.21) and Fabuel et al. [] (mean F = 0.14 - 0.15). The Turopolje island population in Turopoljski Lug is highly differentiated compared to all the other studied breeds (mean F = 0.21). The highest F value is obtained within the Turopolje breed surprisingly with a coefficient of 0.26 between Turopolje TL and Turopolje AUT. The Black Slavonian is moderately differentiated (mean F value of 0.10) and overlaps with the Austrian Turopolje and the Mangalica breeds  a result also observed in the individual-based phylogenetic tree (Figure ). The results obtained from STRUCTURE and the individual genetic distances suggest that a moderate gene flow has occurred between the Black Slavonian breed and the Turopolje population of the Posavina. More precise data on this genetic relationship could be obtained by analyzing mitochondrial DNA. The aim of this study was to identify possible candidate populations and individuals from the Croatian local pig breeds  which could be used to increase the gene pool of Austrian Turopolje pigs. Considering the results  genetic distances and population structure  three populations could be used in the Austria conservation program: the mother population in Lonjsko Polje  the second Croatian nucleus herd in Turopoljski Lug  and a breeding group from the Black Slavonian breed (Figure : Black Slavonian I). However  the situation for the Turopolje pig breed remains very serious. In Croatia  only about 157 breeding animals (in two populations) are left  and the Austrian population (at present  324 breeding animals) is isolated due to the import regulations of the European Union. The results of this study suggest that the Turopolje herd in Lonjsko Polje is a metapopulation between the herd of Turopoljski Lug and the Austrian population. At present  the gene pool of the Austrian herd originates from the old \"Posavina\" gene pool and its size is continuously decreasing in Lonjsko Polje due to animals immigrating from Turopoljski Lug. Only a few animals from this herd still belong to the \"Posavina\" cluster and it is important to develop a boar line out of this genetic cluster in order to preserve this gene pool for the future. The herd in Turopoljski Lug is a product of a strict consolidation breeding program. The phenotypically distinct animals are highly inbred and the genetic diversity is low  but no sign of inbreeding depression is observed for the time being. Thus  establishing one or two additional boar lines could help to increase genetic diversity in the long term.

"The importance of information on relatives for the prediction of genomic breeding values and the implications for the makeup of reference data sets in livestock breeding schemes"	"Authors: Samuel A Clark  John M Hickey  Hans D Daetwyler and Julius HJ van der Werf"	"University of New England  Armidale  NSW  2351  AustraliaSamuel A Clark  John M Hickey & Julius HJ van der Werf CRC for Sheep Industry Innovation  University of New England  Armidale  NSW  2351  AustraliaSamuel A Clark  Hans D Daetwyler & Julius HJ van der Werf Biosciences Research Division  Department of Primary Industries  1 Park Drive  Bundoora  Vic  3083  AustraliaHans D Daetwyler"	"No Co-Author"	"9 February 2012"	"BackgroundThe theory of genomic selection is based on the prediction of the effects of genetic markers in linkage disequilibrium with quantitative trait loci. However  genomic selection also relies on relationships between individuals to accurately predict genetic value. This study aimed to examine the importance of information on relatives versus that of unrelated or more distantly related individuals on the estimation of genomic breeding values.MethodsSimulated and real data were used to examine the effects of various degrees of relationship on the accuracy of genomic selection. Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (gBLUP) was compared to two pedigree based BLUP methods  one with a shallow one generation pedigree and the other with a deep ten generation pedigree. The accuracy of estimated breeding values for different groups of selection candidates that had varying degrees of relationships to a reference data set of 1750 animals was investigated.ResultsThe gBLUP method predicted breeding values more accurately than BLUP. The most accurate breeding values were estimated using gBLUP for closely related animals. Similarly  the pedigree based BLUP methods were also accurate for closely related animals  however when the pedigree based BLUP methods were used to predict unrelated animals  the accuracy was close to zero. In contrast  gBLUP breeding values  for animals that had no pedigree relationship with animals in the reference data set  allowed substantial accuracy.ConclusionsAn animal's relationship to the reference data set is an important factor for the accuracy of genomic predictions.

However  genomic selection also relies on relationships between individuals to accurately predict genetic value. This study aimed to examine the importance of information on relatives versus that of unrelated or more distantly related individuals on the estimation of genomic breeding values. Simulated and real data were used to examine the effects of various degrees of relationship on the accuracy of genomic selection. Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (gBLUP) was compared to two pedigree based BLUP methods  one with a shallow one generation pedigree and the other with a deep ten generation pedigree. The accuracy of estimated breeding values for different groups of selection candidates that had varying degrees of relationships to a reference data set of 1750 animals was investigated. The gBLUP method predicted breeding values more accurately than BLUP. The most accurate breeding values were estimated using gBLUP for closely related animals. Similarly  the pedigree based BLUP methods were also accurate for closely related animals  however when the pedigree based BLUP methods were used to predict unrelated animals  the accuracy was close to zero. In contrast  gBLUP breeding values  for animals that had no pedigree relationship with animals in the reference data set  allowed substantial accuracy. An animal's relationship to the reference data set is an important factor for the accuracy of genomic predictions. Animals that share a close relationship to the reference data set had the highest accuracy from genomic predictions. However a baseline accuracy that is driven by the reference data set size and the overall population effective population size enables gBLUP to estimate a breeding value for unrelated animals within a population (breed)  using information previously ignored by pedigree based BLUP methods. Genomic selection (GS) is a method that uses genomic information to estimate breeding values and rank selection candidates in livestock breeding programs. It has become widely used in some livestock industries e.g. dairy cattle and pig improvement programs. Initial studies on genomic evaluation have suggested that GS predicts the effects of markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with quantitative trait loci (QTL). This implies that accurate predictions of breeding value may persist for several generations  allowing for: 1) a reduced number of phenotypic measurements in each generation [] and; 2) the possibility of accurate predictions across different breeds provided sufficient marker density []. Habier et al. [] proposed that genomic predictions also rely on the genetic relationships between individuals with phenotypic records  usually known as the reference data set  and those whose breeding value is to be predicted [  ]. The following question arises: does an animal that has its breeding value predicted from genomic information require relatives in a reference data set? The reference data set is used to gain information on important phenotypes and genotypes so that genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) can be highly accurate for selection candidates. The makeup and size of this data set  combined with the methods used to predict the breeding value  govern the accuracy achieved in many breeding schemes []. Due to the cost of measuring genotypes and phenotypes on large numbers of individuals  it has been suggested that using a specially selected reference data set may be a cost effective way of gaining the economic advantage presented by genomic selection  especially for species such as beef cattle and sheep that do not have the nucleus structure of the dairy cattle  pig and poultry industries [  ]. Various methods are used to predict breeding values from genomic data. These range from variable selection methods such as BayesB  which allows only a small number of loci to have an effect  some of them potentially large  to gBLUP  which assumes equal variance across all loci []. Empirical evidence across livestock populations has shown that in many cases these methods obtain very similar accuracies of the estimated breeding value []. This suggests that additive genetic variation for many traits is controlled by many genes with a small effect  somewhat like Fisher's (1918) [] 'infinitesimal model'. The gBLUP method to estimate genomic breeding values has been widely described [      ]. This method uses genomic information in the form of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) that defines the additive genetic covariance between animals []. The GRM then replaces the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix (NRM) in the traditional BLUP equations. The GRM is expected to give a more accurate estimate of the covariance between individuals  however  it is important to understand how much accuracy is gained from improved measures of covariance among known relatives and how much is gained from information on distant 'relatives' previously ignored via the pedigree method. Goddard [] and Daetwyler et al. [] presented methods to predict the accuracy of genomic selection. These methods predict accuracy based on the effective population size  the number of animals in the reference data set  the heritability and the effective number of chromosome segments segregating within the population. Hayes et al. [] extended the approach by Goddard [] to consider information from relatives and illustrated that the GRM uses information on true relationships  which can vary around the expected additive genetic relationship predicted from pedigree. This study will compare the accuracy of an animal's breeding value that has a strong pedigree relationship with a reference data set with that of an animal that is essentially unrelated to the reference data set  and discuss the effect of these relationships on the design of reference data sets used in genomic selection breeding schemes. To examine the effect of relationships between animals in the test and reference data sets  we used both computer simulation and real phenotypic data from the Australian Sheep CRC Information Nucleus Flock (INF). The INF animals are located at eight sites across Australia and managed by CRC partner organizations  including The University of New England  NSW Department of Primary Industries  Victorian Department of Primary Industries  South Australian Research and Development Institute and The Department of Agriculture of Western Australia. The experimental data in this paper were obtained according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethics committees of these organizations. Genotype simulations were conducted using the Markovian Coalescence Simulator (MaCS) [] to simulate 2 000 base haplotypes  with an effective population size ( ) of 100. As described in Clark et al. []  thirty chromosomes each with base haplotypes of a 100 cM region (1·10 base pairs) were simulated  with a per site mutation rate of 2.5·10. The total number of SNP segregating on the genome was approximately 1 670 000 (SNP sequence). Sixty thousand SNP markers and 10 000 QTL were randomly selected from the SNP sequence in the base generation to be used in the genomic analysis (9428 QTL segregating in the final generation). Therefore each SNP had a 3% chance of being used as a marker and a 0.5% chance of being used as a QTL. The additive effect of each QTL was drawn from a gamma distribution with a shape and scale of 0.4 and 1.66 respectively [] and had a 50% chance of being positive or negative. The base population haplotypes were randomly allocated to 80 base males and 2 000 base female animals of a simulated population structure  with 10 subsequent generations receiving these haplotypes via mendelian inheritance  allowing recombination to occur according to genetic distance  i.e. 1% recombination per cM. The population was simulated for 10 generations and each generation contained 4000 animals  half male and half female. Eighty males were randomly selected in each generation and each male was randomly mated to 25 females  which each had two offspring per generation. Only breeding animals were allocated breeding values and phenotypes. The true breeding value () of each animal was determined using: where  is the additive effect of QTL genotype () and  is the QTL genotype at locus  which is coded as 0  1  or 2 and is the number of copies of the QTL that an individual () carries. Trait phenotypes were simulated based on a heritability () of 0.3 and all other variation in phenotype was due to a random environmental effect drawn from a normal distribution with variance . Three reference data sets of 1 750 animals were formed for the simulation study. Reference data set 1 (closely related) consisted of animals from the 10 generation. This reference data set was constructed such that animals in the test data set had 20 half sibs in the reference data set. Reference data set 2 (distantly related) also consisted of animals in the 10 generation but there were no close relationships between animals in the test and reference data sets. However there were some second degree relationships (1 cousins) between the two data sets. The final reference data set (unrelated) consisted of females from generation 1 and resulted in a very low or zero relationship between the two data sets. The accuracy of prediction was assessed in the test data set which consisted of 250 animals from the 10 generation and the average correlation between TBV and estimated breeding value (genomic or pedigree based) was calculated over 10 replicates of the simulation study. As in Hayes et al. []  we assumed a model where  is a vector of phenotypes  µ is the mean  1 is a vector of 1s   is a design matrix allocating records to breeding values  g is a vector of breeding values for animals in the reference set and the test set and e is a vector of normal deviates with variance . Furthermore  where  is the genomic relationship matrix (GRM)  and  is the genetic variance for this model. The GRM () was formed using the method as defined by VanRaden [] Traditional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) was also performed  using a deep (BLUP-D)  10 generation pedigree or a shallow  single generation pedigree (BLUP-S). Traditional BLUP ignores genomic data and relies on information from ancestors using a numerator relationship matrix () based on pedigree information. This method uses the same model as gBLUP (above) however with the vector of additive genetic values g replaced by a  with  where  is the numerator relationship matrix and  is the additive genetic variance. Variance components for both BLUP methods were estimated with ASREML [] and the model solutions yielded estimated breeding values. The reference data set consisted of phenotypic and genotypic records for the Merino sheep from the Australian Sheep Cooperative Research Centre information nucleus flock (INF) []. The traits ultrasound scanned eye muscle depth (EMD; 1781 animals) and live weight at ultrasound scanning (SC_WT; 1743 animals) were evaluated. Scanned EMD is used to estimate the size of the rib-eye muscle  which produces high value cuts of meat  and SC_WT is highly correlated to an animal's weight at post weaning. Animals in the INF were sired by rams from the wider Merino population; these sires were chosen to maximize the connectedness with the Australian sheep flock by sampling artificial insemination sires from a wide range of sheep breeders. The test data set consisted of a population of Australian Merino industry sires with highly accurate Australian sheep breeding values (ASBV). Information about ASBV definitions can be found at the following website maintained by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd and Meat and Livestock Australia []. The industry sires were divided into closely  distantly and unrelated groups based on their pedigree relationship the animals in the INF flock. The maximum relationship of an animal in the test data set with an animal in the reference data set ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 (no progeny included) for the 48 closely related test animals  from 0 to 0.125 for the 60 distantly related test animals  and the 53 unrelated test animals shared no pedigree relationship to the reference data set. All animals were genotyped using the Illumina 50 K ovine SNP chip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA)  which includes 54 977 SNP. Following the genotyping procedures  quality control measures were applied to all SNP as follows: SNP were removed if they had a call rate of less than 95%  a GC score (proportion of guanine-cytosine pairs) of less than 0.6  a minor allele frequency of less than 0.01  a SNP heterozygosity of greater than 3 s.d. from the mean (mean heterozygosity  0.374; s.d.  0.129)  were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (a P-value cut-off of 1·10)  had no genome location or were in greater than 0.99 LD with another SNP on the chip []. After these quality control measures were applied  48 640 SNP were used. Missing genotypes were imputed using fast PHASE []. The following fixed effects were fitted in both trait models: sex  birth type  rearing type  age of dam  contemporary group (birth year • birth month • site • management group) and age-at-trait recording  SC_WT was fitted in the analysis of EMD. As in Daetwyler et al. []  the following model was assumed where  is a design matrix relating the fixed effects (as described above) to each animal and  is a vector of fixed effects. Genetic evaluation was undertaken using BLUP-D  using a deep pedigree of 7277 animals that ranged from one to eight generations in length (depending on the individual)  and gBLUP as defined above. Variance components for all methods were again estimated using ASREML [] and the model solutions yielded estimated breeding values. The empirical accuracy (r) for the Merino data analysis was evaluated as the Pearson product-moment correlation between the GEBV and a progeny test ASBV of the animals in the test data set. The empirical accuracy may be an underestimate of the 'real' accuracy because the ASBV accuracies are below 1. The validation sires had an ASBV accuracy greater than 0.5 and the mean accuracy was 0.85 for EMD and 0.9 for SC_WT. The ASBVs used were calculated such that they included no information from animals in the reference data set. The Merino sheep population is highly heterogeneous and can be divided into strains defined as fine  medium and strong wool types. Correlations between GEBV and ASBV were calculated after accounting for the effect of strain. The empirical accuracy of the breeding values estimated in the test set  for the simulation example was defined as the correlation between the true and estimated breeding value. The accuracy was also estimated for each individual as:  where;  is the prediction error variance estimated using elements from the mixed model equations    is the diagonal of the GRM for animal  and is substituted for   in traditional BLUP   is the additive genetic variance. Furthermore   where;   is the diagonal of inverse of the coefficient matrix for animal  and  is the residual variance (See Appendix 1). To determine the effect of an individual's relationship to the reference data set on the accuracy of genomic predictions  a range of comparisons were made between varying definitions of relatedness and an individual's GEBV accuracy using r. Four measures of genomic relatedness were considered: a) An animal's mean relationship with the reference data set; b) its maximum relationship; c) its mean top 10 relationships and d) its mean top 100 relationships. Breeding values that were estimated using gBLUP always achieved a higher accuracy than both pedigree-based BLUP methods. When animals in the test and reference data sets were closely related (reference data set 1)  all methods gave an accurate prediction of breeding value (Table ). When the two data sets were distantly related (reference data set 2)  accuracies were generally lower but the reduction in accuracy was much smaller for gBLUP than for the pedigree-based BLUP methods. Furthermore  when the two data sets' were unrelated (reference data set 3)  gBLUP gave much higher accuracies than both BLUP methods. There was no significant difference in accuracy between BLUP-S and BLUP-D when the animals in the test and reference data sets had a close relationship. However  when a shallow pedigree was used  and animals in the test and reference data sets were distantly related or unrelated  all breeding values estimated using BLUP-S were zero. In contrast  BLUP-D predicted a breeding value with a significant accuracy when the reference and test data sets shared a distant relationship and accuracy reduced to close to zero when animals in the reference and test data sets were unrelated. The estimate of accuracy  r  when averaged over the test data set  was similar to the empirical accuracy of the group r. The largest difference between the two accuracy estimates was observed for gBLUP  where runder-estimated the realized accuracy when half-sib family information was used (Figure ). . There was no significant difference in the empirical accuracy of the estimated breeding values between pedigree and genomic methods for EMD for close relationships (Table ). As in the simulated data  when the relationship between the test and reference data sets was reduced the difference in accuracy between gBLUP and BLUP-D increased. In addition  there was still a significant amount of accuracy achieved when using gBLUP in unrelated animals. Results for SC_WT are given in Table  showing that gBLUP gave higher accuracies than BLUP-D. When the relationship between the test and reference data sets was reduced  gBLUP was again considerably more accurate than BLUP-D. For the EMD example  the estimated and empirical accuracies were very similar when using gBLUP. However for the SC_WT scenarios  there was a large difference between the estimated accuracy and the empirical accuracy. To predict the accuracy of a GEBV based on an animal's mean relationship with the reference data set gave a poor prediction of accuracy (Figure ). The best predictor of accuracy was an animal's mean top 10 relationships with the reference (Figure )  whereas its highest relationship to the reference was also a good predictor of accuracy (Figure ). . These measures include: a) The mean relationship  b) The average of the top ten relationships  c) The average of the top 100 relationships and d) The maximum relationship to the reference population. The relationship between the animals in the test and reference data sets has an effect on the accuracy of genomic predictions. Close relationships between the two data sets' result in the highest accuracy for GEBV. Similar results were predicted by Hayes et al. [] and observed by Habier et al. [  ] for populations that share a close relationship. However  breeding values that are predicted for closely related animals using the traditional pedigree-based BLUP approach also achieve high accuracy. The current study has shown that when there is a distant relationship between the animals in the test and reference data sets  gBLUP is still able to predict an animal's breeding value with some accuracy. Furthermore  when the animals are unrelated by pedigree or when the pedigree relationships are low  gBLUP can use information from distant relatives to maintain a proportion of accuracy of the GEBV. The information gathered from only distantly related animals enabled an estimate of breeding value to be made with some accuracy. However  when relatives were included in the reference data set  the importance of information on distantly related animals may be reduced. Selection index theory shows that when information on closely related animals is available  more weight is placed on this information and therefore information from distantly related animals becomes less important. Although the importance of information from distant relatives is reduced  this extra information  which is not used in pedigree-based methods  enables gBLUP to achieve a higher accuracy of the EBV. The inclusion of information on relatives improves the accuracy of the predicted breeding values. If there are no close relationships between animals in the reference and test data sets  the accuracy of the GEBV is driven by distant relationships  which will be more useful when there is more LD in the population. The accuracy obtained for these animals can be called the 'baseline accuracy'  which is the accuracy that may be expected for a member of the population that does not have any close relatives in the reference data set. Goddard [] and Daetwyler et al. [] proposed predictive formulae for the accuracy of genomic predictions. These methods depend on the size of the reference data set  the effective population size of the breed  the heritability of the trait and the length of the genome []. The overall  will govern the effective number and size of chromosome segments ( ) that are segregating in the population. If the effective population size is small  it is expected that animals will share larger chromosome segments and the genomic predictions will be more accurate [  ]. The accuracy (r) for an individual with no phenotype  as described by Goddard []  is then predicted as: Where <U+03C1> = (1 + a+ 2va)  with a = 1+2*<U+03BB>/ and  is the number of animals in the reference  <U+03BB> = s /s where s is the residual variance and s is the genetic variance at a single locus and is estimated by s = h/ ·k where  = 2 and is the effective number of chromosome segments  h is the heritability and k = 1/log(2 ). For the simulation example  = 1750   = 100  h = 0.3 and  = 30. Then k = 0.189  <U+03BB> = 3773.8  a = 5.31 and consequently the accuracy for an individual with no phenotype was equal to 0.36. Similarly  the alternative method described by Daetwyler et al. [] results in a predicted accuracy of 0.28 (details not shown). The predicted accuracies resulting from either method were similar to the baseline accuracy in our study achieved by gBLUP in unrelated individuals (0.34). In the theoretical prediction methods  there is some ambiguity about the approximation of [  ]  with proposed values equal to: a) 2 4; b) 4 and c) 2. Using [] for each of these values results in predicted accuracies of a) 0.74 b) 0.27 and c) 0.36. Consequently 2 appears to be the most appropriate variable for baseline accuracy in our simulation example. For the Merino sheep data  with an estimated  of approximately 1 000 []  the expected accuracy was 0.15 and lower than that achieved by gBLUP for EMD (0.28) and for SC_WT (0.18). This increase for gBLUP in the real data is possibly due to extra information from animals that shared a genomic relationship but were unknown in the pedigree  or the estimation of  may have been affected by heterogeneity of the breed  which really consists of several sub-populations. Accuracy estimated using the prediction error variance of the mixed model equations () was shown to be a good approximation of empirical accuracy for the simulation example. Estimated and empirical accuracies were also very similar when using gBLUP for the EMD example. However  some differences between and empirical accuracy were observed for both  BLUP-D and gBLUP in real data in the case of SC_WT. In the simulation example  the empirical accuracy was the correlation between the TBV and EBV (or GEBV)  whereas in the Merino data example  the empirical accuracy was the correlation between the ASBV and EBV (or GEBV). The ASBVs are progeny test estimates and have some prediction error associated with them. The empirical accuracy was also likely to be affected by sampling because of the small size of each test data set (50-60 animals). Furthermore  unlike the simulation data  where all animals were linked by a true pedigree  many Merino animals in the unrelated test set had no direct pedigree relationships with the reference data set and therefore only zero breeding values were estimated for these animals. In contrast  in the case of missing pedigree  gBLUP could use genomic relationship information and a more accurate breeding value was estimated for all animals in the test set. Another complexity in our real data example is the heterogeneity of the Merino sheep population  as it consists of many sub-populations. In routine ASBV analyses  this population structure is accounted for using pedigree information and genetic groups based on individual flock data. When correlating GEBV and ASBV  we accounted for sub-population effects by assigning sires to groups of \"fine wool\"  \"medium wool\" and \"strong wool\". Empirical accuracies for SC_WT were clearly affected by correcting for the sub-population structure  which may explain why there are some differences between rand r for this trait. The corrections had little to no effect on empirical accuracy for EMD. Note that EMD was corrected for SC_WT and this may have removed some of the sub-population effects on EMD. The makeup of reference data sets is an important factor for the design of genomic evaluation systems to enable additional genetic gain from genomic selection at the lowest cost. This is especially true for beef cattle and sheep breeding programs that do not have a distinct nucleus tier. We have shown that genomic predictions are more accurate when animals are related to the reference data set; however substantial baseline accuracy can be achieved for all animals in the population. To achieve this  the reference data set will need to include a large number of animals that cover the genetic diversity of the given population (breed). It may be important to include animals that are expected to contribute more to the future gene pool in that breed but these contributions need to be balanced by contributions to genetic diversity []. The optimal size of the reference data set will depend on  of the given population; populations with higher  may need a larger reference data set so that suitable baseline accuracies can be achieved. If the baseline accuracy is low (large  and small reference data set size) the contribution of relatives' information will be larger  however this information from relatives is only limited to closely related individuals and will not last over many generations. The relationship between animals in the reference and test data sets affects the accuracy of predicting breeding values using gBLUP. When there is a close relationship between the animals in the reference and test data sets  gBLUP can estimate breeding values with a high accuracy. When there is only a distant relationship between the animals in test and reference data sets  gBLUP can still estimate a breeding value with some accuracy. This baseline accuracy depends on the effective population size and the size of the reference data set  and should be carefully considered when designing a reference data set for a breeding program. Firstly the variance of a is defined as: where  is the additive genetic variance and G is the diagonal of the numerator relationship matrix (or genomic relationship matrix). The prediction error variance is defined as: where  is the residual variance and  is the diagonal of the inverse of the coefficient matrix  furthermore:  where var() is the estimate of the variance of a and is equal to: Therefore the regression coefficient (r) is equal to: recall:  and Therefore: Finally the accuracy (r) of the estimated breeding value is then given by: Muir WM: Comparison of genomic and traditional BLUP-estimated breeding value accuracy and selection response under alternative trait and genomic parameters.

Use of a shallow reference population  most closely related to the selection candidates  gave early benefits while in later generations  when marker effects were not updated  the estimation of marker effects based on a deeper reference population did not pay off. Genomic breeding values estimated with genetic markers distributed over the whole genome (MEBV) have become important in dairy cattle breeding [  ]  and efforts are undertaken to implement this technology in other animal species [  ] as well as in plants [  ]. The expected advantages of selection based on MEBV over traditional selection methods  where the estimation of breeding values is based solely on phenotypes and pedigree information  include an increased accuracy of MEBV compared to traditionally estimated breeding values  in combination with a reduced generation interval and a lower rate of inbreeding  e.g. due to the ability to distinguish between sibs [–]. Calculation of MEBV requires a population with information on genetic markers and phenotypes  called the  population. Information on the relation between markers and phenotypic information in the reference population is used to calculate MEBV of individuals with only marker information  called the  population. Factors affecting the accuracy of MEBV include the heritability of the trait  the size of the reference population  the method used to estimate allelic effects of the markers  linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL)  and the distribution of QTL effects  i.e. the genetic architecture of the trait [  –]. The accuracy of estimated breeding values  estimated either with traditional methods such as pedigree BLUP or with the use of markers  decreases when the number of generations separating the reference and the evaluation populations increases [  ]. Using pedigree BLUP  this decrease is mainly due to the inability of this method to predict the random segregation of genomic segments to the next generation. Using markers  this segregation can be traced and  for the part of the genetic variance that is explained through LD with the markers  the decrease in accuracy per generation is smaller than for the remaining part of the genetic variance that is explained solely by family structure. The accuracy that is due to LD with markers is only affected by the changing patterns of LD between markers and QTL. More persistent accuracies of MEBV are expected when the average distance between markers and QTL decreases  as this leads to lower recombination rates []. The structure of the reference population is expected to have an effect on the persistence of accuracies because it affects how well the genetic variance of QTL can be assigned to markers near the QTL as opposed to markers that are more distant. When individuals in the reference population are more related  they will share longer stretches of chromosomes surrounding the QTL  allowing more distant markers to explain QTL variation within the reference population. Because the recombination rates between these more distant markers and the QTL are higher  they will loose their predictive value more quickly compared to markers near the QTL. Selecting animals for the reference population across more generations will reduce the average relationship within the reference population and is expected to lead to more persistent accuracies of MEBV. Moreover  in populations under selection  LD is expected to change more rapidly compared to unselected populations  with the result that accuracies of the MEBV decrease faster under selection [  ]. A variety of methods for estimating MEBV exist  including Bayesian methods (BM) such as BayesA and BayesB proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  ridge regression [  ]  BLUP methodology with the use of a realized relationship matrix calculated from the markers (GBLUP) [  ]  principal component regression (PCR) []  and partial least square regression (PLSR) [  ]. Methods BM and PLSR deal with the high dimension of the marker data by assigning different variances or weights to individual markers. After one generation  these methods result in higher accuracies when genetic variance is due to a small number of QTL compared to traits with more QTL of small effect [  ]. Pedigree BLUP and GBLUP estimate covariances between individuals based on pedigree data or marker data  respectively and may be less dependent than BM and PLSR on LD between individual markers and QTL []. The performance of estimation methods has been extensively evaluated in simulations. Information on the performance of these methods when the MEBV are being used for selection  however  is very limited. A few studies applying selection on MEBV are the selection on MEBV estimated using GBLUP  in the studies of Muir []) and Jannink [] and in a study by Sonesson and Meuwissen []. A systematic comparison between methods to calculate MEBV is lacking concerning their ability to achieve a selection response for more than one generation under a range of genetic architectures (number of QTL and distribution of QTL variance). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of choices that can be made  in terms of evaluation methods and between reference population structures  on the long-term selection response. The evaluation was done across a range of genetic architectures to avoid conclusions that may hold only under specific circumstances. The reference population structure was evaluated because a reference population made up of multiple generations was expected to increase the long-term accuracy of MEBV compared to a reference population made up of a single generation [    ]. Comparisons of methods and reference structures were based on genetic progress  accuracy of MEBV  inbreeding rate and reduction of genetic variance. Finally  accuracies of MEBV under directional selection were compared to accuracies with random selection. The simulations were performed using the R-package HaploSim []  which is available from the R repository CRAN at . We refer to Coster et al. [] for a detailed description of the simulations to create the starting populations. Briefly  the simulated genomes consisted of four 1 Morgan chromosomes. The genome contained 40 000 equally distributed loci where mutations were allowed  most of the 40 000 loci were monomorphic at any time. Random mating was simulated from generation -5005 to generation -1 to generate LD between loci and to reach mutation-drift equilibrium. The number of recombinations on each chromosome per meiosis event was drawn from a Poisson distribution  and the mutation rate of the 40 000 loci was set at 10 per meiosis. The mutation rate was set to 0 after generation -1  to avoid the introduction of a large number of markers with very low minor allele frequency (MAF). All loci that were polymorphic in generation -1 were used as markers. Each individual in generations -5005 to -2 contributed two gametes to the next generation  which were randomly combined to form individuals. Consequently  a constant population size of 100 individuals with an effective population size of 199 was maintained throughout these generations of random mating. In generation -1  each individual contributed ten gametes to the next generation  with the objective to increase the population size to 500 individuals. The individuals of this generation were formed as pairs of random gametes from distinct parents to avoid selfing. Thirty replicates of this population were simulated and stored. From the data of each replicate  all four genetic architectures were created. Each of the five estimation methods was then applied in combination with one or two selection approaches to each population. In this way  identical base populations were used in a variety of simulation and selection scenarios. The four genetic architectures  five estimation methods and two selection approaches are explained below. Four traits with different genetic architectures were created in each simulated population by combining a  or  number of QTL  with one of two distributions of QTL variance   and  QTL variance (Table ). The high number of QTL was simulated by selecting 50% of the markers with a MAF above 0.10 in generation -4 as QTL. The low number of QTL was simulated by retaining every 10QTL from the high QTL density and removing the remaining 90% from the data. QTL density and number of QTL are interchangeable measures because the length of the genome is fixed and the distribution and number of polymorphic loci are the same in all scenarios within a replicate. The variance of all QTL was set to 1 in the equal distribution case and the allelic effect of a QTL was calculated as  where p and q are the frequencies of the two QTL alleles. In the unequal distribution case  the allelic effect of every 10QTL was multiplied by 9 to make its variance 81 times the variance of the other QTL. This resulted in the unequal distribution  where 10% of the QTL accounted for 90% of the total genetic variance. All polymorphic loci that remained after selecting the QTL for the high QTL density were used as biallelic markers in all scenarios. Within a replicate  this resulted in an identical set of markers for each genetic architecture. The true breeding value of an individual was calculated as the sum of the effects of the QTL alleles it received. The additive genetic variance    was calculated as the variance of the breeding values of the individuals in generation -4. Random normal deviates from a  distribution were added to the breeding values to simulate phenotypes with a heritability of 0.25. The reference population always consisted of 500 individuals with genotypes and phenotypes but could have one of two structures. The reference population was either   consisting of all 500 individuals from generation 0 (1 × 500)  or the reference population was   consisting of 100 individuals from each of generations -4 to 0 (5 × 100). The deep reference population was an attempt to reduce the average relationship between reference animals compared to the shallow reference population. In generations following those of the reference population  no additional phenotypes were recorded for methods BM  PLSR and GBLUP  and therefore the marker effects were not updated after the initial analysis of the reference population. Breeding values were estimated for all individuals from generation -4 onwards using five different methods. The first two methods were a bayesian model (BM) and partial least square regression (PLSR). BM and PLSR methods were similar in that they estimated allelic effects for each individual marker using the phenotypes and markers in the reference population. These estimated allelic effects were subsequently used to calculate MEBV as follows: where  was the vector of breeding values estimated with the marker genotypes   was an incidence matrix that related allele counts to individuals  and  was the vector of allelic effects of the markers  estimated either with method BM or with PLSR. The next two methods applied the BLUP methodology. Genomic BLUP (GBLUP) used a relationship matrix    estimated from marker data and pedigree BLUP (BLUP) estimated the relationship matrix    from pedigree records. Both GBLUP and BLUP used  or  as a covariance matrix among relatives in an animal model: where  was a vector of estimated breeding values (EBV for estimates from pedigree BLUP and MEBV for estimates from GBLUP which used the marker data)   was an incidence matrix relating each individual to its breeding value in vector . In the last method  RANDOM  random numbers were assigned to selection candidates as estimated breeding values. This method was included as a baseline in which changes in LD are only affected by drift and recombination. The RANDOM method made it possible to compare changes in accuracies of MEBV over generations in situations with and without selection acting on LD and allele frequencies. The Bayesian method (BM) was used as implemented by Verbyla et al. []. In this model  the allelic effects of the markers were considered independent random normal variables. The allelic effects of markers were considered to be from a mixture distribution. Effects were sampled from a wide  distribution or a more narrow  distribution. The prior for the probability of marker effect being sampled from the wide distribution was the ratio of the true number of QTL over the number of markers. The true number of QTL was counted in the generations that contributed to the reference population  generations -4 to 0. The prior for the QTL variance  was set to the genetic variance resulting in generations -4 to 0  divided by the true number of QTL. The priors were set separately for each scenario and each replicate. The BM method used Gibbs sampling to numerically integrate over the posterior distribution of the model. The Gibbs sampler was run for 10 000 iterations and the first 1000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. Estimates of allelic effects of the markers were calculated as the mean of the posterior distributions. Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) reduces the dimensions of the regression model by building orthogonal linear combinations of markers  or components  which have a maximal correlation with the trait []. The trait was subsequently regressed on these components. Cross-validation was used on the data in the reference population to find the number of components that minimized the prediction error. We used the  function in the package pls [] of R [] to fit and cross-validate the models. The algorithm to fit and cross-validate the PLSR models was modified according to Coster et al. [] to reduce the computation time. GBLUP was performed by solving the mixed model equations of an animal model using a relationship matrix estimated from the marker data as the covariance matrix among relatives  following Van Raden []. The relationship matrix  was calculated as: where matrix  was the genotype matrix  with -1 for one of the homozygous genotypes  0 for a heterozygous genotype and 1 for the alternative homozygous genotype. Matrix  was a diagonal matrix with the reciprocal of the expected variance of each marker on the diagonal elements  where p and q were the frequencies of the two QTL alleles. We used the  function in the pedigree package [] of R [] to calculate these MEBV  using the simulated heritability of 0.25. The simulated phenotypes of all 900 individuals in generations -4 to 0 were used to estimate breeding values using pedigree BLUP. This represents 400 additional phenotypes compared to the 500 used by all three genomic estimation methods. The inverted genetic relationship matrix  was calculated from the pedigree data with generation -4 as the unrelated base population. The matrix  was calculated using function  of the R-package pedigree. The pedigree BLUP approach only used phenotypes of the 900 individuals in generations -4 to 0. For the subsequent generations  only pedigree information was used to estimate breeding values. We used the  function of the pedigree package in R [] to calculate the EBV  with the simulated level of heritability of 0.25. Selection started in generation 0  the last generation of the reference data  and was continued for ten generations. In each generation  100 individuals (50 males and 50 females) were selected from the 500 candidates. Selected individuals were mated at random and each pair produced ten offspring  making the next generation consist of 50 fullsib families of size ten. The three methods to calculate MEBV (BM  PLSR  GBLUP) were applied to each of the two reference population structures to form six genomic selection approaches. Each genomic selection approach was applied to each of the four genetic architectures (Table ). Selection on pedigree BLUP EBV and RANDOM selection were also applied to each of the four genetic architectures. In the RANDOM scenarios  selection was performed by randomly sampling males and females to produce the next generation. Breeding values of random selection generations were estimated with each of the three genomic estimation methods BM  PLSR and GBLUP. The random selection scenario was included to assess the impact of selection on accuracies of MEBV. Accuracies of MEBV from selection scenarios were compared to accuracies of MEBV in the RANDOM scenarios where there was no selection that could cause changes in the LD between markers and QTL  changes in the frequencies of QTL alleles  or reduction of . This resulted in 32 unique scenarios of genetic architecture by selection approach. The results for each scenario were obtained from 30 replicates. The evaluation of simulation scenarios was based on genetic improvement  incurred inbreeding  accuracy of the (M)EBV and loss of genetic variance over ten generations of selection. Genetic improvement was calculated as the cumulative increase of the average breeding value () in each generation. The average breeding value in each generation was standardized and presented as a percentage of the genetic standard deviation in generation 0. The inbreeding coefficient was calculated for each individual in the pedigree using the function  from the R-package pedigree []. The average increase in inbreeding was calculated for each generation  using generation 0 as the base population. The accuracy of the (M)EBV was calculated as the correlation of these (M)EBV with the simulated breeding values of the individual from each generation. The genetic variance was calculated in each generation as the variance of the simulated breeding values and presented as a percentage of the genetic variance in generation 0 or as the percentage reduction in genetic variance from generation 0. For each replicate  all 36 scenarios started with the same number of markers in generation 0  which was on average 1429 across the 30 replicates (Table ). The average minor allele frequency (MAF) of markers was 0.09  reflecting a U-shaped distribution of allele frequencies. Average LD between adjacent markers  measured as   was 0.05 (Table ). This low  value was due to the high number of low frequency alleles  which resulted from recent mutations. The average  between markers with MAF above 0.1  was 0.15  which was in line with expectations based on Sved []. The average number of QTL was 34 for the low QTL density and 340 for the high QTL density architecture (Table ). The average LD between QTL was 0.01 for the low QTL density and 0.15 for the high QTL density architecture (Table ). The number of QTL that accounted for 90% of the genetic variance ranged from only 3 for the low-unequal architecture to 306 for the high-equal architecture. Linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL () was defined as the average  between each QTL and the marker in highest LD with that QTL. The  was 0.46 for the low QTL and 0.47 for the high QTL density architecture  reflecting the fact that the marker density was the same in both scenarios (Table ). The increases in average genetic value  and in the average inbreeding  were measured over ten generations of selection. The reductions in the accuracy of MEBV and of  during selection were also measured because on the one hand they are affected by past selection and on the other hand they affect the genetic progress that can be obtained with future selection (i.e. <U+0394>G =  ·  · ). Genetic architecture had a strong impact on the maximum increase in  that was reached after ten generations of selection. The maximum increase in  was 321% for the low-unequal architecture and between 372 and 384% for the other three architectures (Table ). The pattern of much lower levels of  with the low-unequal architecture  compared to the other three genetic architectures  was the same for all estimation methods. The low-unequal architecture showed a fast reduction of genetic variance  indicating that the few QTL were quickly moved towards small minor allele frequencies. The order of the other three genetic architectures for final level of  was not consistent across estimation methods  but differences between these three genetic architectures were generally small. The response to the first generation of selection was similar for the three genomic evaluation methods when compared within a specific genetic architecture (Table ). Increases of  declined over generations for all selection approaches. For pedigree BLUP   reached a plateau after about two generations of selection. The pattern of results differed between the low-unequal and the other three genetic architectures. In the low-unequal architecture  the BM method was expected to do well because it gives specific emphasis to big QTL. BM was indeed the best genomic selection approach  on average  across reference population structures  both in generation 1 and after ten generations. The three other genetic architectures showed a consistent but different pattern from the low-unequal architecture  with GBLUP performing best in generation 1  while PLSR performed best in generation 10 for approaches that used a shallow reference population  and GBLUP performed best in generation 10 for approaches that used a deep reference population (Table ). In generation 1  selection on MEBV from a shallow reference population always resulted in a greater response in  compared to selection on MEBV from a deep reference population (Table ). Only in a few scenarios did we observe the expected superiority in level of  from a deep reference population after long-term selection  but the differences in levels of  between the deep and shallow reference populations were small for all scenarios. The accumulation of  was always below 1% per generation  except for selection on pedigree BLUP EBV for which the increase in  was 1.7% per generation. No differences in accumulation of  were seen between the different genetic architectures (Table ). Besides the high inbreeding with the pedigree BLUP selection method  the highest levels of  were incurred with the PLSR and BM selection approaches for all genetic architectures  with  after ten generation ranging from 7.0% to 7.7% for PLSR and from 6.9% to 7.6% for BM. Random selection only incurred a  of 4.7% to 4.9% after ten generations. GBLUP incurred only 1.4% to 1.7% more inbreeding after ten generations than random selection and incurred 0.6% to 0.9%  or roughly one tenth  less inbreeding than PLSR and BM (Table ). No effect on the accumulation of inbreeding was observed from differences in reference population structure or genetic architecture. Accuracies obtained within the reference population were similar for all the genomic estimation methods  with an average of 0.63 ± 0.03. For all scenarios  the accuracies dropped steeply in the first generations of selection  after which the decline became more or less linear. After ten generations of selection with the low-unequal genetic architecture  all genomic selection approaches showed an accuracy between 0.07 and 0.10. For the three other genetic architectures  the accuracy after ten generations was only slightly higher  with values between 0.12 and 0.16. The shallow reference population structure resulted in higher accuracies (0.63 ± 0.03) in the first generation of selection candidates compared to the deep reference population (0.55 ± 0.03). In the shallow reference structure  all selection candidates were included in the reference population with own phenotypes while in the deep reference structure  only 20% of the selection candidates were included in the reference population with own phenotypes. In generation 10  however  accuracies were no longer different between the two structures for a given genetic architecture and estimation method (Table ). MEBV were also estimated in each generation of the RANDOM selection scenarios based on training in the shallow reference population. Accuracies in the RANDOM selection scenarios were well above accuracies from the same model when directional selection was applied (Figure ). The largest difference was seen in the low-unequal genetic architecture where accuracy decreased quickly with the application of selection  primarily due to reduction of genetic variance. In the other three genetic architectures  differences were smaller  but the accuracies for the RANDOM selection scenarios were still 18% higher  on average. In the low-unequal architecture  accuracy was higher after ten generations of RANDOM selection with BM compared to the two other genomic evaluation methods. In this architecture with few QTL  BM could identify markers close to the QTL with a good predictive ability for several generations because recombinations between these markers and the QTL were rare  due to the short distance between them. . Accuracy of MEBV in generations 0 to 10 averaged over 30 replicates; panels show results from genetic architectures with a low number of QTL of unequal variance (row 1)  a low number of QTL of equal variance (row 2)  a high number of QTL of unequal variance (row 3) and a high number of QTL of equal variance (row 4); estimation methods are BM (column 1)  PLSR (column 2)  GBLUP (column 3) and pedigree BLUP (column 4); levels of accuracy are shown for selection with training on phenotypes from one generation (shallow reference population  red circles) or from five generations (deep reference population  blue diamonds); accuracies of MEBV under RANDOM selection are shown as gray triangles; symbols for some scenarios may be hidden if values overlap. Similar to the results for accuracy  a much bigger reduction in genetic variance was observed for the low-unequal architecture compared to the three other genetic architectures in all selection approaches. After the first generation of selection  an important reduction was seen in genetic variance for all selection methods (Table ). After the initial drop of genetic variance in the first generation of selection  a small rebound in genetic variance was seen in some scenarios before variance started to decrease again. This rebound could be partially attributed to the reduced accuracy of selection in later generations  as it was not observed with BM in the low-unequal scenario  where accuracies in generation 1 were substantially higher. Genetic variance can be increased by favorable QTL alleles moving to more intermediate frequencies. In scenarios with lower accuracies  the balance of increasing genetic variance from changing allele frequencies and decreasing variance from selection resulted in a small increase of variance. Genetic variance steadily decreased over the next generations of selection  except in the pedigree BLUP selection method  which became rather ineffective after a few generations  therefore limiting the loss of genetic variance  even though the inbreeding rate was high for this approach. The final percentage of genetic variance remaining in generation 10 ranged from 29.4% with BM in the low-unequal genetic architecture to 90.5% with pedigree BLUP in the low-equal genetic architecture. Comparing between the genomic selection approaches  GBLUP was best  it retained the highest genetic variance (43.2% to 81.2%)  PLSR the worst (42.1% to 66.2%) and BM (29.4% to 69.4%) roughly in the middle between GBLUP and PLSR  with the exception of the low-unequal architecture for which the lowest genetic variance was retained by BM. In summary  GBLUP could retain the highest genetic variance while PLSR retained the lowest genetic variance  except in the low-unequal genetic architecture where BM retained up to 15% less genetic variance than GBLUP (Table ). The deep reference population resulted in a smaller reduction in genetic variance after one generation of selection than the shallow reference population  but after ten generations  the differences in genetic variance were very small (Table ). In this study  response to selection was determined over ten generations with different selection approaches that combined one of the following estimation methods BM  BLUP  GBLUP or PLSR with a deep or shallow reference population structure. It has been found that accuracies of MEBV reduce with increasing distance between reference and selection candidates [  ] and that selection increases the effect of distance on accuracy and hence  on response to selection [  ]. The different selection approaches were compared under four different genetic architectures to investigate the effects of evaluation methods and reference population on accuracy of MEBV and selection response. The results of this study can help to choose MEBV methods for distinct scenarios. Genetic architecture affects the comparison of methods to estimate genomic breeding values. In the frequently simulated low-unequal architecture  which has a few QTL  there is a clear benefit for the BM method. In the low-unequal scenario  BM appears to be able to identify markers in LD with QTL  giving this method an advantage in early generations and in long-term response. The increase in  with the PLSR method was comparable to results obtained with GBLUP in the low-unequal scenario. This result is different from the pattern observed in []  where PLSR showed considerably lower accuracy than BM and GBLUP in a simulated dataset that was very similar to the low-unequal architecture used here. A reason for this difference could lie in the implementation of PLSR. The results in [] were obtained by a two-step procedure where variable selection preceded model fitting  which is suboptimal to the simultaneous selection and fitting of the model that was applied to obtain the results presented here. When the number of QTL increases  as for the three genetic architectures other than low-unequal  the conclusions change. The three genomic methods performed differently in terms of genetic improvement  with GBLUP performing best in generation 1 and PLSR or GBLUP performing best in generation 10 for approaches that used a shallow or deep reference population  respectively (Table ). GBLUP had a clear advantage in generation 10 especially in comparison to PLSR and BM  with a smaller increase in inbreeding and smaller reduction of genetic variance. The GBLUP method combined a good response in  with a smaller increase in . Although the priors were set to the true values for genetic variance and number of QTL  which would be difficult in practice  BM resulted in somewhat smaller increases in  compared to the other genomic evaluation methods for all architectures except the low-unequal one where BM resulted in an intermediate increase in G. Low-unequal is an architecture that fits the approach of the BM model well  since having fewer QTL improves the power to select the correct SNP into the model [  ]. Selection is an important factor when comparing methods to estimate genomic breeding values  especially for traits with a low-unequal architecture. In populations under selection  the pattern of decrease in accuracy was not very different between estimation methods. However  without selection in the RANDOM scenarios  BM performed better to keep high accuracies up to ten generations past the reference population. It is important to realize that this advantage disappears when one is actually selecting on the MEBV. Genomic selection approaches are expected to incur less inbreeding than pedigree BLUP selection [  ]. When the estimation methods BM  PLSR and GBLUP became inaccurate in later generations  they caused much smaller increases in inbreeding compared to the pedigree BLUP method. The lower inbreeding from genomic estimation compared to pedigree BLUP agreed with earlier results that indicated that genomic estimation methods can track mendelian sampling within families [] and that pedigree BLUP tends to select family members []. Accuracies of pedigree BLUP breeding values in generation 0  and hence the response to selection on pedigree BLUP in generation 1 were at the same level as accuracies and response for genomic selection methods. The pedigree BLUP accuracy in generation 1  of approximately 0.60  was as expected with a heritability of 0.25 and phenotypes on the selection candidates and several of its sibs. The accuracies for genomic evaluation methods depend  among other factors  on the size of the reference population. The reference population size was chosen to yield an intermediate accuracy to allow for differences in accuracies from estimation method and/or reference population structure to become evident. Accuracies that are obtained as an output of the genetic evaluation model  i.e. obtained from the mixed model equations in pedigree BLUP  can be biased if pre-selection occurs on for instance MEBV []. Similarly  the estimated genetic progress can be affected by bias in the accuracies of MEBV when they are obtained from the evaluation model. These biases were not found in our simulation results because accuracies were obtained from correlations of MEBV with the true breeding values and selection response was calculated as the increase in average true breeding values. Differences between reference populations with a deep or shallow structure were most apparent in the first generations of selection. Methods to estimate MEBV used not only the LD in the population but also any family structure within the reference population that was detectable by markers. When predicting MEBV in generation 1 with data from the shallow reference population  a considerable contribution to the accuracy of those MEBV will originate from family structure detected by markers []. Especially in a small breeding population  individuals may need to be included from multiple generations to make up a sizeable reference population. The deep reference population that covered multiple generations increased the average genetic distance of candidates with reference individuals and reduced the accuracy of the MEBV and resulting selection response in generation 1. In later generations  the advantage of the shallow reference population decreased and accuracies and levels of response became similar to those obtained with a deep reference population. In these later generations  the markers lost their ability to explain family structure  which appeared to benefit the shallow reference structure more. In later generations the deep reference structure probably benefited from having less focus on capturing family structure and better use of LD information but it was concluded that the impact of reference population structure on long-term response was small. Only in a few scenarios did we see the expected pattern where cumulative genetic gain from a deep reference structure overtakes the accumulated gain from the shallow reference structure. Early gains made by the shallow reference structure are difficult to overcome by the greater gains made in later generations with the deep reference structure. One reason may be that accuracy  and also genetic variance  declined over time  which made early gains even more important. In contrast to the small impact of reference population structure found in our results  Muir [] showed a large impact of reference population structure on accuracy of MEBV after one to eight generations of random selection. The result of Muir [] was obtained in a simulated population in two-locus Hardy Weinberg equilibrium  which meant absence of LD between markers and between markers and QTL. A deep reference population  named TG4  made up of generations 1 to 4  was compared to a shallow reference population  named TG2  made up of generations 1 and 2. TG2 resulted in an accuracy that was about 15% lower compared to TG4 in the sixth generation after training. We expect that in these results  the more persistent accuracy from the deep reference population was due to the fact that TG4 had two more generations to build up LD after starting the population in linkage equilibrium. In addition  the effect of building up more LD in the TG4 compared to the TG2 scenarios was strenghtened by the smaller effective population size in TG4 (= 64) compared to TG2 (= 128). In our simulations  we kept equal and the same level of historic LD was present in the deep and shallow reference population structures. In this study  we used information from a reference population with ten generations of selection to evaluate the long-term impact of reference population structure and the persistency of methods. Many other choices for genotyping and phenotyping strategies could have been made and selecting on the same marker effects for ten generations is not a practical application  given the low accuracies that were obtained after ten generations under all genetic architectures. One exception might be the low-unequal architecture  where genomic selection resulted in a reduction of up to 71% of genetic variance and re-training the model would not have much value. In all other scenario's  retraining the models after a number of generations is expected to considerably improve response in later generations  as was shown by Sonesson and Meuwissen []. Selection without retraining can still be of practical value. Traits that are difficult or expensive to measure can warrant the use of the same reference population for several generations. To address our main questions  the impact of estimation methods and reference population structure on long-term selection  we chose to simulate genomic selection scenarios without retraining. Retraining  or adding more generations with phenotypes would have obscured the assessment of the persistency of methods (i.e. the ability of a method to assign genetic variance to markers in close LD with the QTL) and would have reduced the contrast between the deep and shallow reference population by making both populations \"deeper\" each generation. It should be realized that without retraining  our results do not show the maximum potential of genetic progress from genomic selection but that was not the aim of this study. Accumulation of inbreeding was calculated based on pedigree relationships. The pedigree measure of inbreeding is supposed to capture genome-wide increase in homozygosity but this may not be the most relevant measure if genetic variance is due to a few QTL  and selection changes allele frequencies at these specific genome positions. In this case  average homozygosity may increase only a little although the favorable QTL are (nearly) fixed. In this situation a direct measure of genetic variance may be more valuable to describe the opportunities that remain for response to selection. For traits that are not under selection  pedigree-estimated inbreeding will still be a reasonable measure  assuming that loci that affect fitness are located away from the QTL with allele frequencies rapidly changed by genomic selection. A number of studies have described the accuracy of MEBV for individuals that are up to six [    ]  nine [  ]  ten []  or 19 [] generations away from the reference population. Of these studies  only Muir []  Sonesson and Meuwissen [] and Jannink [] applied selection based on the MEBV  while random selection was applied in the other studies. In the study of Muir []  accuracy of MEBV decreased quickly when the number of generations between the reference and the evaluation population increased  because of the very small number of QTL that were simulated  comparable to our low-unequal genetic architecture. Therefore the resulting decrease in accuracy of the MEBV was largely due to the reduction in genetic variance. Any change in LD patterns may have played a minor role. In actual breeding programs  the reduction of genetic variance has been relatively small [] and therefore changes in LD  due to drift and selection  are expected to play a much bigger role in reducing accuracy of MEBV in breeding programs that apply GS. The study by Sonesson and Meuwissen [] showed a pattern of the decrease in accuracy and genetic response from their FIRST-GEN scenario  which is comparable to our results in the low-unequal scenario with BM. Their FIRST-GEN scenario was similar to our approach because it did not retrain the model. Their simulated genetic architecture was similar to our low-unequal architecture because QTL effects were sampled from a G(0.4 1.66) distribution which has a high density at low values. The study by Jannink [] applied genomic selection to an inbred crop  and investigated the use of genomic breeding values prior to phenotyping. An increase in early selection gains was shown  especially when additional weight was placed on favorable alleles with low frequencies. The loss of favorable alleles was not evaluated in our study. In future research  we will extend the comparison of estimation methods and reference population structures for their effect on genomic parameters such as LD and allele frequencies of QTL. The differences seen in reductions of genetic variance for the different estimation methods indicate that these genomic parameters of LD and allele frequencies of QTL may be affected differently by different methods. Under selection  applying GBLUP leads to lower inbreeding and a smaller reduction of genetic variance especially in comparison to PLSR but also to BM  while a similar genetic improvement is achieved with these estimation methods for traits that have a moderate to large number of QTL. With a small number of large QTL  BM and PLSR were expected to result in greater response over ten generations of selection but differences were small and most progress was made by one of the scenarios that applied GBLUP. Without selection and with a small number of large QTL  accuracies of MEBV from BM remained high for 10 generations past the reference population and were always higher than accuracies from the other methods. When selection on MEBV was applied however  no important differences were seen among the methods. Response to selection on MEBV for traits with a small number of large QTL  a common simulation scenario in recent literature  was limited in the long-term by a rapid reduction of accuracy over time  which was caused by a strong reduction in genetic variance. When the trait was affected by more QTL  reduction of genetic variance was limited and the decline in accuracy was smaller. The structure of the reference population had a limited effect on long-term accuracy and genetic gain. Based on these results  use of a reference population made up of individuals that are most closely related to the selection candidates is recommended. This approach gave early benefits but in later generations  without updating marker effects  the estimation of marker effects based on less related reference individuals did not pay off.

These estimates of heritability and the genetic correlations can be used in the development of an index to improve feed efficiency and reduce the cost of production. Feed represents two thirds of the total costs of poultry production and feed requirements are an important consideration in the turkey industry. Furthermore  as genetic progress is made in body weight traits  feed consumption could be expected to increase since larger birds require more feed. Consequently  improving feed efficiency by identifying animals that require the same amount of feed as their contemporaries but have higher body weight or weight gain is valuable in the animal production industry. This is feasible in a breeding program  and genetic selection combined with management  has improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the turkey by approximately 20% between 1966 and 2003 []. Feed efficiency is often assessed as either FCR or residual feed intake (RFI) []. The ratio of feed intake to weight gain  or FCR  provides an indication of a bird's ability to convert feed to body weight  however selection based on a ratio is not ideal []. The RFI trait attempts to isolate a measure of biological efficiency independent of production  which can include weight gain or carcass yield  and is estimated as the difference between actual feed intake and a predicted feed intake based on body weight and production []. The RFI and FCR traits have moderate heritability values in broilers [  ]; however published parameters for feed efficiency traits including RFI in the turkey have not been reported. Reliable genetic parameters are essential for selection index design and to determine the correlated response to selection that will occur in other traits in a selection index. As a result  accurate estimates of genetic parameters enable turkey breeders to determine the impact that selection for feed efficiency will have on a breeding program. The objective of the present study was to determine the heritability of RFI and FCR  as well as their component traits in the turkey and to determine genetic correlations between the traits. Data collected on toms from a primary breeder turkey sire line (n = 16 412) over a 10-year period were used and breeding objectives emphasized commercial performance traits including growth  feed efficiency  and meat yield. Pedigree information extended back a minimum of five generations and included 28 464 relatives of the birds with records. Rearing until 14 weeks of age was under a standard commercial production environment and feeding regime  which involved group housing and a feeding program using shared feeders distributed on the basis of bird density. At 14 weeks of age  toms were placed in individual cages (0.60 m wide  0.85 m long  0.82 m high) to acclimatize and the turkeys remained in the same cages throughout the feeding trial. The feeding trial was conducted from approximately 15 to 19 weeks of age  since this corresponds to the rapid growth phase and is the standard time period used to assess feed efficiency in the commercial breeding program. Body weight was measured at the start of the trial (15 weeks of age) and at the end of the trial (19 weeks of age) and feed intake was recorded. During this period toms were fed a standard commercial diet [] and had  access to feed and water from individual feeders and shared drinkers within each cage. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated as: and metabolic mid-weight (MMW) was calculated as: Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated as feed intake divided by weight gain. Means and standard deviations for the traits measured are shown in Table . Expected feed intake was calculated using two different regressions (M1 and M2) as: where  represents feed intake  µ is the intercept     and  represent the regression coefficients on metabolic mid-weight  weight gain (WG)  and body weight (BW) at the start of the trial  respectively. A fixed contemporary group effect () adjusted for the common environment effect that influenced a group of birds hatched on the same date and managed in the same contemporary group. The residual effect was represented by . The R-squared value of M2 was higher than that of M1 and consequently coefficients from M2 were used to calculate RFI as: Data exceeding three standard deviations from the mean were removed as outliers for each trait and the remaining 15 831 individuals with records for all traits were used for the genetic analysis. Heritabilities  phenotypic  and genetic correlations were estimated using ASReml []. The model for all traits was: where  represents RFI  FCR  FI  BW  or WG   was the same fixed contemporary group effect used in the M1 and M2 RFI models   represented the random additive genetic effect  and  was the residual random effect. The random effects were assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a (co)variance structure equal to: where  represents the additive genetic relationship matrix and  is an identity matrix. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were estimated pair-wise in bivariate models and the reported heritabilities were averages across the bivariate models. Means and standard deviations of the measured traits are shown in Table . The R-squared value of M2 (0.79) was higher than that of M1 (0.75) and as a result  body weight at the start of the trial explained a larger proportion of the variation in feed intake than metabolic mid-weight. For this reason  the regression coefficients from M2 were used to calculate RFI. The R-squared value indicates that RFI may account for up to 21% of the remaining variation in feed intake after adjusting for body weight  weight gain  and hatch. Heritabilities  phenotypic  and genetic correlations are shown in Table . All traits showed a moderate heritability (0.16-0.35). The phenotypic and genetic correlations between feed intake  body weight  and ADG were all positive and within the moderate to high range with genetic correlations ranging from 0.28-0.67. There were also high positive phenotype and genetic correlations between RFI and FCR. The genetic correlation between feed intake and RFI (0.62) was positive but the correlation between feed intake and FCR was approximately zero. The ADG trait was negatively correlated to FCR (-0.67) but was not genetically correlated to RFI (-0.04 ± 0.07). The BW trait was not phenotypically correlated to RFI  as was expected  but there was a weak positive genetic correlation. The phenotypic (0.10) and genetic (0.12) correlations between BW and FCR were low and positive. The feed efficiency traits (FCR and RFI) that were analysed could both be considered for a selection index and the magnitude of heritability indicated that selection could effectively improve each trait. The estimated heritability of BW agrees with previous estimates in the turkey [] and the heritabilities of RFI and feed intake agree with reported moderate estimates in broiler chickens [  ]. The heritability of FCR was intermediate between results in these studies (0.12 - 0.16) and lower than values from a recent study on broilers  which ranged from 0.41 - 0.49 []. Genetically  the FCR trait was negatively correlated to ADG (-0.67) and this relationship between FCR and weight gain also exists in the chicken and beef cattle with genetic correlations of -0.50 and -0.52  respectively [  ]. These correlations are expected because of the relationship between feed conversion ratio and its component trait of ADG. The RFI trait was adjusted for body weight  and  as expected  the phenotypic and genetic correlations between RFI and body weight were low. Near-zero correlations between RFI and body weight at the start of a trial have also been estimated in meat-type chickens []. To account for the effect of body weight on maintenance energy requirements  RFI can be calculated by adjusting for either BW  as in the present study  or MMW. In a study on broilers  RFI was calculated using a regression on MMW in place of body weight and positive genetic correlations (0.29 - 0.49) between MMW and RFI were estimated []. Meat-type poultry have a very high and non-linear growth rate  and these results in broilers indicate that the mid-trial MMW measurement  which inherently includes the effect of growth throughout the trial  may confound the independence of RFI from this body weight trait. Consequently  body weight at the start of a trial may be a more beneficial trait to use  relative to MMW mid-trial  in the calculation of RFI in poultry to remove the genetic correlation between feed efficiency and body weight. The use of BW in the calculation of RFI would allow the analysis of the metabolic  nutritional  and physiological factors that contribute to RFI independently of the nutritional needs required to maintain body weight and to gain weight. As the investigation of feed efficiency in the turkey expands in the literature  trait parameters could also be reported for female birds. Evidence in broilers has shown that the relationship between efficiency and production traits change over the growing period []  and as a result FCR and RFI should be evaluated at an earlier age in hens to evaluate both male and female turkeys during the rapid growth phase. RFI showed a high genetic correlation to the feed conversion trait  which was expected based on results from other species [  ]. The positive genetic correlation estimated between feed intake and RFI was favorable since increased efficiency was associated with a decrease in feed intake. Alternatively  the genetic correlation between feed intake and FCR was near zero indicating that improvement of one trait may not impact the other. This correlation was unexpected based on the inherent relationship between the traits and positive correlations in beef and swine  however a near-zero correlation has also been estimated in a study on broilers [    ]. Studies in broilers have also shown that selection for FCR has a negligible impact on feed intake and a zero genetic correlation was estimated between feed intake and FCR in lines selected for feed efficiency []. Consequently  results suggest that RFI may be more favorably correlated to feed intake and more independent of performance traits than FCR. Ideally  feed efficiency measures would be independent of production and this was shown for RFI. This indicates that the genetic regression between ADG and RFI was equal to the phenotypic regression  to produce a genetic independence between the traits []  and selection for RFI would likely not have an impact on ADG. Additionally  the correlations between feed efficiency traits and traits associated with body composition such as breast meat yield were not considered here. These relationships should be considered prior to implementation into a breeding program as important genetic relationships with body conformation traits  like back fat  muscle area  and meat yield have been observed in other species [  ]. Previous research demonstrated that a linear selection index can be more efficient than selection on a ratio trait like FCR [  ]. A direct measure of feed efficiency can be omitted from an index  without decreasing the accuracy  if it is developed with appropriate weights on the component traits (feed intake  body weight  and growth) []. However  RFI may be advantageous because it can be considered independently  unlike feed intake  which is difficult to interpret as a standalone trait independent of growth rate and body weight. As a result  genetic improvement for efficiency can be accomplished by including a feed efficiency trait in a selection index or through its component traits  with the appropriate parameters as presented here. These results provide the required genetic parameters of feed efficiency in the turkey for consideration in the development of a breeding program. The heritabilities and genetic correlations can be used to calculate selection index weights. The moderate heritability of feed efficiency traits and the genetic correlations to feed intake  weight gain  and body weight indicate that selection can improve feed efficiency. The direct measures of FCR and RFI can be best utilized to study the traits that impact overall efficiency. A breeding program can then use this information to incorporate the efficiency constituent traits into an index to achieve genetic progress. This will  ultimately  reduce the relative cost of production and improve profitability for the turkey industry.

Decorrelated selection indices should not be used because of misleading results and the availability of accurate and fast algorithms for exact multidimensional integration. Genomic selection is the method of choice when maximising the genetic gain per year but genotyping females may not allow for a reduction in overall breeding costs. Furthermore  the economic justification of genotyping females remains questionable. Genomic selection (GS) offers breeders the opportunity to reduce costs  decrease the generation interval [] and possibly avoid inbreeding []. GS is based on the prediction of breeding values from individual genotypes (estimated genomic breeding values  GEBV). These genotypes consist of a large number of DNA markers in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)  which are in linkage disequilibrium with quantitative trait loci coding for economically important traits. In dairy cattle  accuracies (r) of GEBV(r) for milk production traits can be as high as 0.75 []  but are below those from progeny testing. However  the tremendously decreased generation interval (L) may lead to a much higher genetic gain per year (<U+0394> G) [  ]. Schaeffer [] summarised the potential effects of GS on dairy cattle breeding schemes assuming an r of 0.75 and a cost for GS per genotyped individual (C) of 500 Canadian Dollars in a one-stage selection approach. As r and C may change  research work concerning optimum breeding schemes for different combinations of these parameters and possible multistage selection approaches are of interest. The availability of a variety of SNP chips at different prices and yielding breeding values of different accuracies makes it possible to use specific SNP chips in each selection path or more than one chip in a multistage preselection approach. Additionally  the advantage of GS might also be combined with traditional progeny performance testing (PPT) schemes as currently applied in certain dairy cattle breeding programs []. Thus  apart from the already answered questions concerning the applicability of GS  the answer to the question of how a breeding scheme should be structured has become more complex. This complexity results from the possibility of combining different information sources according to their costs and correlations with the aggregate genotype  allowing for a variety of one-  two- or multistage breeding schemes in each selection path to choose from. It is a question of economic optimisation to select the breeding scheme which maximises a defined utility function. In multistage breeding schemes  the information about the selection candidates collected at all previous stages is combined with the information collected at the current stage. Therefore  the estimated breeding values (EBV) of successive stages are correlated and the EBV of selected individuals after the first selection stage are non-normally distributed. One of the major challenges of research on optimising multistage breeding schemes is the necessity of using computationally sophisticated multiple integration techniques to derive the selection intensities. When Ducrocq and Colleau [] applied such methods on multistage dairy cattle breeding schemes they were faced with the problem that the convergence of such algorithms can be difficult to achieve if the EBV of successive stages are highly correlated. Furthermore  the computational time was seen as unacceptable if the number of selection stages became too high []. A possible solution to circumvent these problems is the decorrelation of the EBV of successive stages  as proposed by Xu and Muir [  ]. Then  a normal distribution can be assumed for EBV at each stage  making it easy to calculate selection intensities. Xu and Muir [] estimated the loss in the predicted genetic gain due to the decorrelation in a two-stage breeding scheme to be up to 10% compared to the exact calculation solving the integral. This loss was justified by the possibility of implementing an unlimited number of stages  which was otherwise not applicable. Decorrelated indices have been used for model calculations of breeding schemes for poultry [  ]  beef cattle [] and marker-assisted selection []. In all these applications accuracies of breeding values  selection intensities and generation intervals across selection paths were assumed identical. Thus  the applicability of decorrelated indices for complex breeding schemes has not been investigated in detail regarding a) different selection paths  b) their interaction due to the effects of the selection strategy in one path on the accuracy of EBV of the other paths  c) different selection intensities and EBV accuracies in each path  d) the interaction between the generation interval and the number and intensities of successive selection stages and  finally  e) the opportunity to split financial investments between selection paths. Numerical integration techniques developed more recently by Genz []  in conjunction with the maximisation algorithm of Brent []  allow for a fast and stable calculation of the exact selection intensities  even when using many stages. The aim of our work was to compare the results of breeding scheme optimisations when the approach of Xu and Muir [] (decorrelated indices) or numerical integration (optimum indices) was used to derive selection intensities  breeding value accuracies  and <U+0394> G. Both methods were applied to a complex dairy cattle breeding scheme as mentioned above. The possibility of using GS as an optional selection stage in a way that it can be used in addition to or instead of PPT was allowed for. Optimisation was over a semi-continuous parameter range of rand Cand financial resources were restricted. Therefore  the results provide insights into the sensitivity of dairy cattle breeding plans to variation in these parameters. Deterministic methods were used to optimise breeding plans. Accuracies of EBV (r) were calculated based on the selection index theory and coefficients for regressing the aggregated genotype of the selection candidate on phenotypic measurements of informants were derived using two different methods. The GEBV was included in the selection index as a trait with a heritability of one and a genetic correlation determined by its accuracy [  ]. For the optimum selection indices (OSI)  standard selection index methodology was used at each selection stage  = 1 ..  of each selection path  = 1 ..  . For decorrelated selection indices (DSI) the regression coefficients were constructed according to Xu and Muir []: where  is the vector of economic weights of the traits in the aggregated genotype  is the vector of regression coefficients on all available information sources  is the genetic-phenotypic covariance matrix  is the phenotypic covariance matrix of all information sources up to stage   is the phenotypic covariance matrix of all information sources up to stage  -- 1 and is a matrix of regression coefficients for all stages previous to . Note that second and third equations are used as constraints when solving the first equation  and are incorporated into it via Lagrange multipliers. The first constraint guarantees that the covariance between EBV of stage  and EBV of all other stages is equal to zero and the second that a solution exists. The pedigree and associated phenotypic and genomic information for candidates and relatives available to construct case specific selection indices are given in Figure . . The genetic gain of each path (<U+0394> G) was calculated differently depending on whether DSI or OSI was used. When using OSI  the following formula was applied: where is the expectation of the aggregated genotype (selection intensity) of the selected individuals after selecting at stage  (the last stage in path ) and is the standard deviation of the aggregated genotype. Selection intensities were derived using the moment generating function of a truncated multivariate normal distribution including all used selection stages and the aggregated genotype []  where the truncation points were calculated following the approach of Mi and Utz []  merging the integration algorithm of Genz [] and the maximisation techniques of Brent []. Using the decorrelated index approach of Xu and Muir []  <U+0394> G was calculated avoiding multiple integration according to where is the selection intensity and is the standard deviation of the decorrelated EBV. Due to the zero covariance between EBV of successive stages  could be calculated by one-dimensional integration. <U+0394> G for the whole breeding scheme was calculated according to Rendel and Robertson []: where is the generation interval in path  A cooperative Holstein dairy cattle breeding program with a cow population of 100 000 was used. Bull dams were selected as heifers from all available heifers and were assumed to be used as bull dams only once. Male selection candidates were produced by contract mating to bull dams. For the purpose of comparing methods  only one milk trait with a heritability of 0.25 was set in the breeding goal. Selection took place on EBV combining performance data and GEBV. The biological  technical and economical parameters of the program are given in Table . All parameters of the breeding program that are expressible in terms of probabilities and not given in Table   such as success of first insemination  survival rate of calves  etc.  were assumed to be zero or one. The selection paths were \"sire to sire\"(SS)  \"sire to dam\"(SD)  \"dam to sire\"(DS) and \"dam to dam\" (DD). Since in practise  almost no selection takes place within the path DD  a selection intensity of zero was assumed for this path. Each selection path was structured in stages. The selection stages available in paths SS and SD were a) selection on performance data and GEBV of ancestors and half-sibs (PED stage)  b) selection on the candidate's GEBV (GS stage) and c) selection on progeny performance data (PPT stage). The selection stages available in path DS were a) selection on performance data and GEBV of ancestors and half-sibs (PED stage)  and b) selection on the candidate's GEBV (GS stage). To genotype and select male calves  a tissue sample was taken by a veterinarian on farm at birth and had to be paid for by the farmer. DNA-isolation and SNP-genotyping was carried out by a central laboratory  and was added to the expenses of the breeding organisation. Selection candidates were kept on farm until the age of six months. Farmers keeping male candidates selected at the PED stage and slaughtered after GS received a compensation payment from the breeding organisation. When genotyping female calves as potential bull dams  costs were similar  but since the bull dams were not bought by the breeding organisation  no compensation was paid. Costs not related to selection strategies (e.g. performance recording of females  calculating EBV  marketing  semen processing) were not considered. To allow for changes in costs for labour and infrastructure due to different breeding schemes  all expenses were derived from some invariant basic cost given in Table  via the cost function of NamKoong []: where is the total cost of expense factor  in path is the cost of expense factor  per individual  is the number of initial selection candidates  is the proportion of the available individuals that is selected at stage  and  is the stage within path  at which the selection stops concerning can be costs for genotyping  purchasing  keeping the animals until maturity  keeping them from maturity until their breeding value is estimated from PPT  compensations for test bull insemination  or compensations for keeping the animals during genotyping stages. Note that in the case of compensation for keeping the animals during genotyping  the cost formula changes to The breeding costs of path  were the sum over all expense factors in the path  and the total cost for a certain breeding program was the sum over all paths. The maximum breeding cost of 719 050  was imposed as a constraint during maximisation and was derived assuming progeny performance testing of 50 young bulls per year: This cost included the purchase of 50 male calves from contract matings  their maintenance until maturity and from maturity until breeding value estimation from PPT  and compensation payments for test bull insemination. Various values for Cand rwere used during the calculation process  r varied between 0.3 and 0.9 in steps of 0.025 and C between 20  and 400  in steps of 10   resulting in 975 combinations of rand C. Breeding schemes maximising <U+0394> G for each combination of Cand rwere obtained using a grid search in which the proportion of selected individuals varied at each selection stage in every path. Within the maximisation process  trait measurements available for ancestors  and  therefore the accuracy of the candidates' EBV were adjusted according to the selection strategy in the path from which the ancestor had been derived. Furthermore  to select bull sires from cow sires  the possibility of additional selection stages was allowed for  which requires additional information (e.g. PPT stage) instead of just increased selection intensity for the same group of males. For each path  the initial number of selection candidates and the final number of selected individuals for reproduction were fixed. The product of the selected proportions at each stage  within path  () had to fulfil the equation: where is the number of selected individuals actually used for reproduction and is the number of selection stages in path  The proportion  varied between 0.01 and 1 in steps of 0.025. Stages with = 1 were treated as not used. For the stages used (< 1)  the constraint of equation  was fulfilled by calculating of the last used stage as a dependent variable. Only if this value was = 1  was the stage combination considered as valid. The valid stage combinations of all paths were completely cross-classified to obtain all possible breeding schemes. Breeding costs were derived for each of these schemes but <U+0394> G was only calculated if the cost constraint was fulfilled. The breeding scheme with the highest <U+0394> G was seen as the optimum for the given combination of Cand r. For each combination of rand C  a grid of about 60 000 breeding schemes was searched for optimisation. The total amount of evaluated breeding plans was 58 million for each calculation method  OSI and DSL All calculations were carried out with a FORTRAN 90 program written by the first author. The calculation of the selection intensity of an optimum index in a multistage breeding program used the FORTRAN routines of Genz [] and Brent []. Parameters and results of the breeding schemes that maximise <U+0394> G and fulfill the cost constraint were compared between OSI and DSL Table  summarises the frequency of certain selection strategies of optimum breeding schemes in paths SS  SD and DS as a function of  and the application of either OSI or DSL For selection in path SD with rQEBV ranging from 0.3 to 0.4  both methods found that combined selection at PED and GS stage or a three-stage selection approach maximised <U+0394> G. The same holds for path SS for an rQEBV range between 0.3 and 0.45. Beside these similarities  applying DSI also led to strategies for male selection that did not include GS  which was never the case when using OSI. Furthermore  a three-stage selection approach in paths SS and SD was found to maximise <U+0394> G much more frequently when using OSI. The differences between the proposed selection strategies in path SD are even more obvious within rranging between 0.45 and 0.9  including 741 possible parameter combinations. When using OSI  in all these cases the breeding schemes that maximised <U+0394> G used two-stage selection of sires  whereas when using DSI in 680 cases one-stage selection of sires was found to be optimum. Similar results were obtained for path DS  where two-stage selection was the most frequent strategy that maximised <U+0394> G when using OSI compared to DSI. Except for one-stage selection procedures  DSI always suggested breeding schemes yielding less <U+0394> G than OSI  with a maximum reduction of 5.5% and a mean of 2% (see Figure ). If all optimization results obtained by applying DSI were recalculated using OSI  which means using the selection intensities obtained from DSI and using these with OSI  the loss in the predicted <U+0394> G due to DSI was up to 5.5%  and up to 7% for the predicted <U+0394> G(results not shown). For the reverse recalculation  i.e. using selection intensities of optimum breeding schemes obtained from OSI in DSI  the loss in the predicted <U+0394> G increased up to 29%  and the loss in the predicted <U+0394> Gup to 40% (results not shown). . Figure 2(a) shows the genetic gain per year from applying DSI as a proportion of the one from applying OSI. Figure 2(b) shows the genetic gain per generation of different selection paths of breeding schemes that maximise the genetic gain per year given an accuracy and cost of estimated genomic breeding values of 0.75 and of 150   respectively  when the proportion of genotyped males is varied along the x-axis and all other parameters were chosen such that the genetic gain per year was maximised; paths \"sire-sire\" (<U+0394>) \"sire-dam\" (<U+25A1>) and \"dam-sire\" (+) calculated with optimum indices  and of the paths \"sire-sire\" ()  \"sire-dam\" () and \"dam-sire\" (x) calculated with decorrelated indices A key to understand the different results when using DSI or OSI is given in Figure  and Table . Decorrelating EBV of subsequent selection stages is equal to decomposing e.g. the variance at stage 2    into  (the  is the variance at the previous stage and  is the respective covariance) and reducing the variance of the information source at stage 2 to . Thus  an increase in the covariance between stages leads to a further reduction of the variance of EBV in the last selection stage. This is exemplified in the last two rows of Table . Including a GS stage in path DS increased the accuracy of the PED stage EBV and the covariance between PED stage and GS stage in path SD  but led to a reduction of the accuracy of the GS stage EBV in this path to a value below that of the PED stage EBV. The effect of this interaction on <U+0394> G is given in Figure   which reflects <U+0394> G  <U+0394> Gand <U+0394> Gof breeding schemes that maximized <U+0394> G as a function of DSI  OSI and the proportion of genotyped initial male selection candidates  given an rQEBV of 0.75 and  of 150 . All other parameters  e.g. the number of genotyped females were chosen such that <U+0394> G was maximised. If  was set to zero  a breeding scheme selecting males at PED and PPT stages and females only at the PED stage was found to maximise <U+0394> G (GS of females was not possible due to cost limitations). In this case  <U+0394> Gof both methods were equal because of the one-stage selection approach. The difference in <U+0394> Gand <U+0394> Gwas small because of the high selection intensity at the PED stage and a DSI induced reduction of the accuracy of the PPT stage EBV from 0.993 to 0.814. If genotyping was allowed  as indicated by PG> zero  breeding schemes that maximised <U+0394> G excluded the PPT stage in paths SD and SS in favour of inclusion of a GS stage in all paths. GS of females had to be abandoned due to cost constraints if PGexceeded 0.375. The DSI induced reduction of the accuracy of GS stage EBV below that of PED stage EBV led to a strong peak of <U+0394> Gand <U+0394> Gat an already low PGvalue. Furthermore  abandoning pre-selection at the PED stage (PGequal to one) led to a sharp increase in <U+0394> G and <U+0394> Gbecause one-stage selection made decorrelation unnecessary. The counter-intuitive interaction between paths due to DSI became even more obvious if GS of females was abandoned  which slightly decreased <U+0394> Gand <U+0394> Gwhen OSI was applied but increased these genetic gains when DSI was applied. This resulted from an inversion of the process well described in the last two rows of Table . Thus  the reason behind the given interaction is the characteristic of DSI to exploit only the residual variance. This can reduce the accuracy of EBV of a certain stage below those of the preceding stages  which leads to a loss of <U+0394> G if two- or multi-stage selection is applied. Additionally  more accurate EBV in one path can have negative side effects on EBV accuracies and <U+0394> G in other paths. Such results are impossible when using OSI. Results when using OSI are given in Figure . <U+0394> G increased with increasing rbut was almost independent of C. The highest <U+0394> G of 236.94 kg or 0.67 genetic standard deviations was achieved at a parameter combination of r= 0.9 and C= 20   whereas the lowest <U+0394> G of 113.09 or 0.32 genetic standard deviations was achieved at a parameter combination of r= 0.3 and Cbetween 380 and 400 . . 3(a) Proportion of genotyped initial selection candidates in the sire-dam path 3(b) Proportion of progeny tested initial selection candidates in the sire-dam path 3(c) Proportion of genotyped initial selection candidates in the dam-sire path 3(d) Genetic gain per year 3(e) Total breeding cost as proportion of the maximum cost 3(f) Breeding cost of the dam-sire path as proportion of total breeding cost The relative contribution of the different selection paths to the total genetic gain of breeding schemes was between 0.46 and 0.34 for path SS  between 0.36 and 0.29 for path SD  and between 0.35 and 0.19 for path DS. Only in 21 of 975 parameter combinations did the relative contribution of path DS exceed that of path SS  but by no more than 0.01. The relative contribution of path SD was exceeded by that of path DS in 202 of 975 cases; wherein the maximum excess was 0.04. Thus  in the vast majority of parameter combinations  the main contribution to genetic gain came from path SS (results not shown). The total cost of breeding schemes that maximised <U+0394> G ranged from 544 685 to 718 973  but only in 218 of the 975 parameter combinations was it below 700 000 . Breeding costs incurred by genotyping females ranged from zero (no genotyping) to > 90% of the total breeding costs but was greater than 50% in 802 of the 975 parameter combinations. As given in Figure (f)  a prerequisite for such a high proportion of total cost from genotyping females was an r> 0.4. Below this value  the marginal benefit of a reduced selection intensity at the PED stage and an increased selection intensity at the GS stage in path DS was not found to maximise <U+0394> G. The highest proportion of genotyped bull dams i.e. 0.6  which equals 30 000 heifers  was found when genotyping costs were the lowest and rwas = 0.45. This proportion decreased with increasing C  but GS was applied to select females in almost all parameter combinations except when Cexceeded 120  in conjunction with an rrange between 0.3 and 0.4. As PGwas always below one  selection in paths SS and SD included a PED and a GS stage if rranged between 0.45 and 0.9 and between 0.4 and 0.9 for bull sires and cow sires  respectively. Below an rof 0.4(SD) and 0.45(SS) three-stage selection strategies with a PPT stage were also found to maximise <U+0394> G. Furthermore  for rbetween 0.425 and 0.45  bull sires were selected from cow sires on the basis of an additional PPT stage. Nevertheless  a pure two-stage selection strategy with only a PED and a PPT stage was not found to maximise <U+0394> G across all 975 parameter combinations. The results of this study quantify the respective loss in predicted <U+0394> G from using DSI instead of OSI to be up to 5.5% and in <U+0394> G per generation to be up to 6%. This is within the range given by Xu and Muir []. Nevertheless  DSI changes the functional dependencies of selection intensity and <U+0394> G as well as <U+0394> G. Although the modelled breeding scheme was less complex  tracing the interaction among selection stages and paths was quite difficult. This might become impossible if DSI is applied to more complex breeding schemes with numerous selection stages in a variety of paths with different selection intensities and generation intervals. Thus  DSI has its mathematical intrinsic logic  but for breeders its results are difficult to interpret  counter-intuitive or suboptimal. The genetic variance is known to be reduced by the \"Buhner\" effect  selection-induced gametic disequilibrium []  leading to an overestimation of asymptotic rates of genetic response [–] if this effect is not accounted for as was the case in our study. The ranking and relative differences between alternative breeding programs have  however  been found to be little affected by ignoring this effect [  ]. Comparisons between OSI and DSI-types of selection indices are not affected  because ignoring the Bulmer effect is equivalent to a comparison in terms of one-generation responses. One of the advantages of decorrelated indices mentioned by Xu and Muir [] is the ability to use maximisation methods that use first and second derivatives of the goal function. However  this option is limited to breeding schemes with equal generation intervals because otherwise the goal function might change in a non-continuous manner with the number of selection stages. Furthermore  the cost function of NamKoong [] is not continuous if the selection intensities of certain selection stages converge to zero in the maximisation process. Thus  grid searches or heuristic approaches are still the methods of choice when goal functions are difficult or impossible to differentiate or non-continuous. As limitations due to central processing unit time have almost been overcome because of developments in efficient hardware and fast algorithms []  the exact calculation of optimum indices in combination with the above mentioned methods is the better alternative. In this study  we found for a given  of 0.75  a <U+0394> G between 0.53 and 0.57 genetic standard deviation  which is higher than found in other published results [  ]. This may result from differences in the underlying selection intensities in paths SS and SD  which were higher in our calculations. As already mentioned  the effect of selection on genetic variance in later generations (\"Bulmer\" effect) was not accounted for. However  the results are still comparable to other studies that did not consider this effect either [  ]. Furthermore  since ranking the breeding schemes might not be affected  the main conclusion remains the same. Ignoring reduction in variances in later stages also affects optimal breeding schemes in terms of the proportion selected in each stage and whether or not a given stage is utilised. So including this effect is important  which our methods do. The strong fluctuation of PGamong programs that maximise genetic gain (see Figure ) can be explained by the non-linearity of <U+0394> G as a function of selection intensity (see the OSI curves in Figure ). In optimum breeding schemes  PGwas mostly at its upper limit  where the marginal benefit or loss in <U+0394> G from a small increase or decrease of selection intensity was very small. On the contrary  due to the imposed cost constraint  the proportion of genotyped females was small  leading to a high sensitivity of <U+0394> Gto any change in selection intensity. In the case of increasing Cthree scenarios were possible. A: Cost was increased as long as the number of genotyped females could be maintained by reducing PGwith negligible effect on <U+0394> G. B: Cost was increased until a reduction of PGlet to a loss in <U+0394> Gbeing higher than a loss in <U+0394> Gdue to reduced genotyping of females. C: Cost was increased till even not genotyping males could not save enough money to maintain the number of genotyped females. In the latter two scenarios the number of genotyped females had to be decreased and the available funds could be reinvested to increase PGup to the maximum achievable <U+0394> G. Schaeffer [] found that path DS became the main source of genetic gain but he assumed that for each possible bull dam a highly accurate GEBV was estimated. However  when calculating the breeding costs for such a GS scheme  genotyping costs for only 2000 bull dams were regarded. In our breeding programs genotyping large proportions of the population of potential bull dams was not possible due to cost limitations. Thus  paths SS and SD were generally the main sources of <U+0394> G. Furthermore  genotyping bull dams was the major source of breeding costs  leading to values higher than 90% of the maximum possible breeding costs in the majority of parameter combinations. This exemplifies a trade-off between decreased overall breeding costs and the importance of path DS for <U+0394> G. Since implementing GS allows to gather information on selection candidates relatively cheaply compared to PPT  the selection intensity can be increased because of a higher number of selection candidates. When doing so  breeding organisations should take into consideration that the additional <U+0394> G from an extended selection basis is approaching zero. Additionally  optimising breeding schemes should also include the cost of the invested capital and <U+0394> G per . Such parameters may not allow for the inclusion of GS in path SD  as given in our results and for the application of GS in general in path DS  and may also question the utility of genotyping even whole sub-populations  as proposed by König and Swalve []. Some breeding organisations rely on using GS as a preselection stage followed by PPT []. The continuation of progeny testing in combination with GS was found to be economic only at an  =0.4 in path SD and =0.45 in path SS. Since an rof 0.7 can be achieved in practical breeding programs []  there may be no alternative to replacing conventional progeny testing by GS in order to maximise the genetic gain per year. Applying decorrelated indices to multistage dairy cattle breeding schemes including genomic selection in an optimisation approach taking into consideration the strong interaction between selection paths led to results that were not only difficult to interpret but also counter-intuitive or suboptimal. This may result in improper advice to breeding organisations. Since fast and stable calculation of selection intensities in multistage breeding programs is possible even for highly correlated EBV of successive stages and small proportions of selected individuals  the optimum selection index is the method of choice for the deterministic optimisation of breeding schemes using the selection index methodology. Genomic selection might meet its promises concerning the increase in genetic gain per year  although the effects on breeding costs are still unclear. However  the relatively low financial efforts to obtain estimated genomic breeding values compared to progeny performance testing make it possible to optimise breeding schemes in a holistic across-path approach  which also includes the risk of losing money due to opportunity costs.
