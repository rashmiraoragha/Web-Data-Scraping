For the porcine inversion  probes specific for p arms and q arms were produced and hybridised simultaneously on metaphases of a heterozygote carrier. In the case of the bovine translocation  two whole chromosome probes (chromosome 5  and derived chromosome 5) were elaborated and hybridised independently on chromosomal preparations of the bull who was a carrier of the mosaic translocation. The impossibility of differentiating chromosomes 2 and der(2) from other chromosomes of the metaphases did not allow the production of painting probes for these chromosomes. For all experiments  the quality of painting was comparable to that usually observed with probes obtained from flow-sorted chromosomes. The results obtained allowed confirmation of the interpretations proposed with G-banding karyotype analyses. In the bovine case  however  the reciprocity of the translocation could not be proven. The results presented in this paper show the usefulness of the microdissection technique for characterising chromosomal rearrangements in species for which commercial probes are not available. They also confirmed that the main limiting factor of the technique is the quality of the chromosomal preparations  which does not allow the identification of target chromosomes or chromosome fragments in all cases."

Twenty-six microsatellite markers recommended by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and ISAG (International Society of Animal Genetics) were employed to analyze the genetic diversity of 18 Chinese indigenous pig breeds with 1001 individuals representing five types  and three commercial breeds with 184 individuals. The observed heterozygosity  unbiased expected heterozygosity and the observed and effective number of alleles were used to estimate the genetic variation of each indigenous breed. The unbiased expected heterozygosity ranged between 0.700 () and 0.876 ()  which implies that there is an abundant genetic variation stored in Chinese indigenous pig breeds. Breed differentiation was shown by fixation indices (    and ). The per locus varied from 0.019 () to 0.170 ()  and the average of all loci was 0.077  which means that most of the genetic variation was kept within breeds and only a little of the genetic variation exists between populations. The Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed based on the Nei (1978) distances and one large cluster with all local breeds but the  breed  was obtained. Four smaller sub-clusters were also found  which included two to four breeds each. These results  however  did not completely agree with the traditional type of classification. A Neighbor-Joining dendrogram of individuals was established from the distance of  ln(proportions of shared alleles); 92.14% of the individuals were clustered with their own breeds  which implies that this method is useful for breed demarcation.

Yet molecular information about this species remains scarce. We present here the first genetic linkage map of the Japanese quail. This comprehensive map is based solely on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. These markers were developed and genotyped in an F2 progeny from a cross between two lines of quail differing in stress reactivity. A total of 432 polymorphic AFLP markers were detected with 24  I/ RI primer combinations. On average  18 markers were produced per primer combination. Two hundred and fifty eight of the polymorphic markers were assigned to 39 autosomal linkage groups plus the ZW sex chromosome linkage groups. The linkage groups range from 2 to 28 markers and from 0.0 to 195.5 cM. The AFLP map covers a total length of 1516 cM  with an average genetic distance between two consecutive markers of 7.6 cM.

Yet molecular information about this species remains scarce. We present here the first genetic linkage map of the Japanese quail. This comprehensive map is based solely on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. These markers were developed and genotyped in an F2 progeny from a cross between two lines of quail differing in stress reactivity. A total of 432 polymorphic AFLP markers were detected with 24  I/ RI primer combinations. On average  18 markers were produced per primer combination. Two hundred and fifty eight of the polymorphic markers were assigned to 39 autosomal linkage groups plus the ZW sex chromosome linkage groups. The linkage groups range from 2 to 28 markers and from 0.0 to 195.5 cM. The AFLP map covers a total length of 1516 cM  with an average genetic distance between two consecutive markers of 7.6 cM. This AFLP map can be enriched with other marker types  especially mapped chicken genes that will enable to link the maps of both species and make use of the powerful comparative mapping approach. This AFLP map of the Japanese quail already provides an efficient tool for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Correspondence to                 .

The main objectives of this work were to (1) measure the extent and pattern of LD between a putative QTL and nearby markers in finite populations and (2) investigate the usefulness of LD in fine mapping QTL in simulated populations using a dense map of multiallelic or biallelic marker loci.

Although the power to test the association with a frequent QTL of large effect was satisfactory  the power was low for the QTL with a small effect and/or low frequency. More powerful  multi-locus methods may be required to map low frequent QTL with small genetic effects  as well as combining both linkage and linkage disequilibrium information.

"Bayesian inference on genetic merit under uncertain paternity"	"Authors: Fernando F Cardoso and Robert J Tempelman"	"Department of Animal Science  Michigan State University  East Lansing  MI  48824  USAFernando F Cardoso & Robert J Tempelman"	"No Co-Author"	"15 September 2003"	"A hierarchical animal model was developed for inference on genetic merit of livestock with uncertain paternity. Fully conditional posterior distributions for fixed and genetic effects  variance components  sire assignments and their probabilities are derived to facilitate a Bayesian inference strategy using MCMC methods. We compared this model to a model based on the Henderson average numerator relationship (ANRM) in a simulation study with 10 replicated datasets generated for each of two traits. Trait 1 had a medium heritability () for each of direct and maternal genetic effects whereas Trait 2 had a high  attributable only to direct effects.

A system approach was employed concerning the planning of the experiments. One element of the system approach is the choice of the breeds to be compared with . These breeds were supposed to represent major evolutionary branches of chickens. Four experiments on genetic relationships were conducted using different estimation criteria including morphological discrete characters  body measurements  biochemical markers  and the activity of serum esterase-1.

A system approach was employed concerning the planning of the experiments. One element of the system approach is the choice of the breeds to be compared with . These breeds were supposed to represent major evolutionary branches of chickens. Four experiments on genetic relationships were conducted using different estimation criteria including morphological discrete characters  body measurements  biochemical markers  and the activity of serum esterase-1. The greatest similarity was found between  and the egg-type breeds of Mediterranean roots and/or true Bantams.

This disease is caused by the actinomycete bacterium  associated with the tick . Currently there are no prospects for a vaccine  and acaricide or antibiotic control is hampered by the development of chemoresistance. Animal breeders have observed that dermatophilosis susceptibility seems to be determined genetically  and we previously identified a  class II haplotype marker for high (R = 0.96) susceptibility to the disease. With this marker  we developed a successful eugenic selection procedure for zebu Brahman cattle in Martinique (FWI). Over a period of five years  a marked reduction in disease prevalence  from 0.76 to 0.02 was achieved  and this low level has been maintained over the last two years. The selection procedure  based on a genetic marker system targeting the highly polymorphic  locus  eliminates only those individuals which are at the highest risk of contracting the disease.

This disease is caused by the actinomycete bacterium  associated with the tick . Currently there are no prospects for a vaccine  and acaricide or antibiotic control is hampered by the development of chemoresistance. Animal breeders have observed that dermatophilosis susceptibility seems to be determined genetically  and we previously identified a  class II haplotype marker for high (R = 0.96) susceptibility to the disease. With this marker  we developed a successful eugenic selection procedure for zebu Brahman cattle in Martinique (FWI). Over a period of five years  a marked reduction in disease prevalence  from 0.76 to 0.02 was achieved  and this low level has been maintained over the last two years. The selection procedure  based on a genetic marker system targeting the highly polymorphic  locus  eliminates only those individuals which are at the highest risk of contracting the disease. In the present work  we discuss the properties of this system  including the \"heterozygote advantage\" and the \"frequency dependence\" theories  and examine their involvement in the biological mechanisms at the host/pathogen interface. We speculate on the exact role of the MHC molecules in the control of the disease  how the natural selection pressure imposed by the pathogens selectively maintains MHC diversity  and how our results can be practically applied for integrated control of dermatophilosis in developing countries.

The  gene is often responsible for this disorder in men  mice and rats. Recent experimental data on  sheep reared in Sicily for milk production  support the genetic control of the ovine hypotrichosis as a Mendelian recessive trait. The ovine  gene was chosen as the candidate gene involved in this disorder. Blood samples were collected from  sheep with the normal and hypotrichotic phenotypes. Almost the entire  gene was successfully amplified using the long PCR technique. Unrelated sheep with differing phenotypes were randomly chosen for sequencing the amplified products. Different mutations related to the hypotrichotic phenotype were found in exon 3. In fact  sequencing revealed an A/T transversion at position 739  a G/A transition at position 823  and a C/T transition at position 1312.

The  gene is often responsible for this disorder in men  mice and rats. Recent experimental data on  sheep reared in Sicily for milk production  support the genetic control of the ovine hypotrichosis as a Mendelian recessive trait. The ovine  gene was chosen as the candidate gene involved in this disorder. Blood samples were collected from  sheep with the normal and hypotrichotic phenotypes. Almost the entire  gene was successfully amplified using the long PCR technique. Unrelated sheep with differing phenotypes were randomly chosen for sequencing the amplified products. Different mutations related to the hypotrichotic phenotype were found in exon 3. In fact  sequencing revealed an A/T transversion at position 739  a G/A transition at position 823  and a C/T transition at position 1312. From these nucleotide exchanges  three substitutions of the processed mature protein were deduced at the amino acid positions 247 (Thr/Ser)  275 (Ala/Thr)  and 438 (Gln/Stop).

Lamont"	"No Co-Author"	"15 June 2003"	"Several candidate genes were selected  based on their critical roles in the host's response to intracellular bacteria  to study the genetic control of the chicken response to  (SE). The candidate genes were: inducible nitric oxide synthase ()  tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand ()  transforming growth factor  ()  transforming growth factor  ()  and immunoglobulin G light chain (). Responses to pathogenic SE colonization or to SE vaccination were measured in the Iowa  response resource population (ISRRP). Outbred broiler sires and three diverse  highly inbred dam lines produced 508 F progeny  which were evaluated as young chicks for either bacterial load isolated from spleen or cecum contents after pathogenic SE inoculation  or the circulating antibody level after SE vaccination. Fragments of each gene were sequenced from the founder lines of the resource population to identify genomic sequence variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified  then PCR-RFLP techniques were developed to genotype the F resource population. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. Because the inbred dam lines always contributed one copy of the same allele  the heterozygous sire allele effects could be assessed in the F generation. Association analyses revealed significant effects of the sire allele of  I on the spleen ( < 0.07) and cecum ( < 0.0002) SE bacterial load. Significant effects ( < 0.04) were found on the cecum bacterial load for  I. Varied and moderate association was found for SE vaccine antibody response for all genes. This is the first reported study on the association of SNP in         and  with the chicken response to SE.

The candidate genes were: inducible nitric oxide synthase ()  tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand ()  transforming growth factor  ()  transforming growth factor  ()  and immunoglobulin G light chain (). Responses to pathogenic SE colonization or to SE vaccination were measured in the Iowa  response resource population (ISRRP). Outbred broiler sires and three diverse  highly inbred dam lines produced 508 F progeny  which were evaluated as young chicks for either bacterial load isolated from spleen or cecum contents after pathogenic SE inoculation  or the circulating antibody level after SE vaccination. Fragments of each gene were sequenced from the founder lines of the resource population to identify genomic sequence variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified  then PCR-RFLP techniques were developed to genotype the F resource population. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. Because the inbred dam lines always contributed one copy of the same allele  the heterozygous sire allele effects could be assessed in the F generation. Association analyses revealed significant effects of the sire allele of  I on the spleen ( < 0.07) and cecum ( < 0.0002) SE bacterial load. Significant effects ( < 0.04) were found on the cecum bacterial load for  I. Varied and moderate association was found for SE vaccine antibody response for all genes. This is the first reported study on the association of SNP in         and  with the chicken response to SE.

Several indigenous West African taurine () breeds  such as the Longhorn (N'Dama) cattle are well known to control trypanosome infections. This genetic ability named \"trypanotolerance\" results from various biological mechanisms under multigenic control. The methodologies used so far have not succeeded in identifying the complete pool of genes involved in trypanotolerance. New post genomic biotechnologies such as transcriptome analyses are efficient in characterising the pool of genes involved in the expression of specific biological functions. We used the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) technique to construct  from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of an N'Dama cow  2 total mRNA transcript libraries  at day 0 of a  experimental infection and at day 10 post-infection  corresponding to the peak of parasitaemia.

Several indigenous West African taurine () breeds  such as the Longhorn (N'Dama) cattle are well known to control trypanosome infections. This genetic ability named \"trypanotolerance\" results from various biological mechanisms under multigenic control. The methodologies used so far have not succeeded in identifying the complete pool of genes involved in trypanotolerance. New post genomic biotechnologies such as transcriptome analyses are efficient in characterising the pool of genes involved in the expression of specific biological functions. We used the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) technique to construct  from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of an N'Dama cow  2 total mRNA transcript libraries  at day 0 of a  experimental infection and at day 10 post-infection  corresponding to the peak of parasitaemia. Bioinformatic comparisons in the bovine genomic databases allowed the identification of 187 up- and down- regulated genes  EST and unknown functional genes. Identification of the genes involved in trypanotolerance will allow to set up specific microarray sets for further metabolic and pharmacological studies and to design field marker-assisted selection by introgression programmes.

MacKenzie"	"No Co-Author"	"15 June 2003"	"This paper considers the use of disease resistance genes to control the transmission of infection through an animal population. Transmission is summarised by R  the basic reproductive ratio of a pathogen. If R > 1.0 a major epidemic can occur  thus a disease control strategy should aim to reduce R below 1.0  . by mixing resistant with susceptible wild-type animals. Suppose there is a resistance allele  such that transmission of infection through a population homozygous for this allele will be R < R  where R describes transmission in the wildtype population. For an otherwise homogeneous population comprising animals of these two groups  R is the weighted average of the two sub-populations: R = R+ R (1 - )  where  is the proportion of wildtype animals. If R > 1 and R < 1  the proportions of the two genotypes should be such that R = 1  .  = (R - R)/(R - R). If R = 0  the proportion of resistant animals must be at least 1 - 1/R. For an  genotype model the requirement is still to have R = 1.0. Probabilities of epidemics in genetically mixed populations conditional upon the presence of a single infected animal were derived. The probability of no epidemic is always 1/(R + 1). When R = 1 the probability of a minor epidemic  which dies out without intervention  is R/(R + 1). When R > 1 the probability of a minor and major epidemics are 1/(R + 1) and (R - 1)/(R + 1). Wherever possible a combination of genotypes should be used to minimise the invasion possibilities of pathogens that have mutated to overcome the effects of specific resistance alleles."

The approach allowed each lactation to have its own baseline hazard function  which gives a better description of the hazard than traditional analyses of the whole length of life. As a consequence  the overall fit of the model to the data was improved and fewer time-dependent variables were needed. Longevity on a lactation basis was defined from one calving to the next instead of from the first calving to culling. However  no new information was added and it was still the overall risk of being culled that was modelled. It is shown that no cow effect is needed in the lactation basis model because a censored record is not complete  a cow can appear as uncensored only once  and a cow cannot be censored after having been culled. Different subdivisions of the stage of lactation effect were tested and the first ten days of lactation were shown to correspond to an increased risk of being culled. There were no major differences in sire variance between the longevity analysed on a lactation basis and longevity based on the entire length of life."

The two other multitrait methods were based on univariate analysis of linear combination(s) (LC) of the traits.

Thomson"	"No Co-Author"	"15 May 2003"	"To date  most statistical developments in QTL detection methodology have been directed at continuous traits with an underlying normal distribution. This paper presents a method for QTL analysis of non-normal traits using a generalized linear mixed model approach. Development of this method has been motivated by a backcross experiment involving two inbred lines of mice that was conducted in order to locate a QTL for litter size. A Poisson regression form is used to model litter size  with allowances made for under- as well as over-dispersion  as suggested by the experimental data. In addition to fixed parity effects  random animal effects have also been included in the model. However  the method is not fully parametric as the model is specified only in terms of means  variances and covariances  and not as a full probability model. Consequently  a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach is used to fit the model. For statistical inferences  permutation tests and bootstrap procedures are used. This method is illustrated with simulated as well as experimental mouse data. Overall  the method is found to be quite reliable  and with modification  can be used for QTL detection for a range of other non-normally distributed traits."

In humans  one of the most severe forms of EB known as Herlitz-junctional EB (H-JEB)  is caused by mutations in the laminin 5 genes. EB has been described in several species  like cattle  sheep  dogs  cats and horses where the mutation  a cytosine insertion in exon 10 of the  gene  was very recently identified in Belgian horses as the mutation responsible for JEB.

In humans  one of the most severe forms of EB known as Herlitz-junctional EB (H-JEB)  is caused by mutations in the laminin 5 genes. EB has been described in several species  like cattle  sheep  dogs  cats and horses where the mutation  a cytosine insertion in exon 10 of the  gene  was very recently identified in Belgian horses as the mutation responsible for JEB. In this study  the same mutation was found to be totally associated with the JEB phenotype in two French draft horse breeds  Trait Breton and Trait Comtois. This result provides breeders a molecular test to better manage their breeding strategies by genetic counselling. Correspondence to                 .

The likelihood criterion is commonly used and allows to compare the fit of alternative models. Its value does not reflect  however  the potential improvement that can still be reached in fitting the data unless a reference model with the actual covariance structure is available. The score test approach does not require the knowledge of a reference model  and the score statistic has a meaningful interpretation in itself as a goodness-of-fit measure.

The likelihood criterion is commonly used and allows to compare the fit of alternative models. Its value does not reflect  however  the potential improvement that can still be reached in fitting the data unless a reference model with the actual covariance structure is available. The score test approach does not require the knowledge of a reference model  and the score statistic has a meaningful interpretation in itself as a goodness-of-fit measure. The aim of this paper was to show how the score statistic may be separated into the genetic and environmental parts  which is difficult with the likelihood criterion  and how it can be used to check parametric assumptions made on variance and correlation parameters.

"On the need for a control line in selection experiments: A likelihood analysis"	"Authors: Daniel Sorensen  Bernt Guldbrandtsen and Just Jensen"	"Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics  Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences  PO Box 50  8830  Tjele  DenmarkDaniel Sorensen  Bernt Guldbrandtsen & Just Jensen"	"No Co-Author"	"15 January 2003"	"The question of whether selection experiments ought to include a control line  as opposed to investing all facilities in a single selected line  is addressed using a likelihood perspective. The consequences of using a control line are evaluated under two scenarios. In the first one  environmental trend is modeled and inferred from the data. In this case  a control line is shown to be highly beneficial in terms of the efficiency of inferences about eheritability and response to selection. In the second scenario  environmental trend is not modeled. One can imagine that a previous analysis of the experimental data had lent support to this decision. It is shown that in this situation where a control line may seem superfluous  inclusion of a control line can result in minor gains in efficiency if a high selection intensity is practiced in the selected line.

The consequences of using a control line are evaluated under two scenarios. In the first one  environmental trend is modeled and inferred from the data. In this case  a control line is shown to be highly beneficial in terms of the efficiency of inferences about eheritability and response to selection. In the second scenario  environmental trend is not modeled. One can imagine that a previous analysis of the experimental data had lent support to this decision. It is shown that in this situation where a control line may seem superfluous  inclusion of a control line can result in minor gains in efficiency if a high selection intensity is practiced in the selected line. Further  if there is a loss  it is moderately small. The results are verified to hold under more complicated data structures via Monte Carlo simulation. For completeness  divergent selection designs are also reviewed  and inferences based on a conditional and full likelihood approach are contrasted. Correspondence to                 .

Understanding the breeding activity of individual animals becomes a prerequisite for a successful breeding program. This study set out to investigate the sources of variation and the genetic profile of the spontaneous  out-of-season ovulatory activity of ewes of the Chios dairy sheep breed in Greece. The definition of the trait was based on blood progesterone levels  measured before exposing the ewes to rams  which marks the onset of the usual breeding season. Data were 707 records  taken over two consecutive years  of 435 ewes kept at the Agricultural Research Station of Chalkidiki in northern Greece. When all available pedigree was included  the total number of animals involved was 1068. On average  29% of all ewes exhibited spontaneous  out-of-season ovulatory activity  with no substantial variation between the years. Significant sources of systematic variation were the ewe age and live weight  and the month of previous lambing. Older  heavier ewes  that had lambed early the previous autumn  exhibited more frequent activity. Heritability estimates were 0.216 (± 0.084) with a linear and 0.291 with a threshold model.

Understanding the breeding activity of individual animals becomes a prerequisite for a successful breeding program. This study set out to investigate the sources of variation and the genetic profile of the spontaneous  out-of-season ovulatory activity of ewes of the Chios dairy sheep breed in Greece. The definition of the trait was based on blood progesterone levels  measured before exposing the ewes to rams  which marks the onset of the usual breeding season. Data were 707 records  taken over two consecutive years  of 435 ewes kept at the Agricultural Research Station of Chalkidiki in northern Greece. When all available pedigree was included  the total number of animals involved was 1068. On average  29% of all ewes exhibited spontaneous  out-of-season ovulatory activity  with no substantial variation between the years. Significant sources of systematic variation were the ewe age and live weight  and the month of previous lambing. Older  heavier ewes  that had lambed early the previous autumn  exhibited more frequent activity. Heritability estimates were 0.216 (± 0.084) with a linear and 0.291 with a threshold model. The latter better accounts for the categorical nature of the trait. The linear model repeatability was 0.230 (± 0.095). The results obtained in this study support the notion that spontaneous out-of-season ovulatory activity can be considered in the development of a breeding plan for the Chios sheep breed.

Group C was the offspring of generations 3 and 4  and group S was the contemporary offspring of generation 10. The animals were weighed individually twice a week during the first four weeks of life  and once a week thereafter  until 20 weeks of age.
