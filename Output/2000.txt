The coat colour loci yielding information on genetic variation were:  and . The  locus was assessed for two alleles. A profound variation between breeds was observed in the frequencies of both colour and horn alleles  with the older breeds generally showing greater variation in observed colour  horn types and segregating alleles than the modern breeds. The correspondence between the present genetic distance matrix and previous molecular marker distance matrices was low ( = 0.08 – 0.12). The branching pattern of a neighbour-joining tree disagreed to some extent with the molecular data structure.

The coat colour loci yielding information on genetic variation were:  and . The  locus was assessed for two alleles. A profound variation between breeds was observed in the frequencies of both colour and horn alleles  with the older breeds generally showing greater variation in observed colour  horn types and segregating alleles than the modern breeds. The correspondence between the present genetic distance matrix and previous molecular marker distance matrices was low ( = 0.08 – 0.12). The branching pattern of a neighbour-joining tree disagreed to some extent with the molecular data structure. The current data indicates that 70% of the total genetic variation could be explained by differences between the breeds  suggesting a much greater breed differentiation than typically found at protein and microsatellite loci.

There was an increase in power (4–16%) and decrease in the bias of parameter estimates with the use of half-sib information.

There were five generations of selection with four replicates  and a selected proportion of 20%. For each replicate  an unselected control was produced. Responses were significant in the IF and IR lines. Responses for the selection objective differed significantly between lines ( < 0.01). The efficiency of the IR line relative to the IF line was 0.52  similar to the expected efficiency of 0.51. The IF and IR lines did not differ significantly for pupal length nor adult weight  whereas the response for egg mass in the IF line was significantly different from the response in the IR line. Realized heritability was greater in the IF line (0.63 ± 0.05) than in the IR line (0.37 ± 0.16). The deleted trait (egg mass) has high heritability and genetic and phenotypic correlations nearly equal to zero with the other two traits included in the selection criterion. The results show the importance of including index traits with high genetic value that are independent of other traits  and they could be useful in breeding programs simultaneously considering production and reproduction traits with nearly zero correlations between them."

Four hundred and seventy-seven overfed animals were slaughtered at 20 weeks of age; they were measured for \"paletot\" (breast meat  bone and meat from wings  bone and meat from thigh and legs) weight and liver weight. In these two experiments  the weights had moderate to high heritability values. Breast depth measured on live animals showed a low heritability value. In overfed animals  liver weight showed a high heritability value. Liver weight could be increased by selection without a great effect on \"paletot\" weight. Thus  obtaining a white plumage geese strain for fatty liver production by selection would be difficult because only 20% of overfed animals had fatty liver. The results did not allow to conclude on the influence of selection on liver weight on carcass traits such as muscle or fatty tissue weight."

Bandsharing (0 < BS < 1) was calculated within and between six quail lines of two origins  and under reciprocal recurrent (AA and BB)  within-line (DD and EE) or no (PP and FF) selection. Twenty one pair types were compared. BS was 0.30 higher within line than between lines. BS with the control line was smaller for reciprocal recurrent selection lines than for lines under individual selection. Bandsharing between the two reciprocal recurrent selection lines was 0.19 lower than between lines under individual selection. These results indicate that the two selection methods had different effects on the genetic constitution of the lines  in agreement with previous observations made from the analysis of biochemical polymorphisms with the same set of birds. Egg production and weight traits of pure and crossbred progeny from fingerprinted quail were obtained and compared  and a linear relationship with the measure of bandsharing was estimated. No significant regression coefficient of performance on BS was found over all progeny genetic types. Heterosis from individual matings could also be estimated under the two selection methods since the same birds were parents of both pure and crossbred performance-tested quail. The association of heterosis with the difference between BS of parents of the purebreds and BS of parents of their half-sib crossbreds was favourable and significant for early production traits in lines DD and EE  but no relationship was found in lines AA and BB. These results indicate that the high level of heterosis obtained through reciprocal recurrent selection  and the heterosis observed under within-line selection may have  partly at least  a different genetic determinism.

Algorithms were developed for predicting discrete responses to BLUP selection  and latent responses when the selection process included additional culling on scores. These algorithms were Taylor expansions using well-known expressions such as the probabilities and the two first moments of the truncated multinormal distribution  after appropriate re-parametrizations.

These algorithms were Taylor expansions using well-known expressions such as the probabilities and the two first moments of the truncated multinormal distribution  after appropriate re-parametrizations.

Diversity was evaluated on the basis of 18 microsatellite markers typed over a total of 483 DNA samples collected. Average breed heterozygosity varied from 0.35 to 0.60. Genotypic frequencies generally agreed with Hardy-Weinberg expectations  apart from the German  and  breeds  which showed significantly reduced heterozygosity.

Genotypic frequencies generally agreed with Hardy-Weinberg expectations  apart from the German  and  breeds  which showed significantly reduced heterozygosity.

Recent studies have shown that asymptotic proportions of genes predicted from conventional gene flow theory may deviate considerably from true proportions.

For RP (respectively PP)  97.8% (resp.  94.1% ) of the 109 160 (resp.  100 665) female records were censored after 106 days (resp.  313 days) on the average. A Cox proportional hazards model stratified by flock (= season) and including a hatch-within-flock (HWF) fixed effect seemed to reasonably fit the RP data. For PP  this model could be further simplified to a non-stratified Weibull model. The extension of these models to sire-dam frailty (mixed) models permitted the estimation of the sire genetic variances at 0.261 ± 0.026 and 0.088 ± 0.010 for RP and PP  respectively. Heritabilities on the log scale were equal to 0.48 and 0.19. Non-additive genetic effects could not be detected. Selection was simulated by evaluating all sires and dams  after excluding all records from the last generation. Then  actual parents of this last generation were distributed into four groups according to their own pedigree index. Raw survivor curves of the progeny of extreme parental groups substantially differed (e.g.  by 1.7% at 300 days for PP)  suggesting that selection based on solutions from the frailty models could be efficient  despite the very large proportion of censored records."

Selection was within full-sib families  16 families per replicate for the first seven generations  eight subsequently. At generation 20  GFPR in the F lines was twice and in the L lines half that of C. A log transformation removed both asymmetry of response and heterogeneity of variance among lines  and so was used throughout. Estimates of genetic variance and heritability (approximately 50%) obtained using REML with an animal model were very similar  whether estimated from the first few generations of selection  or from all 20 generations  or from late generations having fitted pedigree. The estimates were also similar when estimated from selected or control lines. Estimates from REML also agreed with estimates of realised heritability. The results all accord with expectations under the infinitesimal model  despite the four-fold changes in mean.
